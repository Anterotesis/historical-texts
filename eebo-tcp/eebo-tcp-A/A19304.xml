            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Anniball, by the helpe of the frenchemen, paſſed the mountaines, and after in Italie fought three or fower notable battailes, to the great ruine of the Romaines: but they were achieued rather by crafty ſleightes and policies, than by ſtrength. In theim alſo he had the aſſured ayde of the frenche men. The citie of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he wanne by treaſon. Capua, and many other cities, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly yelded vnto hym, whoſe aſſiſtence after, was muche his auauncement. On the other part, Scipio arryuyng in Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, founde there kynge Maſſaniſſa his olde frende, by whoſe helpe, valiantneſſe, and conduite, he preuailed againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thaginenſes, and ſubdued kyng Sypbax. Theſe thynges ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med than to men ſo notable, that emong others, my chief au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour Titus Liuius, to auaunce the renoume of them, wrote thereof a noble and goodly hiſtorie.

For it is not vnknowen, that thynges nowe be muche harder to be achieued, than they were in thoſe dayes: the artillary more perillous, the armour more ſure, and the caſtelles more ſtrong: In ſo muche that the winnyng of Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn or Morlace, is muche more to be eſtemed, than the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of Capua or Carthage. I wille omitte to reherſe, that the emperour Maximilian, hearyng the fame of your hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe power and excellence, deſyred to be of youre maieſties bande, and vnder your baner in the fielde agaynſt the frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I wyll alſo leaue to reherſe the wyſe and woorthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the realme of Irelande, wherof at this preſent your maieſtee weareth the Diademe. Neither will I tary to declare the ſundry and moſte lucky victories, that your hyghnes hath of late had agaynſt the promiſſe breakers the double dealynge Scottes. Furthermore, partely for breuitie, and partely for that the thyng beeyng ſo lately dooen, neither the bruite nor the memory therof can not but be ſo freſhe, that it were much ſuperfluous here now to recite the ſame, I haue thought beſt wholly to omitte the long recitall of your late moſt noble, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike, and myghty conqueſt of Bollayne, neuer heretofore by any prince ſubdued, no ſcarcely by any approched vnto, but lefte as a thynge inuin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hercules onely delyuered countreys from the bodily vexation of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and tyrantes: your maieſtie dooeth eaſe your ſubiectes bothe in bodie and goodes, but chiefly in their ſoules, by the true knowlege of god and his moſte holy woorde. So that in my hert I wyſhe Liuius to be on lyue agayn, not doubtynge, but he that toke ſuche peyne to deſcriue the actes of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, Anniball and Scipio, would muche more nowe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaille, to blowe foorth your mighty magnificence and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſes with the loude trumpette of immortall fame and memorie.

And from thens he paſſed the ſea with his army into Spayn: where he abode .ix. yeres, in whiche tyme he meruaylonſely increaſed and inlarged the dominion of Carthage. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar was father to Hanniball, whyche at his ſaylynge into Spayne, was but .ix. yeres of age: but yet his hart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was ſuche, that he neuer ceaſſed, tyll he had with fayre and pleaſant wordes opteined lycence of his father, to goo with hym into Spayne. And at his departyng on a ſolemne day whan his father dyd ſacrifice in the Temple, accordynge to the vſe and ceremonye than vſed, yonge Hanniball beinge there preſent, layinge his handes on the holy aultar of the Temple, ſware and auowed, that from thensforth he wolde become a deadly ennemy to the Romayns, and that he wolde vtter the ſame his malice on them as ſoone as he were able. This othe and vowe pleaſed wel his father Amilcar. For his intent was ſhortly after to moue the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes to warre with the Romaines, but he dyed ſoone after: whoſe deathe, with the tender age of his ſonne Hannibal ſtayed that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe, and cauſed the peace to endure betwene them .viii. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res longer. Duryng whiche tyme one Aſdruball, that maried the daughter of Amilcar, gouerned the army, a man of great wyſedome and policy. For he by his gentyll entertainyng of princis, and frendly handlyng of his neighbours, more than by batayle, brought many cities vnder the obedience of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage. Whoſe facion, in gettyng of frendes, whan the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes perceiued, they ſent vnto hym: and renewyng their olde amitie, entred into a newe league, for the more ſure and ſtable conſeruation wherof, they determined to ſet metes and boundes of both their empires.

This peace beyng concluded, Haſdruball, that hartily loued Hanniball, ſent his letters, and for his ſake, cauſed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Carthage to be moued, to lycence Hanniball, beyng than a freſhe yong man, to exerciſe him ſelfe in warre to the intent, when he were of lawfull age, he myght optayne, both the rule and richeſſe, that were his fathers. Wherevnto the mooſte parte of the Senatours agreed. Whervpon Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal was incontinent ſent into Spaine, to be Capitaine there vnder Aſdruball. At his fyrſt commyng he gate the fauour of al the armie, and ſo reſembled his father in al pointes, that the olde ſouldiours ſuppoſed Amilcar that was dead, to be reſtored ageine to them aliue. And in ſhort ſpace he brought to paſſe, that his father was not to be compared vnto him, in wynnyng the hartes of people. He excelled ſo in wiſedome, policie, and feates of warre, that whan the Capitayne wolde haue any weighty matier enterpriſed, he wolde to him aboue all other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte the charge therof. He ſo ordred hym ſelfe, both in obeying his capitayn, and rulyng his ſouldiours, that it was harde to knowe, whether he was better beloued of his capytayne or of his hooſte. He was of an hyghe courage in icopardynge on any peryll, and of noo leſſe counſaile in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding the ſame. His body and mind coulde with no labour be weried or ouercomme: he coulde as well ſuſteyne heate as colde: of meates and dryakes he vſed none exceſſe, but that wolde ſuffice nature: he preſcribed no tyme to reſte or ſlepe by nyghte nor by daye. And whan he myght from bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynes conueniently reſt, he deſired neyther ſoft beddes, nor quiet ſlepes, but being couered with a ſhorte cloke or ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours garment, he wolde repoſe him vpon the harde earthe. He was not curious in garmentes: In pleaſant horſes and ſure armour was alwayes his delite. Among all the army on horſe backe and on fote he was founde the beſt, he wolde be euer the fyrſt and the laſt in battail: Which his noble vertues lacked not dyuers vyces to accompany theym.

Whervpon beinge taken he nother changed countenance nor feared any punyſhement that ſhuld come to hym therfore: but with ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng countenance receyued his deathe.

And to colour his intent, he fyrſte led his army into the coſtes of Olcades, a people of Spayne beyonde the ryuer of Iberus, neighbour to the Saguntines, to thende it ſhuld ſeme, that he of purpoſe or by any pretence of warre dyd not ſeke to inuade the Saguntines, but wynning the countreys adioynyng togyther, he ſhulde alſo take Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt with hym as it laye in his way in order with the other.

walles manfully, but alſo couragiouſly iſſued out of the towne and aſſayled their ennemies, and breakyng downe theyr mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimentes and fortifications, entred the towne ageyn welnere to as great loſſe of their ennemies as of their owne people. Whyche thynge whan Anniball perceiued, he ſodaynly with out aduyſement approched to the walles, and was ſtryken with a barbed iauelyn in the thygh, ſo that ſoore wounded he felle to the grounde. Whan his people ſawe hym falle, there was ſuche feare and clamour amonge them, that they cleane gaue ouer the aſſaute, ſo that they ſuffred the towne to be in reſte tyll theyr capitayne was healed. Durynge whiche time of reſt from battayle, the citizens were not vnoccupied. For they fortified them ſelfe the more ſtrongly, for that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the aſſautes to come ſhulde be more fierce and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Whan Hanniball was cured of his wounde, the ſiege and warre became more deadly and terrible than before. The Carthaginens dayly increaſed, they were to the noumber of Cl.

The ambaſſadours heryng this anſwere departed towardes Carthage, as they were commaunded. Whiche thyng Hanniball perceyuynge, ſent letters to the ſenate and princes of Carthage, that were

So that it came to paſſe, that as they coulde not be receyued of Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, euen ſoo theyr ambaſſage was voyde at Carthage. For whan Hanno, a man of great authoritie, had opened in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the peryll and ieopardy of the truce breakyng, and the vengeance whiche might folowe vpon the ſame: and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it ſhuld be neceſſary, that Hanniball, ſhulde be yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Romaynes, for amendes of the truce breakynge: His oration being fyniſhed, the hole ſenate, more inclynynge to the vniuſte enterpryſe of Hanniball than to any reaſonable perſwaſion to the contrarye, eſtemed hym to haue ſpoken more vnfrendly than the legates of Rome. Whervpon they anſwered the ambaſſadours, that Hanniball had done nothing but iuſtely, and that the Romayns dyd wronge in takyng part with the Saguntynes agaynſt theym of Carthage, beynge theyr olde frendes. And thus whyles the Romaynes ſente theyr ambaſſadours to and fro, Hanniball ceaſſed not, but whan his weary ſouldiours releued them ſelfes of theyr pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and trauayle, to encourage his men againſt his ennemies, ſometyme with hope of victory, ſometyme with hope of the ryche pray: ſo that they were in ſuche wyſe encouraged and ſtered, that they thought nothyng able to reſyſte them.

Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge the Saguntines, with as great ſhyfte as myght be, made countermures in the towne, and defended theym ſelfe: and ſaued thoſe partes that were not gotten as it myght be. But in ſhorte ſpace they were ſo beaten, that they wyſte not where to defende. Thus the Saguntines defendyng the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde partes of theyr towne, loſte dayely more and more of theyr citie. Vitayles alſo fayled theym ſore, by reaſon of the longe ſiege. Agayne, the expectation of theyr ſuccours was in vayne, bycauſe the Romaynes, theyr onely hope, were ſoo farre of. Not withſtandyng they were alyttell comforted, by reaſon that Annibal was ſo ſodaynly ſent for to go againſt the Oretanes and Carpetanes, whiche than were raiſed agayne, and beganne to rebelle, but their warre in the meane tyme ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing the leſſe, by reaſon of one Maharball, Himil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos ſonne, who kepte the ſiege ſo ſtreightly, that it ſemed the capitayne was not abſent.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Anniball was retourned from the Carpetanes and Oretanes warre, the battayle beganne more ſtrongely than before. Duringe whyche tyme, two ſouldiours, one named Alcon a Sagu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine, and the other called Alorcus a Spaniard, hauyng ſome hope of peace, determined to moue Anniball to the ſame. Alcon the Saguntine was brought before Annibal, who ſhewed vnto hym, what they ſhulde do, if they intended to haue peace. Whiche conditions of peace ſemed vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con very vnreaſonable. Wherfore thinkyng that the Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines wold in no caſe agree vnto the ſame: he remained there ſtyll, and wolde not retourne agayne to his citie, affirmynge, that he were worthy to dye, that vnder ſuch couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes wold treate of peace Whan Alcon had denied, that the Sagunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wold receyue any ſuchetruce, Alorcus aforeſayd, beinge a ſouldiour of Annibals, and an olde frende to the Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, ſuppoſyng that theyr myndes myght be perſwaded to receyue the conditions of peace, ſeing their walles ſo weake, and their towne ſo eaſy to be wonne, promiſed to declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the contentes of the truce. He deliuering his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to the capitaynes of theyr ennemies, was brought to the Pretor Saguntine: and ſo into the ſenate, where, whan the multitude of the commons was a lytell withdrawen, thus he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9127:12"/>
beganne his oration.</p>
            <p>¶ If your citezyn and meſſanger Alcon, that came to Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball to require peace, had lykewiſe broughte from hym vnto you the conditions of the ſame, my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng nowe had ben in vayne. Which thing if he had done, I ſhuld nother as Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals oratour, nor as a fugityue, haue come vnto you at this tyme. But ſeing that he, either through his owne defaute, or els by yours, tarieth with your ennemies (leſt you ſhulde be ignorant, that there are certayne conditions offered bothe of peace and ſafegard) I for the olde frendſhyp and hoſpitalitie that hath ben betwene vs am come to you: and fyrſt I wolde ye ſhulde perſwade your ſelues, that for your welth and none other cauſe, I ſpeake to you thoſe wordes, which I wyl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and this you may well perceyue. For as longe as you were able with your owne power, to make reſiſtence, or tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to haue ſuccour from the Romayns, I neuer made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you of peace. Nowe ſeing there is no hope of ſuccour from the Romains, and your own ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and walles do fayle you, being vnable any longer to reſiſt: I bring to you peace more neceſſary than ryghtuous or iuſte. Of the which peace there is yet ſome hope, yf, as Anniball beinge conquerour, doth ſende it, ſo you as people ſubdued, wyll receyue it. For you muſt conſyder, that you beinge conquered, muſte of the conquerour receiue that whiche of his goodnes he wyl giue you as a reward. The conditions of peace are theſe: He wyl take the citie (whyche he hath broken for the moſt parte, and almoſte wonne) from you. He wyll leaue to you the fieldes, and alſo aſſigne a place, where you ſhall buylde a newe citie. He commaundeth alſo your golde, ſyluer, and other goodes, publike and priuate, to be brought to hym. He is contented to ſuffer your ſelues, your wyues and children to paſſe in ſafe garde, if ye go out of the citie vnarmed, takyng with you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double apparell for your bodies. Thoſe thynges your vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious enemy Anniball dothe commaunde you, the whyche your ſorowfull chaunce and fortune dothe perſwade you to accepte. Truely I doubt not, whan ye haue accomplyſhed all theſe his requeſtes, but that ſome of theſe conditions ſhalbe remytted vnto you. I thynke better, you ſhulde rather ſuffer theſe iniuries, than your ſelues to be ſlayne, your wyues and chyldren taken &amp; violently led away before your faces, by the extreme lawes of warre.</p>

Whan the feare the trembling and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng for this buſynes had paſſed through the citie, annother rumour was afterward heard. A towre of the citie, that had longe tyme be bruſed and ſhaken, fell downe to the earthe: at which place a company of the Carthaginenſes entred. Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball in ſuche a chance thynkyng not mete longe to deliberate, with great violence entred the town, and incoutinent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all the youth ſhulde be ſlayne, a cruelle victory, not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding it was knowen in that caſe almoſt neceſſary. For whiche of thoſe ſhulde be ſpared, that eyther being incloſed with their wyues &amp; children burned theyr houſes ouer them: or els being well armed, wold determine no end of the warre but by deathe? The citie was taken with a great praye: of the whiche moche goodly houſeholde ſtuffe was ſent to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage. Some write, the .viii. moneth that the warre began, the citie was won, and that Anniball for the wynter, returned agayne to newe Carthage. Duryng which tyme the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours that went to Carthage, brought worde to Rome, that the Saguntines were ouercome and diſtroyed, and their citie taken: Whyche tydinges hearde and knowen for trouthe, brought ſuche heuynes and ſorowe togither to the Romans, What for pitie of theyr fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des vnworthily loſt, and for ſhame that they had not ſuccoured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in due tyme, that therby they conceyued as great diſpleaſure toward the Carthaginenſes, and alſo feare of loſſe of their owne countrey and goodes, as though the hole power of theyr ennemies had bene preſente at hande.

            <p>¶ Oye Romaynes, your fyrſt legacy (whan ye came and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Anniball to be delyuered vnto you, as one that hadde beſieged Sagunt of his owne mynde without our counſayle) was voyde and of none effecte: Howe than ſhulde this your cruell legacy take place, wherin ye requyre of vs a confeſſion of the treſpaſſe, and amendes for the ſame? I thinke it ought not to be inquired, whether Sagunt was diſtroyed by our publike or priuate counſayle, but whether it was done ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or wrongefully. For your queſtion and conſyderation, as concernynge our cytezen is, whether he enterpryſed the ſyege and battayle by his owne mynde, or by our accorde: and our controuerſy with you is, whether it myght be done, the truce beynge obſerued, or no. Therefore ſythe it muſte be determyned, what rulars maye doo by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylle, and what of theyr owne wylle: Ye muſte vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that the truce that was taken betwene you and vs,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:14"/>
was gyuen by Luctatius, than being your conſull: in whiche it was conteyned, that bothe our frendes ſhuld be ſpared, no mention being made of the Sagu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines, for as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n they were not your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. But verily in the truce, that was taken with Haſdruball, the Saguntines were excepted, againſt which I wyll ſay nothyng, but that I haue learned of you. Truely ye refuſed to obſerue the truce, that C. Luctatius your conſull dyd decree and make with vs, bycauſe it was not done by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of the fathers conſcripte of your ſenate: than yf you do not obſerue and kepe your bandes and truce, oneleſſe they be conſtitute and made by your auctoritie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: We alſo wyll not obſerue the truce take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Haſdrubal, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we were ignorant. Wherfore leaue now to ſpeake of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt and Iberus: and declare boldly that whyche you haue longe tyme conſultynge, deuiſed. Than the Romayn Legate aduaunced forthe hym ſelfe, and ſayd: Here we brynge vnto you peace or warre: take whether you wyll. Whervnto they fierſely anſwered, that he ſhulde giue whether he wold. And whan he agayn ſettyng forth his commandement, had ſhewed theym that they ſhulde haue warre, they aunſwered all: that they wolde accept it, and with no leſſe courage proſecute the warre, than they had receyued it.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan the Romain ambaſſadours had propoſed the warre as it was commaunded theym, they wente from thenſe into Spayne, with fayre beheſtes to wynne and allure the chiefe cities therof to their fauour, and to tourne from the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes. Fyrſt they came to Barguſies, who receyued them gentilly, bicauſe they were wery to be vnder the dominion of Carthage, ſturring moch people with deſyre of the new war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. From thenſe they came to the Volcians: whoſe wyſe and quicke anſwere ſhortly knowen through Spayne, turned the reſydue of the people from the frendſhyp of the Romaynes. Thus the eldeſt of them in counſayle anſwered.</p>
            <p>¶ Dye Romaynes, how may ye for ſhame requyre vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte your frendſhyp before the frendſhyp of the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes, whan they that ſo did (the Saguntines) ye more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly betrayed than theyr ennemies dyd deſtroy. Therfore I wold counſayle you, to go ſeke your frendes, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sagunt is not knowen. For as theyr deſtruction was an heauy and pitiefull thing to the Spaniardes: ſo is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9127:14"/>
ſame a great warnyng and teachyng, that no man ſhulde truſt to the promeſſe and frendſhyp of the Romaynes. With this anſwere they were commaunded ſhortly to depart frome the Volcianes, nother coulde they after gette any better frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of any of the counſayle of Spayne. And ſoo whan they had in vayne trauailed through Spayn, they cam into France where whan they had before the nobles and great multitude of the people, magnified and extolled the renoume and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Romaynes, they deſyred, that the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhulde haue no way through Fraunce, to leade theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into Italy. At which requeſt there aroſe ſuch a laughing amonge them, that (as it was ſayd) ſcarſely the youth coulde be pacified of the auncient men and rulers. Their deſyre was thought very folyſhe and vnreaſonable, that the frenchemen ſhoulde not ſuffer the Carthaginenſes to leade theyr armye through Fraunce: but they for other mens pleaſure ſhoulde tourne the warre to them ſelues, and haſarde theyr countrey to be diſtroyed. Whan the noyſe was appeaſed, anſwere was made, that the Romaynes were at noo tyme ſo frendly vnto them, nor the Carthaginenſes ſo great foos, that they wolde eyther holde with the one, or warre againſt the other. They ſayd more ouer, that the Romaynes hadde dryuen dyuers of theyr countrey men out of Italy, and cauſed other to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, with many other iniuries. Suche anſwere for the moſte parte they receyued through all Fraunce, nor other newes of peace or frendſhyp they ſcarſely hearde before they came to Maſſilia: There they had knowledge by certayne of theyr frendes, that Anniball had obteined the hartes of the french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before, and that he had corrupted the princis and rulers with money, wherof they were moſt couetous and deſirous of all nations. So whan the Romains had wandred through Spayne and Fraunce, at laſte they came to Rome, not longe after the Conſuls were gone to the prouinces, &amp; they founde the citie holly bente on the expectation of warre.

And the ſelf fortune, which hath brought you now into ſuche neceſſite, that nedes ye muſt fight or die: the ſame fortune ſhal giue you ſuch rewardis, if ye ſubdue your enmies, as no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men can deſire greatter of the immortall goddis.

Here fortune hath gyuen you an ende of your trauayle: Here fortune wyl rewarde you accordyng to the coſtes and charges that you haue ben at. Nor ye ſhuld not ſuppoſe the vyctory to be ſo harde, as the battayle is of great name. Oftentimes a ſmall hoſt hath made a great and a dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful battayle: agaynl noble people yea and kynges haue ben o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come in a lytel moment. For take away the terrible ſound of the name of Rome, and what are they to be compared to you? Your great warres this .xx. yeres, with your manhod with your good fortune I ſpeake not of: I wyl only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre thynges of late done.

Shall I that was born and brought vp in the noble hous of my father, that hath ben the chaſtyſer of Spayne and France, that haue conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not onely the people of the mountaynes: but alſo all the paſſages, whiche is moche more: compare my ſelfe with this weake capytayne of a fourtenyght olde, wandrynge frome hoſte to hooſte: to whom yf a man this day wolde ſhewe the army of Carthage and the army of the Romains togyther: he can not tell of whyche hoſte he is gouernour, but only by the banners and badges. Surely worthy warriors, I eſteme not this a lyttell, that there is none of you, before whome I haue not done ſome worthy feate of warre.

This moſte cruell and proude nation dothe all thynges after theyr owne brayne and iudgement: they wyll determyn with whome we ſhall haue warre or peace. All thing that they do, they thynke it ryghtefull. They wylle appoynte hylles and fluddes to be boundes and meres, whyche we may not paſſe, yet wyll not they obſerue the places and termes, whych they haue ſette and preſcribed them ſelues. Thou ſhalt not (ſaye they) paſſe Iberus, leſt thou make the a do with the Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Sagunt is at Iberus: Therefore you ſhall not moue thyther from your appoynted place. They eſteme it but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell to haue taken from vs our moſt auncient prouinces, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia and Sicilia, but they woll haue Spayn alſo. And if they wynne that, than they wyll haue Affrica. I may well ſay Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica alſo, For they haue ſent two conſuls this yere, one into Affrica, and an other into Spayne. There is nothynge lefte to vs, but that that we muſte be fayne to wynne agayne with the ſworde. If feare compelle theym, lyke cowardes to flee here from vs, they haue places ynoughe to receyue theym, they knowe the countreys and wayes wherby to eſcape: It behoueth you to play the valyant men, and ſettyng all at ſix and ſeuen, eyther to vanquyſhe, or elles yf fortune frowne, rather manfully to dye in battayle, than to be ſlayne in fleyng away, If this that I haue ſayd, be faſt fixed in your myndes, I ſay to you for certayne, you haue all ready the vyctorye.</p>

And alſo that the tyme ought not to be prolonged with ſicke folkes. Shal we tary and loſe time? For what third conſull, or what other army ſhall we abyde?

Theſe thynges conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he ſent certayn Frenchmen abrode the cuntrey as ſpies, who ſhewed hym, that the Romayns were all redy to fyght. Than Anniball wente to ſee and prouide a place for diſceyte. There was in the myddes betweene the two hoſtes, where the fielde ſhuld be, aryuer whiche was cloſed on both ſides, with greatte and hygh bankes, be ſette aboute with the wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the fennes, whiche almoſte couered all the grounde, with yonge wyllowes and ſhrubbes, and alſo with hygh buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and thornes: whyche whan he had ſerched and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to be a place obſcure and darke ynough, to hyde an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſhement of horſemen in, he ſayde to his brother Mago: This place ſhalt thou kepe, and thou ſhalte (ſayde he) choſe vnto the one thouſande of horſemen, and oone thouſande of fotemen, of the beſt of myn army, to lye here in theſe couert places: and whan tyme ſhal requyre, to do as I ſhal ſhew you what therto appertayneth: and be ye ſure, that ye ſhall haue ennemies blynd in theſe feates of warre. Whan Mago had a M. horſemen, and a.

Sempronius bearyng the rumour of the Numidies, brought all his army (beinge very deſyrous of battayle) to the ryuer, whervnto the other reculed backe, as was appointed by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball. The weather was extremely colde, and it ſhowed faſt. The ſouldiours hadde taken no ſuſtenance before, nor made any prouiſion to ſtrength and kepe theyr bodies warme from the colde froſt and ſnowe. But in all haſte folowyng the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians, theyr crafty ennemyes that fledde before theym, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the ryuer.

Whan they cam out of the water, theyr bodies were ſo ſtark and benom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with colde, that ſcarſely they could holde theyr armour vpon them: and alſo towarde the myddes of the daye, they beganne to faynt for hunger. In the meane ſeaſon Anniball cauſed great fyres to be made before his ſouldiours tentes, that euery man might warme him: and alſo to put oyle in their gloues, whyche ſhoulde ſouple their ioyntes and membres. Whan they hearde that theyr ennemies were paſſed the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, beinge luſty bothe in body and harte, euery man toke his weapon and went to battayle.

The ryuer of Trebia cauſed them to retourne from the purſuite of the Romans: ſo that almoſte deade for colde they came to theyr campe, with very ſmall ioy of theyr victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Thus were the Romans conueyed peaſibly to Placentia, and from thens they paſſed ouer Padus to Cremona. Whan the chance therof was kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen at Rome, there aroſe ſuche ſo dayn feare among them, as though theyr ennemies had ben come alredy with baners di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplayde before the gates of Rome: Neyther had they hope of any further ſuccours, wherby they myght defende theyr enemyes from their gates and walles: The one conſul being ouercome at Ticinus: and the other called frome Sicilia to helpe hym: and nowe bothe beinge togyther ouercome, and their two hoſtis.

            <p>¶ Whyles theſe thynges were doone in Italy, Cn.

And alſo the fame of his gentil enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of people broughte the inhabitauntes on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and the wylde nations to be his aſſured frendes. So that they were all redy with theyr armour &amp; ſuccours to aide the Romans to the beſt of their powers. Hanno, whom An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball hadde left for the defence of theſe regions, knowynge theſe actes of Scipio, after his arryuall, and fearyng leſte he ſhuld be by hym put from the poſſeſſion of all that countreye: appoynted to fight with hym before the matter were ouerfar gone, and pytched his campe not farre from the hoſte of the Romans.

Wherfore he made ſpede to mete fyrſte with Hanno and his company. In whyche battayle there were ſlayne .vi. thouſand of the Carthaginenſes, and .ii.

The Frenchemen that folowed theym, coulde nother ſaue theym ſelues from fallynge: nother whan they were downe well aryſe agayne, nother coulde their hartes comfort their bodies, nor hope comforte their hartes: ſome drewe their weary membres with peyne after theym. Some
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9127:28"/>
other, where they ones fell, theyr hartes being ouercomme with wearynes, were conſtrayned to dye. The watche that they ſuffred .iiii. days and .iii. nyghtes, without any ſlepe, was the chiefe cauſe of theyr confuſyon. Whan they could fynde no dry place, where they myght reſt theyr weary bodies, the water coueryng al the erth, they heaped theyr ſtuffe and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the water, one packe on an other, whervpon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſaued them ſelfes. The heapes of dead cattell, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were dead in all the way, was in ſtede of beddis to many that were faint and feble, whiche eaſed them for a lytel ſpace. Anniball hym ſelfe hauynge ſore eies, by reaſon of the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſprynge tyme of the yere, that chaunged now to heate and nowe to colde, being caried vpon an elephant (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained) bicauſe he ſhulde be hyghe from the water: yet through his great watche and colde, and by reaſon of the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ayre beinge noyſome to his heade, and bycauſe there was no place nor tyme to heale him, he loſte one of his eies. And whan he had paſſed the fennes, not without great loſſe bothe of men and of beaſtes, as ſoone as he came to dry ground, he pytched his campe, hauing certayne knowlege by his eſpies, that the Romane hoſte was about Aretium, a cuntrey as ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and fertyle as was in all Italy.</p>
            <p>¶ The conſull was than fierſe and cruell, for the ioy and the pride of his newe office. And he not onely lyttell feared the lawe and dignitie of the fathers of the ſenate, but alſo he wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted the feare of the immortall goddis.

And howe moche more redye he was to folowe his owne foly, ſo moche the buſyer was Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball to prouoke and ſtere hym to the ſame. Wherfore leauing his ennemies on the left hande, he went towarde Feſſula, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendyng to diſtroy the fieldes of Hetruria, where he ſhewed the conſull as great waſte, deſtruction, and ſpoylynge of his frendes as he myght, bothe by robbynge, ſlaughter, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng: to thintent he ſhulde therby the rather be prouoked to battayle.

            <p>¶ Flamminius folowynge his ennemies, was come aboute the ſettyng of the ſonne to the lake: And the next day early in the mornynge, whan it was ſcarcely day lyght, he with his hoſte were paſſed the ſtraytes.

Whan Anniball knowyng: his ennemies to be encloſed with the lake and hylles on the one ſyde, whyche he deſyred, and alſo compaſſed about with his army on the other ſide, he gaue a ſigne to his men ſodeinly, to inuade their ennemies: which his commandement they anon with all diligence executed, ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶ The Conſull Flamminius, whan all his people were thus oppreſſed with feare, he hym ſelfe as a man of great courage and lyttell affrayde, ordered his troubled company, and ſette them in order as well as the tyme and place wolde ſerue him, ſtyll exhortyng them by all the meanes he myghte, to abyde and to fyghte, ſhewynge theym, that it booted theym not to praye and call on theyr goddis, or to make vowes theym for theyr delyuerance: There was nowe no waye to for theym to eſcape but by ſtrengthe and hardyneſſe, there was no way than to be made, but with the ſwerd: and the leſſe feare they dydde take, the leſſe ieopardye and perylle ſhoulde they be in.

Than commanded he the bodies of his company that were deade, to be diſſeuered from the other, and buried.

Whan the newes of this great ſlaughter was firſt knowen at Rome, the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with great feare and rumour in the market place, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng into companies, to knowe the trouth therof. And a litel before the ſonne ſettyng, Marcus Pomponius pretor ſaide: With great bataile wear ouercome: and although the people herd him ſay no more of certainty, yet by receiuing the newes one of an other, they filled the hole city with tidingis, that the conſul, with a great part of the hoſt, was ſlayne, and that fewe were left on lyue, but were other chaſed abrode, or taken of theyr ennemies.

Neuertheleſſe to proue the faſcion and conduicte of Fabius, Anniball very oftentymes remoued his campe, and euer ſpoyled the countreys of the frendes of the Romanes as he went: Sometyme he wolde ſodeynly conuey his army: and than ſecretely tourne out of the way, and lye in awayte, yf by chaunce he myght take his ennemies at auantage: but Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius euer ledde his hoſte by the high places of the countreis ſtyll kepynge his ennemies in ſyghte, ſo that he wolde not be farre from theym: yet intended he not to giue them battayle, his men went neuer out of theyr campe, but only for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſyon of thynges neceſſary. And whan they lacked vytailes forage, or woode, he ſent a great numbre togyther, that they myght walke ſurely. And alſo thoſe that wente therfore, he ſuffered not to ſtray farre from the hoſte. He hadde euer his horſemen and lyght harneyſed footemen in a redyneſſe and in aray, for feare of ſodayne inuaſions of his enemies. And alſo to thintent they ſhulde be redy to oppreſſe his foes, that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyme ſhulde roue abrode for ſpoyle or for vitailes, he myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neuer to ieoparde the hole eſtate of the empire in open battayl, but he remayned ſtyl as a ſtay to weary his enemies. Whiche his ſobrenes was no leſſe diſpleaſant to Anniball, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was to Minutius, the maiſter of the horſemen. For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge raſhe, and deſyrous to put all in auenture, fyrſt pryuily, and than openly dyſprayſed the ſlacknes of Fabius, callynge hym bothe ſlowe and fearefull. Anniball often remouing, cam from Arpos to Samnium, waſtyng the fieldes of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentanes, and there he toke the towne of Tileſia, truſtyng by the ſhewe of ſoo moche diſpleaſure, to cauſe Fabius to gyue hym battayle. There camme to hym the ſame tyme thre gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylmen of Italy, whome Anniball hadde before at the bataile of Traſimenus taken pryſoners, and delyuered to lybertie without raunſome. Theſe men ſhewed hym, that in caſe he wolde conuey his army into Campania, they wolde helpe him with ſmalle peyne to wynne the noble citie of Capua. To this their motion Anniball at length agreed, ſendyng them to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua before hym, to ſtere the myndes of the rulers and of the communes therto, and to retorne, bryngyng him the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their ſpeede. Than commanded he his guyde to leade hym the next way to the fielde of Caſſinus, hauyng knowlege by diuers expert men of the ſame countrey, that yf he were

ones mayſter of the hyll and ſtrayte there, he ſhulde ſtoppe the Romanes from bryngyng any ſuccours to theyr men, but that he ſhuld at his pleaſure diſtroy them. But the guide mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the name of the countrey, toke Caſilinus for Caſinus. Wherfore leadyng hym a wronge way, he conducted hym by the countreys of Alifinus, Calatinus, and Calenus, to the fieldes of Stellates. Whan Anniball behelde that countrey to be on all partes encloſed with mountaynes and ryuers, he inquired of his guyde, in what region he than was? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered agayn, that the ſame day he wold bring him to Caſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Wherat Anniball being diſpleaſed, cauſed him to be ſore beaten with roddes, &amp; after hanged for the example of other.

            <p>¶ By this tyme was Fabius come by the hilles, to the toppe of Maſſicus the mountayn: where the Romayns myght be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Carthaginenſis lodged in the fayre playnes vnder them, who ceaſſed not to ſpoyle the fieldes of Falernus, and to burne the houſes of Simeſſa. This diſpleaſure entred er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly into the hart of Minutius: who aboue other maligned at the cowardiſe of the dictatour Fabius.

But all theyr murmurynge Fabius lyttell eſtemyng, contynued the reſte of the ſommer in his olde faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, euer kepyng Anniball from battaile, the thyng that he moſt deſyred. Whan the wynter began to draw nere, Fabius perceiuyng the countrey not to be able to ſuſteyne the hoſt of his ennemies any long ſeaſon, and that there was none other way for them to paſſe out of the fieldes of Falernus, but only by the ſame ſtrayte wayes, by whych they before had entred, he ſendyng ſufficient power of Romans to the hyll of Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, and the towne of Caſilinus: hym ſelfe, with the mayſter of the horſemen, kept the narowe way, by whyche Anniball muſt nedes paſſe. Anniball wylling to proue the maner of ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of that ſtrayt, came thyther, and there made a ſkirmiſhe with the Romanes, ſomewhat to his loſſe, and was fayne to recule backe. And he perceyuynge the Romans to haue the Samnites and the Campanes their frendes at theyr backes, redy to ſuccour them with all neceſſaries, and that he and his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9127:32"/>
hoſte were ſo encloſed, that he was like to winter among the ſtones of Formiana, and the ſandes of Linterni: he forgatte not than to renewe his accuſtomed ſubtiltie and craft. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented a deceyte and mockery, very fearefull to mens ſyght, wherby he myght paſſe the ſtraites by ſtelthe in the nyght. he cauſed rotten ſtyckes and drye pieces of woode, to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither in the fieldes, and fagottes of yong roddes and bowes to be made, whych he cauſed to be tyed to the hornes of oxen and kyne, whiche he had before taken at a pray in the countrey, ſome being wylde, and ſome tame. There were .ii. thouſande beaſtis, that ſhuld be thus ordred. And the charge was committed to Haſdruball, that he ſhuld in the beginnyng of the darknes of the nyght, ſette the faggottes on fyre, that were on the hornes of the beaſtes: and than to dryue theym to the hylles and ſtraytes, ſpecially aboue the way, which the Romans kept. Than in the begynnyng of the nyght, ſecrete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he cauſed his men to remoue their campe, driuing the oxen a lytel before the ſtanderdes. but whan they came to the fote of the hyll, and to the narowe way, he commanded the fago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes on the beaſtes hornes to be ſet on fyre. Whiche done, the feare of the flamyng fyre aboute theyr heades, and the heate commyng to the quicke and lower parte of the hornes of the beaſtes, cauſed them to runne, as though they had bene mad. With whyche ſodeyne running the yong roddes toke a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, euen as though the woddes and hylles had ben on fire: and the mouing of their heades, cauſing the flame to ſprede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, ſhewed like as it had ben men ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning abrode with fyre. Whan thoſe that were ſet at the entryng of the paſſage ſawe the fyre on the hygh hylles aboue them, ſuppoſyng that they had ben betrayde, lefte the place aſſigned theym to kepe, and fiedde to theyr ſuccours, ſekyng theyr beſt way by the toppe of the hylles, by whiche the great flame and blaſe dyd ſhyne, where they chaunced vpon certayne oxen ſtrayed from theyr flocke.

He imagined with hym ſelfe, what way he myght beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the frendſhyp of the Romans. After many ſundry ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, he thought ſooneſt to brynge it about, if he might finde the meanes, to delyuer them thoſe noble mens children, whiche were left at Sagunt as pledges and ſuerties. For by that meanes he thought the Romans myght beſte wynne the hartis of the pricis of Spain. But this enterpriſe he thought he coulde not compaſſe, onleſſe he myght obteyne the fauour of one Boſtar, who lay encamped without the citie vpon the ſhoore of the ryuer, with a good numbre of Spaniardes, for the ſure kepyng of the citie, and to ſtoppe the Romanes the entre that way from the hauen, without whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement he knewe well the kepers of the pledges wolde nothyng do. Than Acedux thought with crafte to aſſay Boſtar, and went to the campe where he lay, deſyryng ſecretely to ſpeake with hym: And fyrſt he beganne to ſhew hym the daunger that the countrey was in, conſyderyng the ſtronge armye of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, whiche was than at hande. He ſhewed hym alſo, that the Spaniardes had ſo longe continued in the frendeſhyp of the Carthaginenſes, for feare more than for loue. And all by cauſe the Romane army was ſo farre from theym: but nowe ſyns they were come ouer Iberus, it was to be feared, leſte they wolde all yelde them ſelues vnto Scipio. Wherfore he deſyred hym to worke wyſely therin.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Boſtar demaunded of him, what he wold haue him to do for remedy therof, he anſwered: I wold aduyſe you, to ſende the children of the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom ye haue as pledges in this towne, to their parentes frendes and cities: ſo ſhal ye get all theyr hartes and loues by this kyndnes ſhewyng, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ye can neuer get with feare.

And I my ſelfe wyll gladly take the peyne to delyuer agayne the pledges to theyr frendes: and ſo worke, that I wyll get theyr hartes to you moche more than ye nowe haue. Boſtar, meanynge all truthe and playnnes, was anone perſwaded to the ſame purpoſe, and graunted hym the conduite of the ſure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties. Than went Acedux priuyly to Scipio his tentes, and there declared vnto hym the good wyll that he bare towarde hym and the Romanes: And appoynted with hym the tyme and place of delyuere of the pledges.

Fabius anſwered but fewe wordes, for he thought they ſhuld be euyll harde: but he ſayd, that where .ii. yeres paſt, the citie had ſuſteined great harmes and loſſe through the foliſhe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyneſſe of the gouernours, he douted not, but yf he myght beare rule and haue his mynde, he wolde make it euident to all men, that fortune coulde lyttell do or worke againſt a good captain: but that wiſdom &amp; reaſon ſhuld haue the dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer al her chances. He ſaid further, that he had ſaued his hoſt from a cruel enmy, in al this perillous time without harme or ſhame: which he thought, ought more to be praiſed, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kyl a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of enmies. But in concluſion, the determination of the ſenate was, that M.

¶ With theſe diſpleſant actes of the ſenate Fabius returned to his army, truſtyng, that although Minutius ſhoulde haue halfe the rule with hym, yet ſhuld he want the policy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ordryng his part of the army to him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: whiche policy by exercyſe and great tranayle he had obteyned. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius perceyuyng hym ſelfe to be had in ſuche eſtymation at Rome, as wel with the ſenators as with the commons, where he was before a lyttell proude, he than beganne to take moch more on hym, boſtyng hym ſelfe, that in theyr great calamitie, he alone was founde out a captayne able to matche Anniball. And than began he to diuiſe of the parting of their empyre or rule. He wold haue had it ſo parted, that one day or one weke he ſhulde haue ruled all: And one other day or weke, Fabius to rule al, and ſo to take the hole gouernance by tourne. That wolde Fabius none of: but wolde haue the army parted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them, with the ordynances and other neceſſaries. Say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng, that in caſe he coulde not by his counſayle ſaue the hole hoſte: yet he wold aſſay to ſaue the halfe therof, as wel as he myght. And on that poynt they agreed, and thervpon deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theyr companies or legions, and alſo theyr campes. This debate and order of the Romayn capytayns was knowen to Anniball by eſpyes, as were all other thinges that were done in the tentes of his ennemies, whyche tydynges brought to hym double ioye. One was, for that he thought to vanquiſhe the foolyſſhe hardynes of Minutius euen as he wolde hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe. The other was, for that halfe the ſtrengthe of Fabius was dymynyſſhed, by reaſone of the partynge of the hoſte. Thanne was there a hylle betweene the hooſte of Anniball, and the hoſt of Minutius, which hyll who ſo euer had goten, ſhuld be able to do moche diſpleaſure to his enemies. Annibal deſyred not ſo moche to take it without batayle (although the occupation therof ſhuld be to hym very neceſſary) as to make it an occaſion of batail to Minutius: whom, he wiſt wel, wold euer run to withſtande his enterpriſe in the attaining therof. A fielde there was in the myddell betwene hym and the ſayd hyll, whyche fielde was very playne and fayre, and appeered moche vnmete for treaſon, to hyde any embuſhement in, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was nother couered with woode, ſhrubbes, nor buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes. It ſemed therfore a place rather mete to deſcry treſon than to hyde it, for that in a plaine and bare valey no ſuche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9127:36"/>
myght be feared. But than Anniball eſpied, that in the bottome of the ſayd hyll were diuers caues and holowe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the rockes, of whiche ſome were able to receyue and hyde .ii. C. ſouldiours armed. In theſe darke caues Anniball hydde .v. M. footemen and horſemen: not withſtandyng leſt the noyſe or the bryghtnes of the harneys myghte happen to diſcouer his diſceyte, he ſent a fewe in numbre the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to take the foreſayd hyll, wherby he withdrew the eies of his ennemies from lokyng to that place of embuſſhement. Whan the company that went to the hyll, were apperceyued by the Romanes, to be ſo fewe in numbre, they ſet nought by them, and euery man coueted to go to dryue theyr ennemies from that hyll. And alſo the Capytayne no leſſe foolyſhe than they, called his men to harneys, thretenynge his ennemyes with vayne wordes. Fyrſt he ſent lyght harneyſed yong men: than he ſent forthe horſemen, whiche were a great company: laſte of all, hym ſelfe commeth with his hole armye. And as Anniball ſawe occaſion, and the battayle encreaſe, he ſent euer of his men bothe fotemen and horſemen, to ſuccour his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo that the battayle was furnyſhed on bothe partes, and waxed very ſtronge. The Romans were thought to be of a great boldnes and courage, and ſhulde haue done well, yf the battayle had ben equally handled, they were ſoo encouraged with theyr late victorye: but ſodeynly came thoſe that were hydde in the caues forthe on them, making great clamour and rumour on theyr ſides and backes, ſo that they ſurpriſed with feare, had nother hartes to fyght, nor hope to flye. Than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius fyrſt hearyng the noiſe, and after ſeing the hoſt troubled afarre of: Fortune (ſayd he) hath caught theyr foly, no ſoner than I feared it wolde: nowe he that is ioyned with Fabius in the empire, hath found Anniball ouerhard for hym, both in power and alſo in Fortune. But it is not now tyme (ſayd he) to chyde, I wyll referre that, tyll more oportunitie. Than cauſed he his men to diſplay theyr baners beyonde the valey, and in good aray came forwarde to the helpe of his felowes, that ſome were fledde, and ſome redy to flee, ſo that they all thought, that he cam as it were one ſent from heauen to their ſuccours. And before he ſhulde come to the caſting of dartes or to handeſtrokes, Anniball called backe his men from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng any further theyr ennemies that fled, and ſodeinly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe
<pb facs="tcp:9127:37"/>
hym to his campe, ſaying, that he had ouercome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius, but that he was alſo ouercome of Fabius. Than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Roman army, that by fleing were ſcatered and ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled abrode, ranne to the hooſte of Fabius: many other that dyd flee before theyr ennemies, tourned agayne to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: ſo that there was almooſte one battayle of them that were ouercome, and of them that ranne to theyr ſuccours. Whan the moſte part of the day was ſpent vnder the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtanderde of Fortune, and that the hoſtes were come to theyr owne tentes, Minutius (his ſouldiours beynge gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about hym, ſayd:</p>
            <q>¶ I haue oftentymes, louing ſouldiours and frendes, hearde <note place="margin">Minutius oration.</note> ſay, that he is moſte wyſe, that can gyue counſell, and tel what is to be done in his buſynes. And that he is next wiſe, that can obey hym that gyueth good counſayl: but he that can not her gyue good counſaile hym ſelfe, nor obey other mens counſail, is of all other moſte abiecte and fooliſhe. Nowe therfore, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the fyrſt of theſe giftes fortune hath denied vs, let vs kepe the ſeconde, and whyles we lerne to rule, let vs purpoſe with our ſelfes to obey theym that be wyſe. Wherfore let vs ioyne our tentes with Fabius: And whan ye ſhall here me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute hym as my parent and father, you lykewyſe ſhall ſalute his ſouldiours as your noble patrons, by whoſe ſtrength and hardynes this day ye were preſerued.</q>
            <p>¶ Thus incontinent they remoued theyr campe, and went to the campe of Fabius, whereof he marueyled not a lyttell. Whan the two legyons were mette togither, and ſalutations had, after longe proteſtation made by Minutius to Fabius, they toke eyther other by the handes, and the ſouldyours lykewyſe entertaynynge gentylly the one the other. There Minutius ſubmytted him and his men to be vnder the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Fabius, reſigning cleane the authoritie of the empire and rule into his handes, whyche he accompted to be to hym a burthen rather than an honour: deſyryng him that he might be agayne in the office of the mayſter of horſemen, as he was before. Whan this was knowen at Rome, and affirmed to be true, not only by the letters of the capitaynes, but alſo of the ſoudiours of both partis, the praiſe of Fabius was eleuate to the heauens, and he had no leſſe praiſe of Annibal and his hoſt who as than felt, that they had to do with the Romanes, and

For the two yeres paſt, they ſo lyttell dyd eſteme bothe the capytayne of Rome, and alſo the ſouldyours, that they could ſcarſely beleue, that they fought with thoſe people, whome they had hearde of theyr fathers, were ſo moche to be doubted.

Whiche money beinge ones payde for theyr redemption, they ſhuld haue libertie to go to theyr cuntreis. This done, he cauſed the deade bodyes of his owne hoſt to be ſearched and buried, whyche were to the numbre of .viii. M. amonge whyche he cauſed the body of the Conſulle to be buryed.</p>
            <p>¶ There was a certayn woman of a noble kynred called Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, whyche ſuccoured the Romans that were fledde to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſium, bothe with meate, drynke, clothe, and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for whyche dede, the warre beynge fynyſſhed, ſhe was had with the Romaynes in great honour. There were that timein Cannuſium .iiii. Tribunes, whiche were Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus the yonger, and Lucius P. Bibulus. P.

Scipio, beyng than very yonge, and to Appius Claudius: To whome, whan they were conſultyng amonge other for the profyte of the common welth, P. Furius Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius ſayd, that theyr counſell was but in vayne, for to reſtore and brynge agayne that, whyche was vtterly loſte: And that the common wealthe was deſerte and cleane ſubuerted: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſyng the noble yonge men to folow the purpoſe of Lucius Cecilius Metellus, and to take hym as theyr gouernoure, who was redy, with many other with hym, to depart the city in haſte, takynge theyr ſhyppes, whiche were purpoſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned for theym, and by the ſea to flee ouer to ſome prynce or kyng for ſuccour. Whyche cruell counſell ſodeynly gyuen after theyr great loſſe and myſfortune, made them very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and in great doubte what they ſhulde do: in ſo moche that many, beinge there preſent, thought to deliberate on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whyche deliberation yonge Scipio (elect by deſteny to fynyſhe the ſame warres agaynſt the Carthaginenſes) denied and diſpiſed. We muſt (ſayth he) be bolde, and valyantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryſe thynges in ſo great a myſchiefe, and not ſtande longe conſultyng vpon them. Wherfore he commaunded, that ſoo many as wolde haue the common welthe ſafe, ſhulde go with hym armed. And than he with a fewe folowyng hym, went to
<pb facs="tcp:9127:41"/>
Metellus lodgynge, where fyndynge an aſſemble of yonge men in coniuration vppon the dyuiſe of Furius Philus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, he helde his naked ſwearde ouer theyr hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and ſayde: With my whole mynde and wyll, I ſweare that I ſhall neuer leaue the common wealthe of the cytie of Rome, nor ſhall ſuffer any citezen of Rome to leaue it. And if I wyllyngly be falſe, than I pray the mighty and omnipotent Iupyter, to diſtroy my houſe, my familye, and all my goodes, with mooſte vyleſt deſtruction. Whiche othe I requyre of the Lucius Cecilius, and of all other that are here preſente. And he that wyll not ſweare the ſame, lette hym knowe, that my naked ſwerde ſhall paſſe through hym. All they beyng no leſſe feared with his wordes, than yf Anniball had bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, toke the ſame othe, and commytted theym ſelues to the tuition of Scipio.</p>
            <p>¶ While theſe thinges were done at Cannuſium, there were gathered togither about .iii. M. horſemen and fotemen, and were come to Venuſia, where the conſulle Varro was, with whyche company the conſul came to Cannuſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hauyng ſo great a numbre about hym, thought hym ſelfe able to defend them ſelues and the citie from Anniball.</p>
            <p>¶ Of this great loſſe in the batayle newes was broughte to Rome, without any mencion of ſauyng of the ſayde number, that were with the conſull: but that euery man was ſlayn, and no Roman left on lyue. Whyche newes cauſed as great feare and rumour in the cytie, as euer was hearde there before: In ſoo moche that it was bruted abroode, that nother capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn nor ſouldiour was left in the Roman campes, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooſte all Italy was yelded to Anniball. Wherefore they loked euery howre, whan theyr ennemies wolde come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege the cytie of Rome. Whervppon the ſenatours prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at Rome all thynges neceſſary for the ſuccours of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Than they ordeyned theyr legyons and offycers. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Iunius, by the whole conſent of the Senate, was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Dictator, and Titus Sempronius mayſter of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There was alſo by the ſame auctorite choſen. 4. legions, and a thouſande horſemen of yonge men, of the age of .xvii. yeres, beſydes that they ſente to theyr frendes in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Italye, that they alſo ſhoulde prepare ſowldyours of the ſame ſorte, with horſe, harneys, and all other neceſſaries.</p>

¶ The cytie thus beinge in extreme feare, letters came from the Conſull Terentius to Rome, certifyenge the Senate of the loſſe of the battayle, and of his felowe the other Conſul. And howe he with the leauynges of the hooſte, that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped at the battayle, were at Cannuſium, to the noumbre of tenne thouſand men. Whych newes ſomwhat comforted the hartes of the citezens.</p>
            <p>¶ Howe lette vs retourne to Anniball, who beynge buſyed about his pryſoners, ſuffered tenne of the Romayn captiues, in the name of all the other, to go to Rome, to ſee yf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſcript, or any of theyr frendes wolde redeme them, and theyr company that were pryſoners: deſyrynge of theſe tenne meſſangers none other ſuerties for theyr retourne, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge theyr othe. With whom he ſent a noble baron of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, to the intent, that yf it ſhulde happe theym to intreate of peace, he myghte brynge the condycions thereof with hym: The pryce of the redemption of a Romayne horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was fyue hundred peces of ſyluer, called Quadrigati, ſo named for that the coygne bare in it the prynt of a charyote: The pryce of a Romane cytezen was thre hundred: the price of a ſeruaunt was one hundred. All other pryſoners of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that camme to the helpe of the Romayns, he lette go free to theyr countreys without raunſome. And whan it was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the councell, that they were come to Rome, a meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger mette this baron of Carthage, whoſe name was Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, and ſhewed hym, that the Dictator commaunded, that he ſhulde depart from the boundes of Rome, before the nyght.</p>
            <p>¶ Sone after the Senate or parlyament was holden for the captyues meſſangers, where one of theym, that was of moſt authoritie, thus began to ſay &amp; openly pronounce his oracion.</p>

Whan Manlius had fynyſhed his oration, al though many of theym were of the kynrede and alyance to the ſenatours, yet the anſwere was gyuen them, that they ſhuld not be redemed.

Whervpon he called a counſayle, wherein he ſhewed the ſenatours, that to receiue the Carthaginenſes, and to leaue the Romans frendſhip, dyd nothyng pleaſe him, conſyderynge that he had maryed Appius Claudius dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo that Liuius hadde maryed one of his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſauynge that neceſſitie dydde requyre it, bycauſe there was other matters in hande moche more to be doubted, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was, that the commune people were pourpoſed fyrſte to ſlea theym all that were of the Senate howſe, and after to yelde vp the citie to Anniball. Neuer the leſſe he ſayde, he wolde vndertake that he wolde ſaue theym frome daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yf they wolde commytte theym ſelues wholly to hym: wherwith he made theym greatte aſſurance by othes. Whan they all, beinge ouercome with feare, had conſented to hym, I wyll ſhut you (ſaith he) into the ſenate houſe, as thoughe I were of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons councell, and dyd alowe their dedes and purpoſe: but after I ſhall fynde a waye to conſerue and ſaue you. And whan they were agreed to the ſame, he encloſed them in the capitoll, ſo that none could come to them, nother they gette furthe, vnleſſe it were by his licence. And than he called the common people togyther, and ſayd: My frendes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9127:45"/>
nowe haue you power ouer the deteſtable and wycked ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, whoſe death ye haue ſo longe deſyred, and that ye haue nowe without ſtroke ſtryking. For beholde, I haue theym encloſed in yonder howſe aboue vnarmed: And what ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ye wyll gyue of them, or any of them, that ſhall they ſuffer, accordyng to theyr deſertes. but before all thynges, I wolde you ſhulde haue reſpect to your helth and profite, before the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your wrath. For ſenatours I am ſure, ye wil haue to gouerne the citie. Therfore nowe haue we two thinges to be done togither, that is, to put downe the old ſenatours, and than to choſe newe. I wyll wel, that you ſhall iudge what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment the olde ſhall haue: but firſte you ſhall chuſe a newe valiant wiſe ſenator in euery of their places. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet he down and cauſid their names to be put togither in writing into a pot and as their names were ſeuerally drawen forth of the pot, he cauſed them to be called in order, and he that was fyrſt named he cauſed to be fetched out of the ſenate houſe, wherin they were incloſed. And whan the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons herd his name, they all cried, that he was wicked, &amp; worthy of puniſhment. Than ſaid Pacuuius, I here well what you ſay, lette him be caſt out for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought, &amp; an other choſen in his place. Than were they at the firſt put to ſilence, bicauſe they wanted a better to be choſen in his place. And whan any man wolde take vpon hym to name any other man: there wold ariſe a greater rumor and noyſe at his naming. Some ſaying, they knew him not, and ſom repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his birthe, ſome his maners, ſome the vilenes of his craft and liuing, with ſuch other like obiections: &amp; moch more the noiſe was for choſing of the ſecond and third: ſo that they al agreed, that it was rather better for them to ſuffer the olde noughty ſenatours to remain, which they knewe, than to haue ſuch new, as were worſe and vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ſo that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to let the old ſenatours go free, and vſe their romthes. After this maner Pacuuius gat the rule of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe, pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſybly makyng the ſenators moche more bounde to him for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge their lyues, than to the commons of the citie. And by this meane by al mens conſent he had the hole gouernance of the citie. Of this cam the loſſe of the dignitie to the ſenators, forgetting their liberte, doing nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel hous with out the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons aduiſe. The citie was always prone &amp; gyuen to luſt &amp; pleſure, not only by the noughtynes of their myndes,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:46"/>
but alſo by the abundance of pleaſures, ryches, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and of all fruitefulnes bothe on ſea and lande, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red want on through the flattery of pryncis, and ouermoche libertie of the people, folowyng theyr pleaſures and luſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde all meaſure, ſo that they diſpiſed both the ſenate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magiſtrates, and alſo all rule and lawe. And than after the battayle of Canuas, they that had a lyttell ſhamefaſtneſſe before, were not aſhamed to diſpiſe the empire of Rome. And in ſhort tyme after, they conſented to yeld vp the citie to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball, and to leaue the amitie of the Romans: yet before they wolde ſende theyr legates to Anniball, they ſent meſſangers to Rome, to deſyre that one of theyr citie myght be euer one of the conſuls at Rome, yf they wolde that they ſhuld helpe them in theyr buſines. Whervpon there aroſe great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and angre, for that they that were before in amitie and as ſubiectes, ſhulde requyre ſuche equalitie of honour with the Romans. Wherfore they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that the legates ſhuld be brought out of the ſenate houſe, and further they ſente an officer, who ſhoulde conueye theym oute of the citie, and to charge them to departe oute of the limyttes and boundes of Rome. The ſame legates incontinent vppon theyr retourne home, were ſent to Anniball, who receyued them, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them all the conditions of peace, accordynge to theyr aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, ſo that no ruler or magiſtrate of Carthage ſhulde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after clayme rule or dominion ouer any citizen of Capua, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhulde any of them be enforſed to go in the warres, but at his owne pleaſure. Agayne, that they myghte kepe ſtylle theyr owne lawes, with theyr rulers and magiſtrates. Amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt whyche requeſtes, they deſyred .iii. C. Romane captiues to be delyuered vnto them, whiche ſhulde be chaunged for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther .iii. C. of theyr horſemen, that kepte warre in Sicilia, whiche was not denyed theym. To this agreement, Decius Magius, a man of great authoritie (ſauing that the commons were not agreable to hym) dydvtterly withſtande: fyrſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge that no legacy ſhulde be ſent to Anniball. And as ſoone as he hearde, that the agreement was made, and that Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball wolde ſende his men of armes to Capua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſhewed them for an example, the proude raygnynge of Pyrthus: and the myſerable ſeruitude of the Tarentines, crying alowde, that if they wolde here hym, Anniballes army ſhulde in no wyſe be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9127:46"/>
receyued: And yf they were all redye receyued, that they ſhulde be put furth agayne.</p>
            <p>¶ As ſoone as theſe thynges were ſhewed to Anniball (as they were not ſecretely ſpoken) he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, that Magius ſhulde be taken and ſent vnto hym: but than he fearynge the diſpleaſure of the people, ſent worde to Marius the Pretor, that he wold be at Capua the next day folowyng. Marius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent aſſembled the people, and ſhewed all men of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles commynge, commandynge them to be redy with their wyues to meete hym. And whanne he was commynge, and all the citie went to mete hym, onely Decius, with his ſonne, and a fewe of his frendes, wolde not go with them: but wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked openly and ſtubburnely in the market place. As ſoone as Annibal came to the citie, he called a counſayle, myndynge in his angre to do cruell execution of his aduerſaries, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng the rulars of the citie deſyred hym, that he ſhuld do nothing as that day, but be mery and celebrate the ſame in the worſhyp of his commynge. To whoſe requeſt (although he was of a ſodayne inclination to wrath and angre) he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable: and ſpent that day in vewyng the citie.</p>
            <p>¶ Pacuuins Calauius, of whome we ſpake before, who was chiefe of the citie, and chiefe cauſer of the yeldynge thereof to the Carthaginenſes, brought his ſonne, being a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thyther, whom he toke from the companye of Decius, with whom the yonge man ſtode fyrmely agaynſte the bandes and frendſhyp made with the Carthaginenſes: nother coulde the citezens, being enclyned to that parte, nother the auctoritie of his father, moue the yonge man to the ſame: vnto whome his father, with great interceſſion, made Anniball good lorde and frende. Anniball being ouercome and appeaſed with the requeſt of his father, cauſed the yonge man, with his father, to be ſent for to ſupper: at whiche ſupper there was none of Capua, ſauyng thoſe that were lodged in that howſe, and one Iubellius Taurea, a noble warriour. The ſouper was begun before the nyght, the feaſt was ſumptuous, and not after the maner of fare in warre tyme. This yongeman, nother by the prouocation of the rulars, nor by the chering of Annibal him ſelfe, coulde be perſwaded to be mery, but he ſhewed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was diſeaſed, and that his minde was ſoore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And whan his father hearde that, he departed oute of
<pb facs="tcp:9127:47"/>
the feaſtynge chaumbre before the ſonne was ſette: whome his ſonne folowed. And whan they came to a gardeyn, at the ende of the houſe, whiche was ſecrete: Father (ſayth he) I haue diuiſed nowe away, wherby we ſhall not onely purchaſe our pardon of the Romanes, for that we haue forſaken them and choſen Hanniball to be our gouernour, but we ſhall ſtande nowe from hensforth in moche more dignitie and grace with them, than euer we were before. Whan his father (meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng what it myghte be) had inquired of hym that diuiſe: he caſte his gowne from hym, and ſhewed his ſyde beinge gyrte with a ſwerde: Nowe wyll I (ſayde he) eſtablyſſhe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifye the bandes betwyxte the Romaynes and vs, with the bloudde of Anniball: Of this counſayle father, I thoughte to make the priuey before, for bycauſe I knewe not, whether thou haddeſt rather be preſent, whyles the deede were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge or not. Whyche diuyſe whan the olde manne hearde (as thoughe he hadde be preſente at the doynge of that whyche was ſpoken) with greatte feare he beganne to adhorte and perſwade his ſonne to the contrary: layinge fyrſt the greatte othe and promyſe made to Anniball by all the whole citie: and alſo ſhewynge the daunger of the acte to be ſuche, that he coulde neuer eſcape alyne. I beynge thy Father (ſayde he) haue wonne Anniball to be thy good lorde, and ſhall not I wynne my ſonne to be frende to Anniball? And after that he hadde with longe prayer, wepynge, and great interceſſion ouercomme his ſonne, and diſſwaded hym frome his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: the yonge manne ſayde theſe wordes: O countreye, receyue thou this ſwerde, with whyche I beynge armed, wolde haue defended this citie and caſtell, ſparyng nothyng, nor Fearynge myne owne deathe, but onely beinge ouercome with my fathers perſwaſyons. And whan he hadde ſo ſayde, he caſte his ſworde into the playne ouer the gardeyne walle, and than bycauſe he ſhulde not be ſuſpecte, he wente agayne to the feaſt.</p>
            <p>¶ The next day the ſenate was holden, in the whiche Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals fyrſt oration was very gentyll, gyuyng thankes vnto the citezens, for that they preferred his amitie and frendſhyp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Romanes: and among other hygh promiſes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſed theym, that Capua ſhulde in ſhorte ſpace be the heade of all Italye: And that the Romaynes, with other cities of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9127:47"/>
Italy, ſhoulde ſeke vnto Capua for theyr ryghte and lawe: but he ſayde, that there was amonge them one named Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Decius, who was noothynge agreable vnto the amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betweene the Carthaginenſes and them of Capua: who (he ſayd) was no citezen, nor ought to be ſo called nor repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherfore he requyred, that he myghte be yelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tohym, and that alſo in his preſence his cauſe myght be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated before theym of the counſaylle. To whyche requeſte euery manne graunted, althoughe ſomme thoughte he was a manne moche vnworthy to ſuſtayne ſuche myſerye, and that theyr lybertie beganne to mynyſſhe not a lytell in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. The ſenate was holden in the temple. Magius was commaunded to be taken, and brought to ſhewe his mattier, and he anone denyed it to be lawfull for theym, to breake the truce taken with the Romaynes. Wherefore he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be bounde with chaynes, and ledde to the campe of the Carthaginenſes. In this leadynge thyther, as longe as his face was not couered, he wente cryinge to all theym, whyche were gathered togyther to ſee hym: Nowe haue ye, menne of Capua, your lybertie, whiche you deſyred: In the markette place, and in the day lyghte, and in the preſence of you all, I beinge chiefe and moſte auncient of Capua, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge bounde, am drawen to deathe. What coulde haue bene done more cruell and violente, yf Capua had be taken? whan he coulde not be ſtayed, but contynued crienge after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, bicauſe the commune people were thoughte to be moued with his wordes, his face and head was couered, and he was ledde quyckely out of the gates into the tentes of Anniball, and from thenſe in haſte ſente towarde Carthage by ſhyppe, leſte there ſhoulde be anye ſedytion moued for the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Cytezens: but in ſaylynge thyther, the ſhyppe was dryuen by tempeſte to Cyrenas, where Magius fledde to the pycture of Ptholomeus the kynge for his ſauegarde. Wherevppon he was broughte by the kepars of the towne to Alexandria, before Ptholomeus. And whan he hadde declared vnto the kynge, that Anniball hadde ſente hym bounde, contrarye vnto the league and bandes of the truce taken with the Cytezens of Capua: he was delyuered from his bandes, and hadde lybertie to goo whyther he wolde to Rome, or to Capua. To the whyche he made aunſwere,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:48"/>
that Capua was not a place very ſafe for hym: and he ſayde, that Rome, whyles there was warre betweene the men of Capua and it, was rather an habitation of vacabundes than of frendes and olde gueſtes. Wherfore he ſayd, he had not ſoo great deſyre to liue in any place, as in his kyngdom, by whom he was reſtored to his libertie.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hyles theſe thynges were done in Italy, Mago the ſonne of Amilcar, not ſent from the army by his brother, but ocupied a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayn ſpace, in receyuynge the cities of the Bruſians, whiche yelded them ſelues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly to the Carthaginenſes, brought ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges to Carthage of the victory at Can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nas. Whan the ſenatours were for him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, he declaryng the actes done by his brother in Italy, ſayde: that he had foughten with ſix capitayns, of the whych iiii. were conſuls, the fyſte Dictatour, that is chiefe rular in the common welthe of the citie, and the ſyxte mayſter of the horſemen. He ſayd alſo, that he had ouercome .vi. conſulles hoſtes: ſo that there was ſlayne by hym .ii. C. M. and aboue fyfty. M. taken. and alſo he had ſlayn .ii. of the foure conſuls, and the thyrde was ſore wounded: and the fourth hauing loſt all his hoſte, fledde ſcacely with .l. men. And that the maſter of the horſemen was ouercome and put to flyght: ſo that the Dictator, whiche at no tyme durſte come to batayle, remained only their head and capitayne. Furthermore, that diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Italy were tourned to Anniball, as the Brucians, the Apulians, part of the Samnites, and the Lucanes. In ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as Capua, whiche was not onely the head of Campania, but alſo of all Italy, euer ſens the Romaynes were ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen at Cannas, had yelded theym ſelues to Anniball.</p>
            <p>And for the more credence of theſe ſo ioyfull newes, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rynges of gold to be powred before the ſenatours, which of many men were reported to be to the quantitie of thre buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels, and a halfe: but moſte authors wryte (and that ſemeth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9127:48"/>
to bemoſt agreable to veritie) that they were aboue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a buſſhell. And moreouer bycauſe it ſhuld be a token of a more notable ſlaughter, he ſayd: that no man dyd weare any of the ſaydiewels, but horſemen, and men of iiobilitie.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of his oration was, that the greatter the hoope was of the wholevyctory, ſo moche rather Anniball ſhuld be ayded with great helpe and ſuccour, ſignifying to theym, that the warre was far from thens, in the myddel of theyr enmies lande: and that a great quantitie of grayne and moche money was ſpent. He ſayd alſo, that as the numbre of their enemies with ſo many battailes were ſlayne and diminyſſhed, ſo theyr hoſte alſo was partly mynyſhed and ſlayne. Wherfore it was mete (he ſayde) to ſende money grayne and other neceſſaries to ſowldiours that ſo well had ſette furthe the name and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Carthage.</p>
            <p>¶ For theſe tydinges of Mago, euery man being mery, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milco, a man of the faction of the Barchins, thought to finde an occaſion to checke Hanno. What nowe Hanno (ſayth he) dothe it forthynke the of the begynnynge of the warre with the Romans? Commaunde Anniball to be delyuered nowe vnto them: or forbydde in this ſo fortunate tyme thankes to be giuen to the immortall goddis. Nowe lette vs here a ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Rome ſpeke in the ſenate houſe of Carthage. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Hanno anſwered.</p>
            <p>¶ I was determined fathers conſcripte, at this time, in your ſo great and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monioy, to haue holden my peace, and to haue ſpoken nothyng, whiche ſhulde haue bene diſpleaſant to you: but I can nowe no leſſe do, but anſwere the ſenatour that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, whether it forthinketh me of the warre enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed agaynſt the Romanes, or no. Therfore myne anſwere ſhalbe this to Himilco, that I forthynke me yet of the warre taken, and ſhall ſtylle repent it, nor ſhall at any tyme ſeace to forthynke it, and blame our victorious capytayne, vntyl I ſee the warre taken vp and ended by ſome tollerable way and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nother ſhall any other thynge cauſe me to ſeaſſe frome the deſyre of the olde auncient peace, ſaue only a newe peace made. Theſe goodly newes, whiche Mago hathe blaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, are very ioyfull to Himilco and other Annibals fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and ſeruantes: yea they may be alſo ioyfull to me, for our proſperitie in warre, yf we take our good fortune whan it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:49"/>
ſhall cauſe vs to haue better and more profitable peace. But if we let paſſe this time, in the which we may be thought rather to graunt peace, than to craue it: I doubte, leſte this ioye wyll deceyue vs, and come to nothynge. Nowe lette vs diſcuſſe this matter ſeriouſly, and ye ſhall perceyue what this greate ioye is. He ſayth, the army of our ennemies is ſlayne: yet he commaundeth ſouldiours to be ſent hym. What other thynge wolde a man deſyre, yf he were ouercome. He ſayth alſo, that the Campes and tentes of bothe hoſtes of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes are taken, with a ryche praye and ſpoyle: yet he commaundeth, that we ſhall ſende hym grayne and money. What other thynge coulde a manne deſyre, yf he were rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and dryuen frome his owne tentes? But nowe I haue aunſwered Himilco to his demaundes, I wolde that other Himilco or Mago wold anſwere me vnto that I ſhall aſke of them. If the fielde fought at Cannas was to the vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertion of the Roman empyre, and deth of the hole hoſt, and all Italy like yeld them, and forſake the Romans? Fyrſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the people of Rome come fleinge to vs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Romans? Moreouer, whether any of the .xxxv. tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes haue fledde, and come to Anniball? Which both thinges whan Mago had denied to be done: It muſt than folow (ſaid he) that we haue many enmies yet left at Rome. But I wold faine knowe, what courage and hope that multitude of our en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nemies hath? Whan Mago had ſayd, he could not tel. There is nothyng more eaſy (ſayde Hanno) to be knowen. Dydde the Romaynes ſende any legates to Anniball for peace? or whether hadde ye any knowledge, that the Romayns made any mention of peace at Rome? Whanne he alſo hadde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that: Than haue we (ſayde he) as greatte warre euen nowe in hande, as we hadde the fyrſte daye that Anniball en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Italye. There be many of vs alyue, that doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre yet, howe varyable the vyctorye was in the fyrſte warres that were betwyxt Carthage and Rome. Our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and buſynes (bothe by ſea and lande) were thought neuer to be more proſperous, thanne before Caius Luctatius, and Appius Poſthumius were Conſuls: But yet in theyr tyme we were ouercomme at the Iles of Egates. Lykewyſe nowe, yf Fortune do tourne (as ſhe is always varyable) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I praye vnto the Goddis maye not happen: Wolde ye
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9127:49"/>
than hope to haue peace, whan we are ouercome, the whiche nowe we can not gette, although we vanquyſſhe and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Romaynes? If any mention of peace were made, eyther to be gyuen to oure ennemyes, or elles to be taken of theym: I coulde telle thanne ryght well what to ſaye. But in caſe ye wylle onely commen of the demaundes of Mago, I thynke, yf our people haue ſoo vanquyſhed our ennemyes as hathe bene declared, it is not nedefulle to ſende theym that whyche Mago deſyreth. And yf they wolde mocke vs with theyr vayne reporte of vyctorye, whanne none ſuche is hadde in dede: I thynke than they oughte leſſe to be ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at our handes.</p>
            <p>¶ With this oration of Hanno very fewe were moued to be of his opynion. For the enuye and hatrede, that they bare vnto hym, and alſoo the greatte kynrede of the other, cauſed hym to be the worſe heard. Agayne, they were ſoo reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſodayne and preſente ioye, that they wold heare noothynge, that ſhoulde hynder the ſame: Suppoſynge the warres ſhoulde ſoone be fynyſſhed, yf they dydde ſende any helpe nowe at this tyme into Italye. Wherefore by the hole conſente of the Senate it was concluded, to ſende to Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball forty thouſande Numydians, to his ſuccours, and fortye elephantes, and a greatte ſumme of money.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter Anniball had taken Capua, he aſſayed many and dyuers ways to haue gotten Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whiche whan he coulde not brynge to paſſe, he went from thens to the fieldes of the Nolans, aſſayeng by many ways to wyn the towne of Nola. The ſenate, and namely the chiefe, ſtacke ſurely to their olde fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the Romaynes: The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munes being (as they are wont) deſyrous of newes, inclyned all to Anniball.

During whiche tyme of delay, they ſent ambaſſadours to Marcellus the pretor of Rome, being than at Cannuſium, ſhewyng hym the circumſtance of the matter: wylling him to come to them yf he intended that they ſhuld kepe the towne. Who percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng theyr ſtedfaſtnes, greately prayſed the ſenate of Nola, deſyrynge them to perſeuere in theyr purpoſe: and vſe ſuche ſubtiltie in prolonging of tyme, as they before had done, vntill his commyng to them, whych ſhuld be ſhortly: In the meane ſeaſon, he willed them, not to be aknowen of any ſuccour that was commynge. Than ſtreyght he made hym redy, and with his army toke the way to Calacia, and ouer the riuer of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus, and ſo to Nola.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball before the Pretors comming, went from Nola to Naples, very deſyrous to wynne ſome towne that laye on the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9127:50"/>
ſea coſtes, to whyche the ſhyppes myght haue free and ſafe paſſage from Affrica. But whan he vnderſtode Naples was defended by a Romane capytayne (the Neapolitans had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thyther M. Iunius Syllanus) and ſhulde as well be kept out there as he was at Nola: he went and layde ſiege to Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceria, whyche at laſt, vſynge many wayes, he cauſed them by famyne to yelde. Marcellus was by that tyme in the towne of Nola, and was no ſurer of his owne ſouldyours thanne he was of the pryncis of Nola: but he feared the commons, and aboue all other he dradde a yonge man, very hardye, and of a noble lygnage, whoſe name was Lucius Bantius, who was moche deſyrous to yelde the towne to Anniball. for beynge founde amonge a heape of dead bodies and ſoore wounded in the battayle at Cannas, Anniball cauſed hym to be healed, and ſent home with large gyftes: for which gentyll dede, he wold fayne that Nola ſhuld be yelded to Anniball. Marcellus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued this Bantius to be troubled in his mynde with ſuche ſtudy, ſo that he muſt eyther with punyſhement be refrained, orels by benefit reconciled: he ſent for hym, and ſo beninglye with wordes, promyſes, and gyftes entertayned hym, that there was none in the citie ſo ſure after to the Romans as he.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Anniball was come from Nuceria (which he of late had taken) before the gates of Nola, Marcellus was entred the citie, not fearyng to kepe his campe abrode: but leſt his taryinge without ſhulde be an occaſyon of betraying and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vp the citie. Than beganne ſmall ſkyrmyſhyng betwene the citie and the Carthaginenſes: at whiche time the pryncis of Nola ſhewed Marcellus, that the common people hadde ſecrete metynges and communication in the nyghte, with the Carthaginenſes: in the whiche it was purpoſed, that whanne the Romans were gone out to fyght, they wolde take theyr ſtuffe and cariage, and ſhutte the gates: and ſo whan they had gotten bothe theyr ſtuffe and goodes, they wold receyue the Carthaginenſes into the town in ſtede of the Romans. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had ſhewed theſe conſpiracies to Marcellus, he praiſed theyr fidelitie greatly, and thought to aſſaye what he myght do by battayle, before any ſuche trouble ſhoulde be within the citie. Firſt he ordered his hoſte being diuided in thre partes, at the .iii. gates, whyche opened agaynſte his ennemyes. He commaunded the ſtuffe and baggage to folowe a prety ſpace
<pb facs="tcp:9127:51"/>
after. And at the middel gate he ſet the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Roman legions, the newe ſouldiours and other that cam to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, he ſette at the two other gates, ſtraightly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, that the Nolans in no wyſe ſhulde come on the walles, nor nere the gates. He ſent alſo certayn ſouldiours to awaite on the cariage and ſtuffe, leſt whan they were buſy in battaile, the Nolanes myghte ſpoyle and take it. Whan all thynges were thus put in good order, they ſtode ſtyll within the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, without makyng any ſhewe.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball ſtanding in aray in the fieldes a longe ſpace, as he was wont, meruailed that he ſawe nother the hooſte come to the fieldes, nor no man armed on the walles: Than he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that theyr counſayle was knowen, and that for feare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of the towne were conſtrayned to forſake their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe. Wherfore he ſent part of the ſouldiours to the tentes to fetche ordynaunce and all thynges neceſſary to aſſault the walles, thynkyng that if he went on them, whiles they abode in this ſtay, that the common people of the citie wolde make ſome rumour on the walles. Incontynent whyles euery man, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement was, ranne to his buſines, touchinge the aſſault, and the hoſt wente to the walles: the gates were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly opened. Marcellus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to ſpreade the baners, and the trumpettes to blowe, and the footemen fyrſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the horſemen to runne on theyr ennemies. Some authors ſaye, that there were ſlayne at that ſkirmyſſhe .ii. M. iii. C. Carthaginenſes, &amp; but one man of the Romans: whetherthe victory were ſo great, or whether it were leſſe, the acte was great, and the conduicte noble. Anniball hauynge no hope of opteynyng the towne, went than to Acerras, and Marcellus ſtreyght cauſed the gates of Nola to be ſhutte, leſt any manne ſhulde paſſe furthe: and made anon ſtrayght and dilygent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, who they were, that wolde haue betrayed the towne. He beheaded .lxxx. of them, and cauſed their goodes to be dyſtributed amonge the commons. And after he had committed the charge of kepyng of the towne to the ſenate, he remoued with his hole hoſt beyonde Sueſſala.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball, after he hadde wonne Acerras, came to Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum, where they ſo valyantlye defended theym ſelfes, that Anniball, beinge halfe aſhamed, left the ſiege, and wente to wynter at Capua. And there he kepte his hooſte in houſes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9127:51"/>
for the moſt part of the wynter, who of long tyme before had endured agaynſt all kyndes of peynes and trauayle, hauynge ſmalle knowlege of pleaſure or eaſe. And they that could not before be ouercome with any kynde of miſery or peyne, were than loſte with vnmeaſurable pleaſures: wherein they were wholly drowned, ſo gredy they were therof, after theyr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed peynes. Thus toke they al theyr delite in ſlepe and wyne, in bankettes, hauntynge of harlottes and bathes, with dayly reſte and ydelnes, whiche delycate faſhion withdrewe bothe theyr courage, and alſo theyr ſtrength from theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and myndes: ſo that afterwarde theyr ioye comfort and ſtrength was more by remembrance of the victories, whiche they had opteyned before, than in theyr preſent ſtrength: In ſo moche that to lette his ſouldiours thus folow theyr luſtes, was thought amonge expert warriours a greater hynderance vnto hym, than that he did not lead his hoſt to Rome ſtreight after the battayle of Cannas. For that tarienge and doubting was thought but only a prolongyng of the victorye, but this faute made theym vnable afterwarde to ouercome. Soo that whan he remoued from Capua after the winter, it ſemed that he ledde furthe a ſtraunge army, other than he brought thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they obſerued none of theyr accuſtomed ſort of warre, ſomme retourned to theyr harlottes: many other, as ſoone as they beganne to feele peyne, trauayle, and hardeneſſe of warre, and that they were fayne to be couered with ſkyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they were ſo werye, and the warre ſemed to them ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſe, that they wanted bothe theyr ſtrength of bodye, and hardyneſſe of mynde, whyche they hadde before. A greatte parte of the hoſte without theyr wages, ſtole from theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pytaynes, nother hadde they any other denne or receptable but Capua.</p>

Titus Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius was left as ruler of the army. Marcellus being at Nola wolde haue ſuccoured them of Caſſilinum, ſaue that the cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Nola wolde in no caſe ſuffer hym to go from theym, fearynge leſte after his departure, the inhabitantes of Capua wolde haue inuaded theym. The ryuer alſoo of Vulturnus was ryſen ſo hygh, that he coulde not well paſſe ouer, but in great ieopardy. Gracchus was lefte with a certayne men of warre, to lye about Caſſilinum, who moued not, nor brought them any ſuccour, bycauſe he hadde in commandement of the dictatour, that he ſhulde moue no battayle in his abſence: yet hearde he ſuche newes from Caſſilinum, whyche wolde haue moued a man to haue broken his commandement.

Yet was there ſuche lyke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe made by ſendyng of nuttes downe the ſtreame, in barels tyll it was alſo eſpyed. At length they were brought to ſuche pouertie, that they were conſtrayned to take ſkynnes, ſtryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the couerynges of ſhieldes, whiche they made ſofte in warme water, and ſo eate them: nother refrayned they to eate myſe and ſuche kynde of vermyn, and all kynde of herbes and rootes, whiche grewe without in the fielde adioyning to the walles. Thus alſo perceyued Anniball: wherfore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the grounde to be plowed vp, where all ſuche herbes and rootes dyd growe to his ennemies ſuccour without the wall.

The ſenate of Rome appoynted double ſtypende to the ſouldiours of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte, and alſo gaue them fiue yeres licence, to be abſent from the warres, for theyr great fidelitie. Than were the Romans buſy in choſyng newe ſouldiours, to ſupply theyr places that were ſlayne in the batayle before. Lucius Poſthumius, and Titus Sempronius were choſen conſulles. The dictatour, whan the offycers were choſen, went to Theanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the army wyntred: he left the maiſter of the horſemen at Rome: who anone after he had receyued the office, counſayled with the fathers, about choſing and ordeyning of their armies for

And whan they were mooſte diligent aboute theyr bulines, tydynges was brought to the citie of a newe ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and loſſe, that was than happed vnto theym, oone euylle chaunce that yere commynge after an other. The truth was, that Lucius Poſthumius and his armye was dyſtroyed in France by this meane. There was a great wyde woode, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Frenchemen Litana, through which he ſhuld leade his hoſte, of the whiche woode the Frenchmen had ſo cutte all the trees on bothe ſydes the waye, yf they were not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they wolde ſtande ſtylle: but beinge any thynge moued, they wolde anon fall. Poſthumius had in his hoſte fyue and twenty thouſande men. The Frenchemen hadde beſtowed their companye rounde aboute the compaſſe of the woode, and whan the armye of the Romaynes was welle entred the woode, they caſt downe the fartheſt part of the trees, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge in the borders of the woode, which whan they were moued fell one vpon an other through the woode, hauyng no ſtay, throwyng downe and ſleing the Romans as they paſſed, bothe men and horſes, ſo that ſcarſely tenne men eſcaped, the moſte part were almoſte paſte breathe and deade of the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the trees fallynge on them, the reſidue, that eſcaped, &amp; wolde haue fledde, beinge amaſed with the ſodeyne chaunce, were ſlayne by the Frenchemen, who beinge armed, beſet tho woode rounde about. There were a few taken, which ſought to goo ouer a brydge, whiche the Frenchemen kepte, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none they were compaſſed and beſet about with the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. There the conſull Poſthumius, who in no wyſe wolde be taken of his ennemyes, manfully and nobly dyed.

were in ſuche ſorowe and trouble for a great ſpace, that they ſhutte their wyndowes and ſhoppes, as though it had ben in the nyght: but within ſhort ſpace the ſenatours charged the officers, to go about the citie, and cauſe the ſhoppes and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to be opened, &amp; to cauſe the citezens to leaue their ſorow.</p>
            <p>¶Than Titus Sempronius called a ſenate or courte, in the which he exhorted and counſailed the fathers conſcript, that they, whoſe hartes were not ouer come for the great diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loſſe of the battayle at Cannas, ſhulde not nowe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſelues to be vanquyſhed with this moche leſſe ſorow and calamitie: admonyſſhynge theym, that as concernynge the Carthaginenſes and Anniball, all was (as he truſted it ſhuld be) very well. And as for the warres with the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it myght be deferred for a ſeaſon: for at all tymes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengynge of theyr harmes was in the power of the goddis and the Romayns.

The Roman hoſt was diuided into thre partes, part of the footemen were ſette be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtanderdes, and part behynd the horſemen, kept the ſydes or wynges. On the other part Haſdruball ſette in the myddell battayle the Spaniardes, and in the right wyng the Carthaginenſes, and in the left winge the Affricans, with the hyred ſtraunge ſowldiours: And he put the Numidians to the footemen of Carthage, the reſidue of the Affricanes he ſette before the wynges: nother dyd he ſette all the Numy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in the ryght wyng, but thoſe, whoſe qualities were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in lyghtnes and nymblenes, that rydyng vpon one horſe, and leadyng a ſpare horſe in theyr handes, whan the one was wery, they wold among the thickeſt of their enemyes leape armed on the other freſhe horſe, theyr agilitie and quycknes was ſo great, and the horſes of kind ſo gentil and wel taught. Thus ſtode they in aray, and litel difference there was, other in the numbre or kyndes of ſouldiours of eyther hoſte. Not withſtandyng the ſouldiours hartes were not like. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capitayns, although they fought farre from home, yet myght they eaſyly perſuade their ſouldiours, that they ſhuld fyght for theyr cuntrey, and for the citie of Rome. Wherfore by that doubtfull battaile they purpoſed, other to ouercome, or to dye, truſting therby to haue ſhort returne home to their cuntrey. The other hooſte hadde not ſo ſterne valiaunt and hardy men. for the more parte of theym were Spanyardes, whiche had rather be ouercome in Spayne, than wynnynge the victory, be conducted into Italy. Therfore at the fyrſte metynge, whan the dartes were ſcarſly throwen, the middell warde fledde, and gaue place to the Romanes: who came v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them with great violence, not withſtanding the battailes were nothynge leſſe in the wynges, for on the one ſyde the Carthaginenſes, and on the other ſyde the Affricans came on them boldly, and fought egerly. but whan the Romane hoſte had gotten in to the myddell togyther, they were ſtronge y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:9127:55"/>
to put away the wynges of theyr ennemies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being in numbre and ſtrength beſt, they ſhortly put the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the worſe. There was a great numbre of men ſlayne, and vnleſſe the Spaniardes had fledde away, ſo thicke before the battayle was begunne, there hadde ſcarſely any of theym remayned vnſlayne. There was no bataile betwene the horſe men. for as ſoone as the Mauritaynes and Numidians ſawe the myddell warde ouercome and putte to flyghte, they dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge the elephantes before theym, ſodaynly departed and fledde: leauynge bothe the wynges bare. Haſdruball remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng tyll the laſt ende of the battaile, fledde with a fewe with hym. That battayle cauſed the hartes of the Spanyardes, whiche doubted before in the frendſhyp of the Romanes, to be wholly gyuen to them. And it dyd not only take the hope from Haſdrubal of leading his hoſte into Italy: but alſo that there was ſcarſe tarieng for hym in Spayne. Which thinges after they were certified to the ſenate at Rome by the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions letters, they were not ſo gladde of the victory, as that Haſdrubal and his hoſt were prohibited the entre into Italy.</p>

            <p>¶ We were (O Anniball) ennemies to the Romayns of our ſelues, as longe as our weapons, our harneys, and ſtrengthe were able to maynteyne vs. Afterwarde whan we had ſmalle hope and truſte in theym, we fell into amitie with Pyrrhus,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9127:55"/>
of whome we were forſaken, beinge not able to defende vs, we toke truce and peace neceſſary, for that we were vnable to withſtande the Romaynes. And we haue endured in the ſame peace the ſpace of fyfty yeres, vnto thy commyng into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Sens whyche tyme thy onely gentylnes towarde our cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezens (whiche beynge taken, thou ſendeſt to vs agayne) as well as thy vertue and fortune, ſo hathe wonne vs vnto the, that yf thou our frende be ſafe and in good helth, we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wolde not feare the Romans, but alſo yf it were laufull to be ſpoken, we wold not feare the goddis. But verily not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou being ſafe and ſounde, but alſo preſent where as thou mayſt alſo beholde our houſes burnynge, and here the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of our wyues and chyldren, we are ſo ſpoyled, and our goodes waſted and dyſtroyed, that it may be thoughte, that Marcus Marcellus hath ouercome at Cannas, and not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball: and alſo the Romaynes may reioyce, that thou onely as it were at one battayle, art ſtronge and valyant, and at the next wethered and faynt. we kepte warre with the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the ſpace of one hundred yeres, beyng ſuccoured by no man, ſauyng that Pyrrhus the ſpace of .ii. yeres, did increaſe his ſtrengthe and power with our men, rather than defende vs by his power. We wylle not reioyſe of our proſperitie, whan we ſubdued .ii. Conſulles with theyr hoſtes at one time and brought them into our ſubiection: but omytting all ſuche proſperous chaunces that we had, we myghte ſhewe thoſe thynges that happed infortunately to vs at that tyme, yf there were any with leſſe ſhame than we maye nowe declare thoſe that be chaunced to vs. There dydde inuade the coſtes of our countreys at that tyme .ii. noble dictatours, the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of horſemen, and two Conſulles, with two conſulles hooſtes, hauynge all thynge prouyded for theym neceſſary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or they wolde aduenture to robbe and dyſtroy our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But nowe we be almoſte a praye to one lyttell hoſte, beynge lefte for the ſuccours of Nola. Nowe they beynge but a ſmalle noumbre, after the maner of robbers, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our countreye with leſſe feare, thanne yf they were in the Romayne fieldes. The cauſe is, that nother thou doeſte defende vs, and alſo that all our luſtye yonge and valyaunt menne, whiche without doubt, yf they were at home, wolde
<pb facs="tcp:9127:56"/>
defende vs, are with the, and vnder thy baner: neyther had we knowen the, nor thyne hoſte, hadde not it happed, that through thy myght there were ſoo many Romans ſlayne and put to flyght, to whome we may ſuppoſe it but a lyght thyng to ſuppreſſe our robbers, ronyng abrode in the fieldes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, runnyng whyther as foolyſſhe and vayne hope of a pray dothe leade theym, whome a fewe of thy Numidians wolde vtterly confounde. And I doubte not, but thou wylte ſende vs ſome ſure helpe and ſuccour, excepte thou iudge vs vnworthy to be defended and holpen, whan heretofore thou thoughteſt vs not vnworthy to be taken as thy frendes and companyons, receyuyng vs into thy amitie and frendſhyppe. ¶ To this theyr lamentable oration Anniball anſwered, that the Hirpines and Samnites dyd ſhewe their ruine and loſſe, requyryng helpe therein, and alſo dyd complayne, that they were lefte withoute ſuccour and vnholpen, and all at ones: where as they ſhulde fyrſt haue ſhewed theyr cauſe, aſkynge ſuccour in theyr myſchiefe, and afterwarde, yf they coulde not haue healpe, than to complayne, that theyr ſuite was in vayne. Neuer the leſſe he promiſed them ſuccours and helpe, not that his army ſhuld come into any of theyr groundes, but that he wolde inuade theyr neyghbours, whiche were fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the Romaines: wherby he ſhulde drawe the Romans from vexyng of them, makyng them gladde to defende theyr frendes. And as concernyng the warre betwene him and the Romaynes, yf the battayle at Traſimenus were nobler than that of Trebia, and the battayle at Cannas more noble than that of Traſimenus: he wolde make the fame and memorye of the victory at Cannas, but obſcure and nothyng to be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in compariſon of a more noble and triumphant victorye, that he truſted to haue of them. With this anſwere and great rewardes he ſent them home: and leauyng a lyttell company at Tiſatis, he toke his iourney to Nola. At the ſame tyme Hanno came to hym from the Bruſians, with ſtuffe ſent from Carthage, and with elephantes.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Anniball had pytched his tentes, not farre frome Nola, he founde all thynges otherwyſe than it was ſhewed hym by the legates of the Samnites. For Marcellus ſo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hym ſelfe euer and all his men, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted nothinge to fortune, nother left any thyng raſſhely in daunger of his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9127:56"/>
ennemyes: for whan he went about any ſpoyle of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or to gette any pray, he dyd it as prouidently, as though he ſhuld haue done it, Anniball beinge preſent. And whan he perceiued Anniball to become: he kept his hoſte within the citie. Whervpon Hanno approched nygh vnto the wall, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge furthe Herennius Baſſus and Herius Petreius, who by the lycence of Marcellus went furthe to talke with hym. Than vnto them by an interpretour he beganne to extoll the vertue and fortune of Anniball, and diſpiſed the nobilitie of the Romans, which (he ſayd) decayed togyther with theyr power and ſtrength: whyche nobilitie and power yf it were lyke as it was in olde tyme, not withſtandyng knowynge the harde and cruell empire and gouernance of the Romans, and the great gentylnes of Anniball towardes all the captiues of Italy, the frendſhip and amitie of the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes was to be preferred before the amitie of the Romans. And yf both the Conſuls with theyr hooſtes were at Nola, they were no more to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to Anniball, than they were at the battell of Cannas: moche leſſe one pretor with a fewe new &amp; vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſouldiours, was able to defende Nola. And that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Anniball, oughte to care, after what maner Nola ſhuld come to Anniballes poſſeſſion: other taken by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or yelded. for there was no remedy but haue it he wold, as he had Capua and Nuceria. He ſayd further, that he wolde not diuine, what ſhuld happen to the citie being taken, but durſte rather promyſe and vndertake, that if they wold yelde Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus and the citie to Anniball, that no man, but they theym ſelues, ſhulde preſcribe the bandes and lawes of the frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp that ſhulde be betwene them.</p>
            <p>¶ Whervnto Herennius Baſſus aunſwered: that the amitie betwene the Romanes and the Nolanes had continued many yeres, of the whiche nother of them dyd forthynke. He ſaid furthermore, that if they ſhuld haue changed or broken their faithes, whan theyr fortune fayled or chaunged, that nowe it were to late to chaunge: for that other chaunged a long time agone: And that it had ben foly for them to haue ſought ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Romaynes if they had bene mynded to haue yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the towne to Anniball. Wherfore theyr myndes were, that with thoſe, whiche came to theyr ſuccours, they were in all thynges ioyned and ſurely knitte togither, and to the deth
<pb facs="tcp:9127:57"/>
ſhulde be. Whiche anſwere toke from Anniball the hope of optayuynge the citie without battayle: Wherfore he beſette the citie rounde about, intendynge to gyue aſſaulte thervnto on all partes.</p>
            <p>¶ So ſoone as Marcellus ſawe that hys ennemies appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the walles, he ordered his hooſte wyſely within the walles, and than ſodeynly iſſued out to batayle, makyng great noyſe. Some at the fyrſte encountrynge were dryuen backe and ſlayne: but whan the armies ioyned togyther, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle beganne to be very fierſe on bothe partes: And no faile it had bena ſoore ſyght, had not a huge tempeſt and raine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted theym: wherby hauynge bothe egre myndes, the one was dryuen into the towne, and the other to his campe or ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, and lyttell hurt done, where (beynge bothe deſyrous of battayle) they abode all the next daye, ſo great was the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtorme. The thyrde day Anniball ſent parte of his ſouldiours, to robbe and ſpoyle the fieldes: which whan Marcellus knewe, he ſtreight ways brought his hoſte furth to the battayle, and Anniball on the other ſyde was nothinge behynde. There was almoſte a myle betwene the towne and the campe, where the two hoſtes mette togyther. The crye that was rayſed on bothe partes cauſed the companye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to battayle, which were before ſent a ſpoyling, and the Nolans with their power were ready to increaſe the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hoſte: whome Marcellus (greatly prayſynge for theyr good wylles and courage) commaunded to ſtande in aray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to theyr ſuccour, and to conuey them, which were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, out of the battayle. And that they ſhoulde in no wyſe fyghte, vntylle he commaunded theym. The battayle was ſtronge, the ſowldiours fought with all theyr myghtes, and lykewyſe the Capytaynes prouoked theym to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Marcellus badde them boldely withſtande thoſe that were ouercomme not thre dayes before, and that not longe agone fledde from Cuma as vacabundes, and the yere before were dryuen from Nola, he beynge capytayne. And to comforte theym the more, he ſayde, that all theyr enemyes were not in battayle: ſome were a rouynge in the fieldes, and thoſe that fought in battayle, were wethered with the pleaſure of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua, with wyne and hauntynge of harlottes. And that the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9127:57"/>
ſtrengthes, courage, and myghte of theyr bodyes and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, by the whyche they paſſed the greatte mountaynes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Alpes, and the hylles of Pyrenes, was cleane goone. He ſayde alſoo, that thoſe were the leauynges of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde ſowldyoures, ſcarſe able to beare and ſuſteyne theyr owne membres and harneys, ſhewynge, that Capua was as hurtfull and diſpleaſaunt vnto Anniball and his menne, as Cannas was to the Romaones. for there (ſayde he) they haue lefte all theyr ſtrongthe, vertue, and good feates of warre, yea and haue lefte there not onely all theyr glorye and fame of the tyme paſt, but alſo hoope of victorye in tyme to come.</p>

The hartes of the Romanes dyd encreaſe, not onely by theyr capytaynes exhortinges, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the Nolanes ſteryng and kyndlyng theyr courage to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle. At length the Carthaginenſes fledde, and were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen backe to their tentes. And Marcellus brought his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours to Nola with great ioye and thankes of the people, whoſe hartes before were moſt inclined to the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

The nexte daye truce was taken, whyche they ſpente in buryinge the deade bodyes. Marcellus made oblation to Vulcan with the ſpoyle of his ennemies. within thre dayes after, eyther for diſpleaſure, or hope of more wages. M. ii. C. lxxii. of Numidian horſmen and Spanyardes fledde from Anniball to Marcellus, whoſe faithfull ſtronge helpe and aide the Romanes vſed in that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile often tymes after.

            <p>¶ So ſoone as Quintus Fabius harde, that Anniball was gone to Apulia, and that he had brought corne as moche as he thought neceſſary to ſerue them for the winter, from No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la and Naples to the campe at Sueſſula, leauyng a ſufficiente garry ſon there, he moued his campe nygh vnto Capua, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and ſpoylyng theyr fieldes: ſo that they of Capua were conſtrayned) truſtyng lyttel to theyr owne ſtrength) to come out of the citie, and encampe them ſelues before the walles,

            <p>¶ In the ende of ſommer, whan all theſe thinges were done, came letters from the Scipions, what great and proſperous actes they had done in Spayne: but all theyr money grayne and clothynge for theyr ſouldiours, and ſea men was ſpente.

And whan theſe ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes and neceſſaries were come into Spayn, the towne of Illiturgus was beſieged of Haſdruball Mago and Amilcar, the ſonne of Bomilcar, for angre that they had changed their hartes, and yelded them to the Romans.

Traſymenus, and the example of Cannas, are very ſorowfull to be remembred: but they are ryght profytable, and a good document, to be ware of ſuche an other.</p>
            <p>¶ After this oration, the prerogatiue of the yonge men was called in agayne: And than wente they to a newe election: in the which Quintus Fabius hym ſelfe was created the fourth tyme conſul: and Marcus Marcellus the thyrd time. Theſe were created without any variance: Nother did any man ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Quintus Fabius of couetouſnes of rule and gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but rather they praiſed the noblenes and courage of his hart. For that whan he ſawe, that the common welthe dyd want a good capytayne, and knewe hym ſelfe withoute doubte to be one: eſtemed the enuy, that he ſhulde haue (yf any ſhulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſe of that matter) leſſe than the profyt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan all thynges were ordeyned with great care and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for the warres in all partes, the Campanes meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of the great and exquiſite ordynance of the Romanes, whiche was moche greatter than it was wonte to be, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng greatly, leſte they wold that yere begynne warre vpon theym: they ſent legates to Anniball incontinent, deſyrynge hym to moue his army to Capua, ſhewyng hym, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes hoſte was choſen and proſcribed to beſiege Capua, for that the defection of them was more diſpleſantly taken of the Romanes, than of any citie in Italy. And bycauſe the matter was ſo fearefully pronounced vnto hym, he made the greater ſpede to come thyther before the Romans. Whan he hadde bene there a ſeaſon, he lefte certayne of the Numidians and Spanyardes to defende the citie, and wente hym ſelfe to the lake of Auernus, vnder the colour to make ſacrifyce. Not withſtandyng his pretence was to ſet on Puteolus, and them that were left there in garryſon.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Fabius Maximus hearde, that Anniball was gone from Arpos, and tourned agayne to Campania, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng nyght or day, he went to the heſt, and cauſed T. Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus to remoue frome Luceria to Beneuentum, and made Quintus Fabius his ſonne to abyde in his place at Luceria:
<pb facs="tcp:9127:60"/>
and hym ſelfe came to Caſſilinum, intendyng to beſiege it, and the Carthaginenſes that were therein. The ſame tyme (as it were a thynge appoynted) Hanno came from the Bruſianes with a great hoſt of horſmen and fotemen, to Beneuentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but it chanced ſo, that Titus Gracchus came from Luceria thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſomwhat before hym, and entred the towne. And whan he hearde, that Hanno had pitched his tentes .iii. miles from the towne, at a water called Calor, and waſted the countrey, he went hym ſelfe out of the towne, and pytched his tentes a myle from his ennemy, and there he had an aſſemble of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, wherof the moſte part were of bondemen, that had bene in the warre the yere before. Theſe bondemen thought by theyr deſertes to be made free, before they wold deſyre it openly: not withſtandyng he perceyued a murmure of ſome ofthem, complaynyng and ſayinge: Shall we neuer be free, and do battaile like free ſouldiours and citezens: Wherof he wrote letters to the ſenate, as well of their deſyre, as of their deſeruyng, ſayinge, that he had euer vnto that day had theyr good faithful and ſtrong helpe, and that they wanted nothing that belonged to good and iuſt ſouldiours, ſauing liberty. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter it was permitted vnto him, to do that whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che he ſhuld thinke mete for the profite of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. Whervpon before he wold do battaile with his aduerſarye, he ſhewed his men, that the tyme was come, in whiche they might opteyne theyr libertie, that they ſo longe deſyred and hoped after. for the nexte day they ſhuld fyght in a fayre and playne fielde, where the battayle ſhulde be done without any feare of diſceyte, with cleane ſtrengthe and hardynes, and he that then wold ſhewe the head of one of his ennemies, ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in battaile, ſhuld ſtreight way be made free: and he that fledde, ſhuld be puniſhed with vile ſeruitude for euer. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe (ſayde he) euery mans fortune lyeth in his owne handes. For the confirmation of whiche his wordes, he ſaid, that he alone was not the auctour of theyr lybertie: but that Marcus Marcellus the conſull, and the fathers conſcripte were agreable to the ſame. And thereof he had ſente hym theyr letters, whiche he ſhewed and red vnto them. At theſe his wordes there aroſe a great noyſe amonge them, deſyryng battaylle incontynent, yf it myghte ſoo pleaſe hym. Than Gracchus lette the Conuocation paſſe, and appoynted the

            <p>¶ Whyles theſe thynges were done at Beneuentum, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball waſtynge the fieldes of the Neapolitanes, moued his tentes to Nola.

Whiche his diuiſe Nero could not brynge to paſſe, eyther bicauſe he knewe not the cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome wayes of the countrey, or els for that the ſhortenes of the tyme wolde not ſuffer hym. Marcellus in the mornynge mette with his ennemies, and gaue them batayle: in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he had the victory, and cauſed his enemies to flee. neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he durſte not folowe theym, bycauſe he wanted his horſeman. Wherfore he cauſed his menne to recule. There were .ii. thouſande of their ennemies ſlayne, and not .iiii. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Romanes. Nero and the horſemen, labouryng in vayne the nyght and the day, without ſeing his enemies, came home about the ſonne ſette. for whiche his vayne iourney, he was ſore rebuked of the conſull, ſaying, that he was the cauſe as than, that theyr ennemies had not receiued as great loſſe, as they gaue at Cannas. The next day the Romans diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into the fieldes, but Anniball kepte hym in his tentes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legyng hym ſelfe to be ouercome. And the thyrde day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of optaynyng Nola, truſtyng to haue better ſpede, remoued to Tarentum.</p>
            <p>¶ Quintus Fabius, the other conſull, had his tentes at Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilinum, whiche was kept with .ii. M. of the Campanes, and vii .C. of Anniballes ſouldiours. He cauſed Marcellus to come to hym with his hoſte, And if that the Nolans thought them ſelfes not ſafe from Annibal, that they ſhuld ſend to Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neuentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gracchus, to com to theyr ſuccours. which thing done, Caſſilinum was quyckely won, and the ſouldiours that were there, as well of Annibals as of Capua, were taken, and ſente to Rome, and there put in pryſon. There were taken by Fabius at that time many cities in Italy, and in them to the numbre of .xxv. M. of Anniballes ſouldiours and frendes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſlayne, beſide .iii.

Than the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capytaines, remembryng that the citie of Sagunt had ben ſo long oppreſſed with the yoke of dominion of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, they remoued theyr hooſte thyther, and wanne the citie agayne, whyche they reſtored to the olde inhabitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therof, that were lefte on lyue. Than they inuaded the Turditans, who were the fyrſt cauſers of the warre with the Carthaginenſes, whom they wan ſhortly, and diſtroyed their cities. Theſe dedes were done in Spayne, Quintus Fabius Maximus, and Marcus Claudius Marcellus being conſuls.

and ſo proceded furthe with hym, declarynge as was gyuen hym in charge.</p>
            <p>¶ Soone after came to the ſame conſull into the campe oone Claſſius Altinius with his thre ſergeantes, from the towne of Arpos, promiſing for a good reward to delyuer to him Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pos. This matter was debated among the counſell, and by the more part agreed, that this Altinius ſhulde be ſcourged and ſlayne, as an inconſtant traytour and common enemye, conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deryng that fyrſt he, after the battayle of Cannas, was cauſer of the yeldyng the towne to Anniball, chaungyng his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as fortune chaunged.

            <p>¶ Agaynſte whyche theyr determynation ſpake olde Q.

Neuertheleſſe (ſaythe he) I wylle not aduyſe you to gyue moche faythe to Altinius, but kepyng a good meane, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repute hym as an ennemye, nor truſte hym as a frende: but that he be ſente to ſomme of youre cyties neere adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, there to be ſafely kepte, tyll the warres be ended: at whyche tyme we may at lengthe conſulte, whether the fyrſte his departyng from vs hath deſerued more punyſhment, than his retourue hathe deſerued pardon. This his aduyſe toke place. He was ſente with his companye to Cales. And the Conſull determyned, to beſiege Arpos. Wherfore folowing his purpoſe, he pitched his campe within a myle of the towne
<pb facs="tcp:9127:63"/>
where he myghte viewe the towne, and there perceyued on the one parte therof, whiche was leſte vſed, a lowe gate and a narowe. To this gate he appoynted certayn good capitay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and .vi.

This his deuiſe with ſpede was executed. And the chaunce was ſuche, that one thynge, whiche was thought wolde be a greate let of theyr purpoſe, beſt holpe them, and diſceyued their ennemies: whiche was, that about the myddes of the nyghte, there felle ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of raine, with ſo vehement a ſtorme, that the watche men were of force driuen, leauyng their appoynted places on the walles, to deſcende and entre into theyr howſes: where abydyng a good ſeaſon, they fell on ſlepe. In this whyle had the Romans ſcaled the walles, and were beſye to breake vp the gates. Whoſe noyſe was not hearde of the watchemen: ſo rude was the ſtorme, and ſuche noiſe made the huge rayne. Than blewe they hornes, at whoſe ſownde the conſull drewe nere, and about the breake of the day entred the citie by the broken gate. Than was theyr entre diſcried. There was of Anniballes men in that towne .v. M. ſouldiours, the towne alſo had armed .iii. thouſande men, whyche townes men the Carthaginenſes cauſed to go in the front of the battaile, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtynge to haue them behynde at their backes. After a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ſkyrmyſhyng in the ſtretes, dyuers of the townes men of Arpos, and certayne of the Romanes, whyche were before of acquayntaunce, beganne to common and talke togyther. Fyrſt ſpake the Romans, &amp; ſayd: O ye men of Arpos, what do ye meane, to take part with theſe barbarous nation againſt your own cuntrey men? Wherin haue the Romans offended you? or what haue the Carthaginenſes deſerued vnto you, that ye ſhuld thus trauail to make Italy ſubiect &amp; tributary to Affrica? The Arpins excuſed them ſelues, ſaying, that they were betrayed &amp; ſold by their captains to the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis, &amp; almoſt vtterly diſtroyed. Theyr communication ſtayed the fyghtyng. And after a certayn ſpace, the pretor or gouernour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9127:63"/>
of the towne was brought by his men to the conſull: Where they ſo well agreed, that incontinente the Arpines toke the part of the Romans againſt the Carthaginenſes. There were alſo in the towne about a thouſande Spanyardes, who all in lykewyſe tourned to the Romanes: but fyrſt they opteyned of the Conſul; that the garriſon of the Carthaginenſes might freely depart the towne, to go at their liberty: Whiche was truely performed. They departed to Salapia, where Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal was, and the towne incontinent was deliuered to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, without loſſe of any of theyr army.</p>
            <p>¶ The Scipions in this ſpace had broughte theyr buſyneſſe proſperouſly to paſſe in Spayne, bothe in conſeruyng theyr olde frendes, and gettynge of newe: beſydes this ſodeyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had comforte to do good in Affrica, by the reaſone of one Syphax a kyng of Numidia, who as tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was become an ennemy to the Carthaginenſes. To this kynge were ſent .iii. legates, that ſhuld bring him in amitie with the Romans, and alſo cauſe him to make warre vpon the Carthaginenſes. This meſſage was alſo very acceptable to Syphax. Whervpon he reaſoned with the legates, that were expert men of warre, and perceyued many thynges, wherin he and his men before were ignorant. Wherfore whan they wolde haue departed, he intreated them, that two of them wold retourne home to theyr capitaynes, to deſyre a ſure aliaunce betwene hym and the Romanes, and to aſcertayne them of his full mynde: and that the thyrde of them myght remayne ſtyll with hym, to be gouernour of his army, ſaying that his men were good horſe men, but they were nothynge ſkylfull to fyght on foote. To this his requeſt they agreed, and departed, takyng the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges othe and promyſe, that in caſe theyr capitayns wold not agree therto: that incontinent theyr felowe, whiche was left behynd, ſhuld be ſent home to them agayn. The name of hym that remayned with kyng Syphax, was Statorius, who anon choſe out a greate numbre of yonge and actyue men, whome he taught to folowe theyr baners, and to kepe theyr aray af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Romayne facion: So that in ſhorte ſpace, Syphax thought hym ſelfe able, bothe on horſebacke and on foote, to gyue battayle to the Carthaginenſes. Thus was there a ſafe bande of peace and amytie betweene the Romaynes and Syphax.</p>

¶ Whan the Carthaginenſes were ware therof, they ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent meſſangers to one Gala, kyng of the other part of Numidia. This Gala had a ſonne of .xvii. yeres of age, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wyſe yongman, called Maſſaniſſa. The imbaſſadours ſhewed the king, that better it were for him, with theyr helpe to ouercome Syphax betyme: than by his meanes the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſhuld haue any entre into Affrica.</p>
            <p>¶ With ſuche wordes, they perſwaded Gala to the warre: and moche the ſooner, for that Maſſaniſſa his ſonne deſyred to be gouernour of that army. Whervppon the army of the Carthaginenſes was ioyned to Maſſaniſſa his army. And at the fyrſte battayle Syphax was ouercome, and .xxx. M. of his men ſlayne: ſo that with a fewe horſemen he fledde to the Mauritaynes, that inhabyted nygh the Gades or pyllars of Hercules, where he gathered a newe army of men, thinkyng to ſayle ouer into Spayne: but er euer he could take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Maſſaniſſa, with his armye, camme agayne on hym, and without the helpe of the Carthaginenſes, fought a noble ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle with hym, and ouercame hym.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nniball this ſeaſon euer hauing hope, that the citie of Tarent ſhuld, by one meane or other, be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, as is before ſayd, made his abode not farre from that citie. And to bring his opinion to his purpoſe, there happed a fortunate cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by the meanes of oone Phileas a Tarentine, who longe tyme had taryed at Rome, as a meſſanger of the Tarentines. There were than at Rome dyuers pledges of the noble bludde of Tarent, kept in gentyl kepyng. To theſe pledges this Phileas fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the mean to haue often recours, and at length he ſo corrupted the kepers, that they ſuffered them to depart out of the citie in the begynning of the nyghti and Phileas went with them to guide them by ſecrete ways. In the morning yarly the fame of the pledges departing was ſprede abrode through the citie, and a great numbre purſued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſpede: ſo that before they had far trauailed, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertoke them, &amp; brought them all backe agayn into the citie:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9127:64"/>
Where for theyr offences, iudgement was gyuen, that they ſhuld be firſt ſcourged with roddes naked, and than brought to a hygh rocke: from the toppe wherof they ſhulde be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe to the grounde.</p>
            <p>¶ This cruell ende of thoſe nobles offended moch the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of dyuers cities in Italy and Grece, ſpecially thoſe that were of kynne or by amitie alyed to any of theym that were ſlayne: among whiche ſort .xiii. of the nobles of Tarent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired agaynſt the Romans, of whom the captayns and chief were Nico and Philomenes. They were great hunters, and vſed moche to iſſue out of the citie in the nyght to go on hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng. Wherfore by the colour of goinge on huntynge, they went towarde the army of Anniball, intendyng to ſpeke with him, and to declare vnto him theyr intentes. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came nere the campe, they two leauyng theyr company in a wodde nere adioynyng, wente to the campe: and anone were taken of the watchemen, and brought to Anniball, as theyr requeſt was: to whom they declared theyr purpoſe and good wylle. And he gaue theym greate thankes, and ſente theym hoome agayne looded with fayre promyſes. And to couer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr deuyſe, he wylled them to dryue with them certayn cattalle of the Carthaginenſes, ſayinge, they hadde gotten that praye of theyr ennemyes: whyche they were ſuffered to doo without reſyſtence: and brought them home to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with ioye. This vſed they to do oftentymes: ſo that it was thoughte meruayle, that they ſoo often enterpryſed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che feates, and euer eſcaped vnſlayne. Thus often they vſed, and euer whan they kylled any venyſon, or brought any praye from the Carthaginenſes (whyche they were ſuffered to do at all tymes at theyr pleaſures) they eyther gaue it to the capytayne of the citie, a Romayne, or elles to the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the gates: ſoo that they had brought the porter in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a cuſtome, that whan ſoo euer Philomenes dyd but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, at all tymes of the nyghte, the gates were opened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan they had brought all thynges in this good caſe for their purpoſe, they wente to Anniball, and agreed with hym on this couenaunt, that the Tarentines ſhulde lyue euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne lawes and cuſtomes. Alſo that they ſhoulde paye hym noo Trybute, nor haue anye armye appoynted
<pb facs="tcp:9127:65"/>
by Anniball to kepe the citie, but at their owne pleſure. And that they ſhulde enioy all their goodes. Onely that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours of the Romanes, whiche were in the citie, and theyr goodes, ſhulde be at the pleaſure and wyl of Anniball. Than lay Anniball .iii. dayes iourney from Tarent, and bycauſe he wolde not haue his longe abode there, to be ſuſpecte, he fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hym ſelfe to be ſycke, and cauſed it to be bruted abrode, that his ſycknes was the cauſe of his longe lyinge in that one place. But agaynſte the tyme he wolde haue the towne, he choſe out .x. thouſand horſemen, and of the lighteſt footemen of his army: and remoued from his campe in the nyght, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng ſpede tyll he came within .xv. mile of Tarent, where he ſecretely abode, chargyng his men, in no wiſe to breake their aray or order: but that they ſhuld beredy to do what their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaynes dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde them, and none other. But fyrſte, er he ſette furth, to couer the better his remouing, and to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that none of the countrey ſhulde deſcrye his armye: he ſent .iiii. ſcore Numidians lyght horſemen, to go before hym, chargyng them to ouerrunne the cuntrey, by whiche he with his army ſhuld paſſe. And yf they ouertoke any men, to bring them backe. And if they met with any, they ſhuld ſlea them to the intent it ſhulde be thought by the inhabitantes as they went, that they were robbers and theues, and not menne of warre. The fame of theyr robbyng came to the eares of the Romayne capitayne at Tarent: who toke but ſmalle regarde therto, thynkyng ſyth Anniball hym ſelfe was ſycke, and his army ſo farre of, that he wolde the next day ſende furth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of his men of armes, to dryue away thoſe robbers, and to ſaue the corne and cattall of his frendes. The ſame nyght, in the deade parte therof, remoued Anniball toward Tarent, hauynge Philomenes with hym, as his guyde. Whan they came nigh to the towne, it was appoynted, that Philomenes ſhulde entre the towne, with a numbre of men in harneys, at the gate, where he was wonte to entre, bryngynge his praye from huntynge. Whan he came thither, he awaked the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaying, that he had brought a great bore that he had ſlayn. At the fyrſt call the porter opened the gates: and fyrſte let in two yong men of his company: than entred he, and other his ſeruantes, pluckyng in the great boore. at whoſe greatneſſe whyle the keper was daryng and muſynge, Philomenes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9127:65"/>
ſlew hym with his boore ſpeare or huntyng ſtaffe: and incontinent let in .xxx. other men in harneis, who ſlewe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther watchemen of the ſaid gate: and without noiſe let in the reſt of the army, and ſecretely brought theym into the market place, where they abode a ſpace without makyng any noyſe. Whiles this was done at one gate, Annibal, with a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre with hym, came priuily towarde an other gate, and a farre of he made a great fyre, which was a ſigne or token made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene hym and Nico, who abode with other his complices, redy within the towne, loking for his commyng. Whiche fyre whan Nico perceyued, he (as it were anſweryng to the ſame) made him an other fyre. And whan eyther perceyued other, incontinent both theyr fyres were ſodeinly put out. And An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball beganne to approche with his army to the gates. Nico alſo within the citie, cam to the porters ward, which he found open, and fyndyng the watche on ſlepe, ſlewe all the kepers therof, and openyng the gates, lette Anniball and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of footemen entre: for the horſemen were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to abyde in the playnes without, to do there as neede requyred. Thus they entred the towne, and makyng no noyſe, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the market place, where they mette with Philomenes, and his other company. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had he in his company .ii. M. french men, whyche he deuyded in thre partes, and ſent them to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of the citie. The affricanes and the Tarentynes he cauſed to kepe the moſte accuſtomed ſtretes of the towne: commaundynge theym, to ſlea all the Romaynes, but in any wyſe to ſpare the Tarentine citezens. And to that pourpoſe he appoynted the ſayde yonge gentylmenne of Tarent, that were his helpers and frendes, to be in the company of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſouldyours. So that whan they ſawe any citezens, they ſhulde comfort them, byddyng them, not to be affrayde: for they ſhulde haue no hurt. Than beganne a great rumour and noyſe to be rayſed in the towne, as is euer, where ſoo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne chaunce happeth. The capytayne at the fyrſte noyſe, doubtyng treaſon, fledde to the hauen, and frome thens, in a ſmalle bote, paſſed ouer into the caſtell.</p>
            <p>¶ Whanne the day appeered, and that the harneys and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Carthaginenſes were perceyued, and alſo of the frenchemen, with the deathe of ſoo many Romaynes: than was it manyfeſt, that Anniball had wonne the towne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb facs="tcp:9127:66"/>
the Romanes that might eſcape, fledde into the ſayd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell. Than cauſed Anniball the citezens to aſſemble togither without armure, to here his pleaſure, which they all obeyed. There dyd he declare vnto them, the loue and great affection that he hath euer borne vnto them, and the gentylnes that he had ſhewed vnto them at the battaile of Traſymenus, and the battaile of Cannas, whan he ſent vnto theym ſuche of theyr frendes, as he had taken captiues, without any hurt, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or raunſome. And after he expreſſed, with great inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, the cruel and proude dominion, that the Romans euer hadde ouer them. From the whiche he was come to delyuer them: wyllinge euery one of them of the citie, to retourne home to his houſe: and with ſpede to wryte his name on the doore of his owne houſe. for incontinent he wold ſende his ſouldiours to ſpoyle and diſtroy ſuche houſes, as had not the names entitled on the doores: Chargynge theym on peyne of deathe, that none of theym ſhoulde write his name vppon the doore of any Roman: for that was the mark, wherby his men myghte knowe the houſes of his frendes, from thoſe of his ennemies.</p>
            <p>¶ With this exhortation he lycenſed euery man to departe home, and within a certayn ſpace, he gaue a ſygne to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, to ſpoyle the houſes of the Romanes. Whiche was done, and good ſpoyle therof taken. On the morowe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to aſſault the caſtell: but whan he ſawe the ſtronge naturall ſite therof, beyng halfe compaſſed with the ſea, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng on the great hygh rockes, and on the other halfe hauing great dyches and hyghe walles towarde the towne: he was lothe to ſpende his tyme in the aſſaultyng therof, and to leaue other great thynges not folowed. Neuertheleſſe being loth to leaue his frendes the Tarentines, open to all inuaſyons of the men of armes of the Caſtell. (For to the towne they myght at all tymes haue acceſſe at their pleaſure) he thought to make a walle and dyche on the towne ſyde, betwene them and the caſtelle. And he hadde this opinyon, that whan the dyche were caſtynge, the Romaynes wolde aduenture to make excurſion on the labourers, to lette his worke and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And he intended, that yf they ſo fierſely wold do, ſo to diſpoſe his men pryuily in imbuſhmentes: that ſuch ſlaughter of them ſhulde be made, that they ſhoulde not be able after to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9127:66"/>
hurte the towne. And euen as he thoughte, ſoo camme it to paſſe. For ſo ſoone as the worke was begunne, anone the gate of the caſtell was ſette open, and the Romaynes came on the workemen and Carthaginenſes, with ſuche violence, that anone they gaue backe, and ſommewhat the more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, to enhaunce theyr hartes and courage, and to allure theym further frome theyr holde. But anone, at a certayne token gyuen, the imbuſſhemente brake out, and with ſuche force inuaded the Romaynes, that they fledde backe with moche ſpeede towarde the caſtelle: but than was the ſtrete ſoo narowe, by whyche they muſte paſſe, and they ſoo troubled with the baggage of the labourers, that laye in their waye, that many more were ſlayne in the fleinge, than were before in fyghtynge. Thus was the power of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, lefte ſo ſmall, that afterwarde theyr workes were neuer lette, but that the depe dyche and walle were made in ſuche wyſe, that he neded not to leaue any garryſon in the towne. Neuer the leſſe for theyr ſauegarde he lefte a certayn of his ſouldiours: and he with the reſte of his army remoued fyue myles from thenſe to the ryuer of Galeſus, where he pitched his tentes. Soone after he retourned to viewe the ſtrength of the Caſtell: and thought it myght be wonne with a ſaute. Whervppon he cauſed all maner of engyns to be made, and ſette vp agaynſte the walles: to the greatte feare of theym of the Caſtell. But ſodeynly in the nyghte came a certayne of ſhyppes of menne of warre, frome Metapontus, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che than was holden with Romans, and entred the hauen: by whoſe healpe they of the Caſtell threwe downe, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the ingynes and munymentes of the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Wherby Anniball loſte his hope of wynnynge the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelle by any aſſaulte: but than he ymagyned, by contynuall ſiege to famyſſhe theym. Whyche purpoſe alſo ſerued hym nothynge. For they of the caſtelle hadde the ſea free on the oone ſyde, where they receyued vytayles at theyr ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And the Romaynes, beynge mayſters of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, kepte all prouyſyon frome the cytie, that was wonte to comme by water. Soo that they were moche more lyke to endure famyne, thanne the other of the caſtelle, whome they beſieged. Wherfore Anniball, myſtruſting the ſtrength
<pb facs="tcp:9127:67"/>
of the place, called the rulers of Tarent before hym, and ſayde:</p>
            <p>¶ I beholde the nature, the ſite, and all the ſtrengthe of this caſtell, and I can not ſee, that any aſſault can preuayle, ſo long as our ennemies be lordes of the ſea, and haue that at liberty. But if we may (ſaid he) haue ſhippes, which may reſtrain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes to be brought to them: either they wil depart thens, or yeld vnto vs. To this the Tarentines agreed well: but they ſaid, that he muſt helpe, that ſome of the nauy of Carthage, which were in Sicilia, might be cauſed to comme thither, to kepe the ſaid port. Why (ſayde Anniball) haue you no ſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of your owne. Yes truely (ſayde they) but they lye here in a littell creke, and ſo longe as our ennemies haue the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the mouthe of the hauen, howe can they euer eſcape in to the brode ſeas? Yes ſaid Anniball feare it not. for many thinges, that naturally be letted, by witte and policy may be brought to paſſe. Your citie is ſituate on a playne and euen grounde, and your ſtretes and ways be brode, to paſſe to all partes. Your ſhippes wyll I conuey through the high way, that leadeth through the middell of your citie, vpon waines and wheles, vnto the hauen, with ſmalle charge. And the ſea ſhall be ours, that nowe our enemies be lordes of. Than both by ſea and by lande, we wyll compaſſe them: ſo that ſhortely they ſhall be dryuen to forſake the caſtell, or els we ſhall take bothe them and it alſo.</p>
            <p>¶ This his wyſe diuiſe made all men to haue wonder and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of hym, with alſo a hoope of a good ſucceſſe of his purpoſe. Furth withal waynes and cartes were gathered and tyed togither. Than were engins made, to raiſe and to drawe vp the ſhippes, and the ways made hard, euen, and leuell, that they myght the more eaſily be drawen on them. Thus with ſtrength of beaſtes and men, the ſhyppes were broughte to the hauen, and in fewe daies garniſhed with men and all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges neceſſary, and brought rounde about the caſtell, caſtyng their ankers before the mouthe of the hauen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Vhyles Anniball was thus occupied aboute the buſyneſſe of Tarent, Quintus Fuluius Flaccus, and Appius Claudius, that were choſen conſuls for that yere, were com with bothe their armyes into the parties of the Samnites: and the rulers of Capua feared greatly, leſt they dyd intende ſhortly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege their citie. Alſo plentye of corne beganne than to faile them. for the legions of the Romans hadde ſo inuaded their countrey, that the Campanes durſt neither tyll nor ſow their groundes. wherfore they ſent legates vnto Annibal, deſiring hym, to cauſe plenty of wheate to be brought to Capua, from the countrey adioynyng: before that the conſuls dydde enter their countrey with theyr armies. Whervpon Anniball ſent meſſangers to Hanno, that he ſhuld come from the Bruſians with his army into Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pania: And to make prouiſion, that the Campanes might haue good plenty of corne ſent to them.</p>
            <p>¶ Hanno (as he was commaunded) leauynge the Samnites, and the Conſuls, paſſed by, tyll he came within .iii. myles of Beneuentum: where on a mountayne he pitched his campe, and in townes of his frendes adioyning, to which great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wheate the ſommer before had bene caryed, he made goodly prouiſion for the Campanes, and ſent worde ſecretely to Capua, what day they ſhuld, with all the waynes and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that they coulde aſſemble in the countrey, reſorte to the ſayd places, for to fette away their ſaid wheate. The Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, lyghtly and ſklenderly foreſeing their buſines and welth, at the day aſſigned, came thither, bringyng with them but .iiii. hundred cartes: which theyr ſlouth Hanno greatly rebuked, maruaylyng, that they wolde no more hedily auoyde hunger whiche all brute beaſtes labour to eſchue. Wherfore he ſente them home laden, and appoynted them an nother day, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne againe for a moche greatter quantitie.</p>
            <p>¶ This appoyntment came to the eares of the Beneuenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:68"/>
Whervpon incontynent they ſente tenne meſſangers to the Conſulles, certifyenge theym of all the Campanes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And they furthwith agreed, that Fuluius, with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye ſhoulde goo to Beneuentum, and enter the towne, in the nyghte, kepynge him cloſe therin, tyll he ſawe tyme apte for his purpoſe. So ſoone as Fuluius was entred Beneuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, it was ſhewed hym, that Hanno with a parte of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was gone furth for wheate: and that .ii. M. wayns were come to the campe with a great rude ſort of people vnarmed, where they lay myngled amonge the ſouldiours, kepyng no order after the vſe of men of warre. This knowen, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his men to be redy with theyr baners &amp; armure: for the next night he wold aſſayle the Campanes, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Carthaginenſes. They executyng his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made them redy, and about .iiii. of the clocke, they ſet furthe of the towne, and came to Hannos campe, a lyttell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dawnyng of the day. At theyr fyrſt commynge, with their ſodain noiſe, the Carthaginenſes becam ſo feareful, that if the campe had be pitched on plain ground, they had wonne it with ſmall reſiſtence: but the height of the hyll, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes that they had made therabout, was ſuch, that they could no way get vp vnto them: but by great ſteppes and climming. In the daunyng of the day the bataile began to waxe ſtronge, the Carthaginenſes not onely defended their campe, but alſo they kept the hyll without, euer throwing doune the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that ſtroue wonderſly to clymme the place. Neuertheleſſe at length by great pein and trauaile, and alſo with great loſſe and hurt of men, they gat to the diches of the campe. The conſull aduiſyng well the miſchief that ſhulde fall to his company, in winning the place, callid the tribunes vnto him, ſaying: that he wold no further at that time purſue his foliſhe enterpriſe, but that he wold returne for that day to Beneuentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And on the morow he wold ioyne his campe to the campe of his enmies: ſo that the Campanes ſhuld not iſſue out, nor Hanno haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours again to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whan he were returned. And to bring this better and more ſurely to paſſe, he wolde ſende for his felowe Claudius the conſull, with his army to aſſiſt him therin: whan the tribune cauſed the retreate to be ſowned, his ſouldiours, that were earneſtly buſy aboute their enterpriſe, wolde gyue none care therto. Among other there was one Vibius, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitain

of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the Pelignes, who ſtreight toke his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his hande, and with force threwe it ouer the diche into the campe of the Carthaginenſes. Than ſayd he: Euyl might I fare and my company, if myn enemies ſhall enioy my baner. Than by great force he lightly went ouer the diche, &amp; clame vp, and entred the campe of his enemies: whom his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boldly folowed. While they thus fought within the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of the Carthaginenſes, on an other part cried Valerius Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus: what ſluggiſhe cowardes are we nowe waxen? ſhall the Pelignes wynne the honour of taking the campe of our enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before vs Romans? Whervpon Titus Pedanius a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred men, toke his ſtanderd in his hande from his ſtanderde bearer, ſaying: This ſtanderde wyll I beare in to the fielde of myne enemies, folowe me ſyrs as many as wolde be lothe of the loſſe therof. And anone he and his companye were goten into that other part of the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe. The conſul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing their hardynes, changed his mynd of calling them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and began to comfort them: exhorting the reſt, to helpe their felowes, that ſo valiantly fought in the campe of theyr enmies. By whoſe harty wordis, euery man inforced him ſelfe to enter, not regarding the dartes nor weapons of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as people fearyng no peryll: And as people that cared not for deth, ſo they might dye in the campe of their enemies. Thus within ſhort ſpace, that ſtrong place was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, &amp; aboue vi. M. ſlayn, &amp; .vii. M. taken, with the men of Campania, that came for corne, with al their cartes, and a riche pray that Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no before had gotten in the fieldes of the frendes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Whiche pray the conſuls ſolde (for by that tyme was Claudius alſo come thither) &amp; therwith rewarded their men, ſpecially Vibius and Pedanius. Whan Hanno hearde of the loſſe of his people, he fledde backe againe to the Brutianes, with a fewe men whiche he had taken with hym, to get in the wheate for the Campanes.</p>
            <p>¶ The Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panes, heryng of the loſſe of their men &amp; frendes, ſent to Annibal, ſhewing him, that both the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuls were at Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neuentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, within a days iorney of Capua, intending to lay ſiege to their city. And it was to be feared, leſt (if he did not ſhortly ſuccour them) that the Romans wold wynne and diſtroy that citie. They ſaid further, that nother the caſtell of Tarent, nor the town alſo, ought to be ſo moch eſtemed of him, as Capua.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:69"/>
the noblenes wherof he knew well him ſelfe. In ſo moch that he was wont to compare it vnto Carthage. Wherfore they truſted, that he wold not leaue it vndefended, to haue it ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and diſtroyed by the Romayns.</p>
            <p>¶ Annibal hering this meſſage, ſhewed to the ambaſſadours, what loue he bare vnto their citie, promiſing to be euer a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender therof. With theſe gentyll wordes he ſent them home again, &amp; he ſent with them alſo .ii. M. horſmen, by whoſe helpe they might defend their fieldes from robbing and waſtyng.</p>
            <p>¶ In the meane whyle P. Cornelius the pretor, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhippes, laden with wheate, came into the hauen of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, through the hole power of the Carthaginenſes. He cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed alſo ſuche ſouldiours as were at Metapontus in garriſon, to come to the caſtell of Tarent, there to remaine for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence therof: by whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge, they of the caſtell were than ſure from any hurt of their ennemies. but ſo ſoone as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of Metapontus were deliuered of the Romayne garriſon, they incontinent fell in leage and amitie with Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball. Whervpon the Thurines, alſo hauynge a grudge to the Romans, for ſleing diuers of their frendes, as is aforſaid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed a meane, to bringe their citie to the amitie of Anniball: The kynſmen of them that were ſlayne, ſente meſſangers to Hanno and Mago, who than were among the Bruſians: wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to come with their army, to lay ſiege to the towne: not doubtyng, but that one Marcus Attinius, the ruler of a ſmalle company of the Romaynes, left for the defence of the towne, wolde anon be brought to iſſue out, and to gyue them battaylle, vppon the truſt that he had in the yong men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the towne: whom before he had armed and inſtructed in the feates of warre, after the Roman facion. And they dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted not, but this ſort wold doo hym ſmall pleaſure, whan he ſhuld haue moſt nede of theym. The two capitains, hearing this glad tidinges, with ſpede entred the fieldes of the Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, diuydyng their company betwene theym. Hanno with the footemen, with baners diſplayed, in good aray, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the towne: Mago with all the horſmen abode in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley vnder certayn hylles that were nigh the towne. Attinius knowing only of the company of foteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, put his men in good aray, and with great courage iſſued out of the towne, nothing myſtruſtyng the myſchiefe wrought agaynſt hym within the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9127:69"/>
towne. The battaile was quicke on the part of the Romans: but the Thurines ſtode as men that gaue the lokynge on, not as enemies. Hanno with his men of pourpoſe gaue backe, to drawe the Romanes into the daunger of their horſmen. And whan they came nere the hilles, than they fierſly aſſayled the Romayns. and on the other ſyde, Mago with his horſemen came ſodainly and egrely vpon them: at the fyrſt encountring the Thurines fledde into their towne, as faſt as they coulde. The Romans for a ſeaſon mainteyned the battaile: but at the laſt, being conſtrained thereto, they alſo fledde towarde the towne: The traytours, that were cauſers of al this miſchief had gotten to the gate with their power, and againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng backe of the Thurines that fledde, they kept open the gates, and receyued them into the towne: but whan the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes came fleyng, alſo thinkyng to haue entred with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they cried: It is tyme nowe to ſhutte the gates: for els we ſhall lette the Carthaginenſes into the towne among our owne men, and ſo loſe all. Whervpon they ſhut theyr gates, and ſuffred the Romans to be ſlayne by their ennemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour. Only Attinius the capitayn, who gentilly had or dered them, while he was ruler there, they ſuffered to enter with a fewe with him: and incontinent they gaue him a ſhippe in the hauen, and badde hym ſaue him ſelfe by the ſea. After whoſe departynge they opened the gates, and receyued the Carthaginenſes.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe were the conſuls departed from Beneuentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaute Capua, thinkyng, that they ſhuld make their yere hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and honourable to them, yf they might wynne Capua, that was ſo noble and riche: and reuenge them of the iniuries, by them before done. Neuertheleſſe, to the intent the Beneuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes ſhulde not be lefte withoute ſuccours in theyr abſence, they ſent to Titus Gracchus, who was than in the cuntrey of the Lucans, commandyng hym, with his horſemen and other lyght footemen, to come to Beneuentum: leauynge with the Lucanes the reſte of his men, vnder ſome capitayn, whom he myght truſte.</p>
            <p>¶ The Lucans were than diuided, diuers townes were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vp to Anniball, and certaine abode vnder the Romaynes iurisdiction: of the which ſort the chiefe rular that yere was one Flauius, a Lucan. This Flauius ſodeynly was tourned
<pb facs="tcp:9127:70"/>
in his mynde to Anniball: and to obteyne his fauour, he ſente to Mago, that was than among the Brutians, to come ſpeke with hym. Whan they were mette, a compoſition was made betwene them, that if he coulde delyuer Gracchus, the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn of the Romain army, the Lucanes ſhulde be frendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in amitie with the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, and lyue after their own lawes. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought he Mago to a great couert, where he willed him, with a great numbre of men of armes to hyde hym: appoyntyng hym a tyme, at whiche he wolde bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Romaine capitayne. After this appoyntment he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went to Gracchus, to whom he ſhewed, that he had begunne ſecretely a great enterpryſe, whyche to brynge to effecte, he muſte haue his healpe and aſſyſtence. I haue (ſayde he) moued and perſwaded all the pryncis of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, that were gone to the amitie of Anniball, nowe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne agayne to the obedience of Rome. I haue declared vnto them the increaſe of the Romanes power, whiche dayly we may perceiue, and the decreaſe of the ſtrength of the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thaginenſes. And I bad them not myſtruſt the gentylnes of the Romains, whoſe nature we haue euer tryed to be meke and gentyll to ſuche as haue rebelled agaynſt them, vpon hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them made. With theſe my perſuaſions they be all contented to be reconciled: ſo that they may here you ſpeake the ſame, laying your right hand in theirs, as a pledge of your faithe, whervnto they may truſt. And I haue (ſayde he) vndertaken, that you ſhall doo it, and I haue appoynted them for that compoſition a ſecrete place, wel out of the way from our company, for feare of eſpies, yet not far from your campe: where, with fewe wordes, you may go through with them in this matter, and by this meane bryng all the Lucanes wholly vnder your iurisdiction.</p>
            <p>¶ Gracchus nothyng my ſtruſtynge diſceite and treaſon to be in his wordes, toke his officers and horſemen with him, al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and ſo rode to the place appointed, hauynge Flauius with hym as a guyde. So ſoone as they were come thyther, Mago with his army inuaded theym ſodaynly. And to make the treaſon more euident, Flauius incontinent ioyned him to the Carthaginenſes. Than was there plenty of dartes caſte at Gracchus, and his horſemen, and whan he ſawe noo other remedy, he alyght from his horſe, and bad his company doo
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9127:70"/>
the ſame, exhortynge them, ſyns they were but fewe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and vnarmed, in ſuche place, where they coulde by noo waye eſcape, that they wolde not dye lyke beaſtes vnreuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but that with noble hartes they ſhoulde aſſaile theyr ennemyes, and dye bathed and beſprynkled in the bloudde of theyr ennemies: whereby they ſhulde ende in moſte ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: But ſpecially aboue all thyng (ſayde he) lette euery of vs, ſeeke to ſlea that Lucane traytour Flauius, not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, but who ſo euer ſhall ſende that traytours ſoule to helle, before he dye hym ſelfe, he ſhall fynd the oblation ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, todoo hym moche comforte and ſolace. As ſoone as he hadde thus ſpoken, he threwe his clooke aboute his lefte arme, in ſtede of his ſhielde, and ranne vppon his ennemies, who with their dartes and weapons, ſlewe moſt part of the Romaines. And whan they ſawe Gracchus without helpe, they intended to take hym on lyue: but ſo ſoone as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued Flauius amonge his ennemies, he ranne through the thickeſt of them, with ſuche force, to haue ſlayne him, that they were there conſtrained to ſlea hym, or elles he had done them greate hurte.

Which loſſe cauſed the conſuls more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly to worke in all theyr procedynges afterwarde.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball heryng of this proſperous bataile of the Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his abſence, drew nere vnto Capua with his army, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that the Romanes ſhulde be moche leſſe able to indure

his power ioyned to the Campanes. Wherfore the third day after his comming, he diſplayde his baners, and ſet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in order and goodly aray, redy to fight. The Romayns likewiſe made theym redy, and the horſemen on bothe ſydes fought ſtrongly for a ſeaſon, tyll bothe partes perceiued a ſtrange army comming toward them: wherof nother of them were priuie. The truthe therof was, that C. Cornelius, than bearing the office of Queſtor at Rome, had taken the legio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whyche the yere before were vnder Sempronius, and was commyng to the ayde of the conſuls. but his commynge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen made as well the conſuls affraide, as Anniball: ſo that as it were by agreement, both partes withdrue to their cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, the Romans hauing ſomwhat more loſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cartha gine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes. Than the conſuls, wylling to draw Annibal away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Capua deuiſed the night folowing to depart awaye. Fuluius with his hoſt, went to diſtroy the fieldes of the Cumans. Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pius with his hoſt went to the Lucanes. Anniball in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hauing knowlege of their ſundry departing diuers wais, was a whiles in dout, whether of them he might folow: t the laſt he determined to folowe Appius, wherin he was moche deceiued. For he, leadinge hym a great compaſſe aboute the countreys, at his pleaſure, retourned againe an other way to Capua. Than fortune a whyle ſmylyng on Anniball, ſent hym ſuche chances, that he was a ſeaſon ſtayed in thoſe parties. One was the foliſhe hardy enterpriſe of one Centenius Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nula, a gentylman of goodly ſtature of body, and of noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of mynde, correſpondent to the ſame.</p>
            <p>¶ This Centenius, being broughte into the ſenate houſe by P. Cornelius Sulla, deſyred of the ſenatours, that he might haue deliuered him only .v. M. ſouldiours, with whoſe helpe he doubted not, but that with the knowlege that he had, both of the countreys and alſo of the crafty feates of his ennemy, he wold with the ſame ſubtiltie and policies deceiue Anniball, by whiche he before had deceiued the Romaynes. This his vnwiſe promiſe vnto them, was as vnwiſely beleued of them. And where he demaunded but .v. M. they gaue him .viii. M. men: and he in the countreys as he went gathered togyther almoſte as many mo, of ſuche as willyngly went with him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hope in his courage and promiſe. With this noumbre of men he came into the fieldes of the Lucanes, where Anniball
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9127:71"/>
had reſted hym and his company, wery of the chaſe of Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Claudius. Whan either of them ſawe others army, they incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t put their folke in aray. The matche was not equall nother of capitaines nor of ſouldiours: neuertheleſſe the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile indured more than two howres. Centenius perceiuinge his part to ſuffre the worſe, and fearing, leſte if he ſhulde lyue after his men were ſlayne, he ſhulde ſuffer great ſhame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy during his lyfe, for the loſſe of ſuche a numbre of men by his foliſhe enterpriſe: at the laſt willingly he entred the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt preaſe of his enemies, where he was ſhortly ſlayne, and than his men fledde on all partes, but they were ſo harde cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with horſemen, that of that great company, there eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſcant one thouſand.</p>
            <p>¶ One other happy cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fortune ſent to Annibal, as it were for a farewel or leue takyng of him, before ſhe thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the Romans: the occaſion therof was, that one Cneiꝰ Fuluius, bearing the office of pretor, lay than in Apulia with his hoſt, beſiegyng ſuche townes as before were come to the amitie of the Carthaginenſis. And in his buſynes he had ſoo well ſped, and was become ſo welthy and riche, bothe he and his men, with prayes whiche they had taken, that leauyng all good order of warre, or the peynfull purſuite thereof, they were growen into ſlouthe and ſluggyſſhe ydelnes. Of theyr vndiſcrete order the Appulians ſente woorde to Anniball by meſſangers. And he knowing by experience what wolde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the gouernance of an army by an vnwiſe capitane, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of late he had the triall by Centenius, with ſpede he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the coſtis of Apulia. Whan the Romains had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that their enemies approched, and were ouen at hande: they were all mynded to haue diſplayde their baners,. and to haue runne to batail without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The night folowing, Annibal perceiuing their great haſt to battaile, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded .iii. M. of his light men of warre, to lye priuily hyd in woodes buſhes &amp; couertes, next adioyning, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a ſigne or token, at what tyme they ſhulde iſſue out, and aſſaile their enmies. Than cauſed he Mago, with .ii. M. horſemen, to lye priuily in the wayes, by which he demed the Romans wolde flee after theyr diſcomfiture. Theſe thynges in the nyght tyme being wyſely diſpoſed, yarly in the morning he came with his hoſt into the fieldes, putting the reſt of his
<pb facs="tcp:9127:72"/>
men in goodly aray.</p>
            <p>¶ On the other ſide Fuluius the pretor made no tarying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moche inforced therto by the haſty wilfulnes of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours: Wherfore with ſuche aduyſement as they came into the fielde, with ſuche lyke aduyſement were the batayles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. For euery man went to what place him ſemed beſt, and choſe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with whom he wold be: and ſomtyme chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his place again at his pleaſure. The forward and the left wing were fyrſt ordered, and that all in length, and of a ſmall thykneſſe. The Tribunes cried to them, to ſet more ſtrength of men in the myddell of their battailes, or els their enemies myght eaſyly go through them with ſmall force at theyr plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But they were ſo wylfull and haſty, that they gaue noo eare to theyr wordes. By that tyme were the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come in good order redy to ioyne: at whoſe fyrſt cominge with great noiſe &amp; bruite, the Romains were put to the wors: whervpon the capitayn, ſeing all lyke to go to miſchiefe, toke his hors, and with two hundred horſemen with him, fled. The reſte, that abode, were almooſte all ſlayne. for of .xviii. M. of the company, there eſcaped not paſt .ii. M. alyue. The tentes and ſtuffe was alſo taken by the Carthaginenſes, whiche was a good pray. The tydinges of theſe great ſodayn loſſes were brought to Rome, whiche cauſed the citie to be in great feare and mournyng. Neuertheleſſe by cauſe bothe the Conſulles, with their armies were ſafe, and did ſomwhat proſper in their affayres, they toke the more comforte to theym. And incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynent ſent meſſangers to the Conſuls, wylling them to ſerch for all ſuch as were eſcaped at theſe two battailes, &amp; that they ſhuld be gathered togither, and called vnto them: leſt either for feare or for diſpaire, they wold yeld them to their enmies, whiche thyng with all diligence they dyd execute.</p>

Than ſent they to Sueſſula for Claudius Nero the Pretor, who leauyng a ſmall garriſon there, came hym ſelfe to theym to Capua with all his power.

Whervppon the workes of the dyche were ended, and the citie fully encloſed.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball, deſyrous to ſuccour his great frendes of Capua, left al his heuy cariage among the Brucians, and with a great numbre of choſen horſemen and light fotemen, haſted thither as faſte as he might, and after his hooſte came .xxxiii. of his elephantes. With this army he came to the valey that was vnder a mountayn adioynyng to Capua, called Tifata, er the Romans had any knowlege of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Than ſent he ſpies
<pb facs="tcp:9127:73"/>
to the Romayns hoſte to Capua, commaundynge them, ſoo ſoone as he ſhulde gyue them battaile on his parte, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar and Mago, with the horſemen and garriſon of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, aſſemblynge alſo all the power of the citizens, ſhoulde ſodaynely iſſue oute of the citie: and with force aſſayle their ennemies. This diuiſe of Anniball was executed with ſoo ſodayne crye and clamoure, that the Romaynes were in greate feare and daunger. Neuertheles with as great ſpede as they coulde, they prepared their battayles, and dyuyded their people. Appius Claudius wente to withſtande the Campanes, and Fuluius wente agaynſte Anniball. Claudius was ſtronge inough for his ennemies, but Fuluius was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled of the Carthaginenſes and Spaniardes. One co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or legion of his men were driuen backe, and than a great companye of Spanyardes, with thre elephantes, had broken the myddell warde of the Romaynes, and were come to the trench of the campe, redy to enter into the tentes and campe of their enmies. Whan Fuluius ſawe, what daunger his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and campe were in, he cried to Q. Nanius, and other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty capitaines, exhorting them to aſſaile that company of Spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niardes, that fought at the diche: ſhewyng them what danger all was in, onleſſe they might ſone be confounded, which was eaſy inough to be done, ſens there was of them no greatter a number. Nanius was a ſtrong man, and of a huge ſtature. And whan he hearde the conſulles exhortation, anone he toke the ſtanderde from hym that bare it, and commaundyng his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, boldly to take parte with hym, he ſette furthe towarde the Spanyardes, with a great courage. As ſone as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes ſawe hym drawe nere, they threwe plentye of dartes at hym; and beganne violently to aſſayle him. But he nother beynge ſtayde with the multitude of his ennemies, nor with the dartes that were caſte at him, with great force went ſtylle forwarde, tyl by the helpe of Marcus Attilius, Portius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, and other, they had ſlain the elephantes, and made great ſlaughter alſo of Spaniardes.</p>
            <p>¶ On the other part, the Campanes were dryuen back, with the garriſon alſoo of Numidians and Carthaginenſes: ſoo that the battaile was ſtronge euen at the very gate of Capua, that was towarde the ryuer of Vulturnus. This gate was garniſhed with Croſſebowes dartes and other ſuche ingyns,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9127:73"/>
wherby many of the Romayns were wounded by the ſhot out of the towre of the gate. Amonge other, the Conſul Appius Claudius was ſoore hurt on the breaſt vnder the left ſhulder. Neuertheleſſe the citizens with their helpers were driuen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the citie with great ſlaughter and loſſe of theyr company. Anniball ſeing the ſlaughter of his Spaniardes, and that the Romaynes ſo manfully defended theyr campes, he cauſed his people to withdrawe them, and made the horſemen to abyde hyndermoſte for the defence of the footemen, yf their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies happed to chaſe them. The Romaines were very egre, and wolde haue folowed them in the chaſe, had not Flaccus cauſed to ſounde the retreate.</p>
            <p>¶ In this batayle Anniball wrought one crafty poynt, he ſent dyuers of his men forth, that coulde ſpeake the latine tunge, into dyuers partes of the hooſte of the Romaynes, whyche ſhulde in the conſuls name and behalfe declare, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne campes were taken and ſpoyled. Wherfore he wylled euery man to ſaue hym ſelfe by fleing to the next mountayns, ſens by lenger tarying, the greater ſhuld be theyr loſſe. This crafty deceite made many of them amaſed: but at the laſte it was eſpied, to the great ſlaughter of their ennemies.</p>
            <p>¶ After this battaile the Romaynes kept them in their cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and ſo ſtraightly beſieged the citie, that Anniball ſeinge he could no more drawe them furth to bataile, nother through the campes of the Romaines haue any way to enter into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua, fearyng leſte his vitayles ſhuld be cut from hym and his hoſte: he determined to depart from thens. And than he y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magyned, that he wolde go towarde Rome, not doubtynge, but whan the Romayn capitaynes dyd perceyue Rome theyr head citie to be in any daunger, that either one or both wolde leaue Capua, and come to the defence therof. And than theyr powers being diuided, bothe partes ſhoulde be the weaker: and he truſted, that either he or the Campanes ſhulde haue a fayre day of ſome of them. One thynge troubled hym ſoore, leſt the Campanas ſeing his departyng from them, wolde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent yelde the citie to the Romayns. Wherfore by fayre wordes and great giftes, he had gotten one of Numidia to go with his letters through the campes of the Romains, as one that was runne away from the Carthaginenſes army: &amp; whan
<pb facs="tcp:9127:74"/>
he ſhuld come to the further part of the hoſt towarde the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, than ſecretly to enter into Capua, and deliuer his letters, which were full of comfort, declaring his departyng to be for theyr profite, to thintent onely to withdrawe their ennemies from Capua, to defende their owne citie, bydding them not to diſpayre, but to take pacience for a ſeaſon, truſtyng ſhortly to loſe them of the daunger they were in. Sone after he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his hoſte, and paſſed the ryuer of Vulturnus, taking the way towarde Rome. His commynge cauſed great heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the citie. The ſenatours conſulted, what was beſte for to be done in this daungerous caſe. At length it was agreed, that Q. Fuluius ſhulde come from Capua, with a certayn le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions with him, leauing his felowe at the ſiege with a numbre ſufficient for that purpoſe. Q. Fuluius, hauing this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, toke with him .xv. M. fotemen, and one thouſand horſe men, and folowed Anniball as ſpedily as he could. Now was Anniball come within .iii. miles of Rome, where he pitched his tentes, and made his campe on a riuer ſide. And ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came Quintus Fuluius Flaccus into Rome with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and conſulted with the ſenators of the affaires that were to be done touching their enmies. Than toke Annibal .ii. M. horſemen with hym, and camme to the walles and gates of Rome, riding from the gate called <hi>Porta Collina,</hi> to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Hercules, viewynge the ſituation of the citie, and the ſtrength of the walles. This bolde and hygh mynde of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball, in ſo doing, Fuluius Flaccus coulde not ſuffer: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent ſent furth a greate numbre of horſemen, who with force droue their enemies to their campe. The next day An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball came into the fielde with his hoſt in good aray, redy to gyue battaile. And Flaccus hauinge with hym the two newe conſuls, that of late were choſen, with their powers, made hym redy alſo to battaile. Thus whan bothe partes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go togither, abidynge the chaunce of fortune, whether of them ſhulde be maiſter of the noble citie of Rome: there came ſodainly on them ſo vehement a ſtorme of raine and haile togither, that both the partes were faine to withdrawe them to their Campes. The nexte daye they were lykewiſe redye to ioyne battaile, whan a like ſtorme alſo departed theym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. And after theyr departure incontynente the wether waxed verye bryght and fayre, and all the wyndes ceaſſed,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9127:74"/>
whiche euyl chances toke away the hartes and courage from Anniball and his companye, for euer to enioye the citie of Rome. Wherfore hauynge no further hope therof, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe in haſt to the Brucians: And the conſul Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Fuluius returned to Capua to his felowe.</p>

               </gap>yee towarde vs, let vs conſyder, that although Anniball commyng to our ſuccours, had almoſte wonne theyr campes, ſayne many of theyr men, and put them in great ieopardy of loſing all that they had: yet all that ieoperdous peryll of loſſe neuer coulde moue theym to remoue theyr ſiege. Afterward whan he had paſſed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Vulturnus, bournynge the fieldes of Calenus theyr fath full frendes: yet coulde not the hurtes of them call the capitaynes from our myſerable ſiege. Ye than he cauſed his baners to be diſplayd before the walles of the citie of Rome, ſaying: that onles they wold leaue Capua, he wold take their high citie of Rome from them. Yet wolde they not leaue the ſiege of Capua, beares, wulues, and all wyld beaſtes, be they in neuer ſo great a rage and fury, if a man goo to their caues, where theyr yong whelpes lye: anone they wyll leaue al that they are aboute, and runne ſtreighte to the defence of theyr yonge: but the furyous Romaynes, whan Rome was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with theyr enemies, nother for theyr wyues and their chyldren (whoſe lamentable wepinges myght be heard almoſte hither) nother for their houſes, the temples of their goddis, nor for feare of violating the Sepultures of theyr auncetours, coulde be withdrawen from the ſiege of Capua, ſo deſyrous they be to execute on vs greuous punyſhement: And ſo ſore they do thyrſt to drynke of our bludde. And but reaſon: for happily we ſhulde haue done lykewyſe to them, yf fortune had deſerued vs. Wherfore ſens it is the pleaſure of the goddis, that nedes I muſte dye: yet wylle I chuſe me a deathe, bothe honeſt and gentyll: wherby I wyll eſcape the tormentes and diſpites that myne ennemies truſte to put me vnto. Whan Fuluius and Claudius ſhall ſolempnely with triumph enter into Rome, I wyl not bounden be drawen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as a ſpectacle or wondryng ſtocke, and after put in pryſon, or being tyed to a poſte, ſuffer my body to be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and at laſt haue my head ſtryken from my body with the axe of Rome, nother will I lyue to ſe my cuntrey diſtroied &amp; bourned, or to ſee the noble matrons and maidens of Capua rauiſhed and defouled. In the beginnyng of the flouriſhynge of the citie of Rome, the Romains diſtroyed the citie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, and threwe it downe to the grounde: yet had they theyr originall from the ſame citie, what trowe ye than they wyl do

to Capua, whiche they hate more than they doo Carthage? Therfore frendes, ſo many of you as be deſyrous to dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſe theſe ſo many and ſo ſpiteful miſeries, come this day to dyner with me, your meate is alredy dreſſed: and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be well filled with wyne and good meates, a cup of drynke, that I wyll fyrſt drinke my ſelfe, ſhall be borne about to euery one of you: and that drynke ſhall delyuer the body from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the mynde from rebukes, the eies and the eares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſyght and hearyng of all cruell diſpites that be prepared for people that are ouercome. After whan we ſhall be deade, our ſeruauntes ſhall be redy to throwe our bodies into great fyres made for the purpoſe, there to be bourned, and ſo ſhall we neuer come into the handes of our enemies. This is the onely honeſt and free way to dye, wherby our ennemies ſhall meruaile and wonder at our noble courage. And Annibal ſhal therby well perceyue, that he hath forſaken and betrayde his valyant and faithfull felowes.</p>
            <p>¶ This oration of Vibius was heard and wel alowed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mo than had hartes to folowe it, or put it in execution. for the more part of the ſenatours ſaid, that they had oft tymes in warres had experience of the pitie and gentylneſſe of the Romaines ſhewed to their ennemies in ſuche extremitie, not myſtruſtyng, but they ſhulde fynde them mercyfull nowe to them, vpon humble requeſt to them made: and thervpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſend legatis to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul, to yeld them vp Capua.</p>
            <p>¶ Vibius Virius went home to his houſe to dyner, whome xxvii. ſenatours folowed, where they dyned, and drunke ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wyne, to the intent they might haue the leſſe feelinge of the laſt dredefull drynke whan it came. At the laſt they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the poyſon, and went from the table, taking eyther o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the handes, and louingly enbraſyng one an other, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their owne deathes, with the diſtruction of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Some remained there, and died, and were bourned in the fyres made for that intent: ſome went home to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and there made their ende: ſo that before the towne was deliuered to the Romaines, none of them were left on lyue.</p>
            <p>¶ The next day the gates were opened, and the Romaines ſuffered to enter. Than were all the gates kepte by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that no man ſhuld go furth, and firſt all the armour and wepons were brought to the Romain capitain: than were the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9127:76"/>
Carthaginenſes of the garriſon taken and put in priſon. The ſenatours were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to go to the conſuls, than being in their tentes, from whens ſuch as were moſt conſenting to the receiui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Annibal, were ſent to ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry priſons .xxv. to Cales, and .xxviii. to Theanus, vntil it was agreed, what puniſhment they ſhuld haue. Their golde and ſyluer was brought in, and deliuered to the officers, called Queſtores. Claudius the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull was moch inclined to take the ſenators to mercy: Fuluius on the other ſide wold haue them ſuffer, in example of other rebelles and traytours. Wherefore Claudius remitted all thing to the iugement of the ſenate of Rome, and ſent thither to knowe their pleaſure therin. Whervpon Fuluius, fearing leſt he ſhuld be ſtayed of his purpoſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the tribunes, with .ii. M. horſemen, to be redy to ride with him at the third blaſt of a trumpet. With this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of horſmen in the night he departed from the army, and by that it was day light, came to Theanus, where cauſyng the ſenatours of Capua, there being priſoners, to be brought before him, incontinent be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be violently ſcourged with roddes, and after to haue their heades ſtriken of. From thens, as faſt as he might he hied to Cales, and there likewiſe ſat vpon the iugement of the other ſenatours of Capua. but whiles they were going to execution, one came from the ſenate of Rome, riding in great haſt, with letters, willing him to ſtay the iudgement and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the puniſhment of the Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pane ſenators. Than Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius iudging the letters to be writen for that intent, neuer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcloſed them, but put them in his boſom, ſaying to the officers that they ſhuld procede quickly to the execution accordinge to the lawe: So were they alſo whipped, and after had their heades ſtryken of. Than the conſull drewe furth his letters, and redde them, ſaying they came very late, to let the thynge that was alredy done. From Cales he returned to Capua and there put diuers other in priſon, beſide many of the citie that were ſold. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there great debate in the ſenate at Rome whether the citie of Capua ſhuld be burned and vtterly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, in exaumple of other rebelles or not. Moch it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued theym ſoo to doo, for that it was a greate and a ſtronge citie, and a very nere neyghbour vnto them: whych if it ſhuld be an ennemy agayne to Rome, as it late was, ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye dyſquiete the Romaynes. Neuertheleſſe in concluſyon,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:77"/>
conſidering the fertilitie of the grounde, whiche was the beſt of all Italy, they agreed to vſe it to their profit, hauing plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laborers &amp; other to manure and tyl the groundes, and the houſes to be inhabited with rude people, and menne of handy craftes: ſo that it ſhuld be a citie of no body politike, nor haue ſenatours, or other commune counſell or rulars, but onely a iudge yerely to be ſent from Rome, to miniſter iuſtice among them. By this meane was the citie preſerued from vtter dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the profite therof, with the fieldes adioyning, employed to the common profite of the Romains.</p>

            <p>¶ While the warres of Sicilia &amp; about Capua were brought to this good paſſe, Cn. Scipio and Publius his brother, were as buſy in Spayne, but not with like ſucceſſe. They had cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

men of warre of Celtiberia. The power of Carthage was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in .iii. armies, gouerned by thre capitaines, Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and Mago, theſe two capitaines lay .v. dayes iourney from the Romaine legions: the thyrd, whiche was Aſdruball, the ſonne of Amilcar, the auncient capitayne of the Carthaginenſes in that countreye, laye at Anniturgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, more neerevnto the Romaines: and hadde in pourpoſe the ſommer folowynge, to paſſe the mountaynes, to conueye his armye to Anniball. This his pourpoſe to lette, the two Scipios thought fyrſte to aſſayle hym aloone from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not doubtyng, but they were ſtronge inough ſo to doo. Their greatteſt feare was, leſt whan they had ouercome him, that the other Haſdruball and Mago, hearyng therof, wolde flee into the mountaynes and ſtraytes with their power, and ſo prolonge the warres in Spayn. Wherfore to make an ende of all theyr trouble at ones, they concluded to part their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in twayne, P.

With theſe mindes they ſet furth togither toward their ennemies. Cn. Scipio whan he came to Aniturgium, reſted with his company in the ſyght of his enemies, hauyng a riuer betwene hym and them: his brother went furthe, as it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed betwene them. Aſdruball perceiuing the numbre of the Romayns to be but ſmall: and that all their ſtrengthe was in ſtrangers late hyred, knowing the faccion of the people, how vntrue and vnſtable they were: by the meane of Spaniardes, that coulde ſpeake the language, for great ſummes of money he corrupted the princis &amp; rulars of them: ſo that they were agreed to departe home with theyr hole power. They were not deſyred or hyred to vndertake the warres with Aſdrubal againſt the Romaines, but onely to depart without fighting. Whervnto they were ſone intreated, partly for that they had as large wages as though they ſhuld haue foughten: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne for that they were gladde to retourne home to theyr cuntreys and frendes, auoyding the danger of warre. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſodaynely they with their baners and caryage departed. The Romaines meruayling what this ſodaine chaunge ment, enquired of them the cauſe of their departure. They anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:78"/>
they were ſent for home to defende theyr owne cuntrey whiche was oppreſſed alſo with warre. Other anſwere could they none gette: nother were the Romaynes able to kepe them with force.

There was alſo tydinges brought to Scipio, that one Indibilis, with ſeuen thouſande, and fyue hundred Sueſſanes, was at hande, commynge to the healpe of the Carthaginenſes: whoſe army beinge ioyned to the other, he knewe he ſhulde be more ſtraightly encloſed. Wherfore, compelled by neceſſitie to ſerche the compaſſe of his wytte, he determyned ſecretely to take the greatter part of his armye to meete with this Indibilis in the nyghte, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendynge, where ſoo euer he mette with hym, to gyue hym battaylle, he lefte Titus Fonteius, with a certayne with hym, to keepe the campe. And goynge on his waye aboute mydnyght he met with Indibilis and ſodaynly aſſayled hym. There was a fyerſe conflycte for a ſeaſon: And by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne ſettynge on theym, the Romaynes hadde putte theym to flyghte with greatte ſlaughter, hadde not the Numidian horſemenne, who alwayes awayted on the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9127:78"/>
where ſoo euer they wente) on bothe partes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly aſſayled theym: yet Scipio ſoo pryuily was in the nyght departed, that he hadde thought therby to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giled the Numidians watchemen. Than the battail being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued agayn, Mago and Aſdruball with their hoſtes folowing after, were at theyr backes: ſo that the Romaynes knew not to whiche were beſt to tourne them. Scipio ſtille comforted and exhorted his men, and euer where the battaile was moſte ſtronge, thyther went he lyke a noble and valiant gouernour, tyll at the laſt hym ſelfe was thyrſt into the ryght ſyde with a ſpeare, ſo that he fell dead from his hors. Whan the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes ſawe the Romayne capitayne falle, incontinent they ranne abrode in all the partes of the fielde ioyfully cryinge, Scipio the capitayne of the Romaines is ſlayne. The fame wherof gaue hart to the Carthaginenſes, and cauſed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes to flee. but in the flyght there were mo ſlayne than in the batail. The Numidian horſmen were ſo fierſe in the chaſe, and the footemen hauyng lyght harneis were almoſt as ſwyft as the horſes. So that yf the nyght had not come on theym, fewe or none had eſcaped. The Carthaginenſes after this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſlept not nor ſtayde, but to folowe theyr good occaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered, incontinent toke theyr horſes, and went to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Haſdruball, the ſonne of Amilcar, not doutyng of good ſpede there alſo. After that both theyr powers were mette togyther, there was great ioye made betweene the capitey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bothe for theyr metynge, and alſo for the newes of theyr late victory.</p>
            <p>¶ On the other ſyde the Romayns were ſtryken with feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful penſifenes, not for any knowlege that they had of the loſſe of their company, for there was ſuch ſpede made by theyren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that worde thereof coulde not ſo ſoone be broughte them: but their feare was as it were through an inwarde and ſecrete iudgement in theyr hartes, of ſomme euyll chaunce that was happed vnto theym. Agayne Cn. Scipio ſeing the hoſte of his ennemyes encreaſed, by the commynge of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go and Aſdruball, meruailed howe they ſhulde conuey theyr armye thyther ſo ſoone without battayle, onleſſe his brother were ſlayne. He meruayled alſoo, that his brother, nother dydde lette their commynge thyther, nother yet dydde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere folowynge theym. For he knewe, yf he were on lyne,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:79"/>
he wolde make haſte to come and ioyne his army vnto his. In this great trouble of mynde, he thoughte to withdrawe hym as moche as he myght. Wherefore in the nyght he was gone a good ſpace of grounde, but in the dawnyng of the daye, the Numidians were ware of their departing, and folowed with their horſes, ſo that long before nyght they ouertoke theym, aſſayling them now on the one ſide, now on the other, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyme behynde them: but euer Scipio cauſed theym to keepe good aray, and to go euer forewarde in their fightynge, to be out of the daunger of the footemen of their enemies that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them: but the horſemen ſo vexed them on all partes, that they could not go farre. Wherfore Scipio gathered his ſmall company vp to a lytell hyll, the beſt that he coulde there eſpy for his adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. There he toke this order. theyr ſtuffe and cariage was brought into the myddell of the hoſt, and the horſemen ſette about the ſame: without them were the foote men, who ſaued the other from the inuaſion of the Numidian horſemen, tyl the reſt of the Carthaginenſes were come. But than Scipio ſeing hym ſelfe ſo vnable to reſiſt .iii. capitaynes and their great hoſtes, began to diuiſe, howe he might by any meanes caſt a trenche about his campe, or make ſome hedge to defende them from the inuaſions of theyr enemies: but tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the hyll ſo bare, and the grounde ſo ſtony, that no buſhes or thornes coulde there be gathered, nor turues dygged, or any trenche made: and the hyll it ſelfe was ſo flatte, that they coulde by no maner of way let the commyng vp of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Than Scipio to make ſome ſhewe of a defence aboute the campe, deuiſed to lay his packes and groſſe cariage in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the campe one vpon an other, and thervppon he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the packſaddels and other fardels to be tyed: wherby he rayſed the walles of his campe of a good height.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan the hoſtes of the Carthaginenſes were come, they aſcended that ſmall hyll with lyttel peyne: but than ſeing that ſtraunge kynde of fortifieng the campe, which they had neuer before ſene, they were amaſed, and ſtayde for a ſeaſon. The capitaynes perceiuyng theyr ſodayne ſtoppe and wondryng, cried on al partes to them, ſaying, that it was great ſhame for them to be ſo longe or they coulde plucke downe and deface ſuche a fond deuiſe and mockery, wherwith children and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wold not ſo long haue ben ſtayed. Go to it therfore with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9127:79"/>
courage (ſayd they) for your ennemies lye lurkyng behynde thoſe packes. With theſe rebukes of the capitaines, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to enter on all partes. And though a greate whyle they were lette and troubled therabout, at the laſt in diuers partis they entred, ſo few in numbre could no longer endure againſt ſo many. The campe was wonne, and many were ſlain, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Cn. Scipio the noble capitayne was one, a good number ſledde into the woodes, that were next vnto them, and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and came into the tentes of Publius Scipio, whyche than were kept by T. Fonteius. Thus were bothe the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne and capytaynes of the Romaynes in Spayne, ſlayne within the ſpace of .xxx. dayes: whoſe death was greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, both at Rome and alſo in Spain. And it was thought at their death, that the hole army of the Romaines in Spayn was vtterly brought to confuſyon, and that countrey thereby brought out of the Romaynes handes.</p>

And that was Lucius Martius, the ſonne of Septinius, a freſhe yonge man and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. This Martius hadde longe ben in the warres vnder C.

Whervpon he incontinent applied him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:9127:80"/>
buſyly to make ſure theyr campe, and alſo to make good prouiſyon for vitayles of all ſortes. To whoſe pleaſure and commaundement all the men of the hoſte gladly obeyed: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, whan they hearde, that Haſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, was at hande with his army, myndynge to dyſtroye vtterly all the Romaynes that were lefte: and alſo whan they ſawe theyr newe capitayne, makynge redy his people, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncyng his ſtanderdes: they than remembryng theyr olde noble capytaines, and the great power, wherwith they were wont to go to all batayles, coulde not forbeare to wepe and lament theyr myſhappe, in ſuche wyſe, that nother theyr pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty capitaynes, nor yet Martius hym ſelfe, myght appeaſe them: yet dyd they ſometime rebuke theyr feminine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable wepinges, ſometyme ſtyrre them to defende them ſelues and their countrey, and alſo to reuenge the deathe of theyr olde noble capitaynes of late ſlayne. Whyle they thus were ſpendyng the tyme vnprofytably, theyr ennemies were at hande, and redye to aſſaile them, and to enter into their campes, but than the Romaines, tournyng their teares to a furious rage, in haſte toke their armure and weapons, and not only defended the entries of their campe, but alſo iſſued out fierſely, and ranne on their ennemies, whiche kepte no very good aray, ſo littell they myſtruſted any ſuch reſiſtence. This ſodayne iſſuing out of them cauſed the Carthaginenſes to be ſtriken with a feare, and alſo to meruaile, howe the Romaine hoſte was ſo ſhortly encreaſed, whiche ſo late was almooſte wholly ſlayn and put to vtterance. They muſed alſo of their ſodayne courage and hardyneſſe, and what newe capytaine they myght haue to truſte on, the two Scipios beinge ſlaine. In that feare and dout they beganne ſomwhat to giue backe, and than the Romaines folowed vppon them, ſoo that they were conſtrayned to flee, and in that flyght many of them hadde bene ſlayne, or elles the folowers hadde bene putte to greatte hurte and dyſpleaſure, by theyr faſte purſuite, hadde not Martius hym ſelfe ſounde the retreate, and halfe agaynſte theyr wylles ſtayed theym frome the chaſe, and broughte theym backe to theyr tentes, beynge ſtyll hotte, fyerſe, and deſyrous, by ſlaughter to reuenge theym on their enenmies. The Carthaginenſes fledde faſte for a ſeaſon: but at the laſte, ſeynge noo manne to folowe them, thought
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9127:80"/>
that they for feare durſte noo longer purſue theym. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efore they made noo more ſuche haſte, but wente ſoftely to theyr campe, and whanne they were come thither, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo regarded not greatly the good watche and kepynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but lefte all thinges negligently and vnſurely, nothynge myſtruſting their ennemies that were at hande, for that they demed them to be but the remenaunt and leauynges of two hoſtes lately beaten, nowe beynge gathered togyther again. This neglygence of the Carthaginenſes was knowen to Martius by eſpies. Wherefore he (at the fyrſte apparance) ſemed rather raſſhely than boldly to enterpryſe the night fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowinge to inuade theym in theyr tentes and fielde, thinking it more eaſye for him to wynne the campe of Haſdruball a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, beinge ſodainly taken and vnprouided, than he ſhoulde be able to defende his owne campe and fielde, if he taried tyll the .iii. capitaines of the Carthaginenſes, and theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inies, were ioyned togither agayne, Neuertheleſſe before he wold ſodainly and in the night time enterpriſe ſo high a feate, he thought fyrſt to make his companye priuie therof, and alſo to make vnto them an oration, whiche he began in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>¶ The greatte loue that I haue euer borne vnto oure good capytaynes (louynge ſouldiours) as welle whan they were onlyue, as alſo nowe they are deade, and our preſente for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at this tyme is ſufficient to perſwade any man, that this greatte authoritie and rule, which of your goodnes, ye haue gyuen me, is both weighty and full of care and troubles. For although my mynde be ſore troubled and diſquieted, that it can almoſte at no tyme fynde any comfort or conſolation, but onely whan feare dryueth away the ſorowes thereof: yet in my dolour, I onely am conſtrayned to comforte and relieue you all of your ſorowes. Neyther whan I am deuyſynge, by what meanes I may ſaue and preſerue the leauynges of the two Romaines hoſtes, for the wealthe of the countrey, can I at any tyme be quitte and ridde of my ſorowes. For euen thanne the two Scipios bothe by daye and by nyghte, doo vexe and trouble me: ſommetyme in dreames they appeere vnto me, and many tymes they awake me out of my ſlepes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding me, not to leaue them, nor yet their noble ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, nor the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth vnreuenged. And for that intent, they will me to folow the rules and diſcipline,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:81"/>
that they haue taught me: And as (whiles they were lyuing) there was no man more obedient to their commandement tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was: ſo lykewyſe, now they ar departed, I ſhall always be as glad to do that thyng, which I do ſuppoſe they wold haue done, yf they werehere with vs lyuing. And I wold ye ſhuld not thynke it beſt (worthy warriours) to mourne and weepe for theym, as though they were cleane deade, ſens they lyue perpetually through the noble fame of their honorable actes: but whan ſo euer ye ſhall, going to battayle, remembre any of them, I wolde haue you ſo vahantly fight, as though ye ſawe them ſetting furthe before you with baners diſplayde, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortyng you to wyn honour. Such an imagination cauſed you yeſterday ſo manfully to vanquyſſhe and put to flyght youre enemies. Wherfore I am moche deſyrous to proue, whether you, that were ſo hardy for your owne pleaſure, dare now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake as moche at the deſyre and exhortation of me youre capitayne. For yeſterday, whan I called you backe from the chaſe of your enmies, I dyd it not to plucke downe your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes, or to quench your noble courage: but only to deferre the ſame to your more and greatter honour, and alſo better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie: to the intente that you beinge prepared therfore, may aſſayle theym vnpurueyde for the ſame, that you armed, may take them vnarmed and a ſlepe. Our enemies thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng leſſe, than to beinuaded of vs in their campe, whome they accompt as people beſieged within our owne campe, let vs nowe therfore enterpryſe that, whiche no man will thinke, that we dare enterpryſe. And that ſhall be founde moſte eaſy, that ſemed moſte harde to be compaſſed: I my ſelfe wyll be your guide in the dead of the night, and leade you ſo ſecretly, and with ſuche ſilence, that we wyll be within theyr campe, er they ſhalbe ware of our comming. I am aſcertained, that they kepe no watche nor order. Their campe ſhall we wyn at the fyrſt brunt.: And than let me ſee you make the ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them, that you intended yeſterday to haue made, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt your wylles I called you back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the purſuit of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherwith ye were than very angry. This enterpriſe I know to be very great and hardy: but in ſuche neceſſitie ſuche cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are beſt. For whan occaſion is offred, and oportunitie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, it muſte be taken: or els it wyll flee away without reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie. One of theyr armies is here at hande, and two other
<pb facs="tcp:9127:81"/>
are not farre henſe. Nowe yf we aſſayle this one hoſte, there may we fynde oportunitie and haue ſome equall matche. Ye haue alredy yeſterday aſſayed bothe your owne ſtrength and theyrs: but in caſe we delay it, beinge contented with yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days honour, it is ieoperdy, leſt all the capitayns, with their powers come togither: and than howe ſhall we be able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein the power of thre armies with their gouernours, whom Cn. Scipio, with his army was not able to withſtand? as by diuyding their hoſtes our two noble capitaynes were ſlayne: lykewyſe our enemies beinge diuided &amp; ſeuered, may by vs be oppreſſed. Other way is there none for vs to take nowe: but only to loke for the oportunitie of this next night. Wherfore in the name of the goddis go ye now to your reſtes, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe your bodies, that whan I call on you, you being ſtrong and luſty, maye enter into the campe of your ennemies, with the ſame hertes and courage, that of late ye defended your owne Campe.</p>
            <p>¶ This newe counſaile of the newe capitayn was wel heard, and ſo moche the more ioyfully receiued, by howe moche the acte ſemed to be more bolde and hardy. Wherfore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all thynges in a redyneſſe for the departure, and reſted them ſelues the reſt of the day, and a good part of the night. Than Martius cauſed them to be called vp, and ſette theym ſecretely on the way forwarde, aboute thre of the clocke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mydnyght. Than was there an other armye of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes ſeuen myles beyonde the campe of Haſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and in the myddes of that waye there was a holowe valeye, and therin a lyttell woode. Into this woode had Martius ſent an embuſhement of Romaine horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to receyue ſuche as fledde frome the fyrſte campe, and wolde eſcape to the other. And whan he demed the ſaid em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhement to be come thither, he with the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, went to the next campe, where fynding no watche nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, they entred the tentes as eaſily as they might haue done into theyr owne. Than ſodainly they blew vp their trum pettes, and made great clamour and noyſe: ſome ſlewe their ennemies ſlepyng, ſome ſet the tentes on fyre, many kept the entre or gates of the campe, that none ſhulde iſſue out. Thus with ſodayne noyſe, fyre, and ſlaughter, the other were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed, that they wyſt not what to do. They that fledde to the
<pb facs="tcp:9127:82"/>
gates were there receiued of armed men and ſlaine, whan they perceiued the gates ſo hepte, many to ſaue their liues lep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the dyches or cloſures of the campe, thynking to flee to the next campe of the Carthaginenſes, and they were alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Romayn embuſhement and ſlayne, ſo that none eſcaped. And if any had eſcaped, they could not haue brought word of the newes to the other campe, before the Romaines came theym ſelues: ſuche ſpede they made to go to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d campe, after they had ſo ſlaine and oppreſſed them of the firſt fielde. Thus in the breake of the day, they came to the ſecond campe, where they found all thinges more vnready, then in the fyrſte: ſome were gone forthe for woode, ſome on for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge, ſome for vytailes, many walked vp and downe before the gate of the campe vnarmed, many were layed downe to take theyr reſte: the Romaynes, beynge yet fyers of theyr late victory, ſlewe fyrſte ſuche as made reſyſtence at the entre of the campe, and after they entred and made great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. With this great noyſe, many aroſe and armed them, and came to the defence of their fyelde, and thereby the battayle for a ſeaſon was cruel and ſtronge: but as ſone as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the freſhe blodde on the Romayns ſhyeldes, whyche was a ſygne of the deathe of their companye, they were ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſuche feare, that they fledde as many as myght ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wayes, ſo that nyght and morninge Martius vanquyſhed ii. of the hoſtes of the Carthaginenſes, and flewe .xxxvii. M. men, and .i. M. and .viii. C. were taken. He wanne alſo their tentes, wherein was a ryche praye. Amonge other thynges there he founde a helmette of ſyluer, waying .C. xxxviii. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therevppon was grauen the Image of Haſdruball, the ſonne of Amylcar: whiche helmet was ſent to the ſenate of Rome, and kepte long after in the Capitolie, for an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or remembrance of the victory of Martius. And after his tyme it was called Martius helmet, vnto the tyme of the burning of the Capitolye. After theſe great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and loſſes, bothe gyuen and taken on bothe partes, they ceaſſed warryng for a whyle in Spayne, neyther party beyng haſtye to put al in ieopardye, tylle they were ſure of more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</p>

This nyght al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Haſdruball beſtowed, in ſending furth many mo of his hoſt, &amp; more of his cariage then he dyd the nyght before. The next metyng alſo was in lyke maner in vayne, the tyme waſted and ſpente in deuiſes of couenauntes: and euer in the nyght he ſent of his footemen and ſtuffe out of daunger.</p>
            <p>¶ Thus in reaſonyng and debatyng, dyuerſe dayes were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, tyll all his footemen and cariage were eſcaped. And when a great parte of his hoſt was by this illuſion eſcaped, then began Haſdruball more to ſtaye, and be ſtyffe in the agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of couenauntes, in ſo muche that he began to diſſent from dyuers artycles, whervnto he had before aſſented. For as his feare was leſſed, his faythe alſo decreſſed. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there appered a great and darke myſte vpon the ground, as wel on the hilles as on the valeys, whiche ſerued wel Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball for his purpoſe. For he, thinking then his good houre to be come, ſent to Nero the conſull, aduertyſing hym, that the ſame day was, and euer had ben kepte bye holy and ſacred amonge the Carthaginenſes: ſo that in the ſame it was not lawfull for hym, to trauayle about any buſyneſſe. Wherfore he deſyred the communication to be deferred tyll the daie fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowyng. The conſull yet thynkyng no fraude or deceite to be in the meſſage, agreed thervnto. And then Haſdruball with ſpede iſſued out of the ſtrayte with the reſte of his hoſte, horſemen &amp; Eliphantes, with as ſmall noiſe as he could make, and was paſſed all daunger, before the daye waxed clere. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſon began to appere, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nero perceiuing the campe of the Carthaginenſes to be voyde, and knowyng many feſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theyr departure, with theyr vntrueth and his mocke and illuſion, he made as muche ſpede as he coulde to folowe his ennemyes, with a feruent deſyre to fyght, yf he myght ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. But they were in ſafegarde, er he myght atteine vnto theym, without any thyng doyng, onleſſe it were ſmall ſkirmiſſhes betwene the taile of the hoſt of the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the lyght foreryders of the Romayne armie.</p>
            <p>¶ The ende of the yere drewe nere, and the tyme of choſyng of offycers began to approche: at whiche election Marcus Marcellus, and Marcus Valerius Leuinus were choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulles. Then the ſenate of Rome, with no leſſe diligence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libered
<pb facs="tcp:9127:83"/>
of the affayres of Spayne, then they dyd of the eſtate of Italie, for the ſauegarde wherof they determyned to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the armie, that was there with Nero the conſull, and to ſende alſo with the ſame a newe capitayne, whom they called a proconſull. But all theyr doubte was, whom they ſhulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſygne to that office, to ſuccede in the place of two ſo noble ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaynes, as were of late there ſlayne, in the ſpace of .xxx. dayes. The daie was appoynted for the commune election of this capitayne, by voyce of the ſenatours and alſo of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes. Some loked, when many valiant men woulde haue offered them ſelues therto for the wealth of their countrey: But none was founde amonge them, that wolde enterpryſe to take on hande that great &amp; perillous charge. The citezens by great aſſembles mette at the daye and place appoynted for the nomination. At whiche daye the noble men loked one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an other, as people amaſed and deſtitute of counſayle in ſuche perplexitie, lamenting the ſore decaye of the ſtate of the citie.</p>
            <p>¶ When none coulde be found amonge them, worthy for that rome or office: then ſodeinly yonge P. Cornelius Scipio, the ſonne of him that was before ſlayne in Spaine, being then but xxiiii. yeres old, ſtode vp in an high place, where al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myght well ſee and beholde hym, and deſyred, that the ſame offyce myght be gyuen vnto hym. when he had declared his mynde, anon the hole multitude of all eſtates gaue to hym their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, criyng: Luckie be his empire in Spayne.</p>
            <p>¶ Soone after his haſtie election a ſodeyne ſylence was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the multitude, and then all men began ſecretly with them ſelues to conſyder their haſte in their nomination, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylyng, and alſo forthinkyng, that they had more fauoured the perſon through affection, then they did conſider his youth by theyr reaſon, many miſlyked the fortune that had happed to his ſtocke and familie in the ſame countrei before, and ſome were ſorye to ſende one of the ſame kyn and name, to gouerne the countreie, where his father and vncle were ſlayne and lay buryed.</p>
            <p>¶ When yonge Scipio perceyued their ſilence, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of their haſtie election, he deſired them a lyttell to giue him audience. And there he made them ſuch an oration, in the excuſe of his age, and concerning the rule and affayres to him
<pb facs="tcp:9127:84"/>
commytted, with ſuch an herte and courage, that he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enflamed their hertes with more ardent deſyre and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde hym, but alſo he fulfylled them with a certeyne hope of proſperous ſucceſſe in his empyre. For the yonge man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde many his marueylous vertues and good qualities, wher with he was naturally indewed, he had alſo from his infancie a wonderfull counning or gifte in the noble auauncing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng furth of the ſame. Somtime amonge the commune peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he woulde ſhewe certayne dreames or viſions, that he had in the nyght: ſometime he woulde declare vnto them thinges that he was commanded inwardly by the goddes to execute. Theſe and ſuch lyke his ſtraunge wordes, with the maner and facion of lyuing after he was fyrſte put in auctoritie, ſhewed ſuche a magnificence in hym, that the commune people both had an opinion, and alſo publyſſhed the ſame, that Scipio was deſcended of the ſtocke or kynred of the goddes. Inuentyng a lyke fable of his conception to be by the ſeede of a ſerpent or ſnake, as heretofore hath ben fayned of great Alexander: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrming, that the ſimilitude of the ſame hath ben dyuers times ſeen in his mothers chamber: but ſo ſoone as any man entred her ſayde chaumbre, it dyd ſodaynly glide and vanyſhe away.</p>
            <p>¶ This fayned inuention of his conception, and the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious myndes of the people towarde hym, he woulde nother affyrme to be true, nother ſaye they were falſe and vntrewe: but couertly left them to dwell ſtyll in theyr owne opinions: wherby all men had ſuche an admiration of hym, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred hym to enioy that great roume, that els was full vnmete for that his yong age. The army, that ſhuld be vnder hym in Spayne, was increaſed tenne thouſand fotemen, and one. M. horſemen: and M. Iulius Sullanus was appoynted to helpe hym in all his buſy affayres of charge.</p>
            <p>¶ With this newe army and a nauy of .xxx. ſhyppes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of Italy, makyng great ſpede, tylle he arryued in Spayne: where he gathered togither all the power that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there before, and ſo ſobrely handled him ſelf to al men, that in his woordes they iudged to be bothe a royall maieſtie, and a ſtedfaſt faythfulnes. He prayſed moch the ſouldiours, whiche he founde there, fyrſt for that not withſtanding theyr ii. great loſſes of men &amp; capitayns, yet they kept ſtill that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, defendyng manfully their frendis, and many their cities
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9127:84"/>
of the ſame: and alſo that they ſuffred not theyr ennemies to enioy the proſperous fortune, whiche by the loſſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns was ones gyuen them: Thyrdly, for that they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their ennemies to forſake theyr abode on this lide the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iberus. But aboue all other, he had Lucius Martius in great honour and veneration. And anon after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng, he beſtowed his newe menne of warre, to places where they ſhuld remaine for the winter ſeaſon, and he hym ſelfe, after all thinges were ordinately diſpoſed, went to Tarracon.</p>
            <p>¶ The fame of Scipio was no leſſe among his ennemies, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was among his frendes. They alſo had a certaine feare of hym, coniecturyng, as it were by ſecrete diuination, the likely ſucceſſe of thynges that were to enſue. They feared hym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hadde cauſe, and they feared hym the more, by how moche the cauſe or reaſon of theyr feare was hydde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen. And in this perplexitie of mynde, they departed their armies, and went to dyuers partes for the wynter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Haſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, went to the ſea, toward the pyllars of Hercules: Mago kept the myddell of the cun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey, and Haſdruball the ſonne of Amilcar, lay nigh the riuer of Iberus, not farre from Sagunt.</p>

            <p>IN. the ſpryng of the yere P.

            <p>¶ There was neuer newe capitayn before me, that had cauſe to gyue thankes vnto his ſouldyours, before he hadde tryed theyr hardines and diligence in bataile: but fortune hath bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me vnto you (louinge ſouldiours) before I knewe this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye, or ſawe the place of our Campe.

bothe quycke and deade: ſecundarily for that, whan the hole countrey was as loſte, by reaſon of the greate diſtruction of our people: yet you by your noble vertue and myghte, haue obteyned the poſſeſſion of the ſame agayne, bothe to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, and alſo to me theyr deputie here, and ſucceſſour to my ſayd father and vncle. But now, ſens through the fauour of the goddis we intende to worke, not that we may dwell in Spayne ſtyll our ſelues, but that the Carthaginenſes ſhall haue no dwellyng here: Nother onely to reſtraine them, that they ſhall not come on this ſyde the bankes of the water of Iberus: but that we intend to paſſe the ſame floode with our army, to gyue them battayle.

And nowe in his tyme at Trebia, at Traſymenus, and at Cannas, what other thinges did appere, other than hole armyes with theyr capitaynes and Romayne Conſuls ſlayne?

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cruell batayle of Cannas, Haſdruball, with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye was goynge ouer the mountaynes into Italye, to helpe his brother Anniball, and to ioyne theyr powers together: whych if he had done, accordynge to his intent, there hadde by thys day ben almoſt no memorye or name of the Romayns left. But then ye hardy ſouldyours, by the gouernaunce of my father, withſtode theim, and by your good fortune ſo wel ſped there, that therby the euel chaunces, which before hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs, were wel releued, and nowe, through the goodnes of the goddes are dayly more ioyfull and proſperous.

There remayned alſo in that Citie, all the pledges of noble men and citees of Spayne. Beſyde this, the citie was ſituate vpon the ſea, from whenſe it was eaſy to paſſe ouer into Affrica.</p>
            <p>The hauen alſo therof was able to receyue eaſely the greateſt nauye of any prynce.</p>
            <p>¶ Of this his purpoſe no man was priuye, but onely T. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, gouernour of the ſhyppes and armye by the ſea, to whome he commaunded, ſoo to tempre his courſe with his ſhyppes, that his armye by lande, and the other by ſea, myghte bothe ſodaynely appeere at Carthage in one tyme. Whyche his charge was dewely putte in execution. For the ſeuenthe daye after theyr departynge frome Iberus, they mette at newe Carthage: where incontynente the Campe was made, and tentes pytched on the Northe ſyde of the citie.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe is the ſyte or ſytuation of Carthage on this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier: In the myddell of Spayne, there is a greatte bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or goulfe, in to the whyche the ſea hath his full courſe, within the lande the lengthe of fyue hundred paſſes, and the breadthe of the ſea in the ſame place, is muche of the ſame quantitie. In the inner parte or furtheſt ende of this goulfe, is a hylle, on whyche the citie is buylded: and it is on two partes, that is to ſaye, on the eaſte ſyde, and on the ſouthe ſyde, encloſed with the ſea, whyche frome the ſayde goulfe or boſome, rounneth in to the lande by the one ſyde of the citie. Vppon the weaſte ſyde, it is defended with a greatte and brode poole, that rounneth vp alſo a good part of the Northe ſyde of the towne: The deepeneſſe of the poole is at noo certayntie: For as the ſea dothe aryſe on heyghte and ebbe lowe, ſoo is the water thereof deepe or ſhalowe. ¶ Thus is the Cytie on all partes enuyronned
<pb facs="tcp:9127:87"/>
with water, as it were an ylande, oneles it be on a part of the northſyde: and the mayne lande there, paſſeth not .ii. hundred and fyfty paces in bredth. Wherfore ſens the grounde there was no broder, Scipio intended not to make trenches on that part, for that he thought hym ſelfe ſtronge ynough to keepe that lyttell peece of grounde from his ennemies: and alſo to thintent he myght at all tymes haue recourſe to view the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and ſtrength of the towne.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan Scipio had ordered all thinges ordinately vpon the lande for the aſſaulte, he than went to the hauen, where he in lyke maner ordered his ſhippes and his men, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere to the citizens, that they ſhoulde be aſſaulted, as well by water, as by lande: he alſo commaunded watche to be kepte vpon the water in the night ſeaſon in euery ſhyppe. And after all thynges were prudently appoynted, he retourned to his campe, wyllyng before he dyd any thing, touching the aſſault, to inſtruct and admonyſhe his people of his mynd, concerning the ſame, and to comfort theym in that enterpryſe, he called them togither and made his oration to them in this wyſe.</p>
            <p>¶ Who ſo euer beleueth (good ſouldiours) that ye are nowe brought hyther only to aſſault and wynne this one towne, he dothe more conſyder your labour and peyne therin, than the profyte that ſhall enſue therof. Trewe it is, that ye ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and ſkale the walles but of one onely towne: but in the obteynyng of this one, ye alſo ſhall wynne the whole cuntrey of Spayne. For in this towne are the pledges of all the noble men, kynges and people of Spayne, who being ones taken, full ſhortly ſhall cauſe all that euer the Carthaginenſes doo nowe poſſede, to be yelded vnto vs, and to be vnder our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minon. Here alſo is al the money and treſure of our ennemies: whiche being taken from them, they ſhall be able no longer to maynteyne the warres, ſeinge they haue many hyred ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in theyr army. And the ſame treaſure ſhall meruaylouſly profyte vs, therby to wynne the hertes and loue of theſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people. Beſyde this, here remaineth theyr ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, their armour, and al abilimentes neceſſary for the warre: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che beynge ones wonne, ſhall ſerue well our pourpoſe, and therof make our ennemies bare, to theyr vtter diſtruction. Furthermore, we ſhall be lordes of a fayre and a ryche citie, whervnto lyeth a goodly hauen, whereby we ſhall be ſerued
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9127:87"/>
both by ſea &amp; by lande, of all thinges that we ſhall at any tyme lacke. The hauing of theſe thynges ſhal not only be pleſant &amp; profitable to vs, but alſo the lacke of the ſame, ſhal be a muche greatter hyndrance and loſſe to our ennemies. For this citie hath been and is theyr greatteſt ſtrength. Here be theyr ſtore houſes for corn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, here is theyr treaſaurye, here is theyr ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and theyr houſes ſtuffed with all thynges neceſſarye for theyr ſhyppes of warre: generally this citie is the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of all that they haue. Hyther lyeth the ryght courſe by ſea from Affrica to Spayn. And nowe, ſens I perceyue ye be ſufficiently inſtructed, and haue all thinges in good ordre, mete for the purpoſe, lette vs with good hertes, and all our ſtrength, make haſte to the aſſaultyng of this newe Carthage. ¶ Therwithall, euery man with loude voice aſſented therto. And he, not thinkyng to be ſlacke in his buſynes, went furthe towarde Carthage, cauſing it to be aſſauted both by water and by lande. ¶ On the other ſyde, Mago capitain of the Cartha ginenſes, perceiuing that the aſſault was ordeined to be giuen both by ſea and land, he diſpoſed his men within the towne on this maner: Two. M. of the towneſmen he cauſed to be armed &amp; put in aray on that part of the towne, that the Romain te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or campe was, fiue .C. men he appoynted to kepe the caſtell: other .v.

And whan ſo euer they herde any crye made in any parte, through the violent force of the aſſauting: than ſodainly the gate was open, wherat he cauſed the .ii.

In ſo moche that diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the walles were lefte bare and naked, without men to
<pb facs="tcp:9127:88"/>
defende the ſame: euery man lept from his appoynted place, ſo great and ſodayne was theyr feare. This perceiued well Scipio, ſtandyng on an hyll without the towne. Wherefore he commaunded his ſouldiours, to come out of their tentes ſpedyly, to the aſſaulte of the towne, and to bring with theim ſcalyng ladders. His commaundement was fulfylled. The fyght was ſtrong on bothe partes. And to encourage the more his people, Scipio hym ſelfe came thyther, vnder the couert of ſhyldes and paueſſes, to withſtande the ſhotte that came from the walles, of arowes dartes and other ingynnes whiche was greate. There he ſomtyme exhorted and coum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his men: ſomtime he counſayled them, what was beſt for them to do, for the attayning of theyr purpoſe. This his preſence was awytneſſe, bothe ofmens valyant courage, and alſo of theyr cowardyſe, wherby euery man enforced hym ſelfe to clymmevp, neyther regardynge the heyghte of the walles, nor fearyng the men of armes, that fierſely defended the walles. On the other ſyde of the towne lyke aſſault was gyuen from the ſhyppes, by that part that laye towarde the water: but all to ſmall purpoſe. For Mago had ſo furnyſhed the walles with armed men, euer bryngynge theym plenty of dartes and other ordinances, that the Romans loſt more than they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. And aboue al thinges, the ſauing of the town was the height of the walles, wherby fewe of their ladders were able to reche to the toppe of the ſame, and thoſe ladders that wer longeſt, wer therto moſt weake: ſo that whan one was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended vp on any of them, other wolde alſo clyme after him theron, and ſo with heauy burden being loded, many of them brake, to the great hurt of the climers. whervpon Scipio, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his vaine labours, cauſed his wery company to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them, and to reſt them: wherby the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes wer not only eaſed and releued of their preſent feare &amp; danger, but alſo therby toke a hardy courage and opinion, that the citie was out of all danger of taking by any aſſault, &amp; that they wer ſtrong inough to defend it, tyll their other capitaines of the Carthaginenſes armies might haue time inough to come to their reſcous, and to reiſe their ſiege. It drewthen towarde the middel of the day, when certain fyſſhermen of Tarracon, that had ben fiſhing in their botes on the ſaid great and large poole, that lay on the northweſt part of the towne, certified
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9127:88"/>
Scipio, that the water therof was than at a very low ebbe, &amp; alſo the northwind, being very quicke, and driuing the waues with the tide, cauſed a lower vale, than had lightly been ſeen: ſo that men might well wade ouer to the walles of the citie, the water being in moſt places not paſt the middell of a man, and in ſome partes not paſt the knees. This ſtrange fortune of that vnſeen lowe ebbe of the water, Scipio tourned to a myracle, ſayinge: It was the wille and pleaſure of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, to withdraw at that time the water from that great pole, to make for the Romains a paſſage, &amp; to open them a way, by which neuer man before had paſſed. With theſe ſtronge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, he cauſed the reſt of his army, which had reſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their tentes, during the time of the firſt aſſault, to take lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and engines, and to gyue a newe aſſault in the ſame place, where they were before beaten back. There began a fierſe &amp; a cruel bickering. Neuertheleſſe the height of the walles was ſo beneficiall to the citezens, that were they neuer ſo valiante and hardy, yet vp could they not get: but were ouerthrowen with ſmall peyne to the townes men.</p>
            <p>¶ While they were buſy and attentife to defende the Citie, as well there as on the ſea coſt, Scipio, with a good numbre of ſtronge men, ſecretely withdrewe hym to the ſayd ponde: where he bad his companye folowe the god Neptunus, that ſhulde be theyr guide on their way through that ſhalowe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whervpon they with ſmall labour went ouer, and ſet vp ladders to the walles, which they found eaſy to be ſcaled, and not kept with any men of warre. For that they hauinge a ſure hope in the naturall ſtrengthe on that parte, by reaſon of the water, had made no munimentes or defence: nor yet lefte any watch there: euery man was gone to the defence of the other partes, in the which thaſſault ſemed moſt fierſe &amp; dangerouſe: ſo that without any reſiſtence they entred the towne, &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinent made haſt to come to the gate, where the battaile was moſt buſy &amp; ſtrong. To which wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer com, they found al the townſmen ſo erneſt in their defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting their felowes, that they neither herd nor ſaw the Romans tyl they perceiued them at their backes, throwing of dartes, &amp; ſleynge them on all partes, nother tyl that time knewe they the town to be won. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anon wer the gates broken down, &amp; a gret nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:9127:89"/>
ſleyng all that they met: an other company wente in araye to the market place, through the myddel of the Citie. Than perceyued they theyr ennemies fleyng, ſome to the hyl with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the towne, that was kepte with .v. C. men of warre. Mago with a great numbre with him fledde to the caſtel. Then Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio ſent parte of his hoſt to the ſayd hyll, whiche anone was wonne, and the people ſlayne or els taken. The reſt wente to aſſaulte the caſtel, whiche Mago a ſeaſon valyantly defended: but ſeyng all the towne full of his ennemies, and that he was not lyke to haue any ſocours: he yelded vp him ſelfe with the caſtell to the Romaynes. Then ceaſſed they to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlaughter in the citie. Euery man wente to the ſpoile of the towne: the praye whereof was greate, as well of golde and ſyluer as of ordinaunce, artyllary, corne, ſhyppes, iron, laten and many other thinges mete for the apparel of ſhippes: the certayntie wherof I wyll not reherſe, for that writars va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moch therin. There was alſo .x. M. pryſoners taken, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of as many as were citizens, Scipio let go at libertie, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to dwel ſtyl in the towne, and to enioy as moche of their goodes as was not before ſpoyled. Amonge other priſoners there were two.

A greate noumber of the reſt, that were ſeruauntes and luſty yonge men, he ſent to be rowers in his ſhyppes and galeys in the places of ſuche as lacked. And he alſo encreaſed his nauy of eyght ſhyppes wel furniſhed. Beſide al theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners he had alſo the pledges of noble men and cities, to a greate noumbre: whome he cauſed to be well kepte and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly entreated. The reſt of that daye Scipio gaue lycence to his wery men to reſt theym ſelues. For there were fewe, but they had al the daye before ben ſore trauayled with fyghtyng in one place or other.

Lelius, the gouernour of the nauye, he prayſed and muche loued, to whome he gaue, for a rewarde, a crowne of golde, and .xxx. oxen.</p>
            <p>¶ Than cauſed he the pledges to be brought before him, wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng them to be of good comforte, and that they ſhuld conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they wer now in the power of the Romayns, whoſe naturall propretie and deſire is, to bynde men throughe theyr benefytes ſhewinge, to loue them, rather than by compulſion to kepe men in feare of them. And had leauer to ioyne ſtrange nations in amitie with them by faithfull felowſhyp, then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully to kepe them in myſerable ſeruitude. Than he toke the names of the cities, that had their pledges there, and to the ambaſſadours that by chaunce were with hym preſent of any of the ſayde cities, he, incontinent delyuered the pledges vnto theim: to the other cities he ſent meſſangers, wyllynge theim to ſend vnto him for theim, and they ſhulde haue theyr pledges frely delyuered. There were alſo taken many noble matrones and honeſt maydens, whom he committed to ſobre
<pb facs="tcp:9127:90"/>
and honeſt men to be kept, without any force or diſhonour to be done vnto them: among other captiues there was one vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin brought vnto hym, of ſo excellent beautie, that where ſo euer ſhe went, all men delyted to beholde her. Scipio enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her, of what cuntrey ſhe was, and of what kynred ſhe was deſcended: &amp; he perceyned by her, that ſhe was betrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed or made ſure to a yong prince of the Celtiberia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whoſe name was Luceius. Wherevppon he incontinent ſent for the ſaid yonge man, and alſo for her parentes. At whoſe coming, knowyng that the yonge man was ſoore enamoured of her, he thus ſayd vnto hym: I being a yonge man, haue ſente for you, that are alſo a yong man, to come to me, the cauſe is, for that whan this yong maiden, being fianced or enſured to you, was brought to me, by my ſoldiors, I herd ſay, that you entier<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly loued her. And her beautie witneſſeth, that you haue good cauſe ſo to do. If I might laufully enioy her pleaſaunt loue, and were not otherwyſe occupied in my mynde about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of the commune welthe: I coulde perchaunce beare her my loue: and deſyre to enioy the ſame: but nowe I wyll beare fauour to your loue, that of ryght ought to haue her. She hath bene here with me as well and honourably kept, &amp; her virginite preſerued, as though ſhe had dwelled ſtyl with her owne parentes, to thintent I might make of her a preſent to you moſt acceptable, &amp; for the conſeruation of mine honor. And for this my gift, I require of you, but one only reward, that is, that you from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sforth becom a louing fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And if ye eſteme me to be a good or an honorable man, as my father and vncle before me were reputed for to be: thinke, that there are in the noble citie of Rome many like vnto vs. And truſt me neuer, if any people can this daye be founde on the earth; that you wyll be gladder to haue the loue and frend ſhyppe of, or that ye wolde be more ſory to haue the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of. The yong man, after gret thankes gyuen hym, praide the goddes to rewarde him for his goodnes, where his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſuffiſed not: Then were the parentes of the mayden called forthe, who had broughte with them a great ſumme of golde for the redemption of theyr chyld. But when they perceiued, that he had giuen her frely to her huſband, they deſired him to take a parte therof, as of theyr gyfte, for the declaration of theyr good hertes towardes hym: affirminge, that his recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge

therof ſhulde be as ioyfull vnto them, as the reſtitution of theyr dowghter vndefiled.</p>
            <p>¶ Then Scipio, beinge ouercome with theyr longe and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interceſſion, cauſed the ſayde ſumme to be layde on the grounde before his fete, and callinge Luceius againe to hym, he ſayde: Beſyde the dowere that ye ſhal receyue of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawe, for the mariage of his doughter, ye ſhall alſo take this gyfte of dower at my hande. With whiche his great gift, and alſo moch honour to hym done beſyde, he retourned home to his houſe and countrey, declaring to euery man the honour and magnifycence of Scipio, ſayinge, that there was a yonge man come moſt lyke vnto a god, who bothe with his power in warre, and alſo with his gentilneſſe and liberalitie in peace, had ouercome all the countrey.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He newe Conſull, leauynge all thynges in good order at Rome, departed towardes the warres. Q. Fuluius Flaccus paſſed Capua, to whome Q.

The ſame requeſt he alſo made to Marcellus by his letters: who thynkynge no man in Italy ſo able to matche Anniball, as he was hym ſelfe, was ſo kendeled &amp; ſtirred with Fabius letters, that ſo ſone as the wynter was paſſed, and any fode was founde in the fieldes, able to ſuſteyne his army and cattel, he went to Canuſium, where Annibal then laye, and hadde moued the rulers of the towne to yelde vnto

But ſo ſone as he parcey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that Marcellus was come, he remoued from thenſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge that playne countrey, and ſought the hylly and woddy countrey, whiche myght be more apte for traynes of deceipte for his ennemies.</p>
            <p>¶ Marcellus euer folowed him harde, ioyning almoſt campe to campe. Dyuers ſkyrmyſhes were made betwene the horſe men of bothe partes. But Anniball not mynding to ieoparde all at ones, fledde before hym in the nyghte. At the laſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouertoke hym in the playne fielde: And as Anniball cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his campe to be trenched &amp; fortified, Marcellus with his men let the workes therof: ſo that whether he wold or no, he was enforced to do batayl, which thyng he had moſt eſchued. Wherefore they ordered theyr armies on bothe parties, and fought tyll the nyght departed them. On the morowe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus early put his men in good aray, and Anniball dydde the ſame, exhortyng his men to remembre their noble conqueſtes at Traſymenus and at Cannas, and not to ſuffre theyr gredye and vnreaſonable ennemy ſo to vexe them, that they might not haue tyme to incampe them ſelues, ye ſcarſely to loke aboute, or to take breathe. The ſonne whan it ryſeth, and the Romain army, do bothe at one tyme appere in the fieldes. But in caſe (ſaythe he) ye ſo handle hym, that he may ones departe with loſſe of his men out of the fielde, he wil herafter be more eaſy to intreate. With theſe exhortations, and alſo being euyl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the tedious continuall purſuing of theyr enemies: they fierſly went to battaile, where they fought cruelly by the ſpace of .ii. longe houres. At the laſt the ryght wynge of the Romayns gaue backe, whoſe place to fulfyll, Marcellus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted an other legion of men of armes of his company. But as the fyrſt reculed with feare, ſo the other came fayntly into their places. At the laſt the Romayn hoſt being more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than ſhamefaſt, began to flee. There was ſlayn that day of the Romains .ii. thouſand and ſeuen hundred, wherof .iiii. wer capitaines hundreders, and two tribunes.</p>
            <p>¶ Marcellus after that he was come into his campe, made to his ſouldiours ſo ſoore and cruell an oration, that the wordes of the angry capitayne ſemed to them more diſpleaſaunt and peynefull, than the trauayle that they toke in the battaylle the daie before.</p>

¶ I am moche bounde (ſayth he) to the immortall goddes, when ye ſo fearfully toumbled together into your tentes, that it chaunced not your ennemy, after his victory, to aſſayle your campe alſo. For no fayle, loke with what feare ye left the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, with lyke feare alſo had ye forſaken your campe. What ſodayne feare hath nowe inuaded you?

            <p>IN this ſeaſon Q. Fabius Max. the conſul toke Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duria with force, and from thens remoued to Tarent, pytchyng his tentes hardeby the mouth of the hauen, where he founde certayne ſhyppes, whyche Liuius the late conſull hadde left there for the defence of other ſhyppes that brought vytayle and other neceſſary prouiſion for the caſtell. All theſe ſhyppes, and alſo all other that came with vitayles and prouiſion thyther, he charged ſome with gunnes and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and all kynde of weapons inuaſiue, ſomme he laded with ſcalyng ladders, and other engyns to aſſaulte the towne: ſoo that by the ſea al thinges wer ready for the aſſaulte. And then he by land alſo ordered his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany for the ſame. Now to help his purpoſe to be acheued, ther chaunced a ſmall thing in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: yet it proued meruailous happy for the ſucceſſe of his great enterpriſe. Anniball had ſent to Tarent a crue of men of warre of the countrey of the Brutians. The capytayne of this company was meruailouſly enamored on a yong woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the citie, whoſe brother was then ſouldiour in the hoſt of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, to whom his ſiſter ſent worde by letters, of the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and new acquaintaunce of her earneſt louer, and of his greate ryches and honour. Whervpon this man imaginynge, and truſtyng alſo, that the loue of his ſyſter myght leade her louer to do what ſo euer ſhe wolde diuiſe, conceyued an hope, to do good therby, touchynge the wynnynge of the towne. Whervpon he ſecretely opened his mynde to his capitayne Fabius, deſyrynge hym, that he woulde ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Conſull thynkyng to proue the effecte of his opynyon, ſuffered hym to departe. Thus came he to his ſyſter, and by her meanes felle in greate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarite with her louer the capytayne of the Brutianes. And
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9127:94"/>
after longe acquayntaunce he beganne couertly to proue his mynde a lyttell and a lyttell. After, whan he founde ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in hym, he ſette his ſyſter in hande with hym, who with her fayre and flatterynge woordes ſoo compaſſed hym, that to haue her loue, he conſented to the betraiynge of that parte of the Citie, wher of he was rular and Capytayne.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan they were agreed on the tyme, maner, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the purpoſe: the ſouldyour ſecretly in the nyghte, was lette furthe out of the towne, and came to his capitayn, declarynge vnto hym what he hadde doone, and what waye he ſhoulde take, to achieue his enterpryſe. At the tyme and houre appoynted, whiche was the begynnynge of the nyght, the Conſull hadde prepared, that on the ſea ſyde in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, his ſhyppes and menne of warre thereto appoynted, ſhoulde vyolentely aſſaulte the towne. And on an other parte the Romaynes in the caſtell, with all theyr force alſo, ſhulde aſſayle the citizens: and he with a good numbre with hym, pryuyly drewe hym to the eaſte parte of the towne, where he abode a longe ſeaſon, withoute makynge any noyſe.</p>
            <p>There was greatte noyſe and bruite made purpoſely on the hauen ſyde, and on the ſyde towardes the caſtelle, where leaſte daungier was: Soo that Democrates the capytayne, whyche was than nyghe vnto the crew of Brutians, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge leſte in his abſence, the Romaynes myghte chaunce on the other ſyde to wynne the towne, whyche to feare he was moued by the greatte rumour and crye of the cytezens on that parte. Whan he hearde all thynges quiete and at reſte on that parte of the towne, wherin he was: he with his people haſted towarde the caſtell ſyde, where he hearde the greatteſt noyſe.</p>
            <p>¶ Than the conſull, heringe thenoyſe ceaſſed of men of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, whiche before were very loude, iudging that the kepers of that warde were gone from thens: he commanded ſtreight ſcalynge ladders to be ſette to the walles on that ſyde where the Brutians kepte warde, whyche was done without any reſyſtence. For the Brutians not onely made noo reſyſtence, but alſoo holpe theym vp. Thus entred they the towne, and ſtreyghte wente to the nexte gate, the whyche they brake, and cauſed moche of theyr companye to entre with theyr baners dyſplayed. And by the breake of the day, they
<pb facs="tcp:9127:95"/>
came into the markette place. The Tarentines parceyuinge theyr towne to be taken, came with all theyr power frome the caſtell ſide, and from the hauen, to the ſuccour therof: but all to late. For after the battayle was a lyttell begonne, they felte them ſelues farre vnable to reſiſt the Romaynes. Wherfore anon they fled euery man to his houſe, or to his friendes houſe. There wer Nico and Democrates ſlayne in battayle. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, the chiefe autour of betraying the towne to Anniball, toke his horſe and fledde: but whither he wente, or what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of hym, it was not after knowen. Great ſlaughter was made both of the Carthaginenſes and of the Tarentines.</p>
            <p>Many priſoners were taken, and a ryche ſpoyle. The wall, whiche Anniball made to deuyde the caſtell frome the towne, was throwen downe.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball when he fyrſte hearde, that Tarent was beſieged: he with all haſt poſſible hyed thyther to the ſuccour therof. But when he came nere thervnto, and hearde newes of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of the citie, and by what meanes, he ſayde: I nowe do ryght well fynde, that the Romaynes haue alſo an other Anni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ball amonge theim. For euen by ſuche crafte as we wanne Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by ſuche haue we loſt it. Then for that it ſhulde not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere, that he were reculed for feare, he pitched his campe fyue miles from the citie, where he taryed certayne dayes: and from thenſe went to Metapontus, where he cauſed letters to be written by two of the chiefe rulers of the citie to Fabius.</p>
            <p>The contentes therof was, that if it woulde pleaſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes and hym, to receyue theim into theyr grace, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte all theyr olde iniuries and wronges to them doone: they woulde delyuer into his handes, bothe the towne, and alſo the garniſon of the Carthaginenſes, which wer within the ſame. Fabius nothynge miſtruſtinge, ſent to them agayne, appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge a tyme, when he wolde come to Metapontus to ſpeake with them, whiche letters were ſtreyght brough to Anniball. Who beinge very ioyouſe, to trayne and deceyue the old wiſe Fabius, At the tyme appoynted layde a great embuſſhemente vpon the waye, where Fabius ſhulde paſſe to Metapontus.</p>
            <p>¶ The ſame tyme when Fabius ſhulde departe, he ſought by diuinations and auguries, howe he ſhulde ſpede in his voiage, as by the kyllyng of a beaſte, and therwith to do ſacrifyce: and by the lucke of byrdes, as the deteſtable vſe was then, and

Whiche augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were ſo vnlucky and vntowarde, that they ſhewed to hym ſome euyll aduenture, if he wente forwarde in his appoynted iourney. Wherfore the deuynours or wyſe men aduyſed hym, to tary ſtyll in his tentes, for feare of treaſon.</p>
            <p>¶ The Metapontans, ſeing that Fabius came not at the day aſſigned, ſent agayne to hym, requyring hym to come to their capitaynes. Whiche meſſangers were incontinente taken and examyned vpon the caſe. And they fearynge the tourmentes that wer prepared for theim, confeſſed all the deceyte and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: wherby Fabius eſcaped his death, and the deſtruction of many of his armye.</p>

            <p>IN the ſame ſummer tyme, whyles all theſe thynges were done in Italy, P.

Scipio gotte them the hylle, whyche before was not poſſible for theim to haue wonne, the army &amp; elephantes kepyng their aray, the place was ſo ſtiepe to aſcend. Then began the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes to flee for their ſauegard. there was great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made among them that abode, by Scipio and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and of thoſe that fledde, many were receyued by the .ii. companies, which were before layde in embuſſhement for the ſame purpoſe: ſo that there were ſlayne to the numbre of .viii. M. men. Aſdruball ſeing the beginning of the battaile nothing proſperous after his intent, ſent his money, and many of his elephantes away before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he folowed after with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as coulde ſaue them ſelues with flieng: and paſſyng the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Tagus, went ſtreight toward the mountains of Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis. ¶ Scipio, comynge to the campe of the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, gaue all the pray therof to his ſouldiours, except the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, which wer in numbre .x. thouſand fotemen, and .ii. M. horſemen: of whiche numbre, ſoo many as were Spanyardes, he let go at lybertie freely, without raunſome paying: the reſt he cauſed to be ſold by the Queſtor. Than gaue he large gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to the princis of Spayn, ſpecially to Indibilis he gaue .iii. C. horſes, the beſte he coulde chuſe of all that were taken. Through whiche his liberall diſtribution, the communes of Spayne called hym kyng: whyche name, Scipio declared to them, that it was very odious and deteſtable to the Romans. Wherfore he deſyred them, to abſteyne from callyng hym by that name. For with the name of gouernour or capitayne, he was well contented.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan the Queſtor was about to ſell the pryſoners by the capitaynes commaundement, among other he found a goodly yonge chylde of .xv. yeres olde: whome he ſente to Scipio, for that he herd of him, that he was deſcended of lignage roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Of whom Scipio enquired, what he was, &amp; of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and how he, being of no greatter age, happened to be in the campe amonge men of warre. He aunſwered, that he was of Numidia, and was named Maſſus. His father (he ſayd) was deade. Wherfore his mother ſent him to her father Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la kinge of Numidia, and frome that time he had ben brought vp with his vncle Maſſaniſſa. And when his vncle came ouer into Spaine, to the ſocour of the Carthaginenſes, he came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with him. But euer when he went to any batteil, his vncle
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9127:97"/>
wolde not ſuffer hym to go with him. So that before this time (he ſayde) he neuer came in the fyelde. And nowe it was alſo vnware to his ſayde vncle. But when euery man made hym re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye, he pryuely alſo toke an horſe and harneies, and entered the battayle with them. But his chaunce was ſo euyll, that he had nowe a faule from his horſe, wherby he was taken of the Romaynes. Scipio demaunded of hym, whether he were not deſyrous to retourne to Maſſaniſſa. To whom he aunſwered, wepynge for ioye, that he wolde be verye glad, if his chaunce were ſo good. Then Scipio gaue him a ringe of golde, a cote, a ſenatours garmente, a ſpanyſſhe cloke, a goodly horſe, well harneyſed, and a buckle of golde, and ſuffered hym to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte to his vncle at his pleaſure, appoyntynge him horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne to conducte hym on the waye, ſo farre as he woulde haue theim.</p>
            <p>¶ After theſe thynges done, he beſtowed the reſte of the ſummer in receyuynge many people and Cities of Spayne in to the amitie of the Romaynes, and remayned at Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racon.</p>
            <p>¶ Sone after the battayle foughte at Betula, the other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and Mago with theyr armyes came frome the further parte of Spayne, to the helpe of the other Aſdruball: but all to late. For the battayle was paſte before theyr comynge. Wherfore they conſulted, what was beſte be doone. At the laſte, conſyderynge that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, by gyftes and his lyberalytye, hadde won the hertes of the hyther partes of Spayne, and that onely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the furtheſte parte of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ They alſo agreed, that Aſdruball, takynge with hym al the Spanyardes out of Spayne, and farre from the name of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, ſhulde go ouer the mountaynes with them towardes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball into Italy, where the heade and chiefe grounde of the warres was.</p>

But Marcellus by meane of ennemies was runne in great infamy. For it was reported, that Anniball rouyng abrode in the countrey, he kept his hoſt in the ſommer ſeaſon in the towne of Venuſia. Marcellus to purge hym of this ſclaunderous name came to Rome, againſte the tyme of chuſynge of offycers. Thyther came alſoo Q. Fuluius Flaccus the conſull. There was the cauſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus openly debated. And C. Bibulus, one of the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, charged hym ſoore, ſayeng, that the negligence of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, and other ſuche lyke, was the cauſe of Anniballes ſo longe abode in Italy, This is (ſayd he) the tenthe yere, ſens he came fyrſt into this countrey. He hath lyued almoſt as long in Italy, as he hath done in Carthage. At the choſyng of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ye wylled M.

And in the chiefe of ſommer,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9127:98"/>
he hath kepte the reſydue of his men at Venuſia, within the ſure walles of the ſame.</p>
            <p>¶ To this accuſation Marcellus ſo wyſely and ſobrely aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhewynge his policies and his actes doone agaynſte Anniball, that his excuſe was not onely welle taken, but alſo for his well dooinge, the daye folowynge he was, by the hole conſent of the people, choſen conſull: And Titus Quintus Criſpinus was choſen to be his felowe. They both were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to kepe Italy agaynſte Anniball.

Wherfore he ſent for all maner of ordynances to Sicilia, with ſhyppes alſo to aſſault the ſame by ſea as well as by land. But hearinge of the cominge of Anniball to Lacinium, he lefte his pourpoſe for a ſeaſon, and ioyned his hoſte with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Marcellus, who as than was come from Venuſia into the countrey of Apulia, where they bothe incamped their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies .iii. myles the one frome the other. Thyther came alſo Anniball ſoone after that he parceyued the conſull Criſpinus hadde lefte of his beſiegynge of the Locrenſes, and in the ſame cuntrey pytched his campe and tentes. He had the yere before aſſayed the power and herte of Marcellus, ſometyme with wynnyng, ſometyme with loſſe of men. Wherefore fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge with the power of bothe the conſulles to be ouermat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, he than diuyſed, howe with policies and craft to deceiue them. The conſulles made dyuers ſkyrmyſhes with his men, thinkyng with ſuche tryflynge frayes to paſſe furthe the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to kepe hym occupied: yet neuertheleſſe, they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to be ſtronge ynough alſo for the beſiegynge of Locrus. Wherfore they ſent to Sicilia, cauſyng L. Cincius, with his nauy and army, to come to the beſiegynge of Locrus by the ſea. Furthermore to aſſayle it alſo by lande, they commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part of the army, whiche laye for the defence of Tarent, to be brought thyther. This appoyntement was not ſo pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyly done, but that Anniball hadde knowledge therof by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the Thurines. Whervppon agaynſte the tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted of theyr comynge, he ſent an embuſſhement of two thouſande horſemen, and thre thouſande footemen, to lye

ſecretely vnder the hylle of Petillia, vppon the way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Romayne Tarentines ſhoulde paſſe. The Romaynes vnaduyſedly paſſyng by the waye, were amonge them to their great hurtes: for two thouſande of theim were there ſlayne, and one. M. and two hundred taken pryſoners, the reſt that eſcaped, fledde by dyuers waies backe agayne to Tarent. The conſulles laye in theyr ſeuerall campes, not farre frome the campe of Anniball. Nowe was there in the myddell waye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Romaynes campe and hym, a greatte hylle, full of woodde, not taken nor viewed by any of them both. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns feared for to viewe it, for that they doubted, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grounde the vttermooſte parte thereof was towarde theyr enemies. Neither was it viewed of Anniball: for that he eſtemed the ſame to be a place more mete for to deceiue his ennemies, than for to pytche theron his campe. Wherefore he in the nyght ſent thither a company of Numidian horſemen to lye pryuily in the myddell of the wood, without mouynge or makynge any noyſe in the daie tyme, for feare to be eſpied. The Romaynes euer cryed to theyr capytaynes, that they ſhoulde take the ſayde hylle, and pytche there, one of theyr campes, for feare leſte Anniball ſhoulde take it before theim. Than ſaid Marcellus to his felowe Criſpinus, lette vs then, with a certaine horſemen with vs, go viewe the ſame hyll: by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beynge thus agreed, they takyng with them .ii. hundred and .xx. horſemen, wente bothe to ſuruey the ſayde hylle and wood. Whom yonge Marcellus, the conſuls ſonne, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Manlius beinge bothe tribunes, folowed. So couetous was the mynde of Marcellus to ioyne battaile with Anniball, that he thoughte he coulde neuer ioyne his campe nyghe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the campe of his ennemye. Wherefore at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partynge, he cauſed his people to be in a redyneſſe: that in caſe the place lyked theim, that they myghte gather vp the veſſelles, and all theyr ſtuffe, and folowe theim frome theyr campes.</p>
            <p>¶ The capytaynes paſſed thorough a lyttell playne fielde, and frome thenſe they entred into a fayre brode waye or ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, whyche wente vp into the woodes. At the toppe of this rydynge, the Numidians hadde ſette an eſpy to watche, not thynkynge of any ſoo greate a praye as happed theim to

Wherfore he commanded theim, in no wyſe to gyue credence to any letters that ſhulde be ſente vnto them, ſealed with the ſeale of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, or made in his name.

A lyttell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the daye came Anniball, with a great company with hym. The firſt company that cam to the yates, was of Romans, that wer departed from the cuntrey, &amp; taken in wages by Anniball.

            <p>Wherfore they deuyſed to match his quickenes, with a ſobre felowe of great temperance. Then was there one M.

But at this time the cenſors cauſed hym to rounde his heare, and puttynge on other cleane garmentes, to come in to the ſenate houſe. When he was brought thyther, and the fathers were examyned of theyr opinions of M.

mountaynes, ſtryuinge bothe with men and peryllous places, wherin he had ſpent fyue monethes, he loked not for ſo ſpedye and quicke coming of his brother. whiche cauſed hym to be ſo long, er euer he remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place, where he wintred with his army. But in this he was moche deceiued. For Aſdruball had better ſpede in his paſſage, then he loked for him ſelfe. For the frenchemen, and alſo the mountaynoys, dyd not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, and ſuffered hym with his army to paſſe their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: but alſo they folowed him to the warres, leadinge him many ſure wayes, whiche to Anniball his brother, were then vnable to be paſſed. Agayne, the wayes ouer the mountaynes, by the continuall vſe of goinge ouer them, were made moche more eaſy then they were, and the people more gentyll to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate. For before Annibals comynge, they were not vſed to the company of ſtraungers, neyther had ſene any before in the countrey. wherfore they were wylde and ſauage people. They thoughte alſo at the fyrſte tyme, that the Carthaginenſes had come to take theyr caſtelles and cattell from them. But nowe the fame of the warre holden in Italy, betwene the Romaynes and the Carthaginenſes, taught them, and made them to know, that the hole contention betwen thoſe noble head cities of the worlde, beinge ſo farre diſtant a ſundre, was onely for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and for riches: ſo that they wolde trye, whether of them ſhulde poſſede the dominion of the hole.</p>
            <p>¶ Theſe cauſes knowen, made the mountaynes open and eaſy for Aſdruball to paſſe: but his ſpeede was not ſo good in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge the ſame, as his let was great in the beſieginge of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia. Whan he was come ouer, he had thought the citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in a faire plaine countrey, had ben eaſy to wynne: and by the fame of the wynnynge therof, he thoughte all other cities adioyninge, ſhulde haue trembled for feare. But the ſtrength therof moche deceyued him, and that knewe Anniball full wel. For when he came ouer the riuer of Trebia, he in vayne had aſſayed the ſtrength therof. So that Aſdrubals aſſieginge of Placentia was not onely a lette of his owne iourneye: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it ſtayed Anniball moche longer: after he harde therof, ere euer he ſette forthe of the place, where he wyntered with his hoſte.</p>
            <p>¶ The conſulles with theyr armyes went to their prouinces, M. Liuius towardes Placentia, whome ere he departed,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:102"/>
Q. Fabius warned and exhorted, that he ſhulde not ouer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyly fyght with his ennemies, before he knewe the maners and conditions of theim. To whom Liuius, remaynynge yet in dyſpleaſure towarde his citezens for his banyſhement, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: that he wolde fyght with theim ſo ſoone as he might haue fyght of them. Whan the cauſe was demaunded of hym, why he wolde make therm ſuche haſte: Truely (ſayd he) ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I wyll quyckely haue great honour, by ſubduinge myne ennemyes, or els greatte ioye, by the ſleynge of myne owne vnkynde cytezens. Whyche ioye althoughe it be to me not honeſte: yet ſhall it be accordyng to theyr deſeruynges.</p>
            <p>¶ Quintus Claudius Nero made haſte, tyll he approched nere vnto Anniball: who as than was gone into the countrey of the Lucanes, and lay by the towne of Grument. Claudius hadde in his army forty thouſande fotemen, and two thouſand and fyue hundred horſemen: Anniball gatherynge togyther as moche power as he coulde amonge the Brutians, and from ſuche fortreſſes as he than helde: lay inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mped nigh vnto the walles of Grument: and within halfe a myle of them was the campe of the Romaynes. Betwene bothe the campes there was a goodly playne valey, hauynge on the oone ſyde fayre playne hylles, without any wooddes or couerte, for to hyde any embuſſhement, or cauſe deceyte. Wherfore it was the leſſe ſuſpecte to bothe parties. Theſe hylles laye adioynyng to the lefte ſyde of the Carthaginenſes, and to the ryghte ſyde of the Romaynes. In the playne medowe were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lyght eſkyrmyſſhes made betweene the hoſtes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excurſyons the Romayne conſull cauſed to be made one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kepe his ennemyes there frome goynge towarde Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball.</p>
            <p>¶ On the other ſyde Anniball, deſyrous to remoue out of that place with all his power intended to gyue hym battaile. Wherfore he putte his whole hoſte in array. Claudius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, perceyuynge his intent, cauſed ſecretely the nyght folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge, Titus Aſſellus, and P. Claudius two tribunes, with a good noumbre of men with theim, to paſſe ouer the ſayde hylle, adioynynge, and to abyde in the valeye behynde the hylles, appoyntynge theim a tyme, whan they ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcende from the mountayne on the backe of theyr ennemies. He hym ſelfe in the breake of the daye, with the reſte of his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9127:102"/>
footemen and horſemen, came into the fielde in good araye. Anniball lykewyſe commaunded his men to arme theim, and greate noyſe was made in the campe, euery man runnynge to harneys. And whan they were armed, they ranne oute of the campe yates, bothe horſemen and footemen, without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray before Anniball had knowledge therof. And as ſoone as they were out of the Campe in the playne, they ranne to their ennemyes, fyghtynge bothe on horſebacke and on foote, as chaunce gaue theym to meete with theyr ennemies, kepynge none order.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan the Conſull ſawe theym thus rounnynge abrode in the fyelde without order, he commaunded C. Arunculeus, with the horſemen of a legyon, to inuade the Carthaginenſes, with as moche vyolence as he myght: wherby he myght ſlea theym, beinge without order lyke beaſtes, before they coulde be brought in array. Whyche he dydde dilygentely execute, makynge greate ſlaughter. The battayle was ſtrong for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by reaſon of contynuall reſorte of freſhe ſouldiours, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to the ſuccours of theyr felowes.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball, being yet in his campe, hearyng the noyſe of his men fyghtyng, came furthe with the reſte of his power, and ſo dilygently applyed him ſelfe: that euen as his menne were fyghtynge, he put many of theym in araye. Whiche thynge hath not bene lyghtly ſeene, and therein he ſhewed hym ſelfe to be an experte capytayne, hauyng olde and well acquaynted warryours vnder hym. And thus had he brought his wholle hoſte in order, as they were ſtyll fyghtyng: had not C. Aſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, with his bandes of Romaynes, ſodainely deſcended from the hylles, at the backe of the Carthaginenſes, with greate clamour: By the meanes wherof, they beyng aferde leſt they ſhuld be ſtopped from their campe, began to flee on all partes. The horſemen ſlewe many of them in the chaſe: and many mo had been ſlayne, had not the campe been ſo nere at hande. yet loſt Anniball of his men at that battayle .viii. M. which were ſlayne, and vii. C. taken aliue. The next day, and diuers days after, the Romains in array kept the fielde, deſyrous to fight, but the Carthaginenſes abode ſtyll in theyr tentes.</p>
            <p>¶ Soone after in the nyght, Anniball, with his army, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued towardes Apulia, makinge great fyres before the campe, towardes the Romaynes, and leauynge in the entree of his
<pb facs="tcp:9127:103"/>
campe, certayne Numydian horſemen for a ſhewe, tyl he with his hooſte myght be farre gone frome his ennemyes. Whan it was day lyght, the ſayd Numidians ſhewed theim ſelues in the gate of the campe for a ſeaſon, purpoſely to deceyue the Romaines: and whan they ſawe theyr tyme, they ſpedily rode after theyr companie.</p>
            <p>¶ Than the conſull, hearynge noo noyſe in the tentes of his ennemyes, ſent two light horſmen to viewe theyr campe, who fyndynge it voyde of theyr ennemies, retourned to Claudius, certifiynge hym of theyr departyng. Whervpon he with his hoſte wente thyther, and toke the ſpoyle of ſuche baggage as was there leſte: and on the morowe early folowed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, by the fame that they hearde of their waie, by whiche they were gone. Anniball, no more willynge to fyght, toke his waie euer in the nyght, and ouer the mountaynes, tyl he came to Metapontus: where he toke of Hanno, the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, whyche were there lefte, and ioyned theim to his armye, ſendynge hym with a ſmalle numbre with hym, into the countrey of the Brutians, there to aſſemble moo men of warre to his ſuccour.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Sdruball, leauing his further aſſiegyng of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia, ſent foure frenchemen, and two Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to his brother Anniball with letters: who paſſyng all Italy, heryng that Anniball ſhoulde then be at Metapontus, folowed him thither: But er they were ware, they loſt their way, and came to the fieldes of Tarent, where they were taken, and ſent to Claudius Nero with their letters.

But at lengthe,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9127:103"/>
whan it was achieued, it ſhulde tourne the wholle citie from greate feare into meruailous gladneſſe. Wherfore he ſent the ſayde letters to Rome, with other his owne letters of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended enterpryſe. And incontinent ſente meſſangers before hym, to all the townes &amp; countreys, by whych he with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhoulde paſſe: commaundyng theim to brynge furthe into the fieldes agaynſt his commynge, vitayles, horſes, and other neceſſaries for his ſouldyours. Than of his wholle armye he choſe out .vi. thouſande footemen, and one. M. horſmen: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and publyſhyng, that with them he intended to aſſault the next towne of the Lucans, &amp; to take the Carthaginenſes, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che were there left for the keping therof. With this company in the nyght he departed, makyng as great haſte as he myghte in his iourney, to come to the healpe of his felowe Liuius, before he ſhulde haue to do with Aſdruball: leauynge Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Tatius in his campe, to rule and gouerne the reſt of his hoſte. At Rome the conſulles letters made all men no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferde, than they were two yeres paſt, whan the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hadde pytched theyr tentes before the walles of Rome. They doubted, whether they myght allowe or diſallowe that bolde enterpryſe of the conſull, whyche dyd appere to hange all vpon chaunce. They knewe the campe was left very nere to Anniball, with an army diſpurueyed of a capitayne: ye and the flowre and ſtrengthe of the ſame armye was taken awaye with the Capytayne, leauynge his campe ſure in nothynge, but onely by the ignoraunce of his ennemies, who were not priuy as then of the conſulles abſence. But what yf it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to be knowen, and that it chaunced Anniball with his wholle army to folowe Nero, hauyng with him but .vi. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fotemen armed, and one. M. horſemen: or that he wold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the reſte, which were left in the campe, without ſtrength or good gouernance. The euil chances, which they had before ſuſteined in the warres, with the late dethe of .ii. conſuls in one yere, increaſed their feare, whyche all had happed to theim, whan there was but one capytayne and one army of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in Italy. Nowe they knewe .ii. myghty armies .ii. va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant capitaines: ye almoſt .ii. Anniballes, to be in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. For Aſdruball the ſonne alſo of Amilcar, hadde many yeres in Spayne, made warre agaynſte the Romayns, where he had hadde two noble victories, ſleynge two greate armies,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:104"/>
and alſo .ii. Scipions, the noble capitayns of the ſame. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that he myghte glory aboue Anniball, bothe of his ſpedy paſſage ouer the mountaynes, and alſo of drawyng with hym the frenchemen to battayle. For euen where the one had almoſte loſte the greatter parte of his menne, by hungre and colde (whiche two be the greatteſt myſeries of warre): euen there had the other gathered together a gret puiſſance. They rekened alſo, that Claudius Nero ſhuld haue to do with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty capitayn, whom he knewe before had mocked &amp; illuded hym in Spayne lyke a child, with deceiteful intretyng of conditions of peace: wherby he eſcaped out of the ſtraytes, wherein he was indaungered. Thus throughe feare (whiche is thinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretour of all thynges to the worſte) they eſtemed the power of theyr ennemyes to be great, and their owne to be ſmall.</p>
            <p>¶ In the meane tyme Nero the conſull, after he had ſo farre traueyled frome the daunger of his ennemies, that he iudged he myght ſafely diſcouer his ſecrete enterpriſe: he then called together his ſouldiours, and ſpake vnto them ſayinge:</p>
            <p>There was neuer any enterpryſe taken in hande by any capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, whiche was in apparence more bolde, and in effect more ſure then this was. For I wyll nowe brynge you (ſayde he) to a certayne and ſure victorye. For we goo to a battayle, for the whiche my felowe Liuius had before as many fotemenne and horſemen appoynted hym of the ſenate, as he wolde deſyre. Ye ſuche a numbre as he wolde not haue deſyred a greatter, if he ſhulde haue ben appoynted to fyght with Anniball hym ſelfe: and nowe, by the fame of the comynge of the other conſull, with his armye, beinge ioyned to the other: we ſhall not fayle to haue an vndoubted victory. For fame is the thynge that gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth victory in battayle. Yea ſmall thinges oft tymes driue the hertes and myndes of men, eyther in to feare or in to a good hope. And the hole glorye and honour of all the good ſpede ſhall be gyuen to vs. For euer that, whiche cometh laſt, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the honour to it.</p>
            <p>¶ With this comforte he led them forward on theyr way, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynge by a great multitude of men and women of the countrey, that came forth to mete them with great fauour and prayſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge: namynge them the patrons and defendours of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9127:104"/>
of theyr children. Wherfore they prayed vnto the goddes for theyr proſperous returne with victory and tryumphe. And in declarynge theyr loue towardes theyr ſouldiours, they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them cattell, vitayles, and other neceſſarye thynges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they hertely deſyred them to take at theyr pleaſure. And they on the other ſyde, thankefully receiuing that they neded, went on theyr waye, eatynge whan they were hungry, and but ſeldome toke any reſte, tyl they came nere to the campe of the other conſull M. Liuius. Then ſent Claudius meſſangers to his felowe, aduertyſynge hym of his comynge, to knowe his mynd, whether it were beſt for hym and his company, to come to hym pryuely or openly, in the nyght tyme or in the day: and whether he ſhoulde entre in to his campe, or make an other campe for hym ſelfe and his army: Liuius anſwered, that beſt it was, he entered into his campe ſecretly in the nyght. For the more ſuertie wherof, he gaue a pryuy watche worde or token, wherby one tribune ſhulde receyue an other, one centurio or hundredour an other, one horſeman an other, and one foteman ſhulde receyue an other. And it was thought, that there was ſpace ynoughe in the fyrſte campe, to receyue hym and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye, ſenſe thoſe that came with Claudius Nero brought lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more with them, but onely theyr armour, for the ſpedineſſe of theyr war. Liuius tentes were then pitched nere to Sena, and Aſdruball reſted not paſt halfe a myle thence. When Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro approched, he couered hym with mountaynes and hylles, tyll it was nighte. Then kepynge greate ſylence, they entred the campe of Liuius, and were euery man broughte into the tentes by his lyke officer, where they were friendly and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylly receyued, with great ioye and gladneſſe .L. Portius the pretor had his campe ioynynge to the campe of the conſull. The daye folowynge they counſayled, what was beſt then to be done. Some gaue aduyſe, that Nero with his company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge wery, ſhulde reſte them certayne dayes, and that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle ſhulde be differred, tyll they were fully refreſhed of their longe trauayle: and in the meane tyme to knowe the maner of theyr ennemyes. But Nero wolde in noo wyſe agree therto, he inſtantly deſyred them ſo to worke, that his ſecrete enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe, whiche by his ſwyfte comynge thither was made ſure, ſhulde not by theyr long tarying be made folyſhe and voyde.

With ſpede makyng Aſdruball and his hoſt may be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, er euer I departe: and then may I with lyke ſpeede returne to my company into Apulia. But whoo ſo by prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge of the tyme, gyueth ſpace to his ennemies, he cauſeth my campe in Apulia to be delyuered to Anniball, and openeth the way for hym to come hither to be ioyned to his brother, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal at his pleaſure. Wherfore incontinent let vs go to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle: and therby bothe our ennemyes, that be abſente in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia, and alſo thoſe that be here preſent at hand, ſhalbe decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: the other by thynkynge our numbre there to be no leſſe then it was, and theſe by thinking your numbre to be nothynge increaſed.</p>
            <p>¶ After theſe earneſt wordes of Claudius, they departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the counſaile, and euery man armed hym ſelfe, and were put in good order of battayle. The Carthaginenſes alſo were alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come out of theyr campe, and ſtode in array redy to fyght, and bothe the armies had without taryeng gone to gither, had not Aſdrubal for a ſeaſon cauſed his company to ſtay. He, with certayne other horſemen in his company, rode before his hoſt: where he perceiued amonges the Romaynes, to be many olde ſhildes, whiche he had not ſeene before. Alſo he marked many carreine leane and ouer laboured horſes. He thought alſo the numbre of his ennemies was greatter then it was wont to be. Wherfore hauyng a miſtruſt of that, whiche in dede was true: he blewe the retraite. And incontinent ſent certayn of his men to the ryuer, where the Romayne horſes were watered, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye and marke, whether any of theyr horſes were diſcoloured by daſhinge with myre of the waye, or with duſt: wherby they might appere to be of late iourneyed. He alſo cauſed ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ride a farre of aboute theyr campes, to ſe, whether the trenche that enuironed the campe, were enlarged any whyt or not. Furthermore to marke, whether the trumpet, did ſounde ones or two tymes within the campe of the Romaynes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge deceiued him ſo moche, as when worde was broughte him, that the campes were nothynge enlarged: but that there were but twaine as was before, one of Liuius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſull, the other of L. Portius: and neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altered otherwiſe then they fyrſte were. Neuertheleſſe it troubled hym ſore, beinge a wyſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9127:107"/>
man and moche vſed to warres with the Romaynes, when it was ſhewed hym, that the trumpet blewe but ones in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors campe: but in the other it blewe two tymes: wherfore he iudged ſurely, that bothe the conſuls were there. Whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he began to muſe, howe the other conſull ſhulde be depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted from his brother Anniball. He could not deuyſe the thing as it was, that his brother was ſo illuded by the departinge of the capitayne from his campe, whiche was not farre of, with part of his power. He iudged, that he had ſuſteined ſome gret loſſe: wherby he durſt not followe the conſull. Wherfore he feared greatly, leaſt whan all was loſt before, he was come to late to his brother with ſocours. He alſo miſtruſted, that his letters neuer came to Anniballes handes, but that they, with his meſſangers, were taken vp by the waye: vpon the ſyghte wherof the other conſull was come with haſt to vanquiſhe him alſo. Beinge in this great perplexitie, he cauſed all the fires to be put oute, and euery man to truſſe vp his ſtuffe and baggage: and in the begynninge of the nyghte, he with his hole hoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſecretely, folowinge two guides. Whoo had not farre gone with them, but partly for feare, and partely beinge trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the rumour of the armye, toke no good hede to their waye: wherfore they ſecretely ſlypped awaye, leauyng theim without a guide. Some wandered abrode in the fieldes, ſome beinge wery and ouerwatched, laide them bowne to ſlepe and to reſt them, leauynge theyr ſtandardes. When the daye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, Aſdruball cauſed his ſtandardes to go before the hoſte alonge the ſyde of the ryuer of Metaurus, ſekynge for fordes, where he myght paſſe ouer: but the further he went vp the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the hyer were the bankes. Thus wanderynge ſtyll after the crokes and tourninges of the banke, ſekyng a place of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: he ſpente a great parte of the daye in waſte: wherby the Romaynes had gotten tyme and ſpace to followe them. Fyrſt Nero with his horſemen ouer toke them: ſone after came Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Portius with his light harneſſed men. They ſlewe many of Aſdruball his folke, that abode behynd in the fieldes to reſt them. Aſdruball ſeinge no remedy to eſcape, ſoughte for ſome hyll by the riuer ſyde, wheron he myghte lodge his hoſt. By that tyme was Liuius alſo come with al his power of fotemen, armed and in good array. Then ioynynge theyr companies to gether, they put euery man in order. Claudius Nero led the
<pb facs="tcp:9127:108"/>
ryght wynge. Liuius kept the lefte wyng. Portius the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor came in the myddell warde.</p>
            <p>¶Whan Aſdruball ſawe to remedy, but that he muſt needes fyght, he left the fortifiyng of his campe, and put his people in array. In the forefront he ſet his elephantes: about theim on the lefte hande agaynſt Claudius Nero the conſull, he ſet his frenchemen: not for that he truſted to theim moche hym ſelfe, but bicauſe he thought his ennemies feared theim moſt. The ryghte wynge he kepte hym ſelfe with his ſpanyardes, his olde meane of warre, in whom his moſte truſte was. The Liguriens, men of a countrey of Italy, were ſette in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell behynde the elephantes. There was a greatte hylſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Frenchemen and Claudius Nero: ſo that he by no meanes with his hoſt, might come to fight with theim. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they ſtode ſtyll a good ſpace without doing of any thing. But betweene Aſdruball and Liuius fyers and mortall was the fyght. There were the greate numbre of Romayne fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men agaynſt the multitude of Spaniardes his expert warry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and alſo agaynſt the Liguriens, which wer very ſtronge and valiant men. The elephantes alſo dyd at the fyrſte moche diſpleaſure. Claudius ſeinge that he coulde not haue to doo with the Frenchemen, tourned aboute his company, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng a compaſſe, came on the other ſyde of Aſdruballes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye. Than were the Spanyardes and the Liguriens ſlayne on all parties, and the fyght was alredy come to the french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were able to make ſmal reſiſtence: for many of their company were ſhronken away and feble for labour and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchynge, as they be a people that can not well away with peyne. Many of theim were there ſlayne. Many alſo of the elephantes were ſlayne by the Romaynes, but moo by theyr owne rulars that rode vppon theim. For after they were ones ſtryken and aferde, the beaſtes were ſo vnruly, and dyd ſoo moche hurte to theyr owne Carthaginenſes hoſte: that theyr owne kepers and ryders ſlewe theim.</p>

And yf any began to flee, he anon brought them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9127:108"/>
backe to the battayle, and reſtored agayne the fielde, whyche in diuers places was ſlaked. At the laſt, whan he ſaw no helpe, but that withoute remedy he muſte loſe the fielde: not myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to lyue after ſo great a ſlaughter of his men and frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, whyche for his ſake vndertooke that voyage: he ranne his horſe with the ſpurres into the myddell of the Romayne hoſte: where to declare the noble valour of his ſtomacke, of whome he was deſcended, lyke the ſonne of Amilcar, and brother to Anniball, he valyantly fought, and fyghtyng was ſlayne. Greate was the ſlaughter of the Carthaginenſes in that battayle: ſo that it was thought equall to the Romaynes loſſe at Cannas, as well for the numbre of menſlayne, as for the loſſe of the capitaynes. There was of Aſdrubals hoſte in this battayle ſlayne ſyx and fyfty thouſande men, and there were .v. thouſande and foure hundred taken pryſoners. The pray at the ſpoyle was great, bothe of golde and ſyluer, and alſo of the Romayne priſoners, whiche before Aſdruball bad taken. Of whyche Romayne pryſoners, there were founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue .iiii. M. The Romayns loſt in this battayle almoſte .viii. M. men. On the morowe woorde was broughte to Liuius, that thoſe frenchemen and Ligures, whiche were left on liue at the battayle the daye before, were nowe aſſembled togither agayne, and went away without any capitayn or kepyng good order, ſo that they myght ſoone be all ſlayne, yf he wolde ſend but one wynge of horſemen to purſue theim. Not ſo ſayd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius, we wyll ſuffre ſome of our ennemies to eſcape, whyche ſhal remayne and be meſſangers, both of the diſtruction of our ennemies, and alſo of our noble honour and proweſſe.</p>
            <p>¶Claudius Nero, the night after the battayle foughten, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with his company agayne toward his owne camp, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo moche haſt in his retourne, that the ſyxt day folowing he was come to his owne campe, and to the frontiers of his ennemy Annibal, he made ſuche ſpede, that no meſſenger was come thyther before him, whiche hadde broughte any newes of the victorie. Wherefore his perſonalle comynge, with the ſodein declaration of their good ſpede, cauſed ſo greatte ioye and gladnes in the Romayne armie, as thoughe an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie comforte had ben ſent theym after an extreme doloure.

For after Claudius departynge towarde his ſelowe, frome the ſonne ryſynge to the ſome ſettynge, the ſenatours neuer departed frome the ſenate howſe: neyther wente the cyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens out of the market place.

            <p>IN Spayne betwene the Romayns and the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes thus was the countrey diuyded. Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, was dryuen with his companye into the vttermoſte parte of Spayne, and to the yles called the Gades. The reſt of the countrey eaſtwardes, was vnder the dominion of the Romaynes, oneleſſe it were very fewe cities, whyche were kepte by the Affricanes: to whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours Hanno, a newe capitayne was ſent from Affrica, with a newe armye, in ſteede of Aſdruball, that was ſlayne. This Hanno had alſo hyred a great nomber of men of warre in Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberia. With this great hoſte he ioyned to Mago. Agaynſte whome Scipio ſent M. Sillanus, with .x. M. footemen, and v .C. horſemen. And he paſſynge the hye hilles, and manifold daungerous paſſages and ſtraites of Spayn, made ſuch ſpede, that by the guyding of certayne runawayes of Celtiberia, he came within ten myles of his ennemies, before any knowledge was hadde, or any fame was bruted of his comynge. There he ſtode for a ſeaſon, tyll he had by the ſayde runawayes or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes knowledge, that his ennemies were lodged in .ii. cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes: the Celtiberiens on the left hande of the hye waie, and were to the noumbre of .ix.

For they ſcarſely were ſuffered to put theyr ſcalinge ladders to the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: ſo great was the violence of the dartes and other ingins, whiche were throwen at them. And ſo ſone as any were raiſed vp thervnto, and men theron, ſtriuinge to aſcende: anone they were eyther throwen downe, men and all, by the ſouldiours of the towne, hauinge forkes made for that purpoſe: orels they were in ieoperdy to be drawen vp ladders men and all, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of iron hokes that were throwen vpon the ladders, taking ſuche ſure holde on them, that the clymbers were often times pulled vp farre frome the grounde, and hanged longe by the roundes of the ladders. Thus continued the aſſault very long, and was verye fyers and daungerous on bothe partes. Then had Scipio deuided his hoſt in thre partes, to the intente one parte ſhulde euer aſſaulte the towne, while the other reſted.</p>
            <p>Wherfore he commaunded thoſe, whiche were at the fyrſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte, to withdrawe to their tentes, and reſt them: and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent with other two partes of his freſhe ſouldiours, he gaue a newe aſſaulte on two partes of the towne: ſo that the defon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, beinge wery with the longe ſuſteinyng the furſt aſſault, and alſo ſoore afraide, as deſperate, leauinge the walles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe them: wherupon the towne was wonne, and great occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made of people of all kyndes and ages.</p>

Betula .xlv. M. of horſemen and fotemen. Certaine daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr metynge there were ſhyrmiſſhes and iuſtes betwene the horſemen and the lighte fotemen of bothe the armies. At the laſt they bothe deſcended into the fieldes with al theyr po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in good order of battayle. The middell wardes kept the Romaynes on the one ſyde, and the Carthaginenſes and the Affricanes on the other ſyde: the wynges of both the parties were of ſpaniardes and hyred ſouldiours. Thus ſtode they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye to do battayle, tyll it was night, without ſtroke ſtrikinge: and euen ſo they dyd certayne dayes folowynge: So that euer it was bruted in bothe armies, that the myddle wardes ſhulde be ſtill of the Romaynes and Carthaginenſes, where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtrength was, and where that moſt noble and experte men of warre were: betwene whom alſo reſted the cauſe and chiefe grounde of the warre. Scipio beinge aduertiſed, that his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies truſted and beleued, that this order ſhulde be kept ſtill in the battayle: againſte the daye, wherin he thought to fight, he chaunged all his order. Fyrſt in the euenyng before, he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded all his horſemen, before the dawnynge of the day, to eate ſome meate, and then to be armed, and euery one of them to haue his horſe alſo made redy for the battayle. Whiche his commaundement they diligently accompliſhed. Then Scipio, ſo ſone as the day appered, cauſed al his horſemen, with lyght armour, to inuade the ſtation or campe of the Carthaginenſes: and he with the reſt of his hole hoſte folowed in good arraye, but otherwyſe ordered, then eyther his ennemies or his owne company loked for. For he put his Romaynes in the wynges, and in the middle he put all ſtraungers and hyred ſouldiours. Aſdruball, heringe the greate noyſe of the Romayne horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with the ſodayne rumour and feare of his owne menne, ranne out of his tente. And when he perceyued all the fieldes garnyſhed with his ennemies, he ſent forthe anone his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt the Romayn horſemen: and ſone after he hym ſelfe with all his fotemen came forth of his campe kepyng the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rdre that he had doue certayne dayes before, without chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge any parte therof. The battayle betwene the horſemen endured longe, but whan the hoſt of fotemen were within half a myle together: Scipio cauſed his horſemen to withdrawe them ſelues, whom he deuided then in two partes, and cauſed to ſtande behynde the two wynges, to be euer redy for theyr
<pb facs="tcp:9127:111"/>
ayde and ſuccour. Nowe was his myddle warde moſt of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes: whom he commaunded to marche forwardes, not faſt, but a ſofte pace. Then ſente he a meſſanger to Sillanus and Martius, who gouerned the lefte wynge, chargyng them to make ſpeede forwardes on theyr partes, in lyke maner as they ſawe hym do with the ryght winge, whiche he ledde hym ſelfe: ſo that the wynges might be fyghtyng a good ſpace before the myddle wardes ſhulde mete. In this ordre they wente for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, ſpreadynge theyr wynges, and makynge a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the myddell of theyr hoſte. For the ſpanyardes in the middel went a moch ſofter pace then the wynges: wherby the winges were al redy come to ſtrokes, and fought a long ſpace, before that the Affricans and Carthaginenſes (in whom reſted the great ſtrength of theyr ennemies) were come to any ſtroke ſtrikinge. Agayne, to bende to any part of the winges to helpe theyr felowes that foughte, they durſte not, leſte they ſhulde open theyr battayle to theyr ennemies, whiche came directly vpon them. By this meanes the winges wer anone ouercome, and dryuen into the myddell warde: and no meruayle. For the yong and the hyred ſouldiours of Spayne were marched with the ſtronge and olde warriours of the Romaines and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Agayne, Aſdrubals men were ſo ſodainely taken in the mornynge, that they had no tyme to receyue any ſuſtenaunce before the battayle. Wherfore whan the daye was ſomewhat ſpent, they waxed feynte and feble. And for that intent Scipio purpoſely tracted and prolonged the tyme, before the myddell wardes ſhoulde mete: to the ende the heate of the ſonne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the myddell of the daye, with the longe ſtandynge in harneis, and lacke of meate and drynke, ſhulde take from them bothe theyr ſtrength and corage. Thus they beinge wery, and aſſayled bothe before with the middell warde, and alſo on the ſydes with the Romayne wynges, were conſtrained to recule. Whiche they dyd a great whyle, kepynge ſtyll good ordre in theyr withdrawynge: for Aſdruball continually cried to them, and therto exhorted them, ſayinge: If they wolde by lyttell &amp; lyttell withdrawe them, they ſhulde ſone get the mountaines, whiche were at theyr backes: and then they ſhulde be ſure out of the daunger of theyr ennemies. But at the laſt, ſeinge them ſelues ouercome, and ſo many of theyr companye ſlayne on all partes: theyr feare ouercame ſhame. Wherfore with greate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9127:111"/>
ſlaughter they fledde to theyr campe. The Romaynes purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them faſte, and had taken theyr campe and tentes, had not a vehement ſtorme of rayne ſodeynly come vppon them, with ſuche violence, that euery man was gladde to gette hym to his owne tent and pauilion.</p>
            <p>¶ The Carthaginenſes, althoughe the nighte drewe faſte on them, being very ſore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and wet with the rayne (wherby they had neceſſary occaſions of ſlepe &amp; reſt) yet were they ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, that they ceaſſed not, ſtylle to ſtrengthen and to fortifie their campe with dyches and ſtones, whiche they gathered in all partes about them: truſtinge more to the ſtrength thereof, then to theyr armour. Then many of the hyred ſouldiours of the hoſte of the Carthaginenſes lefte Aſdruball, and came to Scipio. Dyuerſe ſtronge townes alſo were delyuered vp to hym: with all the garriſons, whiche were left in them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Aſdruball, thinkynge hym ſelfe more ſure by fleinge, then by his abydinge, ſecretly departed from thenſe in the nyghte.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio in the mornynge, being aduertiſed of the departing of his ennemies, ſent his horſemenne before: and he hym ſelfe with his army ſodeynly folowed them: The horſemen at length ouertoke them, and made ſo many ſkyrmyſhes with them, that therby they were ſtayed, tyll theyr hole armie of fotemen alſo ouer toke them. Then was there great occuion made of them with ſmall reſiſtence. And Aſdruball with .vii. M. men with hym, was fayne to flee to the next hye mountayne, where they encamped them ſelues, and were ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any daunger or hurt, that coulde be done them. Sone after he ſlypped from thens, and ſtale to the ſea, whiche was not farre of: where he toke ſhyppynge hym ſelfe, with Mago, and a fewe with hym, and went to the iles beyonde the furtheſt parte of Spayne, called Gades, leauynge the moſte parte of his men behynde hym at theyr owne aduenture, to prouide for theim ſelues. Parte of them went to the Romaynes, parte to ſuch cities as wer then remayninge in the dominion of the Carthaginenſes.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio, after the dryuinge away of Aſdruball and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, wyllyng vtterly to expell all the Carthaginenſes out of Spayne: layde ſiege to Illiturgus: which after longe trauail he wan with force, and cauſed his men to ſlee al that euer they founde on lyue, man woman and childe. And after they ſette the towne on fyre, and threwe downe the walles to the earth,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:112"/>
that the place, whiche hadde ben the chiefe receptacle of theyr ennemies, myghte be clerely defaced, and the memorye therof abolyſſhed for euer. Frome thenſe he wente towarde Caſtulo, with his armie.

Thus were they clerelye expelled oute of Spayne, the .xiiii. yere after the warres fyrſte beganne, and the .v. yere after that Scipio was appoynted by the ſenate to be capitayne of the army, and was aſſigned to warre in Spayn as his prouince.</p>

            <p>¶ Vpon this decree of the ſenate the conſulles wrote letters eyther to other, and agreed, that lyke as they had with one good wyll and mind gouerned and defended the cuntreye, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the tyme of their offyce: euen ſoo nowe they ſhoulde bothe at one tyme come into the citie of Rome, althoughe they came frome diuers partes. Wherefore it was agreed, that who ſo euer of theim came fyrſte to the citie of Preneſte, ſhulde there tary the comynge of his felowe. Accordyng to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9127:112"/>
the appoyntement, there they mette bothe in one baye: and frome thenſe they ſent meſſangers to the citie, deſyrynge the ſenatours to mete them in the houſe of Bellona the goddes of warre, the third day folowing. There wer they receiued with a great multitude both of ſenators and of citezins with goodly ſalutations and great thankes for theyr politike gouernance of their roumes: by whoſe helpe and dexteritie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth was nobly preſerued and aduaunced. Soone after they were brought into the ſenate: there accordinge to the olde cuſtome of conquerours, they declared theyr noble actes, whiche they had achieued for the common welthe of the citie of Rome: and for the ſame deſyred, fyrſt that honour myghte be giuen to the immortall goddes: and then that they mighte with triumphe entre the citie. Whiche theyr requeſt was graunted them. As touchinge the maner of theyr entringe in triumphe, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, that they ſhuld not come in ſeuerally but together, as they vainquiſhed theyr ennemies together. They agreed alſo betwene them ſelues, that bicauſe the victorye was had in the prouince of M. Liuius, &amp; alſo bicauſe Liuius army was come to Rome with him, where Nero his hoſt coulde in no wyſe be brought thither: Therfore ſhuld Liuius ride in a charyot, and his ſouldiours in order followe hym. Nero ſhuld ryde by hym on horſebacke without any of his ſouldiours to folowe hym. Claudius was contented to gyue the honour to his felowe: by whiche his gentilnes he wan moche the more honour &amp; praiſe. For euery man ſaid of him, that he on horſebacke in .vi. dais had ridden the length of all Italy, and had fought with Aſdruball in the borders of Fraunce, what time Anniball iudged hym to be in Apulia. So that his onely name was able to kepe Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball lurkyng in his campe, and his onely comyng was the cauſe of the victory againſt Aſdrubal. Wherfore (ſaid they) ride the one conſull neuer ſo highe in his charyot, yet the other conſul, that rode but on horſebacke, was worthy of the very triumph. ye although Nero dyd go but on his fote: yet was he worthye of glory and fame perpetual. With theſe prayſes they folowed Nero into the capitoly or palaice in Rome. Where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented moche money of theyr gayne, and that was put into the treaſory. On the morowe both the conſuls, and alſo the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, prayſed moche L. Veturius, and Q. Cecilius: deſiring that they might, for the next yere folowing, be choſen conſuls.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:113"/>
Which at the next election was done, and bothe they appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with .ii. conſuls armies, to kepe warre agaynſt Anniball.</p>
            <p>¶ After all thynges were putte in good order, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the citie, and wente into the countrey of the Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and in ſhorte tyme they had brought all that countrey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubiection.

Whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to haue his frendes in Affrica the more obedyent and redy to hym in all his neceſſities, he appoynted to ſayle ouer in to his countrey, there to make hym ſelfe as ſtronge as myght be, for the ayde and ſuccour of the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whan neede requyred. And Sillanus ſoone after retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Scipio to Tarracon.</p>
            <p>¶ Than P. Scipio, wylling to certifie the ſenate of his great victory and happie chaunces, ſente his brother L. Scipio to Rome, as is before reherſed, who ledde with hym many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men priſoners, whome he hadde before taken in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: whervppon he was meruaylouſely honoured and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all men. Yet he alone, that hadde deſerued all the ſayde honour, eſtemed all his feates done in Spayne, to be nothyng in compariſon of thoſe thynges whyche he had conceyued in his mynde. He looked for the conqueſte of greate Carthage and Affrica, as the ende of his warre, and the conſummation of his honour and glory. Wherfore, to worke in tyme all thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, that afterwardes ſhoulde ſerue for his pourpoſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyned to wynne vnto hym the hartes of princis, whyche were borderars vnto that countrey. And fyrſte he mynded to attempt kynge Syphax.</p>
            <p>¶ This Syphax was kyng of a people in Affrica, called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſuli, adioynyng to the Moores, and lying on the other ſide of the ſea Mediterrane, ouer againſt new Carthage in Spain, who at that tyme was a great friende to the Carthaginenſes: To hym he ſent C.

<pb facs="tcp:9127:114"/>
the kynge was verye gladde and well pleaſed. And conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge in his mynde the good fortune, whyche the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hadde in all partes, and ſeynge the power of his olde friendes the Carthaginenſes to be ſoo greately decayed, that in Italy they hadde nowe lyttell to doo, and in Spayne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge: He agreed with Lelius, to become a friende to the Romaynes. But he ſayde, he woulde no further procede to the confirmation of the amitie betweene them, tyll he myghte perſonally ſpeake with Scipio, the chief capitayn of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes. Whervppon Lelius takynge aſſuraunce of hym, for the ſafe goynge and commynge of his capitayne, retourned to Scipio. And declared vnto hym, howe he had ſpedde, as is before declared. Scipio indgynge his frendſhyppe to be a great helpe and furtheraunce to his purpoſe, touchynge his deſyrous affayres in Affrica, bothe for his greatte ſtrengthe and rycheſſe, and alſo for that his countrey was adioynyng to Carthage, directly ouer agaynſte Spayne, leauynge Lucius Martius at Tarracon, and Sillanus at newe Carthage, with a power ſufficient for the defence of Spayne: he with Lelius in two galeys or rowbarges of fyue oores a piece, paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into Affrica.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe it happened, that euen the ſame tyme Aſdruball, who of late had ben dryuen out of Spayne, was newely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued in the ſame hauen, with ſeuen galeys, and caſtyng their ankers, drewe as neere the ſhore as they coulde. Aſdruball, perceyuinge the other two galeys or rowbarges of Scipios, comynge towardes the ſame hauen: knewe full welle, they were the veſſelles of his ennemyes. Wherefore not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, but that they beynge ſoo fewe in numbre, myght ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyly be oppreſſed and vanquyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the other, hauynge good wynde to theyr furtherance, entred the hauen, before the galeys of Aſdruball myght gette out, ſuche ruffelinge noiſe and littell ſhifte was made by his men. Wherefore when the Romaynes had ones gotten the kinges hauen: no man durſte be ſo bolde to meddell with theym. Thus wente the two capyteynes on lande: fyrſte Aſdruball, and then Scipio with Lelius, and bothe wente to the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges palayes: whoſe comynge dydde vnto Syphax greatte

honour. For it was neuer before ſeene, that the gouernoures of the .ii. moſt noble ſeignories, that were in thoſe dayes in all the world, came euer to his palayce vpon one day, to deſire his amitie and peace. The kynge ryght gentylly receyued theim bothe, and ſens theyr chaunces were to mete both at one time in his howſe: he dydde what he myght, to brynge them both to communication, truſtynge therby to appeaſe all ſtryfe and diſcorde for any mattier that hadde beene betweene theym. But that Scipio refuſed to doo, affyrmynge, that there was no pryuate matter of diſpleaſure betweene hym and Aſdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, whyche by communication or hearynge of friendes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be determined. Neyther was there any thynge tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the common welthe of his countrey, wherin he might trauayle or intreate, oneleſſe it were by ſpeciall auctoritie or commaundement of the wholle ſenate. Than the kynge made great inſtance to Scipio, ſeinge they were bothe his gueſtes at ones, that he wolde be contented to be ſo ordered, that he myghte not haue cauſe to expelle any of theim bothe frome his table. Scipio at the kynges requeſte was not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſytte with Aſdruball at oone table, but alſo, for the kynges pleaſure, he laye in the ſame bedde that he dyd. For Scipio was naturally of ſuche dexteritie, and ſo confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to reaſon, that thereby he not onely wanne the herte of Syphax: but alſoo he broughte his mooſte mortall enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye Aſdruball in more admyration of hym, after he hadde ſeene his conuerſation, than euer he dydde before, for any acte that euer he dydde. Wherevppon he beganne than to coniecture and to iudge, that Syphax, with all his myghte was become friende to the Romaynes. Suche polycie he deemed Scipio to haue in wynnynge the hertes of men. And than he beganne to dyuiſe, that it was neceſſary for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, to conſult among theim ſelues, not how Spayne was loſte, and myghte be recouered: but rather howe they myghte keepe their domynion in Affrica. Specyally he was moued thus to be in doubte, for that he iudged, that ſoo greatte a capytayne of the Romaynes, woulde not leaue the countrey, that he lately hadde conquered, to wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in a ſtraunge domynyon, onely with two galeys, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge behynde hym his greatte power, and committyng hym vnto the daungier of an vnknowen kynge: but onely vppon

ſome truſte that he had therby to wynne Affrica.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio concludinge a peace and amitie with the kynge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from hym, leauynge Aſdruball wrapped in manyfolde troubles. And within foure dayes after, ſuſteynynge many ſtormes on the ſeas, he arriued in ſafegard at newe Carthage.</p>

            <p>IT is before declared, howe Sillanus had ſecrete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with Maſſaniſſa, and had wonne hym to be friende to the Romaynes: but the concluſyon of this communication was deferred, tyll Maſſaniſſa myghte ſpeake with Scipio perſonallye, for the more ſure and faythfull aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theyr alliaunce. Whiche cauſed P. Scipio to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe that longe peynfull iourney, to come nere to the ſea ſide, to mete hym. Of whoſe approchynge Maſſaniſſa, being in the yle called the Gades, was aduertiſed by L.

Wherfore he deſired licence of him, that he mighte, with his horſemen paſſe ouer in to Spayne, there to ſpoyle and waſt the countrey nere to the ſea ſyde.</p>
            <p>¶ By this perſwaſyon he obteyned lycence, and came ouer in to Spayne. At his fyrſte arryuaile, he ſente thre noble men of Numidie to Scipio, wherof he wylled him to reteyne with hym two of them, as pledges: And to ſende againe the third of theim, to acertayne hym of the tyme and place of theyr me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge: by whoſe conducte he myght be broughte to the place appoynted. When the daye came, they met to gether, with a ſmalle numbre in their companye: where Maſſaniſſa, at the fyrſte ſyghte, althoughe before he had a greate admyration of Scipio, throughe the noble fame of his actes: yet vppon the ſyght of hym and his preſence, he had hym in moche more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For beſydes that of nature he was indowed with goodlye and large ſtature: wherein he ſhewed a marueylouſe

magnifycence: yet the ſame was ſet forthe the more by reaſon of his goodly long heare, and his comly apparell, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and warrelyke faſhion. He was alſo of a myddle age, at his full ſtrength, and was become ſo beautyfull after a ſickenes, of whiche he was late recouered: that his luſty youthe ſemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: wherby he was more pleaſaunt to beholde. At theyr firſt metyng, Maſſaniſſa half aſtonied, gaue hym humble than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for his goodneſſe ſhewed, in ſendynge home his brothers ſonne: whom he before had as priſoner. From which tyme (he ſayde) he ceaſſed not to ſeke occaſion of his friendſhyp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, for the whiche, nowe that he had obteyned it, he gaue thankes to the goddes. Truſtynge that he wold ſo apply him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe in his affayres and the Romaynes cauſes, that theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthe was neuer more aduaunced by one man, beinge a ſtraunger vnto them. Which his harty beneuolence and good wyll that he bare to them, he coulde neuer before (althoughe he wolde) haue ſhewed to hym and to them in Spayne, beinge to hym a ſtraunge, and an vnknowen countrey. But in caſe the Romaynes wolde ſende Scipio as theyr capitayne into Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where he was bred and brought vp, he doubted not, there to do them ſuch hie ſeruice, that the honour of Carthage ſhuld no longe while endure.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio gladly behelde hym, and alſo heard hym: knowinge ſurely, that he was the chiefe of al the horſemen in the army of his ennemies, and a luſty yonge man, of a nobleherte and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Wherfore after they had entreated of theyr buſines, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge faythe the one to the other, of faythfull loue and amity, they departed: Scipio to Tarracon, and Maſſaniſſa to the ile of Gades. but bycauſe it myghte appere to Mago, that he had done ſome feate in Spayne: Scipio ſuffered him to ſpoile certayne goodes and groundes on the ſea coſt, and to take the praye with hym.</p>
            <p>¶ Mago beinge deſperate of any good ſpede to be hadde in Spayne, was in mynde to ſayle into Affrica, when ſodeynlye letters came to hym from Carthage, commaundyng hym with his nauy of ſhyppes, that he had at the Gades, that he ſhulde ſayle ouer into Italy. Where hyringe as moche people as he myghte, of frenchemen, and Liguriens, he ſhoulde with all ſpede ioyn him ſelfe with Annibal. And for that purpoſe great ſummes of money were ſent him from Carthage. Beſydes that
<pb facs="tcp:9127:116"/>
he leuied and exacted as moch money as he coulde of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditanes, compellinge euery man to brynge in his money. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes this he ſpoyled the temples. With all this riches he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued at the ile of Minorque, where he gathered together .ii. M. yonge men, whom in the beginnynge of ſommer he toke with hym, and fayled ouer into Italy with .xxx. great ſhippes of warre, and many other ſhyppes loden with prouiſyon. He had in his hoſte at that tyme .xii. M. fotemen, and two. M. horſemen. With this numbre he ſodeynlye arriued at Geene, whiche towne he toke with ſmall reſyſtence, beinge vnprouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of men of warre. From thenſe he ſayled alonge the coſtes of Liguria, nexte to the mountaynes called Alpes, and hering, that a people of that countreye, called Ingawni, helde warre with certayne mountanoys called Epanterii: he landed there, and makynge a leage or amitie with the Iagawnes, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to inuade the mountanoys with certayne of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The reſt he ſent to Carthage, to defende the coſtes of the ſea there. For it was bruted abrode, that Scipio was mynded to lande his nauy in Affrica.</p>
            <p>¶ He had no longe ſeaſon taryed there, but his armye ſtil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. For the frenchemen dayly reſorted vnto hym, hering the fame and glory of his name. Of his arriuaile in Liguria a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Geene, Sp.

For a newe armye was come with Mago from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, to begynne a newe warre lyke the other: onelye the capytayne therof was chaunged. Theſe newes moued moch the ſenatours. Wherfore they ſente letters to M. Liuius, then proconſull, commaundynge hym to brynge his hoſt from Hetruria to Arminius. Cn. Seruilius the pretour hadde alſo commaundement, to bringe thyther from Rome two newe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Thus laye bothe the hoſtes of Romaynes, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Carthaginenſes, with theyr friendes, the oone not farre from the other, a longe ſeaſon, without any thynge do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge worthy of memory.</p>

            <p>¶ I am well aſſured, fathers conſcript, that yf I diſſent and agree not to this haſty paſſage into Affrica, two thynges wyll be iudged and ſpoken of me. One is, a ſlownes or a ſlacke tractynge of my mattier, whiche naturally is gyuen me, and that yongemen calle fearefulnes or ſlouthe. And it greueth me lyttell, thoughe they haue ſuche opinion in me, ſens other mens councelles heretofore haue appered glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the fyrſte face: but at lengthe my counſaile hath euer proued beſte and moſte for the common welthe. The ſeconde thynge is, that I ſhoulde for euyll wyl go aboute to hynder the glory of this valyaunt conſull, that daily groweth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth. Frome whyche ſuſpition, yf neyther my faſcion of lyuynge and maners, nor the offyce of Dictatour, whiche I haue borne, nor the roume of a conſull, whiche I haue fyue ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes enioyed: neyther the greate glorye, that I haue wonne both in the tyme of peace and warre, wyl delyuer and pourge me: lette myne age at the leaſt deliuer me therefro For what indifferent contention can be betwene me and hym that in ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res may not matche my ſonne? When I was dictatour, the mayſter of the horſes laboured ſo to the ſenate, that he was made equall with me in auctoritye and rule: whyche thynge neuer was ſeene before. yet neuer manne herde me, eyther priuyly or openly refuſe theyr ordre therin. For I hadde lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to gette by my deedes than by my woordes, that he why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was by other mennes iudgement compared with me, ſhoulde ſhortely after by his owne confeſſyon gyue me the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9127:117"/>
preferrement. Moche leſſe nowe, whan I haue ſo oft borne theſe honourable offices, dooe I intende to ſtryue with this flouryſſhynge younge manne. I letted Anniball of his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, to the intent he myghte nowe be vanquyſſhed of you that be luſty and ſtronge. Reaſon woulde, Pub. Cornelius, that ye ſhoulde be contented (ſens I dy dde neuer ſette more by myne owne fame &amp; honour, or the fame of the people, than I dyd by the common welth) although I do not now preferre your honour and laudis before the common welth. Neuer the leſſe in caſe there were no warre in Italy, or elles ſuche an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, by whoſe vanquyſhing ſmall honour were to be gotten: than he that would kepe the in Italy (although the commune welthe were therby ſomewhat anaunced) myght ſeeme to go aboute to take thy glory from the. But ſens Anniball is our ennemy, who hath with his hooſte theſe .xiiii. yeeres vexed Italy: ſhouldeſt thou P. Cornelius, thynke the to loſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if by thy proweſſe, beynge conſull, thou canſte expelle and driue hym out of this cuntrey, who hath been the cauſe of ſo many of our mens ſlaughter, and of our ſo great diſtruction? Wherby as Luctatius bare away the honourable title of fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhyng the firſte warre with the Carthaginenſes: euen ſoo nowe thou mayſte obteyne the prayſe of fynyſhing this warre. Oneleſſe thou doeſt thynke, that Amilcar than capitayn, was to be preferred before Anniball: or that warre before this: or that victory to be more noble and gloryous, than this ſhall be to the, if it be thy chaunce (being conſull) to ouercome? Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou it more honour, to deliuer Spayne frome our enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than to delyuer Italy? Anniball is no ſuche man, but that who ſo euer wyll choſe to warre in an other place, muſte be reckened rather to feare hym, than to diſpyſe hym. Make the redy therfore, and thynke not to fetche a compaſſe aboute the buſſhe, to goo before in to Affrica, to the intente Anniball ſhoulde folowe the: but goo the nexte waye to woorke, and where ſo euer Anniball be, thyther dyrecte thy warre. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gyueth, that a manne ſhould fyrſt defend his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: or he inuade or aſſaile an other lande. Lette there firſte be peace in Italy, before there be warre in Affrica. And lette feare be fyrſte expelled from vs, or it be driuen vpon other. Yf thou canſte by thy gouernaunce do bothe, fyrſte ouercome Anniball here: and then after aſſayle Carthage. Our treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
<pb facs="tcp:9127:118"/>
is not able to finde .ii. greate armyes: one here, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Affrica. And if it were ſufficient to fynde P. Licinius one hoſt in Italy, and P. Scipio an other alſo in Affrica: what yf it ſhuld chance (as god forbyd, yet ſuche happes haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and maie dooe agayne) that Anniball dyd ouercome Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius, and were comynge towardes Rome: Myght we call the frome Affrica, as we dydde call Quintus Fuluius frome Capua to our ſuccours? Ye, and in Affrica alſo the fortune of warre is doubtfull and variable. Lette thyne owne howſe or famylie be to the a warnyng. Were not thy father and thyn vncle ſlayne, with theyr hooſtes, and all within thyrty dayes ſpace? Yet hadde they before amonge ſtraunge nations, both by ſea and by lande, gotten greatte renoume to the cytie of Rome and all theyr poſterytie. The daye woulde fayle me, or I made an ende, yf I ſhoulde reaken vp the names of kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and capyteynes, whyche raſſhelye haue inuaded the landes of theyr ennemyes, to the vtter vndooynge of theym and theyr armyes. The Athenienſes, leauynge warre at home, ſente a noble yongeman capyteyne, with an huge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye into Sicilia, where beynge ouerthrowen in oone battaile, they hadde ſuche loſſe, that their common welthe was cleane ſubuerted for euer. This outwarde exaumple is to auncient. Let the ſame A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>frica, and the loſſe of our owne conſulle M. Attilius, there taken by the Carthaginenſes, and their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, be to vs a document. In comparyſon of Affrica, Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Scipio, the countreyes of Spayne be but a play or a game. The eſtates of theym be nothynge lyke. For at thy paſſynge into Spayne thou dyddeſte ſayle by the coſtes of Italye and Fraunce, and dyddeſt arryue with thy nauye in the citie of oure friendes. Where ſettynge thy men on lande, thou by ſure wayes were conueyed to Tarracon, the friendes alſo of the Romaynes. Frome Tarracon, thou cameſt to the ryuer of Iberus, where thou foundeſte that noble capytayne L. Martius, &amp; many fyers Romain ſouldiours, left of the armies of thy father and thyne vncle. And ſone after newe Carthage was wonne: bicauſe none of the .iii. hoſtes of the Carthagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes, came to the ſuccour and defence of the citie and their fellowes. Theſe thynges I cannot ſo greatly praiſe: but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the warres in Affrica, they ſhall be founde farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke. For there ſhalte thou fynde no hauen open for our army
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9127:118"/>
and nauie, no grounde peaſyble, no citye of oure fryende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyppe, no kynge our frende. Alſo no place mete for vs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to abyde vppon, or to goo forewardes on. Wherefore whereſoeuer thou looke, thou ſhalte ſee all full of thyne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes. Wylte thou beleeue Syphax and the Numidians? Lette it ſuffyſe the, that thou dyddeſt ones beleue hym. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſhe hardyneſſe doothe neuer proſpere: Deceyte doothe ſoo order it ſelfe in ſmalle thynges, that faythe may be geuen to it: to the intent in great thynges he may deceiue with gret aduauntage. Thy father and vncle were not oppreſſed by the armour of their ennemies: til they were firſt deceiued by their owne felowes and fals friendes the Celtiberiens. Ye thy ſelfe were neuer in ſo great ieopardy through Mago and Aſdrubal capiteines of thyne ennemies, as thou were in by Indibilis and Mandonius, princis of Spaine: whome thou diddeſt take to be thy very frendes. Thyne owne Romain ſouldiors haue of late rebelled agaynſt the: and wilt thou nowe truſt the Nu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mydians? Bothe Syphax and Maſſaniſſa, touchyng the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or rule in Affrica, wil preferre theim ſelues before the Carthaginenſes: yet wyl they gladlier ſuffer the Carthagine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to beare rule there, then any ſtranger. Nowe is there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention &amp; debate betwene them: bicauſe they be not fraied with any forein power: but ſo ſone as the Romain army ſhal appere before theim, they wil ſtraight ioyne them ſelfes together. As in a towne where fier is in a houſe, people wyll aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the quenchyng thereof, for feare of a common hurt or danger. ye ſhal ſee the Carthaginenſes defend theyr walles of their town and cuntrey, their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, their owne houſes, with their wiues and yong thildren, of an other ſort then they defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Spayne. And what if the Carthaginenſes, makyng peace with the kynges that be theyr neyghbours, truſtynge to the ſtrength of their townes, &amp; perceyuing Italy to be made bare of men of warre by thy coming thither with ſuch a power, wil ſende a newe army from Affrica into Italy, or wyll commande Mago, who is already come to the coſtes of the Liguriens, to ioyne with Anniball with all his power: Then ſhall we be in the ſame caſe, wherein we were when Aſdruball paſſed the mounteynes, and was deſcended into Italy. The more ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and valyant Capytaine that thou arte, the moore oughte we and all Italy to reioyce, and to keepe the ſtyll amonge vs.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:119"/>
Thou canſt not deny thy ſelf, but that where Anniball is, there is the head and ſtrength of all this warre. And thou ſayſt, that thy goinge into Affrica ſhall be to drawe Anniball thyther, ſoo that whether it be here or there, with Ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bal thou muſt chef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue to do. And then I praye the aunſwere me, Shalt thou be more ſure in Affrica, beinge there alone, or here in Italye, hauinge the other conſull thy felowe and his hoſt ioyned with the? And if thou wilte ſeke the experience therof, let Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Liuius, the late conſulles, be to the an exaumple and a lernynge. Agayne, whether ſhall Anniball be ſtronger in the lyttle angle of the Brutiens, wherunto he is dryuen with his hole hoſte, or when he ſhall come to Carthago, hauynge al his friendes of Affrica about hym? What a deuiſe is this, to choſe rather to fyghte and to trye with thyne ennemie, where thy power ſhall be ſmaller by the halfe, and thine ennemies power doubled: then to fyght in a place, where thou ſhalte haue two armies againſt his one? ye and that one worne and weried with longe and greuous warre. Conſydre thy ſelfe, howe moche this thy counſayle varieth frome the mynde of thy father, he beinge fully appoynted to Spayne, as his prouynce, fearynge the comynge of Anniball into Italy, to the intent to mete hym at his deſcendinge from the mountaynes, lefte his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynce, and came into Italy. But nowe thou, when Annibal is al redy in Italy, intendeſt to leaue Italy: Not for that it is for the common welthe ſo to do, but therby to purchaſe the a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and glorious name. But O ye noble fathers conſcripte, I do thinke, that P. Corn. Scipio was not made conſull for his owne priuate welthe or pleaſure, but for the common welthe, and the ſafegarde of all vs. Neyther were the armies of men of warre appoynted to hym, to thintent, be lyke a prynce mighte ſayle with them into what part of the world he wyll. But they were aſſigned to him, and to all other his predeceſſours, for the ſafegarde and defence of this citie and of Italy.</p>

            <head>¶ The aunſwere of P. Cornelius Scipio, to the oration of Q. Fabius Maximus: And of his ſaylynge into Sicilia with his armye. Cap. lx.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Q</seg>Vintus Fabius in the beginning of his oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (fathers conſcript) ſaid, that in the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his opinyon he mighte be ſuſpected to ſpeke of euill wylle and enuy: but it is not I that do accuſe ſo great &amp; ſo noble a man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Although I doo not perceyue the ſame ſuſpition as yet to be by him ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether the defaulte therof be in the deformitie of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or for lacke of good matter, I knowe not. But this I well perceiue, that to auoyde the crime or ſuſpition of enuy, he hath ſo extolled his owne honour, with the fame of his noble actes, as though it ſhuld not becom him, or ſtand with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to contende with me, being my ſelfe but a childe, vnder the age of his ſonne. Conſiderynge the great offices that he hath borne in the citie, wherby as it ſemeth, his meanynge is, that the deſyre of glory ſhulde be meaſured onely, by the length of the lyfe of man, and not extende to be had in perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with our poſteritie. But this I knowe well, that euery no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble herte hathe a couetous deſyre to be equiualent in famouſe vertue, not only with the age preſent, but alſo with the people of al ages, both paſt and yet to come. And (onles I wold diſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble) truly Q. Fabius, my wyll is not only to be equall vnto the in renowme, but alſo to paſſe the in prayſes, yf I may atteyne thervnto. Lette neyther of vs bothe thynke, that none that ſhall come after vs, ſhall be lyke vnto vs. For that were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre of greate hurt and hynderaunce, bothe of our poſteritie, and alſo of the common welth, and generally of all mankynde. Furthermore, Fabius hath remembred the ieoperdies and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryls, that I ſhulde entre into, by my goynge into Affrica, as though he were carefull bothe for me and myne army. I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile greatly, from whens this louing care and thought for me is ſo ſodeinly ſpronge. For whan my father and myn vncle wer bothe ſlayne, and bothe theyr armies almoſte diſtroied, ſlayne, and cleane loſte, the Affricanes ouerrounnynge the countrey with .iiii. ſeuerall hooſtes and capytaines: than woulde no man offre hym ſelfe to be a capitayne of the Romaines in Spayne,
<pb facs="tcp:9127:120"/>
but onely I. Atwhychetyme, whan the people of the citie made me gouernor, being tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but .xxiiii. yeres old, there was no man founde, whiche would remembre my tendre age: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of our ennemies, the daungerouſnes of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, nor yet the late death and deſtruction of my frendes in Spayne. Is there nowe in Affrica any greatter armies or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter capitaines, than were than in Spayne? Was mine age at that tyme more mete for the warre, thanne it is nowe? or is it greater matter to fight with our enemies of Affrica in Spayn, than it is in Affrica? As it is nowe eaſy to auaunce my ſelfe of iiii. armies of Carthage, by me diſtroied: after ſo many cities taken by force, after ſo many princes and wylde nations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and all Spaine won vnto the occean ſea, ſo that none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence is lefte there of any warre: Likewiſe after my victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious returne from Affrica, it ſhalbe as eaſie to ſet forthe the ouercominge of all thinges, whiche nowe be laide very terry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dangerdus: only to the intent to kepe me ſtil at home. Fabius demeth, that I ſhal haue no hauens or portes open for me to enter. He alſo remembreth the taking of M. Attilius Regulus in Affrica: as though M. Attilius had his fall at his firſte arriuall into that countreye. Where of trueth he hadde hauens open and entre at his pleaſure, ye by the ſpace of an hole yere he did many noble actes there: Whome the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginenſes were neuer able of their owne power to ſubdue, till the ſeconde yere after his coming, and many of his hoſt ſlaine. They ſent for Xantippus, capitayne of the Lacedemonians, with his power: by whome he was at lengthe ouercome and taken in battayle. This exaumple can nothing feare me. For why ſhoulde I more feare to ſayle into Affrica bycauſe of the taking of M. Attilius, then I was afrayd to ſaile into Spaine after the deathe of bothe the Scipions? And I truſte Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus the Lacedemonien was not born to be more fortunate to the Carthaginenſes, then I ſhalbe to the Romayns and to mine owne countrey. The tale muſte be recited of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienſes, howe fondely leauynge warre at home, they entred into Affrica: But why doeſt thou not reherſe the hiſtorie of Agathocles, king of the Syracuſanes? Who when his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Sicilia had ben long troubled with warre by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, he with his hoſt failed ouer into Affrica: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he delyuered his owne countrey from warre, and tourned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9127:120"/>
all to the defence of him &amp; his power in Affrica. But to ſhewe the commoditie of inuadinge of a foreyne countreye, thereby to auoyde ieopardyes at home: what better example can any man reherſe, then of this Anniball? There is greate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the ſyght of bournynge and ſpoylyng of other mennes countreyes: and the ſyght of the deſtruction of thine owne cities and regyons. There is more courage in a manne, that offrethe battayle, then in him that defendethe. Lyttell thoughte Anniball at his fyrſt comyng to Italye, that ſo many cities and people wolde haue yelded them vnto him as did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the battail at Cannas: moch leſſe cauſe ſhal the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes haue of truſte or hoope in Affrica, conſideringe their vntruthes to their neyghbours, &amp; their owne proud and cruel dominion ouer their ſubiectes. We beynge forſaken of our neyghbours, haue ſtil endured al dangers by our owne power and ſtrength. The Carthaginenſes haue no great ſtrength of their owne. Their power is in hyred ſouldiours of Affrica and Numidia, whoſe lyghte wyttes cauſe lyghte faythe, when they ſe cauſe of chaunge. Yf ye ſuffer me to depart hence, with ſpede, ye ſhall ſhortely heare of my paſſage thither, and of the warre wherewith I ſhal vexe theim. And then ſhal ye ſee An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niball make ſpede to departe from this countreye: and ye ſhall heare ſhortely of the ſyege of Carthage: not doubtynge, but that ye ſhal receiue gladder tydynges from Affrica, then euer ye had fro me out of Spayne. Theſe hopes I do conceyue. Fyrſte of the fortune of this citie and people of Rome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condely, throughe the truſte of the goddes, whiche are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truſe broken by theim. Thyrdely, that occaſyon offered by Syphax and Maſſaniſſa, to whoſe promyſe and faythe I wyll ſoo truſte, that I wyll alſo be well ware of theyr falſehode and dyſceipte. And it is the parte of a manne and a good capyteyne, not to ſhrynke and forſake fortune, when it is offered. I knowe well Quintus Fabius, that I ſhall find An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niball my matche: but I wyll rather drawe hym, then he ſhall retire me. I wyll cauſe him to fyght with me in his owne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And Carthage ſhall rather be a pray and a rewarde of our victory: then the countrey and caſtelles of the Brutians, whyche are almoſt dyſtroyed already. Nowe when ye ſay, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talye ſhalbe in daungier by my departynge hens, I praye you, may not P. Licinius the conſull (whyles I am ſay lynge thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb facs="tcp:9127:121"/>
ſtaye with his hoſte Anniball, that is nowe of ſmall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: aſwell as thou Q. Fabius, dyddeſt ſlaye him, when he as a conquerour ouerranne all Italy? Yt ſhall be a greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Romayns, and an eternal ſame among kinges and ſtrange nations, that we haue the courage not only to defend Italy, but alſo to enter &amp; make warre in Affrica. What ſhame ſhal it be when it ſhall be ſayde, that Anniball enterpriſed an act, that no Romayne capiteyn euer durſte enterpriſe? When contention was betwene vs and the Carthaginenſes for Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, our nauies and armies oftentimes inuaded Affrica: Howe when contention is for Italy betwene vs, Affrica remaineth quiet and in peace. But nowe let Italy take reſt, &amp; be in peace, whiche of long tyme hath ben vexed, and let Affrica an other ſeaſon ſuffer bournynge ſpoylynge and waſtyng. And let the puiſſaunt Romayne army approche the walles of Carthage: rather then we ſhould with bulwarkes and fortifycations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende our ennemies from our owne walles. Let Affrica be from henſeforthe the place of warre. Let feare, flieng, ſleing, waſtynge of fyeldes and other dyſtructions, belongynge to warre, be nowe tourned thyther, whiche by the ſpace of .xiiii. yeres hath inuaded our countrey.</p>
            <p>¶ After this aunſwere of Scipio, greate ſtryfe and altercaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in the ſenate houſe. At the laſte it was decreed, that Sicipo, with thyrty ſhyppes ſhulde go into Sicilia, and from thence at his pleaſure, yf he thoughte it moſt conueniente for the common welthe, to ſayle ouer into Affrica: the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul to kepe warre in the countrey of the Brutians againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball. Beſydes theſe ſhyppes, and the Romayne legyons, whiche were appoynted to Scipio, many cities and cuntreys adioyning to Rome, willingly ayded him with ſhyppes, with vii. thouſande ſouldiours, and all thinges neceſſarye, of their owne coſtes and charges. With whiche noumbre he arriued in Sicilia, and there deuyded theim into companyes, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge to euery company an hundred men. Amonge al whiche nomber, he choſe oute thre hunderd of the mooſt valyant and actife yonge men, that were withoute armour: whom he kept euer aboute hym. But they knewe not to what pourpoſe he mente it. And on a daie he choſe and named .iii. C of the moſt noble and rycheſt yonge gentylmen of all Sicilia, whome he ſayde, ſhould ſayle with him into Affrica: aſſygninge theym a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9127:121"/>
day, at whiche they ſhuld appere before him with theyr horſe and armour. This commaundement troubled theim ſore, and to be ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home with the labours by land and by ſea, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very painful, not onely to theim, but alſo to their frendes and kinſefolkes. At the daye appointed for their retorne, they came all before him, bringing with theim horſes harneis and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thinges neceſſary. Then ſaid Scipio: It is ſhewed me, that certaine of you, men of armes of Sicilia, grudge ſore to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this iourneye with me: Wherefore if there be anye of you here, of that mynd, I pray you ſpeake nowe, and I wil gladly heare you. For I had moche leauer, that ye vttered it nowe betymes: then that ye ſhuld agaynſt your hertes go forth, and become vnprofitable ſouldiors to me and to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. Wherevnto one of the .iii. C. anſwered: Truely ſyr, yf it were in my choyſe and election, what I ſhulde do, I woulde not go forthe in the warres. Well, ſayde Scipio: Sence ye haue playnely declared your mynde without diſſimulation, I wyll appoynte one in your place, to whome ye ſhall delyuer youre horſe, harneyes, and other neceſſarye inſtrumentes of warre, whome ye ſhall take home with you to youre howſe, and there teache inſtruct and exercyſe hym in feates of warre, tyll I ſende for hym agayne. Of this bargaine the yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylman was verie ioyefull, and delyuerynge him all his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyll for the warre, he toke him home with him. When the reſte of the three hundred men of armes of Sicilia, perceiued their companion by this meane diſmyſſed from the warre, with the good loue and fauour of the Capytayne: euery one of theym alſo beganne to make his excuſe, and deſyred to haue Scipio to appoynte other in theyre roumes. Whyche he gladdelye dydde, and by this meane he horſed, harneyſed, and inſtructed the three hundred wyllynge Romaynes, that were vnarmed, with the horſes and harneys of the knyghtes of Sicilia, withoute anye charge of the ſtocke of the cytie of Rome: Whyche proued after valiaunte menne of armes, and dydde manye noble actes for the aduauncemente of the common welth. Than Scipio ſerched out ſuche ſouldiours as warred vnder Marcellus the conſull, at the wynnyng of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſa, whom he choſe chiefly: for that he iudged theim to be expert in aſſaultyng and ſcalyng of townes and caſtelles. For euen than he imagined the wynnyng of great Carthage. Sone
<pb facs="tcp:9127:122"/>
after he ſette menne a worke to make ſhyppes with ſpeede, and to amende and to repayre his olde ſhyppes. Which done he ſent C. Lelius, with a good numbre of men into Affrica, to ſpoyle robbe and waſt the ſea coſtes: where he landed in the nyghte. And in the dawnynge of the daye, ſettynge his men in good order, he ſpoyled the fieldes, diſtroyed and ſlewe manye of the Affricans: whiche loked lyttell for any ſuche ſodeyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion, they had ſo longe continued in pleaſure and eaſe. The fame of the deſtruction came anone to Carthage: the meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers noyſed abrode, that Scipio was arriued. For they hadde herde before, that he was alredy come into Sicilia: and they were ſo ſodeinly taken, that for feare they coulde tell the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayntie of nothynge, neyther of the numbre of the Romaynes, nor of theyr ſhyppes: But feare cauſed theim to make moche more therof then it was in dede. The citezens of Carthage were then in a meruaylous feare and penſifeneſſe, beholdynge the ſodeyne chaunge of fortune, that of late had ſo aduaunced them, that theyr army lay before the gates of Rome: and their capytaines had almoſt ſubdued al Italy: Nowe contrary wiſe, they loked for none other, but the ſpoyling of theyr countrey, and the beſieginge of Carthage by the Romaynes. When they conſidered their helpe, they founde theyr citezens, and menne of theyr owne countrey about them, weake and nothyng mete for the warre. All theyr ſtrength was in hyred ſouldiours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other partes of Affrica: and they were wauerynge people, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trewe and vnſtedfaſt. They alſo rekened Syphax to be turned from them by the ſecrete co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, that Scipio had with hym: and Maſſaniſſa was apparently become theyr ennemye. Of Mago they had no tidinges of his remouing from Gene, and goinge into Italy to ioyne his hoſte with Annibals hoſte: and the fame, and alſo the ſtrengthe of Anniball was waxed faynte.</p>
            <p>¶ When they had all hole conſydered theyr wofull ſtate and condition: then began the ſenatours to counſayle and prouide for helpe in theyr preſent neceſſitie. They muſtered theyr men, both in the citie &amp; without. They hyred many ſouldiours Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans. They vytayled theyr citie: they amended theyr ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, they prouided harneſſe and all other thynges nedefull.</p>
            <p>¶ When they were thus buſy, true tidinges came, that it was not the capitayne Scipio, that was arryued: it was Lelius,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9127:122"/>
that with certayne ſhyppes and menne was come to robbe and ſpoyle the countrey onely. And that the great reſt of the army was yet in Sicilia. With theſe newes they were ſomewhat comforted: and then they deuyſed to ſende embaſſadours to Syphax, and to other princes aboute theim, for a ſure aliance and frendſhyp. They ſent alſo to Phillip kyng of Macedonia, promyſynge hym great ſummes of money, to inuade eyther I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly or Sicilia with a great hoſt. Into Italy alſo were meſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſent, to cauſe the capitayns Annibal &amp; Mago to ſtay Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio in Italy. To Mago was ſente .xxv. longe ſhyppes .vi. M. fotemen .viii. C. horſemen, and .vii. elephantes, with greate plenty of money, to hyre mo men in thoſe parties, willyng him with all his ſtrengthe to remoue towardes the citie of Rome, and ioyne his hoſt with Annibals. This preparation made the Carthaginenſes.</p>
            <p>¶ When the ſhippes of Carthage were arriued at Gene, they founde there Mago with his army and nauy of ſhyppes: who knowyng the mynde of the Carthaginenſes, called before him a great numbre of frenchemen and Liguriens, vnto whome he ſhewed, that he was ſent into thoſe parties to purchaſe theim lybertie, and delyuer them from bondage, wherin they hadde longe ben holden. He declared alſo to them, how M. Liuius, and Sp. Lucretius laye with theyr two Romayne armies not farre from them. The one in Hetruria, the other in Fraunce. Whoſe powers to reſyſt, he neded to haue a great aſſemble of people. Then the frenchemen aunſwered, that theyr hertes &amp; myndes were holly to ſerue hym therin. But they ſayd, there was an hoſt of Romaynes all redy in theyr countrey: whiche if they dyd perceyue, that Mago were ayded by theym, they wolde incontinent waſt and deſtroy theyr countrey. Wherfore they deſyred, that the Liguriens might helpe hym: who were nothynge ſo nere daunger, and they wolde priuely helpe hym with vittayles and all thynges neceſſarye, to the beſte of theyr power. Wherunto the Liguriens agreed, and deſyred two monthes ſpace, to aſſemble and take muſters of theyr beſte ſoudiours.</p>
            <p>¶ Marcus Liuius, herynge that Mago gathered to gether ſo great a numbre of people: he remoued with his hoſte in to Fraunce, and ioyned hym ſelfe to Sp. Lucretius, lyinge euer in awayte to mete with Mago, ſo ſone as he remouynge from
<pb facs="tcp:9127:123"/>
the Liguriens wolde offer to entre into Italye, and take his iourney towardes Rome. But in caſe Mago wolde reſt in the angle of the mounteynes without further procedynge: then they lyke wyſe wold abyde about Arminius, euer redy for the defence of Italy.</p>

Whom (he ſayde) he knew ſuerly, after that he had brought his owne purpoſe to good effecte, and had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to ſettle all his owne buſynes, that then he wolde obſerue no promiſe or bonde, that he had before made to the Romains. So lyttle good faythe he knewe to be in hym. Wherfore he deſyred Lelius, to moue and ſtyrre Scipio, to make haſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he wolde not fayle (although he were dryuen out of his owne realme) to mete with hym ſoone after his landinge, with a good numbre bothe of horſemen and of fotemen.</p>
            <p>¶ On the morowe after Lelius departed, with his ſhippes lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded with theyr pray &amp; landed in Sicilia: where he found Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, to whom he declared the mynde and meſſage of Maſſaniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. Wherupon he had ſhortly ſet forwardes into Affrica, had he not hearde comforte of the wynnynge of Locres, a citie in the vttermoſt parte of Italy, that then was holden by the Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thaginenſes. Whiche citie in ſhorte tyme he obteyned, partly by treaſon of certayne carpenters, that wrought in the caſtell, partly by the fauour of the citezens therof. Who beinge gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly opreſſed by Amylcar the capitayne, and other Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes of the garriſon, that ceaſſed not to vſe all kyndes of oppreſſion ouer them: at the laſt conſented to receyue the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes into the towne. Whiche brought to paſſe, Scipio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Sicilia, leauynge behynde hym Q. Pleminius capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9127:123"/>
of the towne, with a garryſon ſufficient for the kepinge of the ſame. After whoſe departynge, Pleminius with his ſouldyours, farre paſſed Amylcar and the Carthaginenſes in pride auaryce and all other vyces. So that it ſeemed, they ſtroue not, who ſhuld ouercome other in feates of armes: but who ſhuld excede other in vice. They ſpared nother mens wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues maidens nor doughters: they exercyſed cruell rapine of mens goodes, and ſpoilyng of temples. Wherof the citizens beynge wery, ſent meſſage of complaint to Scipio the conſul. whervpon he eftſones came to Locrus, where he had al their matters debated, and at length punyſhed certayne of theim by empryſonmente: and after departed, leauynge ſtyll Q. Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius capitayne there, with no leſſe auctority then he had be fore. But after he departed, Pleminius wyllinge to execute his malice ouer his ennemies, put certayne of theym to cruell deathe: whiche before had complayned of him to the conſull. His ſouldiours alſo were afterwarde more cruell and vnrulye then they were before. Therfore they ſent legates to Rome, with greuous complaynte to the ſenate, of the manyfolde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, hurtes, and cruell paynes, that they ſuffered: moche more by the Romaynes, then euer they hadde by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes. Whoſe complaynte beynge well and delybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately herd in the ſenate, Quintus Fabius, replete with olde malyce agaynſt Scipio, to ſet forthe his neglygence, inquired of the legates, whether they had neuer before that time ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed their cauſe to the conſul Scipio. They aunſwered, that at their firſt complaynt, he herd the matter, and then putting the tribunes in pryſon, he let Pleminius go at libertie, and put him again in auctority: although he was worthy more puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the other. But at their ſecond complaynt made to him by their legates, he was ſo buſied aboute the ſetting fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of his ſhippes &amp; men into Affrica, that he could not at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend to here or examine their matter. Then was there gret re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proch ſpoken of Scipio, by many of the princes of the ſenate, ſpecially Q. Fabius alleged, that he was born to corrupt and diſtroy al warlike policy and lernyng, by his ouermoche ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and giuing of libertie. Some would haue had Pleminius brought to Rome bound, and Scipio called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his prouince. At the laſte the ſentence of Q. Metellus toke place, whiche was, that it was good, to ſend for Pleminius, according to the
<pb facs="tcp:9127:124"/>
mynde of Fabius. But as touching Scipio, whom the whole citie fyrſte had choſen in his youth to be a capitaine in Spayn, and he according to theyr expectation had delyuered the hole countrey out of the handes of their ennemies: whervpon they alſo of late had choſen hym conſull, to ſubdue Affrica, and to deliuer Italy of Anniball: He thought it not meete for ſuche a noble man to be ſodainly condemned, his cauſe not being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herd and debated, or to haue him called frome his iourney, without a greatter cauſe than this was. Conſideringe that the Locrenſes could lay no defaut to Scipio, but only ouermuch ſufferance of Pleminius. Wherfore he thought it beſt, that M. Pomponius, with .ii. tribunes, ſhuld be ſent to Locrus, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thens to Sicilia, to examyne &amp; trie, whether the wronges done to the Locre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes, wer done by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement or aſſent of P. Scipio or not. And in caſe he were conſentyng therto: then that they ſhuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand him to returne to Rome: &amp; other legates to occupy his place, or els that he ſhoulde continue in his purpoſe and iourney into Affrica, as he had appoynted.</p>
            <p>¶ According to this ſentence Pomponius, with .ii. tribunes &amp; other legates, came to Locrus, makyng proclamation, that yf any man wold accuſe Pleminius, Scipio, or any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhulde come before theim, and they ſhuld be well herde. The Locrenſes gyuyng great thankes to the Romaines, for the goodnes therin to them ſhewed, anſwered, that they wold accuſe Pleminius, as chief doer of all the miſchief, and certain other with him. But as touching Scipio, they had nothynge to charge hym withal: but that he eyther gaue ouermoch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Pleminius, or to litell faith to their wordes. But they ſayd, they knewe wery well, that the wronges to theim done, were neither by the wyll nor commaundement of Scipio: but they thought hym to be of the nature of many men, which are ſory, that any wronge or offence ſhulde be committed, and yet whan the iniuries be done, they haue not the hertes or willes to reuenge or puniſhe the offenders of the ſame.</p>
            <p>¶ With this aunſwere M. Pomponius, and the other, were moch eaſed of any further inquirie of Scipios matter. Wher fore they toke Pleminius, and .xxx. other of his complices, that were founde gyltie of dyuers greatte offences, and ſente them bound to Rome: where Pleminius dyed in priſon. Sone after the other wer put to condigne execution. Then thought
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9127:124"/>
they to go to Scipio, to ſee, whether the ſclaunder ſpoken of his ſlouthe in gouernaunce, or of the myſorder of his hooſte, were true or not: that they myght therof make true reporte, whan they were returned to Rome.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio hearyng of their coming, cauſed all his army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre to Syracuſa, where he than lay: and alſo cauſed his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy of ſhyppes, to be ſette furthe and ordered in all poyntes, as though he ſhulde the ſame day haue fought with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, bothe by water and by lande. Whan Pomponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and the other embaſſadours were come, he gentilly and louingly receiued them. he ſhewed them his army on the land in array redy to fight: his nauy alſo on the ſea, he ſhewed them not onely redy to battaile, but makyng a ſhew of a fight in the hauen. Than ledde he them to his garners of corne: and into his armory and ſtore houſes of ordinance and artillary, and all inſtrumentes of warre. Who ſeing al his prouiſion and order, were ſtriken with a great admiration of hym and his conduict: iudgyng that through his gouernance and his army, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes ſhoulde be ouercome: or elles it were neuer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble for theim to be ſubdewed. Wherfore deſyrynge the goddis to proſpere welle his iourneye, they departed frome hym, takynge theyr waye to Rome with greatte ioye, as though they were goinge to brynge tydynges to Rome of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, rather than to report the meruaylouſe preparation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde battayle, whiche they hadde ſeene in Sicilia. Whanne they came into the ſenate howſe, they extolled the fame and actes of Scipio after ſuche ſorte, that they ſent hym worde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent, to departe towardes Carthage, takynge with him whom he wolde, leauynge behynd hym for the defence of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia certaine at his pleaſure.</p>

            <p>VVhyles the Romaynes made this great ordynance for the warre: the Carthaginenſes, fearing greatly the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Scipio, prepared as moche as they coulde for

Wherfore to plucke Syphax from the amitie of the Romaynes, Aſdrubal, the ſonne of Giſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon made haſt to fyniſhe a maryage betwene Syphax and his daughter, that was a very fayre mayden.

Specially in Carthage ſuch feare ſorowe and trouble inuaded the people, as though theyr citie had ben all redy taken by theyr ennemies. They were then vnprouyded bothe of men of warre, and alſo of a good capitayne to be their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:9127:126"/>
gouernour. The beſt capitayne that they then had, was Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal the ſonne of Byſgon, whom Scipio at diuers battelles in Spayne, had before put to flyghte, and at the laſt droue him cleane oute of Spayne, with all his helpers: ſoo that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemed the capitaynes to be as farre vnlyke, as the armye of Carthage was vnlyke to the Romayne hoſte. In this greate feare the gates of the citie were ſhutte, the walles kepte with watche and warde, as thoughe theyr ennemies had ben already come before the walles of the towne. Fyue hundred horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were alſo ſente forthe to eſpye the conduite of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, who by chaunce mette with manye Romayne horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that were ſent out to robbe and ſpoyle the fieldes adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, and were by them put to flyghte, to the greate loſſe of many of the Carthaginenſes.</p>
            <p>¶Sone after the arriuaile of the Romaynes, came Maſſaniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa to Scipio, bryngynge with hym .ii. C. good men well hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. His power was then not greate, for he had ben driuen and chaſed out of his owne realme, and was baniſhed by ſtrengthe out of his owne countrey. Whoſe comynge was verye ioyfull and comfortable to the Romaynes. The Carthaginenſes after the loſſe of theyr horſemen, aſſembled againe a newe winge of horſmen, wherof they made gouernor Hanno, the ſon of Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. Then ſent they letters and legates to Aſdruball, to come to the ſuccour of the citie, that was at pointe to be beſyeged. They ſent alſo to kyng Syphax, deſyring him to come to the ſocour &amp; defence both of Carthage &amp; alſo of all Affrica. Then lay the Romaines nere vnto the citie of Vtica. Hanno hauyng with him .iiii. M. horſemen, came to the towne of Salera, xv. miles from the Romain campe. When Scipio had knowlege therof, he ſent Maſſaniſſa before, with certayn horſemen with hym to ſhirmiſhe with them at the gates. Commaunding him, that ſo ſone as the multitude of his ennemies were ones come forth, and that he coulde no longer endure theyr ſtrength, that then he ſhuld ſoftly withdrawe him ſelfe towardes the hylles, where he ſhuld fynde hym with his hoſt, redy to ſuccour him. With this inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Maſſaniſſa departed &amp; rode to the gates of the citie, ſkirmiſhing with ſuch as were at the ſaid gates. ma ny came forth to the battayl, without good order, &amp; then Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſſa faining him ſelfe to be afraide, ſomewhat reculed: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he turned again and fought, with them that folowed him.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:127"/>
Thus he played at baſe with them, tyll the whole multitude of horſemenne were come furthe of the yates. Than ſobrely he withdrewe him ſelfe tyll he came to the hylles: to which hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the Romayne horſemen were than couertely come. Than Maſſaniſſa fierſely retourned and aſſayled his ennemies, and the Romaines beinge freſſhe them ſelues, and hauyng freſſhe horſes, compaſſed and aſſailed them that were before almoſte weery with chaſing Maſſaniſſa: ſo that at the fyrſt brunt Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no him ſelfe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The pray after the victory was greatte. The towne was taken, and the capytains with other men of armes were welle rewarded by Scipio. But aboue other he gaue Maſſaniſſa great gyftes, and leauynge a ſufficient garriſon in the towne, he with his hoſte remoued thenſe: ſendynge mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of the pray, whiche he had taken, bothe men, beaſtes, and other rycheſſe, by certayne of his ſhippes into Sicilia: inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng hym ſelfe to aſſayle the citie of Vtica, with all his power: whiche yf he myght ones wynne, he reckened to be a reſtyng place for him and his, tyl the reſt of his voiage were acheued.</p>
            <p>¶ Thus was the town of Vtica beſieged round about, &amp; their hope was to haue ſuccours of Aſdruball: who had aſſembled togyther .xxx. M. fotemen, and .iii. M. horſmen. Neuer the leſſe for all that numbre, Aſdruball durſte not ſette furthe of Carthage tyll kyng Syphax was alſo come to hym with fyfty thouſande footemen, and .x. M. horſemen. Then ſet he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and came nere vnto Vtica, pytchinge his tentes and campe not farre from the Romayn army. There came aboute this tyme from Sicilia and Sardinia, great plenty of wheate, to vitaile the Romaines: ſo that they had therof great plenty. There was alſo brought thither .xii. C. gownes, and .xii.

            <p>¶ Duryng whych ſommer P. Sempronius the conſull in Ita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly fought with Anniball: where the Romayns had the worſt, and loſte .xii. C. of theyr men.

they went towardes Anniball, and he beynge ioyefull of his laſte victory, foughte with theim agayne, to his greate loſſe. For there were aboue .iiii. M. of his men ſlayne, and iii. C. taken. Then Anniball, beynge greately dyſcomforted with this loſſe, retourned from thence to Croton. Sone after the tyme of the choſyng of conſulles was come, at whiche Cn. Seruilius Cepio, and Cn.

His mynd was ſtyll vpon his buſynes touching the warre. Amonge other his cares, he deuiſed greatly, by what meanes he myght wynne king Syphax from the Carthaginenſes, iudgyng that the heate of loue, which he had to his yonge wyfe, was by that tyme ſomewhat aſſwaged, and that he was then werye of the pleaſure in loue, beinge (as he thoughte) ſatisfyed therin to his contentation: When he had by legates aſſaied the mynde of the kynge, he made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that he wolde intreate of peace betwene the Romains and the Carthaginenſes, Vpon this condition, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes ſhulde departe cleane out of Affrica, and the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes lykewyſe out of Italy, without further trouble: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles he wolde not fayle to purſue the warre on the partie of the Carthaginenſes.

fayntly refuſed thoſe conditions, wherby his ennemies myght take ſome hope of the achieuinge of theyr purpoſe. Now were the wynter houſes in the campes of the Carthaginenſes made of wodde and bowes, ſuche as they coulde get together.

Wherfore at euerye tyme that he ſente any embaſſadours to the kynge Syphax, to entreate of the peace, to be parfectly aſſured of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ When the matter was thus dyuerſe tymes debated betwen the two counſayles: and that the Romaynes were parfecte of all the ſtate of theyr ennemies, and theyr order: Then the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of Scipio ſayde vnto the kynge, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded neuer to returne, vntyll they had brought determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aunſwere, eyther of peace or of warre: Deſyrynge hym, eyther to gyue aunſwere therof hym ſelfe, or to take the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle and aduyſe of Aſdruball and the Carthaginenſes, and therupon to make them theyr aunſwere. For it was nowe hye tyme to knowe, eyther the oone or the other, withoute fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tryfelynge forthe of tyme. Thus while Syphax toke the aduyſe of Aſdruball, and Aſdruball of the noble menne of Carthage, the eſpyes had leyſar to viewe and ſerche all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they were charged with: and Scipio hadde tyme to prepare all that was mete to ſerue his purpoſe. The Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens alſo and the Carthaginenſes, truſtynge euer on peace, were neglygente in foreſeinge and aduoydynge daungiers of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9127:128"/>
warre, that were prepared for theyr myſchiefe. At the laſte aunſwere was made, that the Romaynes woulde haue peace, but theyr conditions were not indifferente, whiche they deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wheruppon Scipio, hauynge a good occaſion, honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to breake the truſe before betwene theim taken: On the morrowe he ſente worde to the kynge, that ſyns he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no man wyllynge to haue peace but hym ſelfe: therefore the kynge from thens forthe ſhulde truſte to haue noo peace with the Romaynes, onleſſe he wolde leaue the amitie of the Carthaginenſes. Then was the tyme of truſe expyred, and the ſprynge of the yere was come. Wherefore Scipio, to brynge his pourpoſe aboute, aſſembled to gether his ſhippes, and furniſhed theim with ordynaunce and artyllery, as though he woulde aſſayle Vtica on the ſea coſte. He alſo ſente two thouſande men of warre to kepe the hyll about Vtica, whiche before laye vnkepte: And that he dydde for two purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Fyrſte, to drawe the myndes of his ennemies from the ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that whiche he had deuyſed, and to occupy them with contrary worke. Secondly, with that power to defende his campe from the excurſions of the citezens, in caſe they wolde iſſue out, whyles he with his power were gone to Syphax and Aſdruball. Then dydde he open vnto Maſſaniſſa, and certayne other, what his mynde was to doo the nyghte fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge. And he commaunded the Tribunes, that in the euenynge folowynge, they ſhulde brynge forthe the hoſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fyeldes. They accordynge to his commaundement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute the ſonne ſettynge, ſette forthe the ſtandardes and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and in the begynnynge of the nyghte, the hoſte ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in arraye, ſo that by mydnyghte they hadde gone .vii. myles, and were come nere to the campe of theyr ennemyes. Then Scipio deuyded his army in .ii. partes. The one parte with the Numidiens, he appoynted to Lelius and Maſſaniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, wyllynge them to inuade the campe of kynge Syphax, and to ſet fire on the lodginges made of bowes and of flagges, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely prayinge them bothe, that nyght to apply theyr buſineſſe with great dilygence. And he ſayde, that ſo ſone as he myghte perceyue the fyre to be in the kynges campe, then wolde he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſayle the campe of Aſdruball.</p>
            <p>¶ Accordyng to his commaundement the purpoſe was achie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For incontinent after the fyre was put into the vttermoſt
<pb facs="tcp:9127:129"/>
partes and houſes, the fyre anon toke in the drye ſtyckes and flagges, and ranne from one houſe to an other: ſo that in ſhorte ſpace it was abrode in euery parte of the campe. The Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens of the kynges hoſte, parceyuinge the fyre, were ſtryken with a ſodeyne great feare, and the more bycauſe it chaunced in the nyght ſeaſon. yet nothynge miſtruſtinge the cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to aryſe throughe their ennemies, but iudginge it to come throughe ſome negligence or euyll fortune. They ranne on all partes to helpe to ceaſſe or quenche the fyre, without armour or weapons. Nowe Maſſaniſſa, whiche knewe the wayes and entrees about the kinges campe, had ſoo laide his Numidiens in embuſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that as the people ran abrode to quenche the fyre, they fel into the company of theyr ennemies er they knew where they were, and by that meanes many were ſlaine, many alſo wer burned in theyr beddes with fyre. The watche of the Carthaginenſes, in the campe of Aſdruball, parceyuinge the great fires in the kynges campe, awaked the reſt of the hoſte. Who being alſo deceyued, for that they thought the fyre was hapned by negligence, and not by the deuiſe of theyr ennemies, and herynge the greate crye of theyr companye in the kynges hoſte, that were ſlayne, whiche they thought came but onely throughe the ſodeyne feare of the fyre, that was happened in the nyghte: they ranne together in companyes vnarmed out of the gates of theyr campes, the next way, takyng onely with them ſuche thynges, wherwith they myght quenche the fyre. Whom the Romaynes receyued as they came, and flewe them euery one, that none eſcaped to beare tydynges therof. Then Scipio incontinent inuaded the campe. Where fyudynge the gates ther of vnwarded, he entred with his armye, and ſet fyre on the lodginges in diuerſe partes, whiche ſpreadyng abrode, in ſhort ſpace burned all that was therin, bothe man beaſte and ſtuffe. And ſuche as wold haue fledde from the daunger of the fyre, were ſlayne with the ſwerde of the Romaynes.</p>
            <p>¶ Thus in one tyme were bothe the campes wonne. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe bothe the capitaines eſcaped with .xx. M. fotemen, and v. C. horſemen: wherof manye were wounded and hurte with that fyre. There were ſlayn and burned that night .xl. M. beſydes them that there were taken, aboue .vi. thouſand, with many noble men of Carthage: whereof .xl. were ſenatours, with a greate and ryche praye, of horſes armure and other
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9127:129"/>
thynges moche of valure, whiche were diſtributed amonges the ſouldiours. The kynge with certayne with hym, fledde to his owne countrey.</p>
            <p>¶ Aſdruball with as great ſpeede as he mightcame to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, where he founde the citie ſoore troubled, and in greate feare. For they iudged, that Scipio, leauynge the further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Vtica, wolde incontinent after his victory come to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and ouercome Carthage. Than they determined, in haſt to aſſemble a newe hoſt of the citie and countrey about theim. They alſo ſent meſſangers to kynge Syphax, to require hym, that he would gather his power, and healpe to defende bothe his countrey and theyrs. Whervnto his yonge wyfe muche moued hym: who pyteouſly wepyng, deſyred hym not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre his fathers and her countrey to be diſtroyed, and the citie of Carthage to be bourned by the Romaynes, as they of late bourned the kynges tentes and her fathers. The legates of Carthage alſo ſhewed hym, that good fortune was comminge towardes them. For that there were arryued of late .iiii. M. men of warre of Celtiberia, a countrey of Spayne, whyche were hyred to comme to their ſuccours. And that Aſdruball woulde not fayle to ioyne with hym with a full noble armye. To whome the kyng gaue gentyll aunſwere, ſayinge, that he woulde aſſemble and put in armour all the luſty yonge men of his realme. For he ſayde, he knewe well, that he was before ouercome by fyre, and not by battayle. Wherefore he woulde neuer accompte hym ſelfe vanquyſhed, oneles he were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſubdued in the fielde by ſtrength and power. With this anſwere the meſſangers departed.</p>
            <p>¶ And ſhortly after, accordyng to theyr appoyntement, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball and the kynge mette togyther, with their armies, and had betweene them bothe .xxx. M. men. Scipio herynge of theyr newe comming agayne on hym, with that power, lefte at the ſayde Vtica, a ſmalle numbre of his people, bothe by ſea and by lande: and hym ſelfe with his greatte power, went to mete his ennemies. He pitched his campe in the playn fielde, not farre from the kynges campe, where lyghte ſkyrmyſſhes were made betweene the horſemen of bothe partes, by the ſpace of .iii. dayes. On the fourthe day, the capitaynes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theyr hoſtes to battayle.</p>
            <p>¶ Scipio ſet his ſpearemen in the front of his battayle: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde
<pb facs="tcp:9127:130"/>
whome were his beſt aſſured ſouldiours footemen ſet to theyr ayde and ſuccours. On the ryghte wynge were his horſemen of Italy. In the lefte wynge was Maſſaniſſa with his Numidian horſemen.</p>
            <p>¶ On the other ſide, Aſdruball againſt the wynge of Italyan horſmen, ſet his Numidians, and againſt Maſſaniſſa he ſet his Carthaginenſes. In the middes were the newe ſouldiours of Celtiberia. Thus beinge ordered, the battailles ioyned. And at the fyrſt encountre, both the winges of the Carthaginenſes and of the Numidians were driuen backe. For the Numidians being now rude and vntaught men of armes, were noothinge able to reſyſte the Romain horſmen: neither the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (being alſo vnexpert in feates of warre) were able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande Maſſaniſſa, that was fierſe and terrible, through the ioy of his late victory. Wherfore the wynges beinge thus put to flight, the poore army of the Celtiberians remained alone, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, deſtitute of helpe or refuge. Flie they durſte not, for that beinge in an vnknowen cuntrey, they knewe no place whither to flie to be ſaued. Again, if they were taken, they looked for no grace at Scipios hand: ſeinge they came from their owne cuntrey into Affrica, to fight againſt hym that had before ofte tymes been their good frende. Wherfore, being compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with their ennemies, they were ſlayne one vppon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without pitie. But whiles al men were buſy about theim, Syphax and Aſdrubal had tyme to eſcape, to whom the night beinge ſo nere, was moche their ſafegarde.</p>
            <p>¶ What feare the Carthaginenſes were in after this great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe of their friendes, and ſeing Scipio with his army, ouer ryding the countrey rounde aboute theim, and winning the cities and townes, which were vnder their ſubiection: no penne can write, nor tunge expreſſe. They loked euery houre whan theyr citie ſhoulde be enuyronned with their ennemies: they fortifyed their walles, they broughte in vytayles to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a lenger ſpace, and prepared all thynges neceſſarye. They conſulted, what were beſt for theym to do. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that meſſangers ſhoulde be ſent with letters to Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, commaundyng him to come to Carthage with his power to their ſocours.</p>
            <p>¶ Certayn of the ſenatours gaue counſel, that a good nombre of ſhippes, furnyſhed with men and ordenance, ſhuld ſodeinly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9127:130"/>
inuade the Romayne hoſte and nauy, that lay in reſt at Vtica: not myſtruſtynge, but they ſhulde fynde the ſhyppes negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently kept: wherby with ſmall peyne they myghte oppreſſe theim. On theſe two pointes the ſenators agreed. The ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes were ſette furthe, and letters were alſo ſent to Anniball. Scipio retournynge from the battayle, leadynge and cariyng with hym the ſpoile or pray of many townes, which he wanne: ſent his ſayde praye with the priſoners to his campe at Vtica. He hym ſelfe came to Tunnes, whyche he found void of men of warre. They were fled after the battayle, and left the town without any garriſon. Of the takyng of this towne Scipio was very gladde, as well for that it was naturally ſtronge by reaſon of the ſyte therof, beſyde that it was ſurely fortifyed by the induſtry of man, as alſo for that the place was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modyouſe for his pourpoſe. It was dyſtaunt from Carthage twelue myles. Yet frome thenſe he myghte welle ſee the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Carthage, and alſo the ſea that bette on the walles of the towne.</p>
            <p>¶ Whyles the Romaynes were caſtynge a trenche and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiynge this towne of Tunnes: they perceyued the nauy of the Carthaginenſes ſaylynge towardes Vtica. Than Scipio leauyng his woorkes, made haſte with his men towardes V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, to come to the healpe of his ſhippes, that lay at the ſiege therof, and came before the arryuing of the Carthaginenſes: who trifled the tyme on the ſea, beinge in feare to ſet on that enterpryſe: ſo that Scipio had prouyded well for the defence of his ſhyppes before their coming. Neuer the leſſe after mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che trouble and fyght on the ſea, they toke with them .vi.

They within xv. dayes came into Numidia: at whoſe coming, a people ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of called Maſeſuli, receiued gladly Maſſaniſſa, and deliuered hym the whole realme, as to theyr ryghtfull kynge, whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge they had ſo longe deſyred, expellynge cleane out of the cities and fortreſſes therof, all the garnyſons of Syphax, ſoo that he was glad to kepe hym within the bondes of his owne realme. His harte ſwelled at this diſpleaſure, wyllynge to be reuenged: whervnto his wyfe and her father moche intyced hym, and prycked hym forwardes. He hadde great plentie of men, and alſo of horſes, whyche moche encouraged hym to make a newe fielde. Wherefore he aſſembled as many as he thoughtable, gyuyng theim horſes and harneys: diuydynge his horſemen and footemenne into companyes, appoyntynge to theim capitaines, accordynge as he before had learned of the Romaynes. Thus hauyng all thinges in a redyneſſe, he marched towardes his ennemies, with as great an hooſte as he had before: but they were almoſte all newe ſouldiours, and yonge men of warre. Whan he came nere the hoſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains he there fortified his campe. And anone certayne of his horſemen iſſued and badde baſe to an nother numbre of the Romayne horſemen. And who ſoo was beaten, retourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to his company, and was anon reſcued of an other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of his company. Thus by diuers iſſuynges and helpynge euery part theyr companies, beyng either aſhamed or angrye of theyr driuynge backe, the battayle beganne to be quicke on bothe partes, ſo that at the laſt the hole companyes of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on bothe partes were come to the fieldes. The noumbre of kynge Syphax hoſte was come ſo thicke to the bataile, that the Romaynes were fayne to recule, and had been put to the worſe, had not the Romain legyons of fotemen come to theyr ſuccours. At whoſe comynge the kynges people muſynge of theyr order and maner of fyghtyng, began to ſtay, and at the laſte were dryuen backe, and began to flee. Syphax, wyllynge to withholde his people from flyght, beganne to exhort them to abyde, and manfully to fyght, ſhewynge vnto theim, bothe the ſhame and alſo the ieoperdye that woulde enſue through theyr flyinge.</p>

¶ And whyles he rode about the fielde, comfortyng his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hapned to come nere a company of Romaynes, where his horſe was ſtryken downe and ſlayne vnder hym, and he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alyue, and brought to Lelius. His people fledde as faſte as they myght, and came to the citie of Cirtha, whyche was the chiefe citie of all that realme. There were of his menne ſlayne in that battayle .v. M. and aboute .ii. M. v.

Than ſayd Maſſaniſſa to Lelius: There were nothynge to me more pleaſant, than hauyng nowe victory, to viſite my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kyngdom, which after my long exyle, I haue now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. But the time will not ſuffre vs to ceſſe from our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. wherfore, if ye wil ſuffre me, to take with me all the hors men, and the kyng alſo nowe priſoner: I will goo before you to Cirtha, where I ſhall fynde euery man ſoo ſuppriſed with feare, that I ſhall ſoone wynne it with ſmal reſiſtence: ye, with your fotemen may come after me ſmall iourneys at your eaſe.</p>
            <p>¶ To this his diuyſe Lelius aſſented. And Maſſaniſſa with his horſemen haſted, tyll he came to the walles of the citie of Cirtha, where he called certaine of the towne to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to haue certain of the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the citie to come furth and ſpeake with hym, which done, he moued them gentylly, to yelde vp their citie: But they, not knowing of the takinge of their king, in no wiſe wold be perſwaded to ſubmit them ſelfes to the Romains. Than cauſed Maſſaniſſa the king Syphax to be brought before them bound as a priſoner. After which pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſyght, the citezens partly for feare, partly truſtyng ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by to obteine fauor of Maſſaniſſa and of the Romains, opened the yates of the citie.

I had leauer auenture to yelde me into the power of a Numidian, and of one that is borne in myne owne countrey of Affrica, than to the handes of a ſtranger. For it is not vnknowen to you, howe moche the daughter of Aſdruball and a Carthaginenſe borne, hath cauſe to feare the hande of a Romayne. And in caſe thou canſte none otherwiſe helpe my deſire, I mooſte hartily require the, to ſteame: and thus by deathe delyuer me from the daunger of the Romaynes.</p>
            <p>¶ This quene being of excellent beautie, and in her luſty flou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhyng age, what with her humble behauiour, what with her fayre ſpeche, ſo perſuaded the king Maſſaniſſa, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toke her to mercy, but alſo hauyng the victory of her, &amp; the hole citie, he becam ſo captiue to her by loue, that he takig her by the right hand, promiſed her, her requeſt, and thervpon he mounted into the kinges palaice. Than he began to dyuiſe in his imagination, by what meanes he myght performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto the queene. And whan he coulde fynde noo way to bringe his purpoſe to paſſe, as one that was ouercome with blynd loue, he inuented a foliſhe and a ſhamefull diuiſe, whiche was, to be maried incontinent vnto her the ſame day: thynking by the mariage of her vnto him, he had taken away all occaſion both from Lelius and alſo from Scipio, of doing her any hurt or diſpleaſure. Whan the mariage was ſtnyſhed, Lelius with his hoſte of footemen came to the citie of Cyrtha. And kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of the ſodeine weddyng he was ſo diſpleſed with the act, that he was mynded to take her from the pleſant bedde of her new huſband, and to ſend her to Scipio, with her huſband Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And as the opinion of men is dyuers, ſo diuerſe were the tales of the people, extollynge the honour of the victorye by the myghty power of Syphax, and by the noble fame of the people that was ouercome. There was recounted the myghty power of the kyng, to whoſe maieſtie in one day .ii. of the moſt noble ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnories of the worlde ſued for his fauour and frendeſhip, that is to ſay the Romayns and the Carthaginenſes.

amitie of the Romaynes, but alſo wyllingely gauetheim bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle. To whom the kinge aunſwered, that he knewe wel, that he had offended, and he confeſſed, that he was not in his right mynde, whan he moued warre againſte them. He was madde: when he dyd forget the comynge of Scipio into his realme, and the bonde of alliance that he then made with hym: but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whan he receiued into his houſe a matrone of Carthage, of whoſe hot loue and mariage the fyry brondes had alredy ſet fyre in his royall palaice. That madde and peſtilente fury, by her intiſement neuer ceaſſed, tyll ſhe had turned his harte and mynde from his olde friendes the Romaynes: cauſynge hym to purſue the warre againſte them. Neuer the leſſe (ſayde he) in all my myſery I haue nothynge that ſo moche doth comfort me, and reioyſe my herte, as when I beholde the ſame peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent madde fury nowe to be entred the houſe of my moſt enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And when I conſyder that Maſſaniſſa is noo more wyſe then Syphar was: but that he more madly, and with leſſe tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peraunce hath receiued her, then euer I dyd.</p>
            <p>¶ With theſe wordes of the kynge, Scipio was not a lyttell troubled, and then herynge the great offence layde to Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa, he ſawe good cauſe, why he ſhuld gyue credence therto. Conſydering the great haſt made in the maryage, without the aduiſe of Lelius, and without abydinge his comynge. This acte alſo ſemed worſe, and more to be abhorred, conſyderyng, that he beinge a yonge man in Spayne, was neuer before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the loue of any captiue or priſoner.</p>
            <p>¶ As he was muſynge hereon, anone Lelius and Maſſaniſſa came vnto hym, whom in open audience he meryly and ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receyued, giuynge them great thankes and praiſes for their dilygence in that iourney ſhewed. But anone, takynge Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſſa alone with hym in to a ſecrete place, he ſayde thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym.</p>
            <p>¶ I knowe ryght well Maſſaniſſa, that you dydde perceyue ſome good qualities and vertues in me, whan you fyrſte came into Spayne to me, defyrynge there my frendſhyp and amitie: and afterwarde in Affrica, when ye holly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted your ſelfe into my gouernaunce. But at that tyme ye thought your ſelfe, that there was no vertue in me, whiche ye ſoo moche eſtemed as temperaunce and continencie: of whiche alſo I truely dyd moſt glory of my ſelfe. And theſe vertues Maſſaniſſa I wolde

ye ſhulde ioyne vnto other noble qualities and vertues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye are indued. For beleue me, there is not ſo moche daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to men of our yonge age by armed ennemies, as is by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſe pleaſure of our wanton deſyres, whiche euer are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vainquiſhe vs. And who ſo euer throughe temperaunce can bridle and ſubdue thoſe affecions, is worthy more honour, and hath achieued a greatter victory, then we haue nowe had by the takynge of kynge Syphax. The actes whiche ye haue ſo valyauntly and nobly done in myne abſence, remayne daylye in my memory: the other your euill actes I had leuer ye dyd call to remembraunce your ſelfe, then that I ſhoulde declare theym to youre greatte ſhame. Syphax, by the good fortune of the Romaynes, is nowe ouercome and taken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he, his wyfe, his kyngedome, his poſſeſſions, his townes and caſtelles, his people, inhabitauntes of the ſame, with all that euer to Syphax belonged, is nowe a praye due to the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of Rome. The king and his wife (although ſhe had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a citezen of Carthage, and althoughe her father were not the capitain of our ennemies) ought to be ſent to Rome, and there ſhe ought to abide the iudgement of the ſenatours, and people of the citie, for that ſhe turned the minde of the kyng her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande from our friendſhyp, perſwadynge hym to take armour agaynſte vs. Wherfore nowe ouercome your owne affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mynde, and beware, that with one vyce, ye dyſgrace not ſo many your good vertues: and by one offence, loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and the thankes, whiche by your merites ye haue here tofore worthely deſerued.</p>
            <p>¶ With theſe ſecrete rebukes Maſſaniſſa was not onely aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but alſo conſtrayned to wepe, ſayinge: that he wolde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be at his commaundemente.

Wherfore he wylleth her, to remembre the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour her father, and the .ii. kynges, to whom ſhe hath ben ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and therafter regarde her owne honour.</p>
            <p>¶ When the meſſanger hadde preſented to Sophoniſba the poyſon, and done his meſſage, ſhe aunſwered: I wyll receyue this mariage gyfte, and that gladly, if a huſbande can gyue no better gyfte to his wyfe. But (ſayde ſhe) I praye the ſhewe Maſſaniſſa, that my deathe had not ben ſoo greuouſe to me, if I had not maryed ſo nere the goinge to my graue. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gyuinge other ſharpe wordes to the meſſanger, ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or tremblynge, toke the drynke empoyſoned, and dranke it of.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan this was ſhewed vnto Scipio, leſt Maſſaniſſa, being a fyerſe yonge man, and takyng this diſpleaſantly in his minde, myght do ſome hurt to him ſelfe: he called hym vnto him: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme comfortynge hym, ſometyme gentilly rebukinge him, for that he had corrected his fyrſt foly with an other folyſhe acte, makynge of the thynge more ſorowe then neded. On the next daye, to the intent he wolde put all ſuche fantaſies out of his mynde: he aſcended to the place of iudgemente, whyther he cauſed all his hoſte to aſſemble. There he fyrſte gaue to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſſa the name of a kynge: and after great lawdes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gyuen to hym, he alſo gaue hym many ryche gyftes, as a crowne of golde, with a great bolle of golde, a chaire of Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, a walkynge ſtaffe of Iuorye, a ryche gowne, with a cote of bawdekyn, vſed to be worne in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ The Carthaginenſes, myndynge onely to tracte the tyme tyl Anniball with his power might come into Affrica, thought they woulde refuſe no conditions of peace, that were demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done for their partes. Wherfore they ſent ſome le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates vnto Scipio, to take truce, other they ſent to Rome, to aſke peace, leading with theim certain priſoners and fugitiues for a colour, to the intent they myghte therby the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teygne peace.</p>
            <p>¶ Whyles theſe thynges were woorkyng, Lelius with king Syphax, and other noblemen priſoners of Numidia, wer com to Rome. Where he declared to the ſenatours by ordre all thinges whiche had ben done in Affrica, to their greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and alſo hope of good ende of that voiage.</p>
            <p>¶ Then were theſe newes publyſhed abrode in the citie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che cauſed great ioy and gladnes.</p>
            <p>¶ Sone after were the ambaſſadours of Maſſaniſſa brought into the ſenate, where fyrſt they ſaid, They were glad and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that Scipio had nobly and happily ſpedde in Affrica, to the no ſmalle comforte of the ſenate, and alſo of the citie of Rome: Than dyd they gyue thankes for that Scipio hadde not onely giuen to Maſſaniſſa the name of a kynge, but alſoo had made hym a kyng, reſtoring him to his fathers kyngdom, if it were the pleaſure of the fathers of the ſenate. Thyrdly, that it pleaſed Scipio, not only to giue great prayſes to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſſa openly, but alſo that he had gyuen hym greatte gyftes, whiche to deſerue he hath and wyll dilygently indeuour hym ſelfe, deſyryng that the ſayd name of a king, with other the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall gyftes of Scipio, myght be confyrmed by the decree
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9127:135"/>
of the ſenate: And furthermore they ſayde, that yf it myght ſtande with theyr pleaſure, Maſſaniſſa deſyred theim, to ſende vnto hym certayne priſoners of Numidia, whiche were kepte in priſon at Rome: by the reſtoring of whom, he ſhuld purchas moche honour and loue among the communes of the cuntrey. To theſe their ſayinges and demaundes, it was then anſwered by the ſenate, that the proſperous actes of Scipio, doone in Affrica, were as moche to theyr comforte, as to the kynges. And that the honour and the giftes, which Scipio had gyuen to Maſſaniſſa, were well beſtowed, and accordynge as he had well deſerued: which his actes they al dyd ratifie and allowe: Beſydes whyche his gyftes, they alſo ſent vnto Maſſaniſſa the kyng, by theim, dyuers other preſentes of apparaile, mete to be worne bothe in the tyme of peace and of warre. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the embaſſadours of the king were honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. The priſoners alſo of Numidia, at theyr delyuery &amp; ſendyng home, had certayn apparayle gyuen theim. And thus plentyfully enryched, they had all departed towardes Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, hadde not the newes of the coming of the legates of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage cauſed the ſenatours to ſtay Lelius and theim all for a ſeaſon, to tary their cominge, bycauſe the communication of the peace with theim, ſhulde be in the preſence of Lelius.</p>

But the ſenatours wold not ſuffre theim to entre the citie, but apointed theim to abide with out the walles. The ſenatours ſoone after ſatte in the houſe of Bellona, whyther the Carthaginenſes lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were broughte, and there made an oration, moche lyke to the other, whych they before made vnto Scipio, laying all the blame from the common counſaile vnto Anniball: ſaying, that he, without the conſent of the ſenate of Carthage, paſſed both the mountaynes and alſo the ryuer of Iberus, makyng warre not onely to the Romaynes, vppon his owne wylle and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but alſo to the Saguntines.

<pb facs="tcp:9127:137"/>
whyche was taken before with the Romayns. In concluſyon they declared, that the ſumme of theyr charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen theym, to deſyre of the ſenate of Rome, was, that they myght continue in the ſame leage and conditions of amitie and peace with the Romaines, as were before at the laſt truce ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them by Luctatius, than being conſull.</p>
            <p>¶ Then dyuers of the auncient Senatours of Rome, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were preſente at the leage taken by Luctatius, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſundrye queſtyons of the legates of Carthage, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge the ſayde condition of peace, conteyned in that leage. Wherevnto they, beynge all younge menne, aunſwered, that they were not of aege to remembre that treatie. This aunſwere was greattely ſuſpected of the fathers.

Whervppon the legates were cauſed to auoide the place, whiles they counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vppon the matter. And after longe deliberate diſcuſſynge therof, Lelius and Fuluius declared to theim the opinyon of Scipio, touchyng this peace, whiche was, that he dydde not myſlyke the meanyng of the Carthaginenſes, in caſe they dyd not ſende to call home Anniball and Mago out of Italy: but if they ſo dyd, than he thought they wolde diſſemble the matter vnto their capitains coming with ſuccours, and afterward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettyng their promiſe, wolde renewe the warre. Vpon theſe wordes the whole counſayle agreed to the ſaying of M.

            <p>¶ Nowe in the meane ſpace, whiles the legates of Scipio and of Carthage, were at Rome, Cn. Octauius, with .ii.

The other hulkes of cariage were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to diuers places on the coſte of Affrica, in the ſight of the

The Carthaginenſes perceyuing this great praye eaſy to be taken, forgettynge theyr deſyre of peace, and alſo the tyme of truſe taken with Scipio (yet mention of them bothe was made to them by certayne of the citie) they by hole aſſente appoynted Aſdruball, with fyfty ſhyppes to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and to bring home thoſe ſeabeaten &amp; diſparpled ſhippes, with all that was in them. At whoſe comynge the ſhypmenne fled away, leauynge theyr veſſelles: and he without any reſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence drewe them with hym to Carthage.

Alſo ſeinge the tyme of truſe was not yet expyred, toke it to be moche more heynous and diſpleaſaunt.</p>
            <p>¶ Sone after this breake of truſe on the parte of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes, arryued Lelius and Fuluius, with the legates of Carthage, to whom Scipio, declarynge theyr vntrewe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to departe, and he with all ſpede pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the warre.</p>
            <p>¶ This yere folowynge were choſen conſulles, M. Seruili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Geminus, and T. Claudius Nero. Seruilius was apoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Hetruria, as his prouynce: and Claudius Nero to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica. He had ordeyned fyfty good ſhyppes, wherwith he and his hoſt ſhulde paſſe into Affrica, where he ſhulde be equal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with Scipio.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>NOVVE VVAS</hi> Anniball, with his armye, arriued ſafe in Affrica, and by land came to Zama, fyue days iourney from Carthage. From thens ſente he eſpies before hym, to knowe the ſtate of the Romayne campe and armye. Theſe ſpyes by chaunce happed on the ſkoute watche of the Romaynes, and were taken and brought to Scipio. Who demaunded of them the cauſe why theyr capitayne ſent them thyther. They aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, to eſpye and to haue knowlege of his army and order. Then Scipio called certayn of his capitaines, called tribunes, commaundinge them to go with the eſpies of Anniball, and to conducte them throughe all his campe, not fearynge to ſhewe them, what ſo euer they deſyred to ſee: Whan they had gone rounde about a longe ſeaſon, and were brought agayne to him, he demaunded of them, whether they had well, accordinge to theyr myndes, viewed his campe and hoſte. They ſayde ye.
<pb facs="tcp:9127:138"/>
Then ſaid he: Go ye to Anniball, and make to hym relation of that ye haue ſeene. Thus let he them departe, ſendynge with them guides to conduct them out of daunger.</p>
            <p>¶ The ſpies, whan they came to Anniball, declared vnto him, how Scipio had intreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But there was nothyng, that euer they tolde him, ſo moch abated his courage, as the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that he gaue his eſpies, to viewe his order and power. For that great boldenes of his ennemye he iudged and knewe well proceded of ſome great aſſuraunce, that he had in his ſtrength and good order. Wherfore although he him ſelfe was the firſt cauſe and occaſion, bothe of the warre and alſo of the truſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge: yet he deuyſed hym ſelfe, to ſpeake with Scipio, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge before any battayle, whyles his power was not aſſayed, he ſhuld obteine peace with more eaſy conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, then he ſhuld, in caſe it chaunced hym to be ouercome. Wherfore he ſente a meſſanger to Scipio, deſyringe that he myght haue lybertie to ſpeake with him, and that he wolde apoynt a place, where they might come together. Scipio refuſed not to accomplyſſhe his deſyre. The place was apoynted, voyde of al deceite and gile. Thyther came the .ii. moſt noble capitaines of the worlde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely eche of them one interpretour with him, to declare to eche other, what ſhulde be ſpoken by them. Theyr hoſtes abode a good ſpace from them. When they were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either of them was aſtonied with the fyght of the other: So that as perſons amaſed through admiration, they ſpake no worde of a good ſeaſon.

But it is eaſyer to fynde faulte with thynges that be paſſed: then it is to amende the ſame.

It belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth not to him that aſketh peace, but to hym that gyueth peace, to appoynte the conditions of peace: But we knowlegyng our defaulte, wyl appoynt to our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues condigne puniſhemente for the ſame, not refuſynge to leaue vnto you the poſſeſſion of ſuche countreys, for whiche the warre beganne, as Sicilia, Sardinia, Spayne, and all the Iles within the ſea, betwene Italye and Affrica. And we of Carthage, beinge contented with Affrica onelye (ſenſe it hath ſoo pleaſed the goddes) wyll ſuffer you to enioye the Empyre of dyuerſe ſtraunge countreys and dominions, gotten bothe by ſea and by lande. Paraduenture in the aſkynge of peace heretofore ye haue not bene playnelye and iuſtely delte withall, whiche cauſeth you to myſtruſte the faythe and promyſe of the Carthaginenſes. But therin, as touchyng the obſeruynge of peace when it is taken, it is moche to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydered, what the perſons be, by whom the peace is required. For as I haue harde it tolde Scipio, your fathers heretofore denyed the Carthaginenſes peace, for that the perſones, that came to intreate therfore, were of ſmall dignitie or eſtimation. But nowe doo I Anniball requyre peace, whiche I woulde not deſyre, onleſſe I thoughte it profytable, and for the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:9127:140"/>
profyt that I do demande it, for the ſame wyll I alſo ſtyll kepe and conſerue it. And as I haue endeuoured my ſelfe, that no man ſhoulde forethynke hym of the warre begunne thorough mine occaſion: in like maner ſhal I nowe enforce my ſelfe, that none ſhal repent of the peace, which I ſhall take. His oration finiſhed, Scipio made him thervnto this aunſwere.</p>

            <head>¶ The anſwere of Scipio to the oration of Anniball, with the battaile thervpon had betwene them, wherin An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball was vanquiſhed and put to flyght. Ca. lxx.</head>
            <p>I Knewe ryght well Anniball, that the truſte of thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng home, made the Carthaginenſes to breake the truſe betwene vs taken, and alſo to let all further hope of peace. And this thou doeſt not denye thy ſelfe: but thou nowe withdraweſt from vs all thynges that we requyre, and were alſo graunted in that treatiſe of peace, ſaue onely thoſe countreys, wherof we haue alredy the poſſeſſion. Wherfore as thou doeſt labour, that thy citezens may feele of what bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then they be diſcharged by the: ſo muſt I trauayle, that noo parte of that, whyche they haue promyſed me, ſhall be nowe withdrawen, for to remayne vnto theim as a rewarde of their vntrouth, conſyderyng the ſame theyr vntrouthe, hathe made theim vnwoorthye to haue the conditions of peace before to theim offered. Neyther dyd our father fyrſte make warre for Sicilia, nor we nowe for Spayn: But than the dangier, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Mamertines our frendes and fellowes were put into: and nowe the diſtruction of Sagunt, cauſed vs iuſtly to make warre. That all hath bene by your prouocation, thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed thy ſelfe. The goddis alſo be witneſſes, who gaue ſuche ende to the firſt warre, as of right it behoued to haue. And in this warre haue gyuen: and I doubt not, but wil giue like end. As for my part, I conſyder well, bothe the infirmitie of man, and the power of fortune: and I know, that all our actes be ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect to a. M. chances. But as I do knowlage, that in caſe thou woldiſt haue come to deſire peace of me, before I toke ſo gret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trauaile, to come into Affrica, and that thou haddeſt with thy good wil departed with thine army out of Italy: if I had then denied thy requeſte, I might well haue been iudged, to haue wrought proudely and ſtubburnely. Euen ſo now after that I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9127:140"/>
haue drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the and thy power home into Affrica, where thou arte redy to make vs reſiſtence: And ſeinge that a peace and truce was ones taken, whiche ye haue broken, taking our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes with force in tyme of truce, and violatinge our embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours: I may ryghte well with honour, byd you prepare for the warre, ſens you could not hold you contented with peace, whan ye had it.</p>
            <p>Thus without any agrement of peace, the .ii. capytaines brake of their communication, and departed euery one to his company, determining to try the matter by battail, and to take ſuche fortune as the goddis wolde gyue theim.</p>
            <p>¶ As ſoone as they were come into their campes, they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on bothe partes gaue commaundement to their ſouldiours, to make them redy to fyght now theyr laſt battaile, wherby in cas they dyd ouercome, they ſhulde haue felicitie, not for one day, but for euer. For before the next nyght, they ſhuld know, whether Rome or Carthage ſhuld haue the ſuperioritie. And that not onely of Italye or of Affrica: but of all the worlde, whiche ſhulde be a rewarde nowe to hym, that ſhuld haue the victory. On the contrary part, the peryll and ieoperdye was no leſſe declared to that part, whiche ſhulde haue the worſe in this battayle. For the Romaynes hadde no place, whether to flye, beinge in a ſtraunge countrey. And to Carthage muſte nedes come an vtter diſtruction, in caſe this their laſt army of refuge were vanquiſhed or ouerthrowen.</p>
            <p>¶ In this great ieopardy on the next day the .ii. valyant capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of the two moſt noble and rycheſt people, ſette furthe with their .ii. myghty armies: intendynge that day, eyther to increaſe the honour, whiche before they had gotten, or els to be ouerthrowen and loſe all. Hoope and feare were myngled bothe togyther in theyr myndes. And whan they ſawe theyr owne battaile, and the battayle of their ennemies: they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their myndes both ioye and ſorowe. And that that the ſouldiours fayled to remembre, theyr capitaines declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theim, with greate warnynges and exhortations. Anniball reherſed to his people all theyr actes done in Italy: how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Romayne capytaynes, and howe many armyes they hadde ſlayne. Scipio ſhewed his conqueſtes in Spayne, and alſo of late in Affrica, with the confeſſyon of his ennemyes, that they for feare were conſtrayned to requyre peace: although
<pb facs="tcp:9127:141"/>
theyr vntrouth wold not ſuffre theim to kepe the ſame, whan they had it. Wherfore he geſſed, that the goddis had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theim to fyght in this bataile, with lyke ſucceſſe and lucke, as they had wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fought at the yle of Egates. Now (ſayd he) all warre &amp; trauayle is at an end. The ſpoyle of Carthage is euen at hande, after whyche ye ſhall retourne home in to your countreye, to youre parentes, your wyues, your chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, and your owne goodes. Theſe comfortable woordes he ſette furthe, with ſuche geſture of his bodye, and merye countenaunce, as though he hadde al redy hadde the vyctory of his ennemies. Afterward he putte his men in order. Firſt his ſpearemen, than his chiefe and mooſte aſſured footemen, not in greate multitudes togyther before any ſtandarde, but in ſmalle bandes, whyche ſhoulde be a certayne ſpace diſtaunt the one from the other, to the intent the elephantes of theyr ennemyes myghte come betweene the ſayde bandes, and be receyued of theim, without breakynge any arraye. In theſe voyde ſpaces betweene the ſayde bandes, he appoynted dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his lyghteſt harneyſed ſouldiours to ſtande, to fulfyll the voyde places, commaundynge theim, that whan the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes preſſed on theim, that they ſhuld recule behynde the ſayd bandes, whyche were in array, or els to ſteppe in among thoſe that went before the ſtanderdes, on their right hande, or on their left hand, giuing way to the vnruly beaſtis to entre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge his men, where with weapons they myght be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ouerthrowen. The lefte wynge ledde Lelius with the Italyan horſemen. The ryghte wynge ledde Maſſaniſſa with his Numidians.</p>
            <p>¶ Anniball on the other part, in the forefront of his battaile, ſette his elephantes, whyche were to the numbre of .lxxx. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whome he put in ordre all ſuche nations as were hyred, or came to his ſuccour, as Liguriens, Frenchemen, and men of the Iles named Baleares, now called Maiorque and Minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, myngled amonge a great numbre of Moores. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde battaile he ſette his Carthaginenſes, with the Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the legion of the Lacedemonians, ſent thither to the ſuccours of the Carthaginenſes from Philip kyng of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And within a lyttell ſpace of from theim, he placed the Italians, which cam with him, whan he left that cuntrey. The winges wer of horſemen. The left winge helde the Numidian
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9127:141"/>
horſemen. The right wynge was of the Carthaginenſes. In this hoſte of Annibal wer men of diuers nations &amp; cuntreis, of diuers tunges and langages, they were alſo different in lawes, armour, and in aparaile. To euery one of theſe he gaue ſundry and diuers exhortations, either of feare, or of comfort. To ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as were come to his ſuccours he promyſed great rewarde of the pray, whiche ſhulde be wonne by their induſtry and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. To the Liguriens he promiſed a plentiful reward of the fertile and pleaſaunt fieldes in Italy. The Moores and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians he exhorted to do well, for feare leſte they ſhulde els be in greuous ſeruitude of Maſſaniſſa. The Frenchemenne wer ſet on by the naturall hatred, which they bare to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes. The Carthaginenſes he put in remembrance to fight for the walles of their naturall cuntrey, for their propre goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, for the ſepulchres of their elders, for their children, their parentes and trembling wiues. There is no meane way (ſayde he) now to be put betwene hope and feare. For either muſt we ſuffre miſerable ſeruitude, after the diſtruction of our citie and cuntrey, orels obteine the empire of all the worlde.</p>
            <p>¶ By that tyme this noble capitayn had finyſhed his wordes: the Romaynes blewe vp theyr trumpettes and hornes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge ſo terrible a noyſe and clamour, that a greate numbre of the elephantes, beinge furyouſe, tourned backe vppon theyr companye, ſpecially vppon the lefte wynge of the Moores and Numidians. Whiche perceyued well Maſſaniſſa, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alſo inuaded the ſame wing with his horſemen, putting theim to ſuche feare, that they fledde, leauynge that ſyde of the hoſte bare of ſuccour. Dyuers of the elephantes by force wer conſtrained to entre the myddle battaile, to whome anone the lyght armed ſouldiours gaue place, ſuffryng theim to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre among theim, where they were thruſt in with ſpeares &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelyns, ſo that many were there ſlain. During this while, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius with his horſmen aſſailed the right wing of the horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Carthage, puttig the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo to ſlight: ſo that the body of the hoſt was of both ſides left without defence of horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the winges being chaſed away: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began the battel of fotemen to be ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g on both partes. Great wer the cries that wer there made: but the Romans wer of better corage, of ſtronger hope, &amp; of more ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. wherfore in a ſhort ſpace, they cauſed their enmies to giue back a certain ſpace of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei had ons gote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:9127:142"/>
ſome grounde, they with theyr ſhyeldes and targettes came ſtill thruſting on theyr ennemies, bearing them backe, tyl ſome ſone after the fyrſte battayle, tourninge theyr backes, began to flie, and came to the ſecond battayle of the Carthaginenſes and Moores, who wolde not ſuffer them to entre, leſte they ſhulde cauſe all theyr arraye to be broken. Wherfore betwene them and theyr owne fellowes began great debate and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſoo that the Carthaginenſes were conſtrayned to fyghte, bothe with theyr owne vnruly felowes, and alſo with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes theyr ennemies. Neuertheleſſe they wolde in no wyſe receyue theyr felowes that fledde in amonge them, leſte they ſhulde mengle that fearefull ſorte, whiche in the flyghte were hurte and wounded, amonge them that were earneſtly bent to fight: Whiche myght haue turned moche more to theyr dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But dryuing them away by heapes, compelled them to go to gether, ſome into the one ſide of theym, ſome abrode the fieldes. Great was the occiſion that was made of them, in ſo moche that the Romaynes coulde not come to fyghte with the Carthaginenſes: but fyrſte they muſte with peyne go ouer the dead bodies of them that were ſlayne. Then Scipio cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a troumpet to be blowen, to withdrawe his men of the firſt battayle, who had ben ſore traueyled, and many of them were ſore wounded. Theſe cauſed he to ſtand behinde the rereward, and made the ſame rerewarde of his beſt men to auaunce fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vpon the Carthaginenſes. Then beganne the battayle newe agayne: whiche was very ſore and fierſe. For then came the Romaynes to the moſt aſſured and ſtrongeſt men, and moſt expert in warres, who before beinge vanquiſhed twyſe, were nowe lothe and aſhamed to be vanquiſhed. But the Romaynes were farre moin noumbre, and had taken to them a great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by dryuinge awaye bothe the wynges, and alſo the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of theyr ennemies.</p>
            <p>¶ Whyles they thus foughte in the ſeconde battayle, Lelius and Maſſaniſſa returned with theyr horſemen from the chaſe of the wynges of the Carthaginenſes: and with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and violence came on the backes of the ſeconde battayle of the Carthaginenſes, whiche were buſy and valiauntly fought. Then were they not able to endure theyr violence, but were with force put to flyght and ſlayne on all partes. There were that day ſlayne and taken of the Carthaginenſes aboute .xl. M
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9127:142"/>
men. Many elephantes, and many ſtandardes of noble men were taken in that battayll. Great alſo was the praye of the ſpoyle founde in the Campe, which all the Romanes toke and brought to their ſhippes. The Romaynes alſo loſt at this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle aboue .x. M. men. Anniball, with a fewe with him, fledde to Adrument: But he neuer departed from the field, til he had bothe in the battayle and before, aſſayed to do aſmoche as was poſſyble for to be done, for the ſafegard of his people. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he that day had prayſe bothe of Scipio, &amp; of al other expert men of warre of the Romains: ſpecially for the ordering of his battayl. For fyrſt he ſet in the forefront his great nomber of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephantes, whoſe gret ſtrength and intollerable violence ſhuld breke the arraye of the Romaines, putting them out of order, whyche is halfe the wynnynge of a battail. Then ſet he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt his hyred ſouldiours of diuers nations: to the intent ſuch a confuſed nombre of ſtrangers (who fought for no great faith or loue, but onely for money) ſholde haue no place nor tyme to flee from the battayle. Alſo to the intent ſuche ſtrangers ſhuld endure the fyrſt violence of his ennemies, makyng them wery and weake, before his chiefe men of moſt truſt ſhould haue any thyng to do. Then after theim were his Carthaginenſes and Affricans, his moſt truſtie ſouldiours. Laſt of al a good ſpace behinde theim, he placed his Italiens, as people whome he knew not wel, whether they ſhuld be his friendes or his foes. Thus when all his pollicie wolde not ſerue hym, nor yet his ſtrengthe coulde helpe, he fledde (as I ſayd before) to Adru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and from thenſe he was ſent for to come to Carthage.</p>
            <p>Whyther he came the .xxxvi. yere after his departynge from thenſe, beinge but a chylde. There in the open aſſemble of the noble men of the citie he confeſſed hym ſelfe to be vanquiſhed; and that there was none other hope of ſafegarde for them, but by obteyninge of peace.</p>

            <p>AS Scipio and his hoſte were comynge to his ſhippes, laden with a ryche praie, worde was brought hym, that P. Lentulus was arriued at Vtica, with .l. ſhippes of warre, and an .C. hulkes laden with all maner of prouiſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9127:143"/>
Wherfore Scipio, thynkinge to put the citie of Carthage in feare on al partes: Fyrſt ſent Lelius to Rome, to beare newes of his victory. And then ſent Cn. Octauius by lande towarde Carthage, with his army of horſemen and fotemen. Whiles he, takyng with hym bothe the newe nauy of ſhyppes, brought hym by Lentulus, and alſo his olde nauye, wente by ſea from Vtica towardes the hauen of Carthage. He had but a whyle ſailed on the ſea, when a ſhippe of Carthage met hym, couered all with white lynnen clothe, and full of bowes of Oliue, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of peace. In whiche ſhippe were .x. embaſſadours of the prynces of Carthage, ſente by the mynde of Anniball to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre peace. When this ſhyppe was come to the fore parte of Scipiosſhip, the coueringe was taken awaye, and the legates ryght humbly required hym to extende his mercy and pitie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. But other aunſwere had they none giuen them, but that they ſhoulde come to hym to Tunes, for to that place he ſayde he wolde remoue his campe. With this aunſwere they departed: and he wente with his nauy of ſhippes before Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, partely to viewe the ſituation of the towne, partely to make the inhabitantes ther of the more afraide. But after ſmal ſoiourninge there, he departed frome thenſe, and returned to Vtica: And from thenſe was goinge to Tunes, when ſodeine newes wer brought him, that Vermina, the ſonne of Syphax, with a great numbre of horſemen and fotemen, was comyng to the ſuccours of the Carthaginenſes. To encountre with theſe people, Scipio incontinent ſente a good parte of the fotemen of his hoſt, and all his horſemen, who metynge with theim, at theyr fyrſte reencountre put them to flyght, and ſtoppinge the paſſages, wherby they myght by fleinge eſcape, they ſlewe of the Numidiens .xv. M. and toke aboue .xii. C. with many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that countrey, to the numbre of xv. C. and with peyne the capitayne hym ſelfe eſcaped, hauynge a ſmall numbre with hym. From thenſe the campe was pytched at Tunes, in the olde place, where they before had ſet it. Thyther came .xxx. noble men of Carthage embaſſadours, ſent vnto Scipio, who with moche more lamentation then the other had done before, required peace of Scipio, conſtrained more therunto through the contrarietie of Fortune, and by the late ouerthrow of their friende Vermina: And they were lykewiſe herde with leſſe pitie, bicauſe of theyr late vntruthe and rebellion. In ſo moche
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9127:143"/>
that it was thought by moſte men, that the citie of Carthage myghte then iuſtely and worthely be deſtroyed by theim. And ſo had it ben in dede, had not one thynge ſpecially moued Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio to the contrarye. Whiche was, that the newe conſull was comynge thyther, whoſe deſyre was, to haue the honour and fame of that victory, and of fyniſhinge that warre, whiche was before achieued by Scipios traueile, to his great daungier. And for this cauſe Scipio and his counſaylours wer fully min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take peace with the Carthaginenſes. Wherefore the nexte day he called the legates of Carthage before him, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebukinge them of the vntrewth to him diuers times ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Wyllynge theim nowe at the laſt, beinge taughte by good experience, to regarde bothe theyr goddes and theyr othes, and ſhewinge them, that he, hauing pitie of the deſtruction of theim and of theyr ſoo noble a citie, was contented to graunte them peace vpon theſe conditions. Fyrſte, that they ſhoulde lyue free after theyr owne lawes and cuſtomes, enioyinge all ſuche cities and townes in Affrica, as they hadde in poſſeſſion before the warre betwene theim taken. And that frome that daye forthe, the Romaynes ſhulde no more deſtroye or ſpoyle any parte therof. Agayne, the Carthaginenſes ſhulde reſtore to the Romaynes all ſuche perſons as were fled and runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Romayns, and all the priſoners of the Romains, and theyr friendes, whom they had in captiuite. Alſo that they ſhoulde delyuer theim all theyr ſhyppes of warre, and other ſhyppes, excepte onely galeys, hauynge thre orders of oores in a piece. And that they ſhoulde alſo delyuer vp all theyr ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes, whiche were alredye tamed and made apte for the warre: neyther ſhulde they after tame any moo. Agayne, that they ſhoulde moue no warre in Affrica, nor withoute Affrica, but by the lycence or commaundemente of the Romaynes. Furthermore, that they ſhulde reſtore vnto Maſſaniſſa all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynges as they hadde taken of his, makynge a peace and agrement with hym. And alſo yelde vnto the Romayne hoſte wheate and wages vnto the return of the legates from Rome. Beſydes all this, they ſhulde paye .x. M. talentes of ſyluer in fyftye yeres: durynge whiche tyme, they ſhulde yerely paye that ſumme, deuyded in euen portions. For the paymente wherof, and perfourmaunce of theſe condytions, they ſhoulde delyuer hym an .C. pledges of his owne election. Wherof
<pb facs="tcp:9127:144"/>
none ſhuld be vnder thage of .xiiii. yeres, neither aboue thage of .xxx. Vpon theſe conditions, he agreed to giue them truce: ſo that they wolde delyuer to him out of hand all ſuche hulkes or ſhyppes of burthen, with their fraught and implementes, which the Carthaginenſes toke from theim, duringe the laſte tyme of truſe, that he had before graunted theim: Or elles they ſhulde neither loke for truſe nor for peace.</p>
            <p>¶ Whan the legates were come to Carthage, they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to declare the ſame conditions of peace openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the congregation of the people therevnto aſſembled. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which conditions one Gyſgo, a noble man of Carthage, ſpake very ſore, and wold haue diſſuaded the people from the taking of peace. To whoſe ſayinges many of the vnruly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude gaue good audience. But Annibal, being therwith great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly moued, went to him, and with force drewe him downe from his place. Which his violent facion had not bene vſed before in that citie, and was thought of dyuers to be contrary to the libertie of their citie: where before all people had free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpeake their opinions: Annibal being vſed to the facion of the warres, more than to the peaſible vſe of the citie: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrynge the liberties therof, excuſed his rudeneſſe in this maner. Whan I departed from this citie, I was but .ix. yeres olde, whiche is nowe .xxxvi. yeres agone: during which time I haue ſufficiently knowen and been inſtructed in all feates of warre, beinge taught by the chaunces of fortune, euen frome my chyldehoode. Wherfore beynge diſvſed ſoo longe ſpace frome the lawes, maners, and cuſtomes of the citie, although I doo forgette the liberties and vſes therof, I am the leſſe to be blamed. Thus after he hadde excuſed his folye, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the people to the takynge of peace, and howe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it was nowe for theim, and alſo howe reaſonable the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were, conſyderynge theyr preſente eſtate. To whiche his perſwaſions the greatteſt parte of the multiude agreed, and the reſiſters agaynſte it, were greately blamed. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt doubte was, howe they myghte make reſtitution of that that was taken frome the Romaynes in the tyme of truce. For all was ſpoyled and goone, neyther knewe they, who badde theym, onely the ſhyppes and hulkes remaygned. But in concluſyon, worde was ſent agayne to Scipio, by the ſame legates, that they wold receyue his conditions of peace.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9127:144"/>
And where they coulde not knowe, who had the goodes that wer in the hulkes: they wold pay therfore at his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The veſſels and men ſhulde be reſtored.</p>
            <p>¶ Thus was the truce gyuen to the citie of Carthage for thre monethes, with a commaundement, that duryng the time of truce, they ſhulde ſende embaſſadours to no place, but only to Rome. And in caſe that any embaſſadours were ſent frome any place to Carthage, that they ſhuld in no wyſe depart from thens, vntyll the Romayne capitayne were aſcertayned what they were, and what was the cauſe of theyr comming.</p>
            <p>¶ Soone after went the legates of Carthage to Rome: with whom were ſent C. Veturius Philo, M. Martius Valla, and Lucius Scipio, brother to P. Scipio the Romayn capytayn.</p>
            <p>¶ When they were come thyther, L. Veturius Philo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, howe Scipio hadde foughten with Anniball, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Carthaginenſes, to theyr vtter confuſyon, makynge nowe an ende of the dolefull longe warre, that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Romaynes and theim. And that alſo Vermina, the ſonne of Syphax, with his power, was beaten and ouercome. Of whyche newes the ſenatours beinge meruaylous ioyfull, commaunded hym to publyſſhe the ſame gladde tydynges, to the whole multitude of the citezens. Who makynge greatte ioye, gaue thankes for the vyctory to the goddis. Than wer the legates of Carthage broughte into the ſenate. And whan the ſenatours behelde the age, the dignitie, and the grauitie of the ambaſſadours (who were of the mooſte noble menne of the citie of Carthage) than they iudged, that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded playnely and ſyncerely to intreate of peace. Amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe nobles of Carthage, there was one Aſdruball, called Hedus, one of the chiefe of theim, bothe in auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and in nobilitie: who was euer deſyrous of peace, and held moche agaynſte Anniball and his affinitie. This Aſdruball ſayde, that a fewe couetous perſonnes of the citie were cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable for this warre, and not the comminaltie. Some faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whyche were layde to theym, he excuſed: ſome other he confeſſed, leſte by the denying of all, he myght be the worſe hearde of the ſenate. Than he perſwaded the Senatours to vſe theyr proſperous fortune gentylly, and in due temperance, profeſſynge euer, that in caſe the Carthaginenſes would haue folowed the myndes of hym, and of Hanno, takynge the
<pb facs="tcp:9127:145"/>
tyme whan it was offered: that they had beene the gyuers to other of peace, vppon ſuche conditions as they were nowe gladde to take at others handes. But (ſayde he) it is but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſene, that good fortune and a good mynd be gyuen both at ones to men. The cauſe of the conqueſtes of you Romains euer chiefly hath been, for that in proſperitie ye haue had the remembrance to conſulte of thynges to come. And your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre hath bene more encreaſed by gentylnes and fauour ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to nations, whom ye haue vanquyſhed, than it hath bene by the victories gotten on theim.</p>
            <p>¶ After that Aſdruball had finyſſhed his oration, the other ambaſſadours made moche more lamentable propoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling the miſerable fall of the ſtate of the Carthaginenſes, who being the greatteſt lordes in honour of the worlde, were nowe conſtrayned to abyde encloſed within the walles of the citie, hauyng nothing els, that they myghte clayme propretie of. ye and that ſame only citie they helde, but vpon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and forbearyng of the Romaynes, whiles theyr pleaſure was, to forbere the vtter diſtruction therof. With theſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gentyll woordes, the ſenatours vniuerſally were fully inclyned to peace. Than one of the ſenatours ſpake out with loude voyce: If peace be graunted to the Carthaginenſes, by what goddis ſhall they ſweare, and make peace, whan they haue broken promiſe, and deceiued the goddis, by whom they ſware, whan they laſte toke peace with vs: To whom the ſayd Aſdruball anſwered, euen by the ſame goddis wyll we ſweare, who be ſo angry, and are reuenged on vs, that brake oure laſte truſe and leage. Herevpon all the ſenatours and the comons, being inclyned to peace, determined, that by thaduiſe of .x. le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of Rome, P. Scipio ſhulde make with theim the peace, vpon ſuche conditions as to him ſemed beſt. The legates wer named, and made theim redy to depart with the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For the whiche the ambaſſadours gaue greate thankes to the ſenate, of theyr goodnes to theim ſhewed: deſyryng them before their departyng, to licence theim to entre the citie, and to viſite certayne of their frendes and kynneſmen, that were kepte in the citie, as priſoners. whiche requeſte was graunted theim. And they deſyred alſo, that they myght redeme diuers of theim vpon reaſonable raunſom. They were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to write the names of ſuche as they wolde haue redeemed. And
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9127:145"/>
they named .ii. C. of theim, who incontinent were delyuered to the x. legates, to take with theim into Affrica to Scipio, wyllyng him, in caſe the peace went forwardes with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes: that then he ſhoulde rendre theſe .ii. C. pryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Carthaginenſes, free without payinge any raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Theſe thynges beynge ſo concluded, the Carthaginen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the Romayne legates, departed towardes Affrica. And whan they cam to Scipio they concluded the peace with hym vppon the conditions before ſpecified. The ſhyppes of Carthage, the elephantes, the fugitiues and priſoners, to the numbre of .iiii. M. were delyuered to Scipio: among whome was one Terentius Culleo, a notable ſenator of Rome. The ſhyppes, vpon the deliuerie of theim, were had furth into the ſea, to the numbre of .v. C. of al ſortes: and there by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Scipio were ſet all on fyre. Which bourninge was as ſorowfull a ſyght to the Carthaginenſes, as if they had ſene the whole citie of Carthage on fyre.</p>

Whoſe ſtocke and common ſubſtaunce was before greatly waſted, by reaſon of the longe contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warres. Wherefore at the leuyinge of the ſayde ſumme of theyr pryuate ſubſtaunce, greate lamentation and wepinge was made in the citie. Whiche Anniball beholdynge, coulde not forbeare to laugh.

            <p>¶ When the peace was thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, betwen the Romains and the Carthaginenſes, Scipio, calling his people together, beſides that he reſtored vnto Maſſaniſſa his fathers kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: He alſo gaue him the citie of Cyrtha, and other townes and groundes that he had wonne of Syphax.

            <p>AFter the warres thus ended in Affrica, the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes continued in peace a certayne ſeaſon.

            <p>¶ This tale publiſhed by them, was beleued to be true of the common people. But Anniball therwith could not be blinded. He knewe full well, that he onely was the cauſe of theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge. Wherfore thynkinge for a ſeaſon to gyue place, till the time might better ſerue hym.

In the hauen of Circyna he founde many ſhyppes laden with marchaundyſe, and at his landinge, greate reſorte of people of the ile came vnto hym, ſalutynge hym, and makynge of his comynge great ioye. Anniball fearynge, leſte ſome of thoſe ſhippes in the nyght ſhuld departe from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſhewe in Affrica, that they had ſene hym in Circyna: He deuiſed to make a ſolemne ſacrifice, and a great feaſt, to the which he badde al the maiſters of the ſhyppes that were in the hauen, and all the marchauntes that were in the ſame. And for that the wether was very hot (being about the middes of ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) he cauſed al the ſailes of the ſhips, with the croſſe maſtes, wherunto the ſayles be faſtened, to be all broughte on lande.

               </gap>erwith he made pauilions and bowres, to defende theym from the vehement heate of the ſonne, whyle they ſouped on the ſhore. The feaſt was ſumptuous, as the tyme might ſerue therto, and was kept very ſolempnely. There was wine great plenty, wherwith many were drunken and heuy headed. The bankette was alſo purpoſely prolonged, tyll it was farre in the nyght. Then fell the marchauntes a ſlepe, with the maryners alſo. Whiche Anniball eſpienge, thoughte he had then good tyme to mocke them, and takynge his ſhyppe, ſecretly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leauynge them faſte on ſlepe. On the morowe, when the maryners aroſe with heuy heades, they caryed theyr ſayles and other tackelinges agayne to the ſhyppes, preparynge all thynges redy. But or they myght bryng al to paſſe, they ſpent a good parte of the nexte daye.</p>
            <p>¶ On the morowe after the departyng of Anniball from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, his friendes, that vſually reſorted to his company, after that they coulde not fynde hym, nor here of hym, they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great multitude of the citie together in the market place, inquiringe, if any newes coulde be ſhewed of the chiefe ruler of theyr citie. Some coniectured, that he was fledde away for feare of his conſpiracie againſte the Romaynes. Some other ſayde, that the Romaynes had by ſome crafty traine conſpired his deathe. Thus dyuerſe were the tales, accordynge to the diuerſitie of ſectes that were in the citie. Tydynges ſone after was brought thyther, that he was ſene at Circyna. Than the Romayne legates openly in the ſenate of Carthage, founde greate lacke, and blamed greately the citezens and rulers, for ſuffryng hym to departe, conſyderynge the priuie letters and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9127:147"/>
meſſages that were ſente betwene him and Antiochus, ſaying. That he wolde neuer be ſatiſfyed, tyll he hadde moued warre throughe all the worlde. The Carthaginenſes excuſed theym ſelues, affyrmynge, that they were nothyng priuie nor conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge to his departynge.</p>
            <p>¶ Now was Annibal arriued at Tyrus, where he was recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued honorably, and with great ioy: and there he ſoiourned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies. From thenſe he ſayled to Antioche, and after that to Epheſus, where he founde the king Antiochus: who was in great doubte before his comynge, in what maner he ſhulde mainteygne his warres againſt the Romayns. The kyng was greatly comforted by the meane of his coming, and alſo by the beinge there of the embaſſadours of the Etholiens: whoo the ſame tyme wer departed from the amitie of the Romaines. He was determined to moue warre: for agree wolde he not to cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine conditions of peace, that the Romaines preſcribed vnto him. Whiche he thought ſhuld be greatly to the loſſe both of his honour and alſo of his dominions. For they wold haue cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed hym to leaue the poſſeſſion of certayne cities, that he had. And alſo that he ſhuld not medle in Grece: but how and where he ſhulde moue this warre, he was not determyned. Anniball was greatly in his fauour, and chieifly for that he thought him an expert man &amp; a mete counſaylour in his affayres agaynſt the Romaynes. Anniball euer was of the opinion, that he ſhulde make warre in Italy, for that the countrey of Italy is able to furnyſhe an army of vitayles and all thynges neceſſary, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſouldiours, if he ſhulde haue nede of men of armes at any tyme. But (ſayde he) if no warre be moued in Italy, ſoo that the Romaynes maye haue all the hole power therof, to make warre in other regions out of Italy: then is there no prynce nor nation of the worlde able to withſtande the Romaynes.</p>
            <p>Wherfore if ye wyll delyuer vnto me one .C. of ſhyppes of warre, and .xvi. thouſande fotemenne, with one thouſande of horſemen: I wyll with that power ſayle into Affrica, truſting to cauſe the Carthaginenſes to rebel agaynſte the Romaynes. Or in caſe they wyll not folowe my requeſt: yet wyll I inuade ſome part of Italy, and moue warre to the Romaynes. Then maye you (ſayde he to the kyng) with all the reſt of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſayle into Europe, kepynge your armye in Grece, redy to ſet forwardes as ye ſe cauſe.</p>
            <p>

¶ This his counſeyle was well allowed of the kinge: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon one Ariſton, an Epheſien, a wyſe and a truſtie manne, was choſen to ſayle to Carthage, to the friendes of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, with priuie and ſpeciall tokens by mouthe, whiche they knewe wer true and not feyned, to ſhewe vnto theim his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For writinge durſte he ſende none, for feare of takynge of the meſſangers. His meſſage onely was to be declared vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon credence.</p>
            <p>¶ But whyle Aryſton went on his meſſage, and therin hadde no good ſpede: the ambaſſadours of Rome were come to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, to knowe of Antiochus, the cauſe why he intended ſuche warre agaynſt the Romaynes, among whiche ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours it was ſayd that P. Scipio, called Affricanus was one. Whiche ambaſſadours hauyng knowledge, that the kyng An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus was a lyttell before gone agaynſte the Piſidians, and fyndyng Annibal there: they diuers times reſorted vnto him, and had familyar communication with him: onely to the intent to make him haue a good opinion of the Romaynes, and not to myſtruſte, that any thyng was intended by theym agaynſte him. Among other communication betwen the ambaſſadours and Annibal, it is remembred, that Scipio demaunded of him, whome he iudged to be the moſt noble capitayne, that euer he knewe or hearde of. To whome Anniball aunſwered, that it was Alexander of Macedony: for that he with a ſmal power ouercame ſo many nations, and vanquiſhed ſo many greate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in battayle, traueylynge ſo many ſtraunge and farre cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, whiche paſſed the power and witte of mannes cumpaſſe. Then Scipio demaunded of hym, whom he iudged to be the ſeconde moſt noble capytayn. He aunſwered, Pyrrbus, which was the moſt wyſe and expert man in placinge his campes, in fortifieng his fortreſſes with watche and ward, and in getting the hertes of men vnto his obeyſaunce. In ſoo muche, that when he warred in Italye, the Italyens were gladder to be vnder his gouernaunce, beynge but a ſtraungyer, then vnder the dominion and power of the Romaynes. Then demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Scipio, whome he thoughte to be the thyrde: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute fayle (ſayde he) it is my ſelfe. At whych aunſwere Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio laughed, and ſayde: What wouldeſt thou then haue ſayd, in caſe thou haddeſt ouercome me in battayle, as I haue done the? Treuly (ſayde Anniball) then woulde I haue putte my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe before bothe Alexander and Pyrrhus alſo. This aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9127:148"/>
ſeemed to Scipio very ſtraunge and proude, whereby he mynded to take from Scipio al his glory.</p>
            <p>¶ Durynge this longe taryenge of the Romayne legates at Epheſus, nothynge els was wrought, but that the often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge and communication of theym with Anniball, made the kynge more to ſuſpecte and myſtruſt him. Whervpon he was no more called to his councel.</p>
            <p>¶ Agayn, one Thoas an Etholien, deſirous to haue the kyng, with all his power, to arryue in Grece, withoute partynge of the ſame his ſtrengthe, ſayde vnto hym: Syr, the greatte citie Demetrias, and the more part of all the cities in Grece, loke daylye for your commynge thyther. And agaynſte your arryuayle, ye ſhall ſee all the countreye aſſemble on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyde, ſo ſone as they may by watches perceyue your nauy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge on the ſea. And as touchyng the parting of your ſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and power: that I can in no wyſe allowe. And in caſe ye were mynded ſo to do, Anniball of all men is moſt vnmete, to haue the rule and gouernance therof.</p>
            <p>¶ Fyrſt ye muſt conſyder (ſaid this Thoas) that Annibal is a Carthaginens, and an outlaw or baniſhed man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cuntrey: Whoſe crafty witte wyl imagyne dayly a.

But in caſe it ſhoulde hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hym to haue the vyctorye, the honour therof ſhall whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abyde with Anniball, and not with Antiochus.

Nay (ſaid he) he that in his youth hath euer coueted in his minde, to be Emperour of the hole world, will now in age neuer be contented, to be vnder the rule of any other, if he may choſe. Wherfore my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayl is, that ye haue no nede to make Annibal your capitain: But if it pleaſe you, ye may vſe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany as your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in your iourney, taki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe in your affayrs, as a prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t counſailour, &amp; none otherwiſe.</p>

            <p>¶ After whiche diſcomfiture, Antiochus, with Annibal, and his ſmalle nomber of men, that were lefte hym at the battaylle, cam to the ſee, and toke ſhipping, and came to Epheſus, where he remayned, thynkyng him ſelfe there to be ſure oute of the daunger of the Romayns. And that he was perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, by many that were about him, gladde to pleaſe his mynd: as many ſuche diſſemblers haue beene and ſhall be dayly about greatte prynces. But onely Anniball aduyſed the kynge, to prepare for the commynge of the Romaynes, ſayenge, that he meruayled more, that they were not already arryued, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their commynge myghte be loked for. Shewynge him alſo, that the Romayns were as ſtronge and valiant vpon the ſee, as on the land: Not doubtyng, but ſhortely they wold ſtriue for the dominion of Aſia, and that eyther he muſte take from theim their Empire, or els he ſhuld be in dangier to loſe his kyngdome. For he knewe, their deſire was to be rulers ouer all the worlde, Counſelynge him to loke for none other thyng at their handes. For in caſe he did, he ſhuld deceiue him ſelf with his vayne and falſe hope.</p>
            <p>¶ Not long after this beginnynge of the warres in Grece, L. Cornelius Scipio, and C. Lelius, were chooſen conſulles. After whiche election, P. Scipio Affricanus offered the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that in caſe they would grant his brother, L. Scipio the countrey of Grece for his prouynce: he would gladly take the payne to go with him in his iourney. Wherunto the ſenate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, geuynge him alſo further auctoritie, to go into Aſia, if he thought it expedient. Sayenge, they woulde nowe proue, whether Antio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hus ſhould be more holpen by the counſayl of Anniball, which was before vanquyſhed: or the Romain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull and his army by the help of Scipio, that had before made the great conqueſt in Affrica. The armies and ſhippes were made ready, and the conſull arriued in Grece, where ſone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing many the rebell cities into his handes, he from thenſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9127:149"/>
ſayled into Aſia: where, by the licence of the kynge Philyp, he had paſſage throughe Macedony and Trace, to the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antiochus.</p>
            <p>¶ Dyuers battaylles were foughte vppon the ſea, betweene the Romayne nauy and Polixenidas, capitayne of the kynges ſhyppes: but euer the Romaynes had the victory, by the help of the kyng Eumenes, and alſo of the Rhodiens. At the laſte it chaunced, that the ſoonne of Scipio Affricanus was taken priſoner, and brought to Antiochus: who kepte him honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and gentelly. And afterward, truſtyng to haue the frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp of P. Scipio, and his healpe, for a peace to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Romaynes and him: he ſente him home his ſonne, withoute payeng any raunſome for him. For when he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Romaynes to approche ſo nere vnto him, he thought it better to common of peace before the battayle, then after, truſtyng to haue more eaſy conditions of peace, if it were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in tyme. But when the matter came in communication, betwene the conſulle and the kynges embaſſadours, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the peace were ſo ſore, that Antiochus refuſed to take theim, althoughe he were thervnto perſwaded by the let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of P. Scipio the Affricane. Wherevpon bothe partyes prepared theim to fyghte. The battayle was cruel, but at the laſt the kyng Antiochus was put to fiyght, and .liiii. M. of his footemen ſlayne, and of horſemen .iiii. M. beſydes .i. M. and iiii. C. that were taken pryſoners, with ſmall loſſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns. Then ſent Antiochus eftſones his embaſſadours to the conſull for peace: which at lengthe, by meanes of P. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Affricanus, was graunted him, vpon theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>¶ Fyrſte that he ſhoulde frome thenſe foorthe no more make warre in Europe. Alſoo that he ſhoulde leaue the poſſeſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the cities landes and countreyes, whyche were on that ſyde the greatte mountayne, called Taurus. Agayne, he ſhoulde paye the Romaynes fyftene thouſande talentes in xii. yeres, and to pay vnto king Eumenes .iii. hundred talen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and a great quantitie of wheate. Vpon theſe condytions he ſhoulde haue peace. Prouyded that Anniball, the authour of this warre, with Thoas, and dyuerſe other capytaynes and counſaylloures, myghte bee delyuered vnto hym. The kynge, beynge at this extreeme myſchyeffe, receyued the peace vppon the ſayde condytyons: and putte in for the
<pb facs="tcp:9127:150"/>
perfourmance ther of pledges. The ſame peace alſo was after that confirmed by the ſenate of Rome.</p>
            <p>¶ And ſo all thynges thus proſperouſly brought to paſſe, L. Scipio the conſull returned to Rome, who was receyued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the citie with great honour and triumphe. And as his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of his victory in Affrica was named Affricanus: ſo was he of his conqueſtes in Aſia, called Aſiaticus, to the honour of his ſucceſſion euer after.</p>

            <p>ANniball, after the battayle begon betwene the Romains and Antiochus, wherin he was vanquiſhed and fledde, miſtruſtinge (as it folowed after) that the kynge of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt be dryuen to take peace, in whiche he feared, leſte the Romaynes, bearyng to hym mortall malyce, wold require his delyuerie: thoughte to prouyde for hym ſelfe in tyme.

Quintius Flaminius was ſent from Rome to the kynge, ſhewinge hym, that the ſenatours thought, he delte not friendly with them, to kepe in his realme theyr great and capitall ennemy Annibal: a man that made fyrſte his owne countrey to make warre with them, to the vtter vndoinge of the ſame, and from thenſe came to Antiochus, and was autour alſo of his warre with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, and nowe was repayred vnto hym, which he thought woulde tourne to his vndoinge.

Wheruppon incontinente the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of the kynge, and alſo of Flaminius, beſette the houſe of Anniball rounde about, ſo that he coulde no waye iſſue out.

            <p>¶ This was the lamentable ende of the ryght wyſe noble and valyaunte capytayne Anniball, in a ſtraunge region, exiled and banyſhed from his owne natiue countrey. Aboute which time, or not longe before, the worthye Romayne Scipio Affricanus alſo dyed: whom the Romaynes, after his manyfold benefites to them ſhewed, recompenced with deteſtable ingratitude, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the citie beinge his ennemies (as no man in authoritie can eſcape enuye) charged hym with the olde matier, betwene Pleminius and the Locrenſes.

Agayne, they layde agaynſt hym, the delyuerye of his ſonne, beinge priſoner with Antiochus, withoute raunſome: whiche they thoughte was very ſuſpecious.
