            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> at the Council-Table with a Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand concerning the Death of the King, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
He did not know but that he did: To which it was
replied, It is plain he did not; for then the Council would
have committed him. To which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> replied, That that
Council would commit no body for the Plot; which might
be the cause of the misdemeanour of frowning in the Articles
mentioned.</p>
            <p>3. To the third he saith, He doth not remember that
ever he express'd much concerning their Credit before
their Tryal; but that there were some passages at that
Tryal which gave him great cause of doubt; which he
hopes he might do, without making it an Article of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.</p>
            <p>4. &amp; 5. To the fourth and fifth he saith, That the
Persons in the Articles mentioned, were committed by him
for publishing several Libellous and Scandalous Papers,
which were proved against them upon Oath; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitments,
even of a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> also, notwithstanding
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Skill, were according to Law:
though there is no Law for these persons to call me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for Judicial acts done upon other men.</p>
            <p>6. To the sixth, which is an insolent Scandal, he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himself to the testimony of that Gentleman of Quality,
whoever he be.</p>
            <p>7. To the seventh he saith, That the persons in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
were Bayled and discharged by the Court, where the
Attorney-General was first called; but indeed Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Consent was not askt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63427:4"/>
8. To the eighth, he saith, He conceives himself not
obliged to do all the business that Justices of the Peace may
do; and though without an offence he might have given such
an answer as is mentioned, yet he did not, but a servant of
his did.</p>
            <p>9. To the ninth he saith, That when the Cause was
tryed, he told the Jury the matter was plain, and so did
the rest of the Court; upon which he went away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Complement to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> to try Causes in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. To the tenth he saith, that <hi>Osbourne</hi> made onely two
Affidavits before him, the substance of one was, That one
<hi>Bowring</hi> a servant to Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had said, that he had heard
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> say, That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> would never
flourish, until it became Elective, and the Kings chosen by
the People. The other Affidavit was, when he was sent
to him by an Order of Council to be Examined, wherein
amongst other things he Swears, That though at the Tryal
of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> it was asked where <hi>Osborne</hi> was, and
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Counsel answered that he was fled, yet <hi>Osborne</hi>
swears, that he at that time was at his Fathers House in the
Country, and that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> knew it; That he took his leave
of him the day before he went, and told whither he went,
and saw a Letter wrote by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to his Father to send
for him; notwithstanding it was carred at the Tryal as if he
had been fled no man knew whither; so that the Affidavit
which the Article chargeth me for permitting to be made,
was not Sworn before me.</p>
            <p>11. He saith, it is more to be wondred how Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
should dare to Charge that as an Article of Misdeameanour,
which was said in the Kings presence, and yet repeated
falfe too.</p>
            <p>12. That at <hi>Monmouth</hi> Assizes he did tell Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63427:5"/>
he was more unsatisfied about Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Tryal than
all the rest; and the rather, for that he was credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
since the Tryal, that Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Study was so
scituated, that he that walked in his Chamber could not see
Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> write in his Study: which was Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi>
Evidence.</p>
            <p>13. He saith, the matter complained of is a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with other Men, of which he thinks himself not
bound to give Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> any other Account,
but that by the taking of Twenty Guinies he lost forty;
and that his backwardness to go into Court to <hi>Wakemans</hi>
Tryal, makes it look as if he had not had Ten thousand
pound to favour <hi>Wakeman</hi> in this Tryal.</p>
            <p>If these Articles shall appear to your Majesty to be Frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or Scandalous, or not true; I humbly pray your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
just Resentment thereon, in <hi>HONOUR TO
YOUR COURTS AND GOVERNMENT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that such an unknown Attempt may not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished;
That the Promoters may be left to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against according to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Articles of Dr. <hi>Titus Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Bedloe,</hi> against
the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> were heard this 21th of <hi>January,</hi>
1679. before the King and Council; and upon the hearing of both
sides, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Captain <hi>Bedloe</hi> are left to be proceeded against
according to Law.</p>
