            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reader will find in this Book, what
the Title declares, <hi>A Pastoral History,
in smooth and easie Verse;</hi> and will in it
find many <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> finely painted, and
feelingly express'd. And he will find the first so
often disappointed, when fullest of desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
and the later, so often, so strangely,
and so unexpectedly reliev'd, by an unforeseen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
as may beget in him wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And the Reader will here also meet with Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
heightned by easie and fit descriptions of <hi>Joy</hi>
and <hi>Sorrow;</hi> and find also such various events
and rewards of <hi>innocent Truth</hi> and <hi>undissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Honesty,</hi> as is like to leave in him (if he be
a good natur'd Reader) more sympathizing and
virtuous Impressions, than ten times so much time
spent in impertinent, critical, and needless Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
about Religion: and I heartily wish it may
do so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48830:3"/>And, I have also this truth to say of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that he was in his time a man generally
known, and as well belov'd; for he was humble,
and obliging in his behaviour, a Gentleman, a
Scholar, very innocent and prudent: and indeed
his whole life was useful, quiet, and virtuous.
God send the Story may meet with, or make all
Readers like him.</p>

               <l>Under the friendly shadow of a Beech</l>
               <l>She sate her down; grief had tongue-ti'd her speech;</l>
               <l>Her words were sighs and tears; dumb Eloquence:</l>

               <l>Her for those briny showres, and in lieu</l>

               <l>At length her sorrows waxt so big within her,</l>
               <l>They strove for greater vent: Oh! had you seen her,</l>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48830:6"/>How fain she would have hid her grief, and stay'd</l>
               <l>The swelling current of her woes, and made</l>
               <l>Her grief, though with unwillingness, to set</l>
               <l>Open the Flood-gates of her speech, and let</l>

               <l>So have I seen a head-long torrent run</l>
               <l>Scouring along the Valley, till anon</l>
               <l>It meeting with some dam that checks his course,</l>
               <l>Swells high with rage, and doubling of its force</l>
               <l>Lays siege to his opposer: first he tries</l>

               <l>And with its weight steals through some narrow
Pores,</l>

                  <hi>Thealma</hi> and her Maid, half dead with fear,</l>

               <l>The Sheep ran bleating o're the pleasant Plain,</l>

               <l>At his safe coming back; but speaks in Tears.</l>
               <l>He lov'd too well to harbour jealous Fears.</l>

               <l>How Mountain-like they swell, and with loud

               <l>Threaten the bounden Shore; when from the Main</l>
               <l>I see a Turtle rise, the Wings and Train</l>

               <l>And by a mark I guess'd it was mine own;</l>
               <l>And slying tow'rd me, suddenly a Kite</l>
               <l>Swoopt at the Bird, and in her feeble flight</l>
               <l>Soon seiz'd upon her, crying, as I thought,</l>
               <l>To me for help: no sooner was she caught,</l>
               <l>When as an Eagle seeking after prey,</l>
               <l>Flew tow'rd the main Land from the Isles this way,</l>
               <l>And spying of the Kite, the kingly Fowl</l>
               <l>Seiz'd on her strait; the Turtle pretty soul</l>
               <l>Was by this means set free, and faintly gate</l>
               <l>Upon the Eagles back, ordain'd by fate</l>

               <l>And in a moment both were out of sight,</l>
               <l>And left me betwixt joy and sorrow; sad</l>
               <l>For the Birds flight, yet for her freedom glad.</l>
               <l>Then, to my thinking, I espy'd a Swain,</l>

               <l>Upon his wrist methought a Turtle sate,</l>

               <l>Only this difference was; upon her head</l>
               <l>She had a tuft of Feathers blue and red,</l>
               <l>In fashion of a Crown; it did me good</l>

               <l>The Bird no sooner loose, made to the Beast,</l>

               <l>The Beast not minding any other prey</l>
               <l>Save what he had, ran bellowing away,</l>

               <l>Something was still forgot; it is loves use</l>

               <l>One might perceive such changes in the King,</l>

               <l>Now a fair day, anon a Dropsie cloud</l>
               <l>Puts out the Sun, and, in a Sable Shrowd</l>
               <l>The day seems buried; when the Clouds are o're,</l>
               <l>The glorious Sun shines brighter than before:</l>
               <l>But long it lasts not; so <hi>Alexis</hi> far'd:</l>
               <l>His Sun-like Majesty was not impair'd</l>

               <l>At last <hi>Sylvanus</hi> leaves him for a space,</l>

               <l>Whence are you, Father (said he) what's your name?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cleon</hi> reply'd, from <hi>Lemnos,</hi> Sir, I came,</l>
               <l>My name is <hi>Cleon;</hi> and full well the King</l>
               <l>Knew he was so, yet he kept close the thing.</l>
               <l>He list not let his Nobles know so much,</l>
               <l>What e're the matter was: his grace was such</l>
               <l>To the old men, as rich in worth as years.</l>
               <l>He leads them in, and welcomes them with tears:</l>
               <l>The thoughts of what had pass'd, wrung from his
eyes.</l>
               <l>And, with the King in Tears, they sympathize.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Rhotus,</hi> said he, 'twas thy charity</l>
               <l>That rais'd me to this greatness, else had I</l>

               <l>Sorrow had tongue-ty'd all, and now they speak</l>
               <l>Their minds in sighs and tears, nor could they
check</l>
               <l>These embrio's of passion: reason knows</l>
               <l>No way to counsel passion that o'reflows.</l>
               <l>Yet like to one that falls into a swoon,</l>
               <l>In whom we can discern no motion,</l>
               <l>No life, nor feeling, not a gasp of breath,</l>
               <l>(So like the bodies faintings are to death)</l>
               <l>By little and by little Life steals in,</l>
               <l>At last he comes unto himself agen.</l>
               <l>Life was but fled unto the heart for fear,</l>
               <l>And thronging in it, well-nigh stifles there,</l>

               <l>Meeting with warmth, is forc'd for to depart,</l>
               <l>And's Life is loose agen: so sorrow wrought</l>
               <l>Upon these three, that any would have thought</l>

               <l>Strugling with passions recover'd strength,</l>

               <l>The gladsom news he brought had power to cure</l>
               <l>A Death-strook Heart; yet in his wisdom he</l>
               <l>Thought it not best, what e're his strength might be,</l>
               <l>To let in joy too soon; too sudden joy,</l>
               <l>Instead of comforting, doth oft destroy:</l>
               <l>Experience had taught him so't might be;</l>
               <l>Nor would old <hi>Rhotus</hi> venture't, wherefore he</l>
               <l>By some ambigual discourses thought</l>
               <l>It best to let him know the news he brought.</l>
               <l>So lowly bowing <hi>Rhotus</hi> thus begins.</l>
