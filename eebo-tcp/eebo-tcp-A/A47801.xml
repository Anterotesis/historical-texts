            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He proceeds with a Story of Mr. <hi>Claypool,</hi> not at all to our purpose; and then gives us further, an account of the <hi>Papists designe</hi> in <hi>Scotland; who first by their Councells procured the poor Inhabitants to be Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, and then sending their disguised</hi> Priests, <hi>and</hi> Emissaryes <hi>amongst them, encourag'd the poor silly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Mutiny against those Oppressions, hoping to cast the Plot upon the</hi> Presbyterians.</p>

                  <hi>Over-hot Church-men;</hi> Fol. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he makes them to have an <hi>Absolute Dominion</hi> over the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Councill;</hi> for they have made him <hi>Banish those Officers</hi> (he says) <hi>that should lead the people up against the Popish Army.

               </p>
               <p>Then there's <hi>another</hi> slip; he will have the <hi>Papists</hi> privy to the <hi>Scotch Rising,</hi> because at the <hi>Disbanding</hi> of the <hi>Popish Army, some Officers were order'd not to sell their Horses,</hi> &amp;c.

The other story is that of <hi>Lewis the Eleventh</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in the Case of <hi>Campobache.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Campo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bache.</hi>

(they being then in hostility) that the Count <hi>Campo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bache</hi> was a Traytor to him: But the Duke would not believe it. And there was one <hi>Cifron</hi> also, who was of the Plot with <hi>Campobache:</hi> This same <hi>Cifron,</hi> being taken prisoner by the Duke before <hi>Nancy,</hi> and condemned to dye; gave the Duke to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that he had a most Important secret to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him. But the Duke neither giving admittance to <hi>Cifron,</hi> nor credit to the King; lost his Life afterward, and his Dominions, by being too incredulous. The <hi>Appellant</hi> applies this to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Case, in Language so course and scandalous, that there is no repeating of it. And what does all this amount to, but that a Prince may be as well<note place="margin">Equally Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too much and too Little</note> undone by believing <hi>too much,</hi> as <hi>too little?</hi> If he had Trusted either <hi>less</hi> to <hi>Campobache,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> to the King, it had come all to a purpose.

But it appears in this place, by the coursness of the <hi>Appellants</hi> Expressions, and by the byasse of the whole Libell throughout, that he is not so much concern'd for the Kings believing or not believing, as to fasten a scandall upon his Majesty, by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the People, that the King does not believe it; and consequently to possess them, that his Majesty is a favourer of <hi>Popery,</hi> tho' never any Prince in Christendom gave more Convincing and Irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs of the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This passage of the Duke of</hi> Burgundy (he says Fol. 4.)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104218:16"/>
                  <hi>may be very much to our purpose, to shew you, that when God designs the destruction of a King or People, he makes them deaf to all discoveries be they never so obvious.</hi> And having Levelled the Application in particular, he speculates in general terms (toward the bottom of the leaf) upon the whole matter.</p>
               <p>There are four several Arguments (<hi>he says</hi>) which <hi>many times prevail with Princes to be incredulous of all pretended Conspiracies against themselves. The</hi> First <hi>is drawn from their being in, or made privy themselves to</hi> Part <hi>of the</hi> Plot, <hi>but not to the</hi> whole. <hi>The</hi> Second, <hi>from their own</hi> good nature, <hi>and</hi> Clemency. <hi>The</hi> Third, <hi>from the nature of the</hi> Evidence. <hi>And the</hi> Fourth <hi>from the nature and Interest of the pretended</hi> Conspirators. <hi>To begin then with the</hi> First, <hi>when the Prince hath been made acquainted with a Design of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a</hi> New Government, <hi>or a</hi> New Religion, <hi>but not with the</hi> Design of taking away his own Life, <hi>this sometimes hath prevailed with him not to believe, that the same party with whom he himself is in a Conspiracy, should have any such other Plot against his Life. But this I hope is not Our Case, For</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>And then he Reasons that his Majesty could get nothing by it.</hi> Fol. 3.</p>
               <p>We shall put him together now, and make <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> of him. <hi>First,</hi> he makes the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundies</hi> Case, in his <hi>Deafnesse to Discoveries</hi> to be the <hi>Kings.</hi> Secondly, He infers from <hi>that Deafness</hi> that <hi>God has design'd his Majesty to Destruction.</hi> Thirdly, he takes upon him to Philosophize upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Princes Incredulity in such Cases; and very fairly represents his Majesty as a <hi>Party</hi> in the <hi>Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi> and consenting to the Introduction of a <hi>New Government</hi> and a <hi>New Religion,</hi> though <hi>not privy to the Plot of taking away his Own Life.</hi> Only he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with a [<hi>But this I hope is not Our Case.</hi>] in

such away of <hi>Doubting</hi> as implys <hi>Believing.</hi> And so much for the first point.</p>

               <p>Now by his Favour, This is not so much an Argument from <hi>Good Nature,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> side, as from the Tye of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> on the <hi>Other:</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way soever it be taken, the Late King found it indeed <hi>a very fallacious way of arguing:</hi> for almost all his Acts of Grace, and bounty turn'd to his mischief, as appears in his Majesties <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. 1642. when after delivering up his Ministers to Impeachments, his Concessions in the business of the Star-Chamber, High<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Commission Court, Ship-Mony, Forest-Laws, Stannery-Courts, Tonnage and Poundage, Continuance of the Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they improv'd all these Trusts, and Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions even to the formal taking away his Authority, Revenue, and Life. And those particularly whom his Late Majesty Oblig'd to the highest degree, laid the foundation of his Ruine. Nor is the ingratitude of the same party to the Son less notorious, then the other was to the Father: None flying so fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the face of the Kings Authority and person, as those that stand indebted to the King for their Lives and Estates; who yet act as confidently, as if one Rebellion might be placed in Justification of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For they do now afresh and in publick avow the methods and practices of the late Times; while the true sons and servants both of the <hi>English Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> lie in the dust, waiting for the righteous Judgment of the Lord in want, and patience. Now

if according to the <hi>Appellants</hi> Rule those are the most dangerous, to whom the King has been most kinde, that Danger must be understood of the Fanatiques; for otherwise the <hi>Appealer</hi> runs the Hazzard of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> upon the Act <hi>for the safety of the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in scandalizing his Majesty for <hi>a Favourer of Popery.</hi> It is not yet that the general Rule fails, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this Exception: For the greater the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the greater in reason ought to be the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though the <hi>Appella<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>In his following way of Reasoning; under the Countenance of<note place="margin">Of Counsell with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> proving it to be the <hi>Papists Interest</hi> to <hi>Murther</hi> the King, he does all he can in the world, by a side-wind, to possesse them with the Necessity of doing it; and consequently, to <hi>force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> them upon it: Only, as good luck is, the Arguments will not bear that stress. I should not dare to speak his words after him, if it were not, <hi>First,</hi> that the Libell is allready, by several Impressions of it, made as Publique as a <hi>News-Book,</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that his Propositions are erected upon a false Bottom. Upon which two Considerations, we shall presume to insert only two Periods of his, upon this Subject.</p>

                  <hi>Their Interest</hi> (says he) <hi>does unavoidably excite them to Murther</hi>

                  <hi>his Sacred Majesty; For First, they know he cannot long subsist without a Considerable Sum of Money, which he must Receive either from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or from the Parliament: Now for them to supply him with so vast a Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, is a Charge, that (you may well imagine) they would desire to get rid of it, if they could, tho' by the Kings Death. On the other side, for the Parliament to supply him with mony, that, they know, cannot be done but by taking off the Heads of their Faction; excluding their Succession, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to such Laws as must of Necessity ruin them: Besides, his Majesty hath allready permitted the Executing so many of their Party, as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can or will forgive it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It falls out Happily that the <hi>force</hi> of his Argument does not<note place="margin">The Plot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd.</note> come up to the <hi>Drift</hi> of it. But the <hi>Weakness</hi> of the One takes off the <hi>Edge</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> He tells the whole world, that the <hi>Papists</hi> have no way in the Farth to save themselves, but by the Murther of the King. The One half of this spoken in a Corner to a Knot of <hi>Priests</hi> and Jesuits, and fairly prov'd upon a man, would be as much as his Head's worth. And is the Crime ever the Lesse for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same thing in Publique, where the Provocation is stronger? These Discourses are not to pass for <hi>Simple Declarations</hi> of a mans <hi>Opinion;</hi> but Artificiall <hi>Encouragements</hi> rather, and <hi>Advises,</hi> toward the <hi>doing</hi> of the thing; especially coming from the Pen of a Person that calls himself <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> and recommends himself to the City by the Borrow'd name of a <hi>King-killer.</hi> Tho' I cannot inform my self of any of <hi>that Family</hi> that lives near <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His First Argument runs thus. The King wants mony; and<note place="margin">He falters in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> there's none to be got, but either of the <hi>Papists,</hi> of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The <hi>Parliament,</hi> he says, will give his Majesty none; and therefore the <hi>Papists</hi> will Murther him to save Charges. This is a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104218:20"/>
Policy far fetch'd: The <hi>Fathers</hi> Head (we know) was set at a Price, but we hope better of the <hi>Sons.</hi> Now in his prejudging the <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon an Assumption that the King gets not a penny of Mony of them, but upon such and such Terms; he does not so much speak his <hi>thought,</hi> as vent his <hi>Proposition;</hi> rather <hi>Desiring,</hi> then <hi>Foreseeing</hi> that the <hi>House of Commons</hi> will hold the King to such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Conditions. And then he finishes his Contemplation with this Conclusion, that the <hi>Papists</hi> will never forgive his Majesty, for what he has done allready. Wherein, <hi>First,</hi> he Contradicts himself, in supposing the King an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Papists,</hi> whom he has hitherto insinuated to be their <hi>Friend.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> instead of proving the <hi>Papists</hi> Design against the King in this Particular, he advances One of his <hi>Own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if he would have come roundly up to the Point of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Popish and Fanatick Interest the same.</note> Interest; he should have told us of the Ecclesiastical Dignities and Preferments that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has confer'd upon their <hi>Emissaries</hi> into his Majesties Dominions: And he should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to the people, what pains they take, and what Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards they run, only in the playing of their Own Game, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way to their advantages in Reversion. This is so great a truth, that most of the serious Catholiques themselves reflect familiarly upon these <hi>Busie</hi> People, as the common <hi>troublers</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christendome.</hi> But then I should have oppos'd an interest also on the <hi>Fanatiques</hi> side, to Ballance this. For they have their Reversio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall prospects too: their <hi>sequester'd Livings</hi> and <hi>Estates;</hi> their <hi>plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd goods,</hi> their <hi>profitable Offices</hi> and <hi>Commissions, Crown</hi> and <hi>Church Lands.</hi> &amp;c.
