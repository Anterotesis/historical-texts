            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>OH Englishmen with Romish harts, what Deuil doth bewitch you,</l>
               <l>To séeke the spoyle of Prince and Realme, like Traytors most vntrue.</l>
               <l>Why is your duetie so forgot, vnto your Royall Quéene,</l>
               <l>That you your faith and promise breake, O viperous broode vncléene.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Blessed be God who knew your thought, and brought your treason out:</l>
               <l>And your destruction now hath wrought that made vs so in doubt.</l>
               <l>For if you might haue had your willes to make your bloudie day,</l>
               <l>Many a widowe and fatherlesse childe, had then cryed wellaway.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Many a Citie had béene sackt, whose houses had béene firde.</l>
               <l>Yea, many a Peere had lost his life, these fruits you all desirde,</l>
               <l>But now fourteene of you haue felt, that death you haue deserued,</l>
               <l>And God (in mercie) from your hands, our prince and vs preserued.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And would you séeke your Countries spoyle, your Mother and your Nurse,</l>
               <l>That fostred you and brought you vp, what treason may be wurse?</l>
               <l>Why is your false and poysoned harts, surprised with such hate,</l>
               <l>That you must néedes by forraigne power, suppresse your happy state.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why doo you beare such foolish loue vnto the Ragges of Rome,</l>
               <l>That you would séeke swéete Englands spoyle, and Princes deadly doome,</l>
               <l>Will nothing serue your deuillish turne in this your deadly strife,</l>
               <l>But euen the blood of your good Quéene, and her to reaue of life.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Doo you not know there is a God, that guides her night and day,</l>
               <l>Who doth reueale her foes attempts, and brings them to decay,</l>
               <l>O wicked men with Tygers harts, nay Monsters I should say,</l>
               <l>That séekes to spoyle so good a Quéene, as none the like this day.</l>

               <l>Doth make you to forget your God, your selues and dueties all,</l>
               <l>Whereby you bend your busie braines to mischiefe and to thrall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Know you not who her highnes is? King Henries daughter déere,</l>
               <l>The mightiest Monarche in his dayes, or hath béene many a yéere:</l>
               <l>She is our Prince and soueraigne Quéene, annointed by Gods grace,</l>
               <l>To set forth his most sacred word, his enimies to deface.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Haue you not holy scripures read, how byrds with fluttering winges,</l>
               <l>A Traytours thought they will betray against annoynted Kinges,</l>
               <l>God will no secret treason hide, against a wicked Prince,</l>
               <l>Much more, for safety of the good, their foes he will conuince.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Therefore you cruell cankred crue, why séeke you mischiefe still,</l>
               <l>For to attempt with violent handes, Gods chosen for to kill.</l>
               <l>How dare you once in hollow hart, thinke ill of such a Quéene,</l>
               <l>Whom God himselfe doth fauour so, as like was neuer séene.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Haue you such wicked hatefull hartes, in thirsting after blood,</l>
               <l>That with false <hi>Iudas</hi> you can beare, two faces in one hoode?</l>
               <l>Too often hath her Maiesty behelde without mistrust,</l>
               <l>The outwarde smiles of Crokadiles, whose harts were most vniust.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>O liuing Lord who would suppose that vnder veluets fine,</l>
               <l>Such cankred poyson should be hid, as hath béene found this time.</l>
               <l>Is this the precious faithfull fruite, which doth from Papists spring?</l>
               <l>Are these the workes whereby they thinke Gods Kingdome for to win?</l>

               <l>Or are they not yet dronke enough, in quaffing bloody bowles,</l>

            </lg>

               <l>O England, England yet reioice, thy God beholdeth all,</l>
               <l>And he hath giuen for euermore thy foes a shamefull fall.</l>
               <l>By him all Kinges and Princes raigne, he giues them life and breath,</l>

               <l>The secret drift and ill intent, of her late hatefull foes,</l>
               <l>Vnto all faithfull Subiects ioyes, the Lord did well disclose.</l>
               <l>Yea many Traytors false of faith, through his most mighty power,</l>
               <l>Are taken in most happy time, and sent vnto the Towre.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which happy sight for all to sée, did glad eche Subiect true,</l>
               <l>And many thousands ranne apace, those Caytiues vile to viewe.</l>
               <l>Whom when the people did espie, they cryed lowde and shryll,</l>
               <l>There goe the Traytors false of faith, which sought our Quéene to kill.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There goe the wretched wicked ones, her Citie meant to spoyle,</l>
               <l>And murther all her Citizens, but now they haue the foyle.</l>
               <l>There goe the enimies of the Realme, did thinke to ouerrunne</l>
               <l>All England: to let in the Pope, but now Gods will is doone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God sent them now their due deserts, as they in hart conspyrde,</l>
               <l>To take away our gracious Quéene, and Citie to haue fyrde.</l>
               <l>God graunt we neuer liue to see, that dismall day to haue,</l>
               <l>Who blesse our noble Quéene and Realme, and eke her Citie saue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus the people still did cry, both men and women all,</l>
               <l>And children yong did shout alowde, and Traytors Traytors call.</l>
               <l>Yea thousands trudging to and fro, to méete them still did runne,</l>
               <l>And some stoode fasting all the day, till that day light was doone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To sée these Traytors taken so, their harts for ioy did spring,</l>
               <l>And to declare this perfect ioy, some ranne the Belles to ring.</l>
               <l>The Belles I say did brauely ring, that day and all the night,</l>
               <l>And throughout stately London stréetes reioyced euery wight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when the day was past and gone, and that the night drewe néere,</l>
               <l>The worthy Citizens many a one, prepared their good cheare.</l>
               <l>And Bondfyres did they merely make, through all the stréetes that time,</l>
               <l>And in the stréetes their Tables stoode, prepared braue and fine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They came together (gladly all, and there did mery make,</l>

               <l>In solempne Psalmes they sung full swéete, the prayse of God on hie,</l>

               <l>But when our noble gratious Quéene, did vnderstand this thing,</l>

               <l>And all that would not gladly so, spend forth their dearest bloode,</l>
               <l>God giue to them a shamefull ende, and neuer other good.</l>
               <l>And Lord with hart to thée we pray, preserue our noble Quéene,</l>
               <l>And still confound her hatefull foes, as they haue alwayes béene.</l>
