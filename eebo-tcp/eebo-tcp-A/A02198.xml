            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause Prayer vnto God is a most Christian exercise and fruit of faith / being rightly vsed: having so many commaundements and promises concerning it in the Scripture: by which we come most neare vnto God / as in any other part of his worship / speaking to him (as it were) mouth to mouth / when we lift vp our hearts and powre forth our requests vnto the Lord: it was thougt needfull / seing these latter Treatises of Mr. Greenwoods towching this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are now published agayne / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his first concerning it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had / here therefore to note downe briefly a few things both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this we pray thee (Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian Reader) to take in good part / and to examine vp the word of God / which is the onely rule of truth / and light of our feet in the darknes of this World.</p>
            <p>Prayer is the lifting vp off the heart vnto God / to call vpon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / with faith / by the work and help of his Spirit. Psal. 25.1. Rom. 10 1;.14. Mat. 21.22. Rom. 8.26.27.</p>
            <p>Praier is eyther with words / or without words. With words / being vttered in speach / eyther publickly or privately: eyther in mo or fewer words: yet alway briefly: according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Prayer is eyther Request or Thankesgiving. Both these are eyther for our selves / or for others. Request for our selves / is deprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plication: for others / intercession. 1. Tim. 2.1.</p>
            <p>Deprecation is for some evill to be kept or removed by the Lord fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Mat. 6.13. and 8.24.25. Psal. 70. Gen. 32.9.12 / 2. Cor. 12.8. Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Prayer is to be made alwayes and onely in the Mediation of Christ. Ioh. 14.13.14.1. Tim. 2.5. Not that this need alway to be mentioned / but that we ought alway to come before God and present our selves / and our prayers vnto him with faith in the Mediation of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by whom alone / we and al our sacrifices are made acceptable vnto God. For in him are all the promises of God yea and Amen. 2. Cor. 1.20. Through him are all the graces a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mercyes of God conveyed vnto vs Ioh. 1.16. Ephes. 4.7. By his Mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our prayers being presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father / all the weaknes / want of faith love hope / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any other corruption wherewith our prayers (as they proceed from vs) be distey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned / are covered and taken away. Because he putteth the sweet odour of his Mediation vnto our prayers / and so presenting them to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / they are accepted of him. Rev. 8.3.4. with Exod. 30.7.8. Psal. 141.2 Mar. 9.22.23.24 / 1. Pet. 2.5.</p>
            <p>For this cause therefore / must prayer / in faith / alway respect Gods promise / and Christs Mediation. Mar. 11.24. Psal. 50.15. Rom. 8.34. Heb: 7.25. and 9.24. And for the same cause / must the person that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth first be accepted of God in Christ / before their prayers and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can be approved. Rev. 1.5.6 / 1. Pet. 2.5. Prov. 15.8, Hag. 2.13.14.15. Gen. 4.3.4.5. and 6.8. and 8.20.21. with Heb. 11.4.7. Wherevpon we are bound to be carefull / first our selves to be in the true faith and Church of Christ / vnder his Mediation / that we may our selves be accepted of the Father in him: and then in faith to offer our prayers / both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and maner / so as we have warrant by the word of God / that he wil heare vs / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Christ will be our Mediatour / therein. For which see the Scriptures a foresaid: and Mat. 6.9 Ephes. 2.19. and 4.4.5.6. Act. 2.41.47. Exo. 30.9. Levi. 17.3.7. Deut. 12.5.8. Psal. 16.4. and 50.8.14.16 17.23. Esa. 1.12. etc. Mal. 1.14 / 1. Tim. 2.1.2.5.8. Iam. 1.5.8. Iohn 5. 13.14. Rev. 8.3.4.</p>
            <p>For our better direction and assurance herein / hath Christ give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that forme of prayer / which is commonly called the Lords prayer. Mat. 6. 9.13. Luk. 14.1.2.3.4. Where he hath prescribed a direction for the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all our prayers both for matter and maner according to that rule. For in it we are taught / as towching the matter of all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers / that they be for things first and chiefly concerning Gods glory / and then concerning our good / so as will stand with the glory of God. Ioh. 12.27.28. And towching the maner of prayer / that it be in faith hope and love / with reverence / briefly and humbly propounded / that he in al may be glorifyed. In faith (I say) both of Gods willingnes to heare a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d help / as being our Father in Christ / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his ability therevnto as being in heaven able to do whatsoever he will. Esa. 63.16. Psal. 115.3. In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe / of his mercy and favour towards vs / he being our Father and we his children in Christ. Luc. 11.9.13. In love both off God and one off
<pb facs="tcp:3575:3"/>
another / in Christ. Psa. 116.1. Mar. 11.25.26. Act. 4.24. With revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / as coming before our heavenly Father / who is full off glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty / he in heaven / we on earth etc. And therefore also ought our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers briefly and hunbly to be propounded: not seking after long or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted speach / nor vsing vayne repetitions etc. Mat. 6.7.8.9. Genes. 18.27. Exood. 34.8.9. Ecclesiast. 5.1.</p>
            <p>And note here / that Christ hath propounded this direction / not by way off exhortation or doctrine / as in other cases he was woont / but in forme off petitions / and those very brieff: Least otherwise we should have doubted that we might not with such confidence in few words have spoken directly vnto God himselff: but that we must have vsed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediatours for vs / as the Papists / or sighs onely without words as the Anabaptists / or never ceasing from prayer / as the Eutychians / or at least some long circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce off words a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d great affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of speach or the like / as ignorance / superstition / and hypocrisy are ready to lead vnto.</p>
            <p>Finally / in this forme off prayer / by Christ we are taught / that the end and scope off all our prayers / ought to be the glory God in Christ. And that therefore we pray alway / with submission off our selves and our requests vnto his will / who being King and Lord ouer all / know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and will performe what he seeth best for his glory and our good. Mat. 6.13.</p>
            <p>And thus prayer conceyved or vttered in five words / is better then ten thousand otherwise / as the Apostle speaketh of prayer in another case / 1. Cor. 14.19.</p>
            <p>Now the help which God hath promised a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d giueth vnto vs in praier is his Spirit. Which is as the fyer / quickning and stirring vp our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to and in prayer: given of God vnto vs for the helping off our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes / that we by it in faith should call vpon the Lord our Father in Christ: Rom. 8.26.27. Gal. 4.6. with Exod. 30.7.8. And this fitly agreeth with the nature of God / who as he is a Spirit in himselff / so wil he off vs be worshipped in Spirit and truth. Ioh. 4.24. Ephes. 6.18.</p>
            <p>Other helps as off praying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a book / or of beads / or the like / read we not any appointed by God. Many tymes in deed we read in the Scripture off the prayers off the faithfull made to the Lord / but never off any one that read their prayers vpon a book or reckned them vpon beads etc. And no marvell / seing the Lord did never eyther commaund to vse / or promise to accept such service off him. Therefore must it needs be / that book prayers / etc. are an invention off man / and a vayne worship off GOD. Exod. 20.4.5.6. Esaie 29.13. Matthe. 15.9.</p>
            <p>Neyther can this stand with the nature and dutyes off prayer / befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mentioned: But in deed breedeth and nourisheth both ignorance and neglect off true prayer / as by lamentable experience may be seen.</p>

            <p>My first writing being about that spiritual exercise of praier and true inuocacion of Gods reuerend name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the distressed soule of man, loaden with the burden of sinne, compassed also about with so many deceitfull enimies, contynual assaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, rebellion of the flesh, entisements of the world etc. seeketh daylie help of God the Father, giuer of all good giftes, hauing thorough. <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> free accesse by the direction of his holy spirit, for all occasions to vnburden yt self of whatsoeuer grief, or occasion of thankes yt is moued with: I ought still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by Gods assistance shall keepe me in the meeknes of the spirit, not witstanding his vnchristian railinges, sclanders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches against me and the truth.

Iohn. 4. This Scripture in deede is cleare and strong to cut downe al Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worship, as disgreeing from the nature of GOD. And if any mayntaine that the very bodily action of reading is the worship of God, it may fitly be alleadged against them, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>IOHN GREENWOODS ANSWER. Wisdome is Iustified of her Children.</head>
               <p>IT is agreed vpon and consented vnto on both sides, that seeing God is a spirit, and onely requireth such to worship him, as worship him in spirit and truth: all carnall worship is cut downe hereby, of what sort soeuer, as disagreeing from the nature of God: And that all fantastical deuises of men; namely, whatsoeuer is not warranted in his worde, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worship, a wearisomnes vnto him, and lothsome in his sight: So that no man ought to intermedle, attempt, or practize anie thing in shew of worship whereof they haue not sure grounde of his worde: For euen our God is a consuming fire.</p>
               <p>Now to put away all your (<hi>bodily</hi>) distinctions and earthly cauils, I still affirme (as I haue proued) the stinting, imposing mens writings vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publique assemblies, to haue them read ouer by number and stint, or any other way, as a worship of God in stead of true inuocation, is a meere deuise of man, and so carnall worship; as also all other reading of mens writinges publiquely or priuatly in this abuse, for praying to God. Yet say you <hi>to apply this Scripture Iohn.</hi> 4.22.23 <hi>in this manner against read pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is friuolous,</hi> where I appeale to all mens consciences, for the weight therof. It is friuolous, you say, <hi>except I can proue that a man cannot pray by the spirit of GOD with sighes and groanes vpon a booke, or when prayer is vttered after a prescript forme &amp;c.</hi> At the first step you go about to alter the question. All our prayers ought to be vttered after a prescript forme, euen that perfect rule and forme our Sauiour gaue to his Disciples and al po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the other which is nothing but a begging of the question. I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged certayne reasons to this effecet. First that those sighes and groanes in reading instead of praying were not of fayth, seeing in praying the sighes and groanes that proceede of faith, minister matter to praye without a booke. Secondly that you did but barely affirme the question in calling it prayer by the spirit when one doth read, seing reading is not praying at al: for as I then alleadged, to inuocate the name of God in spirit, is by the worke of the spirit to bring fourth of our hearts praier to God, which is than in truth when yt agreeth to Gods word. But reading is another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely a receauing of instruccion into the heart from the booke. Out

of the first <hi>Mr. GIFFORD</hi> maketh men beleeue he hath fetched two he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies; the one <hi>a perfection of faith,</hi> the other <hi>that faith cannot be ioyned vnto, or stand vvith anie outvvard helpes for the encrease therof.</hi> Litle mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile, he found so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I said if the sighes and groanes (in that kinde of praying) were of faith, yt would, minister matter without a booke: this sentence I may confirme by manie testimonies of scripture, that no peruerted spirit can gainesay or resist: the scripture teacheth vs euery where, <hi>that in praying the spirit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie helpeth our infirmities,</hi> no other helpes mentioned or can be collected in the present action of prayer through the Scripture. <hi>He hath sent into our hearts the spirit of his Sonne crying:</hi>

                  <hi>ABBA Father. vve beleeue, therfore vve speake.</hi> Yet here is not anie shew of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, but of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, praying for our wantes. But this may be gathered, that God onely accepteth the fruits of his owne spirit in prayer, and requireth no more of anie, but that euerie one according to the proportion of faith, pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as occasion in them requireth. Nowe to conclude that because in praying we neede not a booke to speake for vs, when the heart it self and booke of our Conscience speaketh with God; that therefore fayth neuer nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth instruction, but is perfect, were sclanderous, false, and senselesse. The cause then of these heresies proceed hereof, that your selfe <hi>Mr. GIFFORD</hi> would needes frame two <hi>syllogismes,</hi> and in the moodes of your malice, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the proposition of the present action in praying, to a general sentence of all times and actions, though both our question here was of the verie action of praying, and in the conclusion of that very poynt within six lynes after this, you had these wordes; <hi>Euen in the time of their begging at Gods hands</hi>; so that these heresies must be <hi>Mr. Giffords</hi> and not myne, seeing they are found to be coyned of his idle brayne, and godles heart, only to defame the trueth.</p>
               <p>But (say you) <hi>the most part are ignorant, weake, short of memorie, &amp;c. therefore need al helps to stir them vp to pray, &amp;c.</hi> where, by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, reading is not praying, but a help to stir vp to pray. And euen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all our errours arise, that you cannot discerne the difference of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts, with the distinct vse of them. We doubt not but before prayer, and all the dayes of our life we haue neede of helps of instruction to praye aright, and for the fitnes of the mind and bodie, often fasting, reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, etc. are great helpes to go before to humble our selues in praying: but in the present action of prayer when the heart is talking with God, the eyes, hands, etc. with attention lift vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al the powers of our soules and bodies conuersant with God, to take a booke and read cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this action a help, but a confounding of the mind, of Gods ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a doing we know not what, though before and after, it be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes ordeyned of God, to instruct vs to pray and al other dueties.</p>

               <p>Here I must call all men that reade this fruictlesse discourse to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Mr. Giffords abuse of his tongue / to the defacing of Gods truth. In his Epistle he proclaymed / <hi>that I called all men Idolaters</hi>; which you shall perceaue to be his owne wordes / and to that end I will breifly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat yt. In my first writing I affirmed the reading imposed <hi>Liturgies</hi> by stint a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d limitation instead of true invocation / as also all reading me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for praying / to be idolatrye. In his answeare he said / <hi>he could not see by what collour yt could be called Idolatrie, or maintayned out of Gods worde so to be; but yt seemes the penners of these things take euery sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first table of the lawe, to be Idolatry: if they do so (saith he) and with all do hold that no Idolater shalbe saued, then doubtlesse all are lost, &amp;c.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t excursorie I answered / that all false and devised worship by mans inuention was Idolatrye / as the first and second commandemens

did testifie: And so admit all the breaches of the first table were not idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye / yet reading of mens writinges instead of praying must needes be ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latry / seing yt is a transgression of the second Commandement. Furder (though I needed not have followed his emptye head / euen a cloude wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout water) yet I proceeded to proue / that no idolater could be saved but by repentance for their knowne sinne / and craving pardon with David for their hidden sinnes and secreat faults.<note place="margin">Psalm 119</note> Moreouer (said I) do you thinke anie man is free from all inward and outward idolatrye / seing we cannot keep one Commaundement / and in some things we sinne all. In which wordes i plainelie reproued his grossnes that concluded all men idolaters which committed any idolatrye / and that no idolater could be sauld / and distinguished betweene the sinne of ignorance / weaknes / and inperfection etc. in Gods children / and open professed obstinate idolatrie.

And i leaue it to the consideration of all men / whether i may not say / that they which tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the first or second Commaundements / do commit Idolatrie / without absurdity.

               <p>But to auoyde this foyle / he hath an other euasion.

And what mendes wil you make for this sclandering and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the truth / to all the world? all that I desire is your repentance and amendement / which God graunt vnto you if you you be his.</p>

you would oppose the worde <hi>Apocrypha</hi> against the liuely voyce of Gods graces when you see I said onlie / that no <hi>Apocrypha</hi> might be brought into the publique assemblies.

Secondly whether the same spirit teacheth vs to pray / that taught the holie men of God before tyme.

Secondlie / to say ouer certeine numbers of words or phrases of the Scripture of custome or affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / without feeling of / or asking for our present wantes / is hipocresie. Therfore I will conclude as I beganne / myne Argument standing good / that / To do any thing in the worship of God werof we have no warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods worde / is synne.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3575:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reading prayer vpon a booke is not praying / but an instruction of the heart to praye. If you would stand to this / we should not neede haue so much labour / and all the places of Scripture which you haue alleadged for to proue reading praying / haue beene meerly wrested by you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the simple. Wel (say you) but if the heart be first instructed before yt can vtter matter in prayer / whie may not the heart againe be moued with hearing or reading the worde / and so vtter prayer. Yes I graunt / and still you graunt me / that reading is not praying but moueth to pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yer: Then all your assemblies that haue no prayer but reading praiers / haue no prayer at all / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all that vse read praier for praying do not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye but mocke with God. See if your Ordinarie will here be pleased with you: Yet you would denie all this with the same breath by a shifte / saying: The heart is moued whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one heareth the prayer of the minister and presently sendeth fourth prayers togeather with him. I trust you will not say that the heart of the hearer prayeth one thing / and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister an other / againe the prayer of the minister is the prayer of the people / by Gods ordinance / whiles they thinck one thinge / and are mett to one end / for auoyding confusion one speaketh / yet al pray togeather one thing. But the minister may as well preach and pray / or reade anie chapter and praye / as reade praiers / and praye both in one action of the minde / and voyce / which were strange. Your cauill then / whether the heart may be moved / and pray / both at once / is taken awaye / seing you graunt reading and praying / two seuerall excercises of the heart and voyce / which cannot be performed at once with liuely voyce. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is then / that either ye must fetch the matter out of your booke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you reade prayer / and so do not pray for the particular wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wher with the heart is moued and pressed before you come / or els you pray not with liuely voyce at al / when you read.

All other ceremonies in Gods worship then Christ and his Apostles haue prescribed vs / are diabolicall / and not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical. Then / for all thinges donne in the Church in those publique actions / the offenders must be admonished / if they transgresse the rules of the word.

You are not well pleased that I will not say it is no Church that hath a <hi>liturgie</hi> imposed vpon yt / and because you haue so often sclandered me / that I hold yt so / you take great paynes to conclude it. I haue said that to impose me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s writings / to be read in stead of praying / is to worship God after a false maner / that yt is a devise of Antichrist / a deade letter / quenching the spirit / not of faith / Idolatrous is changing the worke of the spirit into an Idoll / breauing our Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libertye / and so most detestable. By these speaches I condemne al chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches say you: this is not true / I condemne but the sinne.

They may with St. Paule say / it is no longer I that do it / but sinne that dwelleth in me: for if the yoake wherwith he was held captiue in part / could not take from him / but that he was the Lordes free seruaunt / it is no reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that some outwarde bondage should make the Church not to be the spouse of Christ. If a man commaund his wife (saith he) to do a thinge / and ther be violent force to withhold her / shee is not to be blamed. Rom. 7.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3575:26"/>
Also bondage or seruitude is to be al commaundement / and to yeild o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in subiection. Now to be in outward bondage to an other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward government / other lawes / officers / and ordinances then Christs / is to be by outward subiection servantes of Antichrist / which layeth an other foundation: for by outward profession we cannot stand (to mans iudgment) professed subiects to two kings at enimitye / But we must be an enimie to the one / and so esteemed of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / much lesse members vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two divers heades.</p>
                  <p>This then is mine answere here. 1. That it is an heresie to say a man may stand in bondage to open knowen sinne / and the free seruaunt of Christ to vs by outward profession / both at one instant. 2. That it is a falsifying of the Scripture / to say that St. Paul (in the 7. to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) was in bondage to sinne / when he / in the inner man resisted sinne / and daylie preuailed against the sinne / which his flesh would haue led him captiue in / if there had not beene a stronger power to ouercome that enimie. For he ther reasoneth of the benefite of the lawe / to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest our sinne / and our conquest ouer sinne by daylie repentance / and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing of sinne in our selues / fighting against sinne / victory ouer sinne / thoughe yt contynuallie rebell. 3. How blasphemous were yt to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in knowen sinne / in bondage to yt / and to say / it is sinne that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs / and not we / and so still to blesse our selves without amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O horrible peruertinge of the Scriptures to mens destruction. 2. Pet. 3.16.4. That ther is no Argument to be drawen / nor consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to followe / from the reliques of sinne / and corruption of the fleshe in one man / or the whole Church / and a professed bondage to al false go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: no not betweene the open committing of sinne in the whole Church / or some m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cor. 10.21 / 5. Lastlie / that the subiection to an other gouernement / is as a wife that committeth adulterie. Hosea 2.</p>
                  <p>I then reason thus on the contrary with you. Any man that after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation committeth open knowen sinne / and contynueth obstinate / as a bond seruaunt thervnto / standeth not the professed seruaunt of Christ / but of synne Ezechiel. 18. till he repent / so the whole Church / that persisteth in open knowen sinne / and persequuieth the messengers that reproue the same. Then / as euerie member of the false Church standeth a professed seruaunt of sinne / so the whole assemblies that stand profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed subiects of false gouernment / no censures sf admonition belonging vnto them / but calling of them to repentance and seperation from the false Church. Then / as the wife that geueth her self to be one with an other man / is an adulteresse Rom. 7.3. so that Church that subiecteth herself to an other gouernment / ordinances / and lawes then Christs / is an harlot.

                  <p>And herevpon I might saye / Paul never contynued captiue in sinne / but was alwaies renewed by repentance. Furder / this spirit of God (the sparkes wherof were never quenched vtterlie) did not / nor could not consent or giue place vnto sinne / for here is the enimitye and battel betweene the spirite and the flesh / euerie where spoken of Gal. 5,16.17. Rom. 7. May I not now say then / that Paul never contynued capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnto sinne / nor consented vnto sin concerninge the Inner man or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve place vnto sinne in that place mentioned / without heresie: And still reproue you / that when Paul reasoneth of the old man / or corruption in him / you will conclude yt of the new man / or inner man / and of the whole man / when you see euidently / he opposeth the one against the other: For whiles the spirit striueth against sinne / and raigneth in vs / thoughe the fleshe rebell / and cause vs to sinne seauen times a daye / yet are we not ouercome of sinne / so to remayne in bondage to sinne / that it should contynue to reigne in vs / as you may see in the same chapter Rom. 7.5.6. Where you alleage then / that Paul saw a lawe in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers / which did lead him captiue vnto sinne / you do falsifie the text: for he saith leading me captiue / and not did leade etc. for ther was a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger man / or a stronger then man / that suffered not the lawe of his mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers to reigne: for saith he / I my self in my minde serue the law of God / but in the flesh the law of sinne / so that the whole man could not be said to serue sinne. But (say you) afterward as concerning then the

printed / therevpon chardging me I cannot reade twoo words right of hebrue / which were no great ignominie in their priesthood: But shall we say Mr. Giff. cannot reade two words in latine rightly / because in the 28. page of his booke he repeateth out of Augustine / upoli sui / for po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puli sui? This I mention / as sory to see the defendor of his false Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie so emptie / to leaue founde doctrine / and thus to trifle: if he had bene at the print / it should haue bene ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it seemeth. Now to the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne gathered of this word <hi>Coh.</hi> Mr. Gif. would invert the words in his owne se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se / thus: that where I said / the Lord did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund to say the same words but the like / that is according to those directions of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / he gathereth / that I should affirme yt vnlawfull to vse those words at all / yea that they might not vse all or anie of these words at anie ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Whether this be a Christian interpretation of my words or no / I leaue not only to all mens / but chieflie to his owne conscience to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. Yet he still couertly persisting in his error / produceth a place of scripture / where the word <hi>Coh</hi> (as he thinketh) is vsed for the saying of the verie words. Exod.;. The Lord said to Moses / Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel Eheie hath sent me vnto yee / moreouer God said vnto Moses / thus shalt thou say vnto them / The God of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers etc. According to Mr. Grenewoods interpretation (saith he) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is not commanded to say those words / but the like. True / he is not here bound to this certeine number of words / or the same words. If then they should say / what is his name that hath sent thee / he may not say Eheie hath sent me / because God said <hi>Coh</hi> etc. Now Mr. Giffard sheweth himself ashifter: I did neuer hold it vnlawfull to vse anie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Scripture as need required / it is your sclander: where you have in all your bookes affirmed we hold it vnlawfull to say thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come / or vse anie phrase of Scripture to right vse: your woeful wresting of the tongue for vntruthes / wil tourne to your further iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I proued only by the word <hi>Coh,</hi> which signifieth (after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) that God commaunded not the very certaine number of words to be said.</p>
            <p>And where I sayd the word <hi>Coh</hi> was so vsed in all the Prophets (when they say / Thus saith the Lord) to this end / that neither the holy Ghost had registredal their verie words they spake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor that they were tyed to the prescript number of words / he would haue it thought I should hold those words which are recorded / not to be the words of God / which wresting of my words / is but his emptie quarreling to tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne away this firme doctrine: namely / that God did in those formes of prayer mentioned by him / prescribe the somme of their blessings a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions / whervnto they ought according to their seuerall occasions wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the limits of these doctrines / frame their suites and desires / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did not tye them to a certaine number of words.

            <p>But that this is a popish dreame to think in prayer they were bound to some certeyne number of words saying ouer / it was also conuinced vnto him by the Greeke word <hi>Houtos,</hi> where Christ commandeth his Disciples saying / <hi>When you pray, pray thus, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Which word <hi>Thus</hi> Mat. 6.9. singnifieth (after this maner) or according to this forme / rules / and instructions: for if the commandement shoulde goe to bynde vs to the very words / then this word (<hi>when</hi> you pray) would bynd vs never to vse other words / for the text saith / <hi>when you pray, say thus.</hi> To this he answereth / that respecting the rules for matters / <hi>when</hi> is as much as whensoeuer you pray / because we may not depart from those matters conteyned in those general petitions: But in words it is not so there / We must consider to distinguish et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>3. Wel / hath he not lost himself / and still against his will yeilded the matter: namely that wee are not in these formes of prayer bound to the verie words saying ouer / and that the holy Ghost did neuer by commandement stint or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vs to anie words in praying / which in deed is common with inchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters: And I take it he will easily yeild me this point / for if he remember <hi>Augustine</hi> to teach / that then we pray that prayer which Christ taught his Disciples / when our prayers are grounded vpon those doctrines and instructions / or to that effect: And Calvine to say: the Sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not prescribe vs what words we must vse in prayer / he should haue put vs to lesse trouble: So that besids his mass-booke was neuer prescribed by the Lord himself or warrant of his word / he seeth it vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lawful to apportion / limit and stint as by measure and waight certeine numbers of wordes / sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces etc. in prayer. As for his examples of the Psalmes: I refer to my former answere / namely / that praying is our thing / and singing a psalme an other.</p>
            <p>Now then we haue heard that reading is not praying or any help to pray in the instant action of praying / when we should powre forth our owne hearts to God: Also that it is vnlawful to bynde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to numbers of words or sentences in praying. Let vs come to the first generall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument / which is this. No Apocrypha must be brought into the publick assemblies / for there only Gods word and the lively voyce of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3575:31"/>
his owne graces must be heard in the publick assemblies: But mens wrytings and the reading them ouer for prayer are Apocrypha: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not be brought into the publick assemblies / eyther for lawes or worship. Here hee finds fault with the worde Apocrypha (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath bene an antient word in this sense / and now published in their Bibles to distinguish other writings from the authentick scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures) willing mee to goe to the matter yt self / drawing by firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion / that nothing is to be allowed any place in the Church / which is not the perfect rule yt self in writing or without errour vttered in speach / and he wil yeild. This I did proue vnto him by an Argument hee was not able to answere / and did leaue out the word <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> thus. Only the Canonical Scriptures and liuely voice of Gods ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne graces are to be brought into the publick assemblies for doctrine and prayer: But mens writings or Collections are neither Canonical Scripture / nor the liuely voice of Gods graces in such as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to speake in the publick asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies. Therfore no mans writings may be brought into nor imposed vpon the publick assemblies for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and prayer.</p>
            <p>Now where he cauilleth about the perfectnes of the rule and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfectnes of the graces / it doth not help him: For the word of GOD being of necessitie by the lawe and ordinance of God / to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad in our owne language / I trust he will not denye yt to be the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of GOD for the vnperfectnes of the translation / being (to the best search the Church can make) skanned by the original tongue and stil amended / or at least the Church no further bound to yt / then yt shal be found to be the perfect rule: so likewise the liuely voice of GODS graces are not for the imperfectnes to be excluded / being Gods appointed ordinance / neither is anie fault in the translation to be allowed / and errour in doctrine or prayer are presently to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and repented of. Maister Giffard then must denye the Bible translated into our owne language to be the Canonicall Scriptures / and denye the liuely voice of GODS lawfull officers / and such as are therevnto called / in doctrine and prayer / to be the manifestations of the Spirit and vtterance of Gods graces for the assemblie / or els grant the proposition firme: And if hee can put dead mens writinges into the place of either of these / I will yeild. In the meane time I hold such translations to be the worde of GOD / and by Gods ordinance put into our owne la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage / to all our knowledges retayning the words of GOD / which word and the lyuely vse of Gods owne graces in the mouth of such as he therevnto appointeth / are only to be brought into the publicke assemblies for prayer and doctrine / for GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded these vnto vs as his owne ordinances in his assemblies / and no other means wherby either God speaketh vnto vs / or his people vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him / in the Congregation. To this all the Scriptures beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / the word is always firme / confirmed with miracles from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen / and commended to vs by Christ / the Prophetts and Apostles / to be

the foundation / Canon / light / lanterne / etc. the graces of the Spirit gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the interpretation / prayer / doctrine etc. Christ is ascended vp into heauen / and hath giuen giftes vnto men to serve their tyme and minister in their place in this house. These graces stil renewed / not only in those called of GOD in this seruice for their dayly administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / but newe workmen thrust forth into this haruest / as the Lord of the house disposeth: which graces of his Spirit are compared to two oliue branches / which emptie out of themselues thorow two golden pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. Zacharie 4.12. And to seuen thunders which vtter their voices that cannot be written. Away therfore with your patched mass-boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke / yt may neither stande for a foundation in Gods house / nor for the lyuely voyces of these thunders: you make yt a monstrous Idoll by putting yt in either of these vses / yet you will make yt serve for both.

Wee can cast out the errours in the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or doctrine or prayer / and yet reeaine Gods worde in our owne language / and the liuely voice of his graces in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Paraphrases wee hold to be mens writinges and expositions / and not the word of GOD / nor the liuely voice of Gods grace of interpretation or prayer / therefore to be excluded this place of service vnto GOD. Thus you see the further you wrastle / the further you make your wares / the best of them / odious to euerie godly conscience. You say I deceiue the simple by gyuing them one crabbe amongst many apples: but you may behold your best apples such as the holy GHOST hath foretold vs <hi>Revelation.</hi> 18. to be entisements to euil: It is well you will grant my Propositions so sound: and I would wish (if such de GODS wil) they might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sauoured.</p>
            <p>Nowe because I wil not stand either repeating or contending about Syllogismes / I will take this much yeilded of your owne conclusions / which is as much in effect as I haue affirmed were you teach me thus to reason. No mans writings are the vndoubted truth of God / but haue errours and imperfections: therfore men cannot further ground vpon them / then they be consonant to the Canonicall Scriptures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine / The Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets: therfore our faith is not to rest vpon me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s writings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon doth necessarily follow / that if mens writings may not be buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon nor rested vpon / howe should you dreame it lawfull to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them for lawes vpon the publick assemblies / or to haue them there read to beare rule as the wordes of God? And this you confessed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3575:32"/>
in an other of your writings / that GOD spake vnto vs out of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted worde / or by his owne word. If then GOD speake not vnto vs by mens writinges that be of priuate interpretation / in the assemblie / nor that they can be made groundwork to buyld our faith vpon / or to rest assured vpon / yt will be granted I hope that they are not to be imposed v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on the publick assemblies as lawes and ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les / but left to euerie mans private vse in their libertie / as they will answere for themselues what vse they put them to / and whither they doe not prefer them before the booke of GOD / or preiudice themselves by them. This first poinct is then plaine / That only GODS vndoubted worde is to be imposed / brought in / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the publick assemblies as lawes and rules / no other writings being authentick or Canonical.</p>
            <p>But here Mr. Giffard doth in effect affirme / that the word of God yt self is not authentick or Canonical / except in the Hebrew or Greeke Copie: Wherin he goeth a litle beyond the Papists / that wil yet allow the worde of GOD in latine: And if it shoulde be defended / that the worde of GOD were not the worde yt self that wee haue in our ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne language / it will follow that no man could haue assurance of faith / except he vnderstoode both Hebrew and Greeke / yea be able soundly to interpret the Scriptures in both. If the translations be so far mens writings that yt ceaseth generally to be the word of GOD that is not written in Hebrew or Greek / and mens writinges not to be grounded or rested vpon / where shall our assurance stand? And might not Mr. Giffard as well say the Hebrew and Greek Copi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence then we see whiles you go about to abase the Canonicall Scriptures / and extol your patched Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And where you say that you decide not controversies by anie transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / but by the Authentick Copies of the Hebrew and Greke / I trust you speak only of such as are able by the interpretation thereof so to decide controversies / and holde it not vnlawfull for anie such as haue not that help / to convince errour by the powre of the word and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one place with an other in anie translation / according to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of faith / though I grant we ought to vse the best approued.

And when the Church commandeth them so far to be vsed as they are commanded of God / the Churche doth but ratifye and see GODS lawe executed: so that you haue lost your selfe / whiles you sholde haue proued your bold affection: That the Church hath power to ordeyne lawes / for to create or make lawes / which you see the folly of / being nowe driuen to another shift: that in the perticular thinges whereof GOD hath giuen generall lawes / wee may make setled lawes / and yet but for the tyme they be convenient: Wheras in deed GODS lawe is the same and nothing ells.

And as for these thinges / they doe as much binde vs nowe if ther be like cause / namelie / not in Idolothyts / blood / or that which is strangled to offend our weak brethren / if the Iues should be now agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne called / neither to offend anie in meate or drinke for whome Christ hath dyed: Neither was ther here any absolute law made of these thinges / nor necessitye for the present tyme / furder then it should bee necessary for the respect set downe / for otherwise it had bene to build againe the thinges destroied / onlye they thus counselled and admonis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed the Gentiles to vse their libertye in these thinges / as they might gyve noe offence to theyr weake brethren of the Iues / the more to dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we them on in the wayes of CHRIST: for they doe not inioyne yt as a lawe / but tell them they shall doe well if they obserue these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges / by no necessitye inforced. But wee doe not nowe observe these thinges / the occasions being remoued. True / therfore I trust you will grant / that no man shall bee furder bounde to anye constitution in such thinges indifferent / then there shall bee cause / neyther need wee publicke order to retract: so that you leaue the matter to me / that wee can bee no further bounde in such thinges / then by those rules of edifijng / order / comlines / occasion shall require / so that wee neither need nor can haue setled lawes herein: howe much more bondage and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is imposed vnder this Antichristian yoke / the thinges being of themselves most lothsome and detestable Popery / abrogating and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voide all the true ordinances lawes and worship of CHRIST /

these? If Maister Giffard shoulde thus vnderstande the worde may hee is in the same fault to say the regenerate may sinne of frailty: And I answere furder / hee coulde vnderstand the worde <hi>may</hi> otherwise / if (as in all his writinges) hee caryed not this minde to take all in euil part / to quarrell / hee coulde have vnderstood it thus: that God suffereth of his elect to fall into such sinne / yet hee is able to reduce them by repentance / and hath made promise to receive them iff they retourne / and not haue cauilled in this maner in such thinges / the horrour in the verye naming of which sinnes shaketh the flesh and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the godlye to heare or behold: so that his drift is but to cast in a litle wormewood / to deface the truth deliuered: Therefore I will onlye prooue the generall doctrine before affirmed / and for these perticulars / let him that taketh pleasure in raking in them / being sinnes not once to bee named amongst GODS children / answere himself.

            <p>That GODS elect after regeneration doe fall into presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinne / and for a time persist in obstinate sinne / and may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored by repentance / I thus prooue: Manie of GODS children may bee excommunicat / and vpon the repentance bee receiued agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / as the incestuous person 1. Cor. 5. therefore do for a time remayne in obstinate sinne. Againe euerie sinne is to bee prayed for / but that one sinne against the holye Ghost 1. Iohn. 5.16. Therfore presumptuous sinne is committed of GODS elect after regeneration. That all presumptuous sinne is not sinne against the holy GHOST / wee shall see by the discription of that sinne Hebr. 6. and 10. where there is dispy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Spirit / accompting the blood of IESUS an vnholy thinge / persecuting the light they haue sometimes tasted of / and such like notes / which are degrees. further then presumption: for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is presumption of ignorance / of rashnes / of hope of mercy / and many times do the Prophets charge the people with rebellion against GOD: so that all presumption cannot have the curse <hi>maranatha</hi> pronounced vpon it / or the persons not to bee prayed for. But sure I grant / that presumption is neere to that sinne / and there cannot bee that high sinue without presumption. But now if all sinne but sinne of frayltie were vnpardonable / your Clergie were in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case / that thus maynely resist the truth / and persecute GODS servants.</p>
            <p>Neither is this doctrine anye way contrarie to that I delyvered / 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3575:38"/>
namelye / that the regenerat man cannot bee said to stande in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to sinne after regeneration / and the servant of GOD at the same time by outwarde profession / for none are in bondage to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne after their calling to the faith / (to our iudgment) but suche as contynue obstinate in their open knowne sinne after due admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that such stande not by outwarde profession the servants off CHRIST but of sinne / and are to bee excommunicate / hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly granteth: and herevpon merueileth how I shoulde gather / that obstinat grosse sinners shoulde not bee excommunicat: which hee might playnlye perceiue if hee had eyes / for if al the regenerat bee in bondage to sinne / and so the servants of sinne and of Sathan / howe should they cast out an other for bondage out of their fellowship by the power of CHRIST? If Maister Giffard say / becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the obstinate is in greater bondage then the other / this proueth not that the bond can cast out the bond by the power of Christ.</p>
            <p>Againe / if all bee in bondage / then none can bee houlden without for being in bondage to sinne: so that none shoulde be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat / none without / the worlde and the CHURCH / light and darknes / CHRIST and BELIALL should bee mingled together.</p>
            <p>To all which hee hath made no answere / but demandeth certeine questions / and maketh such a formall conclusion / as if all were in bondage vnto sinne. His questions I grant all affirmantiuely / yet denye his consequence. Let him plainely proue therfore by euidence of SCRIPTURE / that all that do sinne are bondslaues of sinne / and when hee hath so done / I shall therevpon conclude him a flat Anabaptist in the cheif ground of their profession. Verye gladlye therefore woulde hee leave out the worde (bondage) / and falslye accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and sclandereth mee / in saying I holde that men can not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appeare sinners / and stand the servants of CHRIST both at a time / which is an open vntruth: Yt is hee / that cannot put difference betwene sinning / and bondage vnto sinne / so that in one worde all his questions are answered: If anie bee in bondage to sinne / hee standeth a seruant thereof.</p>
            <p>Now for the 7. to the Romanes / the APOSTLE setting forth the strift betwene the flesh and the Spirit / speaketh somtimes in the person of the one (if I may so speake) and somtimes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / somtimes of the newe man or regenerat part / or of himself so far as hee is regenerat: somtimes of the olde man / which is not wholly slayne / but ful of rebellion striueth for maisterie. Nowe I must demand of him / whether of these two haue the preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / dominion and rule in the regenerat / the graces of the Spirit / or the rebellions of the flesh? The same APOSTLE saith the SPIRIT / and that part off the man renewed there with / 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3575:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which wee call the inner man: In the 8. Cap. he maketh it playne / <hi>The lawe of the spirit of life in CHRIST hath freed mee from the lawe of sinne and of death.</hi> What is the lawe of the Spirit but the powre / ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le / and dominion of the Spirit of GOD in vs? And what is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we of sinne / but the powre of sinne / and bondage / wherewith wee were somtimes led headlong by Sathan at his pleasure / but are nowe freed / that it no more doth reigne or beare rule in vs vnto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Againe / whosoeuer are ledd by the Spirit of GOD / are the sonnes of God / and in the 7. Cap. 4. and 6. Cap. 16. <hi>Knowe you not that to whome you exhibit your selves servants vnto obedience, his servants you are to whome you giue your selves obedient</hi>? David feeling the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at assaultes of sinne in his flesh / and his inhabilitie to keepe the Lawe of GOD / earnestlye prayeth vnto the Lorde <hi>Direct my steppes in thy worde</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and let none iniquitie haue dominion, over mee.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the stronge man is cast out / CHRIST beareth the rule over vs and in vs / by his Spirit. So the scripture euerye where pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs Saincts by calling / Kinges / and Priestes / a people set free / not that wee sinne not in thought word and deede howrely and daylie / but that sinne hath not dominion ouer vs: If then wee were in bondage to sinne / wee are the servantes of sinne and of death / which GOD forbid.</p>
            <p>Where Maister Giffard therfore reasoneth thus: the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is imperfect / therefore the freedome is imperfect / therefore there is some bondage / yt is blasphemie: For first our freedome is perfect in CHRIST / ells his death is not sufficient. Then though our sanctification bee not perfect / yet is there no bondage / but a rebellion of sinne: which if yt shoulde reigne / wee were not the servantes of CHRIST: And while it seemeth for a time to reigne / and wee obstinatly to cleaue vnto yt / wee are iudged (soe far as men can iudge) the servantes of yt / and so gyuen ouer from / CHRIST vnto Satan / till the grace of the Spirit againe to our iudgement appeare to beare rule.</p>
            <p>As for David in the whole yeare after hee had commytted adulterye and murther / hee never pleaded for his sinne when hee was reproued not did no longer cleaue vnto yt. Soe likewise though wee fall and sinne / and bee ledd awaye with sinne / yet are wee not in bondage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto / vntil wee obstinatly and wilfully give our selues vnto yt from CHRIST / which you finde not in the 7. to the Roman. but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of sinne / a hatred of sinne / a will to doe good / a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and contynuall recouerye of himself / and flying vnto Christ. Soe that your doctrine is false / to saye / the Apostle stoode in some spirituall bondage / and my Argument still firme / that these Ministers and people which stande in a professed bondage to a false governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / their praiers
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3575:39"/>
are an abhomination vnto the Lorde / till they repent and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto CHRIST and his lawes and ordinances. Whiche the Lorde gyue them grace to doe / euen speedely to depart out of the house of bondage / and from all subiection of his Antichristian Hierarchie.</p>
