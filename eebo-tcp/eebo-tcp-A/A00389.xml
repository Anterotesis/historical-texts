            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He had not herde this principle of the spirite: Blessed be the deade, whiche dye in the lorde. He had not herde Paule lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge <note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note> and syghynge: I couet to be dissolued, and be with Christ. And, Christ to me is lyfe, and deathe is lucre. But it is nothinge to be <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> merueyled at, if they, whiche beleue, that the hole man perysheth by death, nor haue not this hope, whyche onely the fayth in Christe worketh in vs, eyther bewayle the deathe of other, or feare and abhorre their owne. This is rather to be merueyled, that


<pb facs="tcp:16736:6"/>
there be so many such as I am, which, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they haue lerned and do professe al Christis philosophie, yet so feare death, as thoughe eyther they do beleue, that nothing of man remayneth after the brethe expired, or as thoughe they mystruste the promyses of Christ: or els as thoughe they vtterly des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre of them selues. The first propretie of these thre is, of beastly personnes, suche as Sardanapalus was. The seconde is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles, which haue no truste in Christ, and the thirde is of theym that be ignoraunt of goddes mercye. In this behalfe they seme lyke to hethen persons, that be ignorant of god. For he is ignoraunt of god, that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not hym to be of infynite mercy. This without question, that the commun sorte of men do thus feare at the namynge of death, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth partly of the vnstedfastnes of faith, partely of the loue of worldly thinges. He knoweth of no tremblyng, which in ful trust sayth with the spostle: Whether we lyue, we <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> lyue to the lorde, or whether we dye, we dye to the lorde. Wherfore whether we lyue, or whether we dye, we be the lordes. But that the lorde ones hath receyued into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, can not peryshe.

I wyll not feare euyls, bycause thou arte with me. For the faith full lorde neuer forsaketh them; which yelde them holly to his grace, but kepeth them as the moste tender parte of his eye. For he is lorde both of lyfe and death, to whome nothinge is deade, but all thinges lyue, which cleaue to hym by faith. Of the weakenes of faythe is gendred the loue of temporall commodities. For if with our hole herte we beleued the thinges that god hath promysed vs by his sonne Jesus, all the delectations of this worlde shoulde sone be lyttell regarded, and death whiche setteth vs euer vnto them with a paynefulle (but yet a short) passage, shuld be les feared. The wyse man cryeth: O death, how bitter is thy memorye? But what addeth he? To <note place="margin">Eccle. 41.</note> a manne hauynge peace in his substaunce. He sayth not, hauynge ryches, For many good men haue possessed rychesse: but to him that hath his quietnes in them. That that is spo ken of ryches, the same is to be vnderstond of honours, pleasurs, wyfe, childern, kyns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>des, of beautie, youth, good helth, brefely of all kynde of commodities, which death plucketh frome both good and euyll.

For in these worldly goodes a manne to set his rest, this is to enioye theym, whiche he ought to vse, and that also by the waye, and as it were in his passage: as the apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertyseth the Corinthes, It remayneth bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, <note place="margin">2.

Than howe moche more ought al these transitorie thinges be of lytel regard, that are in daunger of so manye chaunces, whiche though no casualtie plucked away, yet death plucketh away all from all men? Adde herevnto, that they, whiche renne at a game, se howe moche space they haue left behynd them, and howe moch remaineth to the marke: And in tymes past they that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the Iubilie, knewe howe longe they might enioy that that they had bought. But there is no mortall man, whiche certainely knoweth, that he shall lyue vntyll the nexte day. We renne, but hauynge deathe in oure fete, yea carieng it aboute on all our body. We haue receiued our life frely of the lord, but condicionally, that we surrender it at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery moment, whan he demandeth it. Howe though it chanceth vs to liue vntil extreme age, whiche to how fewe it chaunceth, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man knoweth, O lorde god, what is the hole lyfe of man, but a very short rennynge place, wherin wyl we wyl we not, we renne contynuallye, slepe we, wake we, be we in welth or in wo? The contynuall course of the worlde carieth vs away lyke a boystous flode, although we seme to our selues, or to other, to stand styl. Than if prices of world ly thynges be estemed by the shortenes of tyme, howe moche more vyle oughte tho


<pb facs="tcp:16736:8"/>
thynges to be, whiche haue not so moch as one howre certayne? Nowe the thynges that we lyttelle regarde, we lyttelle force though they be plucked awaye from vs, as they why che be not at home, but in strange countreys, if any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>moditie appereth vnto them in the way, or in theyr ynnes, they cast not their mynd greatly therto, bicause they must leue forth with the thing that delyteth them, and if any inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modite chaunce them, they beare it easely, thinkyng thus, Here I dine, my supp is ordeined in an other place.

from the mattiers, nor yet the imagination of Idee, whiche Plato deuysed, causeth vs to dye wel, but if with the eies of feithe, we consider in our mindes the goodes passyng al mans wyt, whiche god hath promised by his son Jesus to them that trust vnto hym, &amp; the euils which he hath thretnid to infidels &amp; disobedient. Thone shal feare vs from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other shal prouoke vs to do wel. I grant an eternall veritie in certayn humayn lerninges, but suche as procureth to no man the true felicitie.

The summe of mans felicitie is to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate and prayse his maker, redemer, &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour. To this end is man created. This felicitie of man is oftentymes disturbed by the weakenes of this body, which we cary aboute, subiecte to so many necessities, to so many euyls, to so many peryls. In like wyse also saynt Paule, accombred with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall habytation, pytyfully syghynge crieth. O I vnhappy man, who shall delyuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

Of this affection be men of the ryght holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of whome though the bodyes kepe in erth, yet their treasure, harte, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is in heuens. But few men haue this perfection and strongenes of mynde: It is not gyuen to al men to say with Paul, Christ to me is lyfe, and to dye is a lucre.

For there be diseases, whiche do corrupte the inwarde weselles of the mynd, whyche persones be commonly called in the latyne tongue demoniaci, that is to saye, possessed with dyuels. But neyther by these thinges a man is not to be iuged, syth that Chrysosto thus doth moste louyngly comfort a certain monke, whiche was possessed with a dyuell. Howe be it tho kyndes of deth, which haue a manyfest colour of wyckednes, is a good christen mans parte to desyre to escape, and to abhorre it. Contrary wise, somme we see haue so gentyll a deathe, that they seme to sleepe, and not to dye. But what facion of death so euer chaunceth, no man is therby to be estemed. No, not so moch as of them, whiche by the lawes are for their mysche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious dedes, put to execution, though they chaunce to haue a shamefull dethe, we maye not iudge temerousely.

Why wyshe we but ones that thynge to chaunche, whyche dayly ought and may be done of vs? For it is beste counsayl, that euery man before er he betake him to slepe, dilygentely examyne his conscience: and if he fynde any cryme committed that day, let hym knocke his breste, and callynge for the assistence of god, purpose certainly to lyue a better lyfe. Nor there is no cause why any man shulde here say, I am letted with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry busynes, I haue no leyser. To a thyng so necessarie the fourth part of an hour suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyseth. It is not longe to say, I haue synned, Haue mercy. And this is sufficient, soo it be spoken with the harte. No man commytting hym selfe to slepe, is sure to awake. Howe great danger is it than, in that state to slepe, in whiche if deathe oppresse vs, whyche is brother germaine to slepe, we shall peryshe


<pb facs="tcp:16736:30"/>
for euermore? So great peryll maye be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chued with one shorte thoughte. This is dayly to be done to god: but to the prieste, vicare of god. iii. or. iiii. tymes or ofter in the yere with pure confession to purge the conscience, shulde brynge moche tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, and it shall cause that the person, whan he dyeth, shal not be troubled with the scru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulosytie of confession.</p>
            <p>Furthermore bycause in the article of deth, the contemplation of our lordes death, &amp; of the communion of the hole churche, which is the body of Christ, is a principal comfort, it were well done, in both to be dylygently exercysed in the lyfe, to thentent, the doing ofte repeted, may tourne into custome, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome into cours, and cours into nature.

For than in good ernest, we must fight hande to hande, nor there is no skypping away, but on both sydes with all our myghte and power, the maystrie must be tried. So that to this bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerynge mans mynde must alway be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryd. For what shall an vnexperte souldiour do here, whiche neuer fought with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, nor neuer assayd his strength, gyles, craftes, awaytes, nor yet his owne valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? It is a great parte of victorie, to make warre with a knowen ennemy. So the most doughty sowdiour, or rather captayn saynt Paule, That we be not enuyronned, Íùô he, of Satanas.

they, whiche before ieoperdy semed verye fierse, in the very poynt seme moste feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So there be some, whiche whan they be hole, bost their quietnes and vncareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of conscience, and that they be redy pre pared to deathe, yea and couete to flee out of this wretched world, trustyng on a feith (I wote not what) that Christe hathe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed vs lyfe, and for our synnes hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, sayeng, that it forceth not, what oure workes be, whether good or euylle.

They hepe vp, how great iniquite is it to dout of the promises of god: but none do more tremble than they, which doubte not of the promyses of god. For he that beleueth not, that helle is prepared for them whiche lyue wickedly, but that dethe bringeth an ende of all euyls, with an extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyshment of the hole man, doth lesse feare ceathe.

saythe, we haue trauayled with chylde, and haue brought forth the spirite of helthe. In Luke the thirde chapter, the people afea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the preachynge of John Baptiste, whyche exhorted to repentaunce, sayenge, Nowe the axe is sette to the roote of the tree, sayde: What shall we do? But onelesse they had beleued John, they wold not haue said, What shall we do? Lykewise in the actes of the Apostelles, the multitude feared with the preachynge of Peter, conceyuynge a dreade by their beleuynge, with a prycked conscence, sayth to Peter, &amp; the other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels: What shall we doo, O bretherne? they wold not haue said so, if their feith ne were, pryckyng their conscience with the feare of helle. This tremblynge in a man also that lyueth welle, is not gendred of a mystruste towarde the promyses and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>minations of god, or of the not beleuyng in the artycles of the fayth, or of doubtynge of the power of the sacramentes, which they haue of the deathe of Christe: but it ryseth of inwarde knowlege of our wekenes, whiche is gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than may be fully vnderstande of vs. Of singular or particular thinges we be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned to be sure, howe be it we maye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of no person. As, for ensaumple, it is necessary to beleue, that who so euer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth with faythe the sacrament of baptime,


<pb facs="tcp:16736:34"/>
receyueth free remission of all synnes, but it is not necessarie to beleue, that this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptised is free from all synnes. For it maye be, that in this manne there is a peculyar thyng, whiche letteth the general power of the sacramente. Likewise it is of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of penaunce. It is a wyckednesse to doubte, whether he be assoyled of his syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche hath rightly taken this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet it is no poynt of heresie to doute, whether this man or that man is assoyled, bycause of peculiar impedimentes, we haue no knowlege. I except a syngular and euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente reuelation, or irrefutable, authoritie, whan there is no expresse authoritie of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or of the agrement of the church to the contrary. This doutynge is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydelitie, but a religious modestie, with his hole hart submitting him self to the wyl and iugement of god, yea though he wyl damne the man. For he shall not therfore be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but by this very submission he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue absolution, if to the religious tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>blyng be ioyned a truste that cometh of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye of Christe. The same is to be thought of the sacrament of the Aultar. We be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d generally to beleue, that the prieste, duelye doinge his offyce, dothe consecrate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and bloud of our lorde, but it is no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlynes to doubte, whether this manne or


<pb facs="tcp:16736:35"/>
that man dyd consecrate. For this is not to doubte of the sacrament, but of the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar circumstances, lettyng the vertue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the sacrament. Lykewise we beleue of necessitie, that men by faith and charitie towarde our lorde Iesu, obteyn euerlasting helthe: yet it is lefull to dout, whether this man or that be in the same state. Howe be it neyther of other men we ought rasihely to iuge, and in our selues hope oughte to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, togyther with the increase of loue and feyth. The same must we thynke of the promyses and manaces of scriptures. For the matter of doutynge ryseth not of god, which can not ly, but of vs. It is not vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to man, howe excedyng good thinges god hath promysed, but to them that feare and loue hym. But who of vs is there, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath shewed feare as dewe to suche a lorde, and loue, due and worthy for suche a parent? Wherfore they doubt not, whether god be true in his promises, but whether we be worthy of his promyses. Faythe, hope, charitiie, drede, be gyftes of the spirite.</p>
            <p>Who tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> knoweth, whether the feyth &amp; cha ritie, whiche he hath, be of this sort of gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which make vs the beloued of god, and whether they suffyse to euerlasting helthe? Lykewyse god by his sonne hath promised forgiuenes of all synnes, but ones by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme,


<pb facs="tcp:16736:35"/>
yf it be duely taken. Who is there of vs, which hath not by many wayes spotted the whyte garment, which was frely gyuen vs in baptyme? There is prepared a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of penaunce, but to theym, whiche with their hole hert be conuerted to the lorde. Here let euery man examyn hym self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his hole hart he be conuerted to the lord, whether he hath an hert truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humbled, and yf he hath, whether it be after a sufficient maner. The baptyste cryeth: Do ye fruytes worthy repentaunce. Who dare take vppon hym, that he hath in due forme hatyd and detested his synnes? God thretneth wrathe and hell to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his preceptis: and how oft casting awaye the fere of hym, breake we theym? Whom shalt thou fynde, which feareth not more the displesure of a prince or iuge mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, than of the lyuynge god? Further, how ofte chaunceth it, that manne loueth more a man than god, suffring for his mortal frend, that whiche he wolde refuse to suffre for Christes sake? certes I am this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that I thynke the fayth of good men, alwaye to be ioyned togither with a deuout and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tremblynge.

But as it is not alwayes a signe of a valiant courage or faithefulnes, not to fere deathe (for sometyme it is token of a brutyshe ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelesnes and lacke of reason, sometyme of an outragious and gyantyshe felnes: at the approchinge of death to waxe fearefull) is not alway a signe of distruste or of an euyll conscience. Otherwhyles it is a mere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection, accordynge to the varietie of bodyes, which in some is more moderat, and in other more vehement. Thus feared Ezechias deathe, a man whiche with perfit harte walked before god, but he fered, not grutchynge and murmurynge against god, but with teares, prayenge it from hym, and his prayer was harde. I knew certayn wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which at the onely mention of deathe


<pb facs="tcp:16736:38"/>
wolde begyn to tremble, &amp; yet the self same women, whan their death approched, were most stronge and most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>stant. For that fere and quyuering came not of an yll conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, but of a peculiar weakenes of the woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde, or of nature. The affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s of nature if they be ouercome by vertu, doo encrease the victorye, they do not signify a mystrust. So a man shall se some wyttes standynge in their owne conceyt, which do easyly satisfie them selfes in any maner of thinge. There be agayn wyttes of base courage, in nothing contentinge them selfes, although they do a thinge well: to whome if thou reherse all maner comfortes, yet they fele a remorse &amp; a gnawynge in their mynde, drawyng them to mystruste, &amp; hereby they coniecture, that they be not yet allowed of god, bicause they neuer fele a quietnes of conscience. But yf we wyll distinct nature from vertu, neyther they do greately truste vnto their quietnes, which please the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> selfes in any maner thing, neyther they cast away vtterly their hope, whiche haue a mynde euer suspectynge the worst. This is a vyce of a peculiar nature, &amp; not of the will, whiche vice a man muste not regard, if he can not conquere it: and take that for a thinge most ratified &amp; sure, which the spirite inwardly speaketh, thoughe the fleshe be neuer so moch against it. I suppose


<pb facs="tcp:16736:38"/>
that this is also natural, that men wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>their last day draweth nere, be so in maner trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted, that they allowe none of all those thinges, whiche they dyd in their lyfe, not bycause they be naughte &amp; vngodly, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be humayne and going from the perfection. How be it agaynst these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature we must fight with the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gth of the spirite, all be it by theym we aught to iuge, neyther other men, nor yet our selfes.</p>
            <p>But let vs returne to our former purpose, which was, to shew by what meanes weake soules (as the most parte be) maye be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, whom death maketh all dismayd and fearefull, in whose lyfe was moche forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, moche neglygence, moche ceassing, and brefely many mo euyl dedes than good dedes: and if there be any good dedes, they be spotted with moche rustynesse, so that to vtter them into the syght of god, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge elles but to angre god. Eyther the mynde is not redy at all vnto deathe, or els it is but lyghtly instructed. In the very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycle of deathe, whatte shall we doo to this man? No manne is to be despayred, so longe as the breth is in hym. The last battayle is atte hande. The space is shorte, he nedethe spedye counsell. What I saye shall we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle this manne, whyche is thus troubled not withoute greate cause? Fyrste yf he


<pb facs="tcp:16736:39"/>
haue heyres, that shall succede hym, it were best to commyt all the care touching the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament to them. First, this is a lytell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiousnes. If not, let hym as brefely as he can dispatche this mater by a nuncupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, or yf there be any better way. This done let hym auoyde out of his syght all bablers of worldely goodes, in whyche thinge manye men offende aboue measure, which bringe forth doubtes vnto the sycke man, that lyeth a dyenge, of the testament, and of externe thinges: Somtyme also they compell hym to subscribe his name, and that refusynge and vnwillyngly, detestinge their importunitie, by whom he can not be suffred to dye. Than whiche frendes, nothinge is more vnfrendly. Than, yf the maner of the sycknes suffreth, let hym study to heale his sowle before the body, by short confession, but pure and voyde of disceyte, and let hym take of the priest with a full fayth, and with hygh reuerence the remedy of penance, let hym crie for the mercy of god, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the bottom of his hart, and take a purpose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of lyfe, if it chanceth hym to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> if haply the prest be not at hand or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> not be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, let him not forthwith (as som superstitious people be wont to do) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayr in him self, &amp; tremble: but let him with his hart confesse him self to god, of his syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes


<pb facs="tcp:16736:39"/>
&amp; vnryghtfulnes, whych of his mercy, wyll take the good wyll of the man in stede of the very dede, and that whyche lackethe to the external signes of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tes, he wyll vouchesafe to supplye of his owne, by his peculyar grace. By hym doubtlesse all sacramentes be of great vertue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche be in maner signacles of the diuine goodnes and benefycence towarde vs, but the selfe same god, so ofte as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie requireth, doth tender the saluation of man without signes, only so that negligence and contempt of the sacramentes be away, and feythe, and a gladde wylle be presente. These thynges for this cause be spoken, for that oftentymes we se some persones soore troubled in their myndes, if they thynk that they shall departe without confession to the prieste, without receyuing of the sacrament of the aultar, and the laste anneylynge. Yea and such maner of sayinges we here spoken of very many, he dyed lyke a christen man, he was foure tymes confessed before deth, and receyued all the rites of the churche. On the other syde, we take vp our hande, and blesse vs, if we here that any man dyed without them. This surely is a christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> mans part, to wyshe, that he maye lacke none of the sacramentes. For they be great solacies and comfortes of the mynd, and helpynges


<pb facs="tcp:16736:40"/>
ges of oure beleue, and it belongeth to the synceritie and purenes of a Christen man, to accomplyshe (yf he maye) all iustice: But it apperteyneth more to a Christen manne to wyshe for faith and charitie, without which the other do nothinge auayle. But by these outwarde thynges we ought not to iuge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny person, onles we certaynely knowe that they were omitted &amp; not done, by contempt, or which is as yll, by negligence. Surely I doubte not, but that many neyther assoyled of the prest, nor their maker receyued, nor aneyled, nor yet buryed, after the rytes of the churche, haue gone to euerlastynge ioye and blys, where as some other, after all the ceremonies of the church solemnely done, and also buried in the churche next to the hyghe aulter, be caried downe to helle. Let them be in stede of an example, whiche sodeynly do peryshe by tempeste of the see, or by punyshment of lawes, or els by some sodeyne syckenes. Wherfore vnto such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be added a confidence and truste, to thentent that they maye certenly beleue, that they be no lesse assoyled, than yf they were confessed to the preste, nor that they receyue no lesse spiritual grace, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> yf they had receyued the body of Christ, &amp; the laste anneylyng. Only let them haue (as I haue sayd before) an ardent and brennynge faith,


<pb facs="tcp:16736:40"/>
and a prompt wyl and desire. That if a prest may be gotten, &amp; the violence of the sicknes wil not suffre a ful and an hole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fession that shuld require many wordes: with an inward submission of hert let hym confesse hym self to be all togither a synner, and desyre of the prest absolution with a meke hert, and with a full confidence let him thynke hym self as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyled. Soo ofte as necessitie excludeth vs frome the thinges that we couet, god of his goodnes accepteth the desyre of the mynd. Wherfore they, which in this state of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges doo trouble and vexe the man with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall confession, or with often rehersall of his confessyon, with paynfull dyscussynge of the circumstaunces, with the repetinge of euery offence commytted, whether they do a godly thinge I canne not tell, surely in my iugement they do a thinge out of season. Than suffyseth one, &amp; that shorte, but a syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and pure confession of the principall crymes, whiche cometh to a mans mynde, or if that can not be, a brennynge affection &amp; desyre of confession. More ouer, yf any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hath done hym any offence, let hym forgiue the vengeaunce therof with his holle hart. If he be vnworthye of forgyuenesse, yet Christe is worthye, for whose sake thou oughtest laye downe the affection of auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge. Let hym not thenne here recompte


<pb facs="tcp:16736:41"/>
howe greatly he hath ben hurt of this man or of that man, but howe many offences he hym selfe requyreth to be forgiuen and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of god. If he hath offended any man lette hym go about as moche as he may to be reconciled vnto hym. If the other wyll not be at one, and forgyue, lette hym praye god to sende hym a better mynde. He hym selfe in as moche as he hath done all that in hym lyeth, is excused before god. If good workes be required, there is no wark more able to purchase the mercy of god, than for Jesus Christis sake, (and accordyng to the example of hym, whiche hangynge on the crosse, prayed for theym, by whome he was putte to deathe, and of whom he was with spiteful scornes vpbraided) hartily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forgyue what so euer men haue synned agaynst vs. And I canne not say, whether there be any warke more harde and vneasy to be done: and therfore principally it is to be desyred of god. But yet to this helpeth the very selfe syckenes, whyche breakethe the very wylde fyersenes of the humayne spyrite, and maketh it more supple and easy to forgyue.</p>
            <p>Here it is the partes of them that be with the sycke person, to dryue from him the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune affection, whereby many thynke, that deathe is made to come the sooner by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,

houselynge, and anneylynge: And lette theym persuade the sycke man rather (as the thyng is in dede) that by these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there is more hope to recouer helthe, eyther bycause, that a sycke mynd doubleth the soore, or bycause that not seldome the sycknes of the body, cometh of the minde, or finally bycause that god sooner wyl here the requestes and prayers for hym that is reconciled, than for an vnreco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ciled person. Furthermore it is their partes to gette for the sycke man suche a priest as hath a lernid tongue, that he may with his communyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wordes, susteyne and comforte the wery sycke man, and whiche so can mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his wordes, that neyther by ouer moch flatterie he deceyueth the sycke personne, nor by vnseasonable austeritie and sharpnes he cast hym not into desperation, Nor breke <note place="margin">Esai. 42.</note> not the broken staffe, nor quench not the smo kynge flaxe. For in eyther behalf many men offende. Nor let them not rashely lette into the sycke man, all maner of pristes, but these onely, by whose speche he may be releued. Those persons let them dryne out of sight, the whose syght maye renewe the affection of synnynge vnto the syck man, as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignyons, or of foule pleasures, or of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynge, or his mortall ennemyes.</p>

Otherwhyles yet the phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is to be sent for, leste we seme to tempt god, namely in sodayne diseases, that kylle out of hande, whiche, of the phisytians be callyd Morbi acuti. Lette the multitude of phisitians be put out, not onely for that, that likewise as it is sayde by a prouerbe of the grekes, That the multitude of rulers &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours distroyed the countrey of Caria, soo many tymes the multitude of phisitions kyll many sycke men, but also that theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycious and busy cure, whyle that one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayleth one thynge, and an nother an other thynge, and eche desyreth at the perylle of an nother to be compted very wise, and by that meanes medicines be heaped vpon me dyeines, it commeth than to passe, that the sycke manne hath noo leysure iustelye and fully to regarde the mattiers concernynge his sowle helthe. Doubtlesse, whan perylle commeth ouerfaste vppon, the moste valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and strongest comfortes must be giuen, at whiche tyme, many do flatter hym, that is in the departyng, ye and many flatter them selues with vulgar remedies of none effect, as whan one counsayleth hym, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mande

his executours to bury hym in the coote of suche or suche friers or monkes, or to make an auowe to god, that if he recouer, he wyl be professed in the order of the monkes of Charterhowse. Why is not the sycke man rather monyshed to absteyne frome suche maner of vowes, durynge the tyme of his sycknes, and that it is sufficient, if he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to chaunge his lyfe into better: and as touchynge the fourme of lyuynge, let hym delyberate with hym selfe, whan he is hole and free from perturbations and feare. For <note place="margin">Eccl. 5.</note> a foolysshe promyse, displeaseth god. And that is foolyshe, whiche feare extorteth of a distourbed mynde. An other saythe, Dye without drede, I within the space of a yere wyll go to Hierusalem for the: or, I wylle crepe on my bare knees to saynt James: or I wyll go into saynt Patrikes purgatorye, whiche is in Ireland. I knewe a woman of noble byrthe and of high prudence, whiche by testamente deuysed to a prieste a good somme of money, to synge masse dayly, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g the space of a yere at Rome, as though the masses at Rome were of more holynes than the masses of Englande. And yet that money had ben better bestowed, if she had bound that priest neuer to go to Rome. For I know the person very well, whom I iuge rather to do sacrifice to Uenus than to god.

Other some exhort him to bye all the good dedes of some house of religion, or of some order. I deny not, but there is gret comfort in the communion of holy men: but yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, whether god wyll allowe and ratifie suche contractes, I doubt. After my sentence it is a more redy remedy ageinste desperation, to putte before the eies of the sycke perfone, the communion or parte ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of the holle church, which spredeth very farre, conteynyng all the good menne from the begynnynge of the worlde, which haue pleased god: In whiche company be also the aungelles. This hole felawshyppe and fraternite, with theyr vowes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dothe helpe the paciente, lokynge for a glorious victorie. Why than shulde he caste away his buckelar, whiche hath soo manye companies succouryng hym? If the prayer of one religious house, causeth the man to hope, in this numbre be al houses. I speake not this, to thentent, that it auayleth not to require the prayers of certayn men, or that the prayers of few be not profitable, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yf they come of a christen and; free cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but that to styre and pluck vp the hope of the sycke man, the contemplation of the vniuersall churche is of greatter strength. For by this way his hart shall be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. But the moste puisant solace of all,


<pb facs="tcp:16736:43"/>
is neuer to remoue the eyes of faith frome Christ, whiche gyueth him selfe holly vnto vs, whome we haue a suter for vs vnto god, which neuer cesseth crienge, Come to me al <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> ye that labour and be burdened, and I wil ease you. In the hollownes of this rock, let him hyde hym, into this persones woundes, let the sycke man crepe, and he shalbe sure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Satanas.

The venemous by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges of the fleynge spirites shal not noye hym, yf fayth with vnmouynge eres behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that signe of euerlastyng helth. Christ hangynge on the crosse is a signe of triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ph, a signe of victorie, a signe of euerlastynge glorye. For oure sakes he fought, for oure sakes he ouercame, for our sakes he wanne the triumphe, only so that we haue the eyes of our fayth intentyue and wakynge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.

But in this conflyct, which we haue with our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ennemy, the hole hope of the victorye


<pb facs="tcp:16736:44"/>
is in the eyes. But there is moche diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in the two batayles. For in the mundane warres it muste be marked on euerye syde with intentife eyes, what the ennemy doth: but in this battayle we muste be blynde and deafe at the assautes of the deuyll, and only haue our eyes fyxed to the sygne of grace, &amp; our eares lyfte vp to the voyce of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer. Satanas casteth tho thynges into our myndes, which hepe vp the ire of god: But Christ hanginge on the crosse, she weth tokens of mercy. The dyuel barketh ayenst vs such thinges as wold brynge man downe to desperation, Christe speapeth the thinge that plucketh man vp to hope. For fayth as it hath eyes, so also it hath eares. The holy goste requireth of the soule both these two senses, whiche saythe in the. xliiii. Psalme, Audi filia, &amp; vide, &amp; incline aure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> tuam.

So great vertue hath the contemplation of Christ, which was crucified for vs, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration is tourned into hope, &amp; hope into gladnes.

If we haue truste in oure owne good dedes, our aduersary wil therof reioyse, but yf in the lorde Iesu we fyxe the shote ancre of hope, our ennemye will shrynke, lyke as the apostel reioysing, saith in the. viii. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romans, <hi>If god be for vs, who is againste vs?</hi> He also whiche spared not his <note place="margin">Si Deus pro nobis quis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra nos.</note> owne sonne, but for vs all delyuered hym to the Jewes, howe will he not also with hym gyue all thinges vnto vs? who shall make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaint or accusation against the elect of god?

For in this article of deathe the deuyll hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp to mannes mynde all that euer may extynguyshe or put forth the sparke of faith and of hope. He maketh suggestion, how great the maieste and iustice of god is, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che so often hathe bene neglected &amp; defow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

but from consyderation of theym to tourne awaye his mynde to the grace of Christ, so with the deuyll we shoulde not dispute, but whan he suggesteth and casteth into mans mynde wycked and vngodly thynges, he must say to hym, <hi>Abi retro Satana,</hi> So backe Satanas. It is not lefull for me to doubte of tho thinges, which the churche, instructed by the holy goste, hath taught, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sufficient to beleue tho thinges, which I can not attayne with my wytte. They tell a certayne thinge, not out of holy scripture, but neuerthelesse to the mattier that we go now about it is sufficientely accommodate &amp; mete, of two, whome the dyuell at tyme of their deth tempted of their beleue: the one was lerned in Philosophie, the other was nothinge but a Christen man, rude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerned: he assayled the fyrst, how he beleued whether that Christ was god and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he was born of a virgin, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he beleued the generall resurrection. And began with reasons of Philosophie to demonstrate, that it was impossible to ioyne tho thinges in one, betwixt whiche there is no agreance, as betwyxt fynite and infynite, create and increate. Furthermore that it is against nature, that a virgyn shulde brynge forth a childe without carnal knowledge of man, nor that (accordynge to Aristotell the

Prynce of the Philosophers) there can be no returne frome priuation to the habyte.</p>
            <p>What nedeth mo wordes? The man waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and was conuicte, and the dyuell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a victour. The other rude man, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the dyuel asked him how he beleued of this and of that thynge, he aunswered him with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pendious way, As the church beleueth. Agayne whan he obiected, howe dothe the churche beleue? Marye quod he, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. How dost thou beleue? As the church beleueth. How beleueth the church? As I beleue. Frome this rude &amp; vnprepared man so disputations, but with symple fayth sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and stedfast: the gostly ennemy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vanquyshed. This aunswere is good y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe, to confounde and dryue awaye the subtyll and craftye ennemy the dyuell. But chiefly it is good in obscure and doubtefull causes and matters. As yf the ennemy wyll suggest, or some other captious felaw, how maye it be, that in thre persones there shuld be one god, and one essencie in numbre? and also by whatte meanes they be distincte the one from the other? Let him make answere thus, Euen as the churche beleueth. How can all one bodye be in dyuers places, all at one tyme? And how in the Sacramente of the aulter maye the trewe body of a man be conteyned in so lytell a space? Let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,

as the church beleueth. Agayn what maner of fyre is in hell, &amp; how can a bodyly thing be an agent in an vnbodyly substance? let him answere, as the church beleueth. Or yf any thinge is to be answered, let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere with fewe wordes, eyther out of the Crede, (which dayly ought to be rehersed vnto the sicke man) or out of holy scripture, or els by the spirite of faith.

            <p>¬∂ With suche praty answers the sycke man must be armed, short and redy againste the croked suggestions of the dyuell. Ensaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy men muste be called to mynde,

but specially of suche, in whome a notable mercy of the lorde hathe bene declared, as in Dauyd, whiche augmented the synne of adultery with manslaughter, and with two wordes he escaped vengeance: in the Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites, in Achab, in the prodygall sonne, in the publicane, whose rightwysenes the lord preferred before the pharisaic all holynes: in Mary Magdaleyne, to whom the lorde sayde, thy synnes be forgyuen the: in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutrous woman, to whom it was sayd, Go and synne no more: in Peter, whiche thrise denyed our lorde: in Paule, which dyd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the church of god, bynding and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge all that professed the name of our lord Jesus: in Cypriane, which of a southsayer was made a martyr: and in many other mo, which from their ydolatry, from blasphe my from horrible crymes, through their faith in Christ atteyned mercy and crownes. To exclude desperation, &amp; rayse hope, the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the newe testament be more apte than the scriptures of the olde. Nor it is no wonder, Moyses feared the Jewes with commaundementes, Christe comforted all men by fayth and grace. The holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res haue not onely exaumples, but also say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enges very many, partly which cast on men a dicde, partly which comfort the ferefull. For vpon these two thinges in maner al the


<pb facs="tcp:16736:51"/>
bokes of the prophetes do renne, heapinge vp vnto them that turne awaye frome god, the vengcance of god: and agayne amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyenge the mercye of god to theym that be conuerted to repentaunce. Eyther of these medicines is holsome, if it be taken wysely and in place. Those that be terrible, and put men in fere, must be ministred to hole in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and sycke in soule, wylde and dronken in the prosperitie of this worlde, or cast into a slepe with the delytes of this worlde, as it were with the herbe called Mandrake: to the entente that as by takynge of Hellebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus they maye be brought into their ryghte wyttes: or by takynge the herbe Brassica, called Cole, they may returne to sobrenes: or myghtely cryed on, and plucked, they maye awake. Those that cause hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuenes, muste be gyuen to tymorous and fearfull persons, specially in the daunger of deathe. How be it neyther to the one feare must be so ministred, that there shal no hope of forgiuenes be mixed to the medicine, nor to the other asswagementes and comfortes must be so gyuen, that they shall be discey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For it is two thinges, to chastyse and to cast downe, to comfort &amp; to flatter. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it forceth not a lytell, what persons do kepe and syt with sycke men. They ought to haue alwayes at hande sundry places of

scriptures, that eyther by the rehersall or tellynge of them, they maye establyshe and holde vp the fayntynge harte of the sycke person. To this purpose certayne prayers aptely made will helpe. For certayne pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers go aboute, whiche be made of vnlerned persones, &amp; by vnlerned persons be taught to sycke folke. Hope beyng thus called vp, yet remayneth the feare of Purgatory, the which feare some men go about to mitigate and put out with remedyes, after myn opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nothinge effectuall. Some do promyse to be sure &amp; redemed from the fyre of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorye by byenge of pardons: but I feare least this be not, to succour and comfort the sycke manne, but rather a mockynge and a mere dissimulation.

thinge: and that Christ for our synnes hath suffered great peynes on the crosse. Out of these fountaynes, and namely of his blode, let hym fetche a refrigeration and asswage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fyre of Purgatory. And so my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustynge hym selfe, and trustyng vpon the excedynge mercye of god, the merytes of Christ, and the suffrages of all holy menne, with a contrite harte and religious trust let hym saye, In manus was domine, commendo spiritum meum, Into thy handes lord, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende my spirite. There shalbe no disdayn, though the synner and weake man vsurpeth the wordes of his lord. For to that purpose our heed expressed these thingis in him self, that we shoulde folowe hym, whiche be his membres. That yf it please any man also of the other holy men to fetche an exaumple, let him saye with saynt Steuen, Lorde god take my spirite.
