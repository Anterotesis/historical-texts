            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nature cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie with this, that vile &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things should be ioyned in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with precious and excellent things. The fiue senses are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, and those partes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all liuing creatures haue life and féeling, are excellent things: among all which, the sight is the quickest, the liueliest, the most necessarie, and (you knowe) the eies haue their smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and baldnesse. That therefore which in man is of this kinde, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth most honour. So it followeth in conclusion, that the verie best things are bald.

bringeth inconueniences, and namelie, likenesse vnto beastes.

               <p>Not long since, in the countrie of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> which is situate néere the mouth of the rich riuer <hi>Indus,</hi> where a mightie Duke bare dominion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Occanon,</hi> who had heire to his estate but one onlie daughter, named <hi>Gandina.</hi> This Ladie then, more faire than fortunate, liued most déere to her father, and most beloued of his people. But to proue that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not euer a benefite, nor high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states be alwaies the happiest: it chaunced within a while, <hi>Gandina</hi> (sought by manie that were great, and serued by manie that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie) had more competitors of her beautie, than did either wel content her, or proue it commodious vnto her. For loue, which is not led by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor chooseth by appointment, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her affection vnmoueably, with the liking of a knight of estate but meane, but of value verie great, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:1368:31"/>
                  <hi>Contarenus,</hi> who excéedingly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her. So the desires of manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was somewhat for her glorie, but nothing for her gaine. In small processe of time, the secret fires of their fansies discouering the smoke of their desires, bewraied this matter to her father, long before they would.</p>
               <p>The Duke dissembling what hée saw, determining to disappoint that which he most misliked, nether made challenge to the knight, nor charged his daughter for any loue that was betwixt them: but deuised a way (as he thought) most sure, but (as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) most sorrowfull, to set these lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in sunder, by the worke of an Enchauntresse most cunning in her kind: who had caused <hi>Contarenus</hi> to be caught vp, and caried in the aire, from the coast of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bounds of the <hi>Ocean</hi> sea, which cost <hi>Occanon</hi> twentie M. Crownes: a déere price of repentance.</p>
               <p>But it is no noueltie to Princes, to make their wils verie costlie: and somtime to paie déere for their owne
<pb facs="tcp:1368:32"/>
displeasure. <hi>Contarenus</hi> thus strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuided from his ioie, &amp; perplexed aboue measure, was charged by this Enchauntresse, to weare his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with patience, which necessitie did put on, and destinie would put off. And ere seuen yeres came about, she trulie assured him, that he should haue, for his reward, the height of his desires: but first he should fight with the worthiest knight, and sée the worthiest Ladie in the whole world. Now, the whilest, she told him, that he must take the gard of a blind He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remit, who should recouer his sight, and he his satisfaction: both at one time. So she left him on the earth, and went her waie againe into the aire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gandina</hi> now lacking long that she looked for: namely, the sight and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of her knight, fel soone into those diseases that accompanie such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, as she was accumbred with, to wit, distrust, curiositie, and excéeding troublesome thoughtes. At last, (as Princes do few things so priuily, but
<pb facs="tcp:1368:32"/>
they haue partakers of their counsell: and heires of crownes lacke neuer seruants of hope, which be curious to please them: the deuise and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Occanon</hi> came to the eares of his daughter.</p>
               <p>The which being told her: And is it euen so? (quoth <hi>Gandina.</hi>) "Care kinges for no right?
And right cares for no kingdome. It is neither the court of <hi>Occanon,</hi> nor the countrie of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> that I can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, if <hi>Contarenus</hi> be gon. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vnhappie countrie, and most cruell father, that turnes me to this fortune, to followe my faith: which neither greatnesse of estate, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of mine aduenture, shall make me forsake. But if I loose not my life, I will find <hi>Contarenus,</hi> if he be in the world."</p>
               <p>This saide, she pursued her most hard determination, and taking only a damsell with her, in simple habite, with such things as were necessarie, she straight conueied her selfe most closly from the borders of <hi>Cambaia,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1368:33"/>
and with toile (too long to tell) passed perils past beléefe, till at last she arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the den of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> where (by chaunce) she met with a most noble knight icleped <hi>Loricus,</hi> by loue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise drawne thither, to learne what should betide him.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Loricus</hi> loued a Ladie that was matchlesse, in such manner as was strange. For after much deuise, and diligence, to attaine to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that she would be pleased he might loue her, not looking for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, seing no glimpse of her liking, his vttermost deuotion to find surely out her fansie, which she caried most closely, he made a strange assay with all semblance that might be shewed, to set by her but little, that was so sought for of all. And the better to colour the passion, which he was not able to conquer, he made a shew of choise of a new mistresse, that liued euery day in her eie (a péece surely of price, but far from such a perle as his hart onely estéemed:) and to this idol he séemed to offer all his loue, and
<pb facs="tcp:1368:33"/>
his seruice, leauing no maner of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance that to loue appertaineth, as wearing her colours vpon his backe, and her picture in his bosome, kéeping her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie before all other, &amp; continuing most at her comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. Which déede espied by the Ladie, (whose péere and equall, for any naturall qualitie, either of bodie or minde, was no where to be found) though she cared not for his choice, yet she shewed scorne of his change, and disclosed by gelousie that which loue could not discouer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loricus</hi> this perceiuing, fell by and by to consider, that it was the want of his worth that made his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnacceptable, &amp; no impossibilitie in her will to receiue them to serue her, that merited the honor of such fauour. Therefore he left his owne countrie, and betooke himselfe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to trauell, and to armes, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with most endeuor to deserue that reputation, as this great and noble Mistres would but thinke him worthie to be hers, though she would
<pb facs="tcp:1368:34"/>
neuer be his. So thinking no toile too tough, and no attempt too hard to attaine to renowme, he wandered through the worlde, till by painefull waies he came to <hi>Sibyllas</hi> denne, where he met with <hi>Gandina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There these two louers hauing occasion to vnfold all their fortunes, the Ladie séeking to knowe the ende of her trauell, and the Knight some aduise for the ease of his hope: they both receiued this answere of <hi>Sibyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi>
"That as they were now coupled by fortune, so they shoulde neuer parte fellowship, till they had found out a place, where men were most strong, women most faire, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie most fertile, the people most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, the gouernement most iust, and the Princesse most worthie. So should the Ladie sée what would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her, so shoulde the Knight heare what woulde comfort him."</p>
               <p>Now (most déere and best deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Ladie) it fals to my purpose, &amp; your praise, to say somwhat of my selfe. And though you sée me here old,
<pb facs="tcp:1368:34"/>
wrinkled, and cast into a corner, yet once haue I bin otherwise a Knight knowne, and accepted, euen with the best in the worlde. And liuing in a Court of most fame, amongest a swarme of Knights and Ladies of great woorth, and rare vertue, where beautie bad the base, and desire sought the goale: it chanced me to loue a Ladie, to be beloued of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, who is feigned to be blind.</hi>
                  </note> Loue himselfe, if he coulde haue but séene her. But as shée was such as did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, so was shée of woonderfull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without disdaine to be desired, but most deintie to be dealt withall. For touch her, and shée would turne to twentie diuers shapes, yet to none but to content me as I thought, who supposed still to touch her was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And so it séemed by my holde, that was most loath to let her go, till shée liked (alas) at the last to put on the shape of a Tygresse so terrible to beholde, that I durst holde her no longer. And being so escaped, I could neuer more set eie vpon her</p>
               <p>Madam, thus began my paine: but
<pb facs="tcp:1368:35"/>
you heare not yet my punishment. Being shifted from the sight of that I sought aboue all things in the worlde, and then little delighting to looke vpon anie thing else: I tooke by and by a pilgrimage to <hi>Paphos</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> trusting to heare of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres there, where <hi>Venus</hi> was most honored: whither when I was come, I began to steppe in at the doores of her temple, and was sodainely stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken blinde. Astonied at my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and vnderstanding no cause, I fell on my knées, and saide:
"O fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Goddesses, and furthest fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crueltie, what hath bin my fault, that you are thus offended? Thy folie &amp; presumption, (quoth <hi>Venus</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine) as I gesse. From my youth vp (quoth I) I haue bin an honorer of vertue, a delighter in learning, and a seruant of loue. But it is no parted affection (quoth he) that <hi>Venus</hi> will be honored with. Bookes and beautie make no match, and it is a whole man, or no man, that this Goddesse will haue serue her. And therwithall
<pb facs="tcp:1368:35"/>
taking me by the shoulders, he thrust me out of the temple."</p>
               <p>So with sighes and sorrowes I sate downe in the porch, making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession to <hi>Apollo,</hi> the particular God I honored, to haue compassion of mine estate. Now faithfull praiers being hearde, ere they be ended, <hi>Mercurius</hi> commes vnto me, &amp; bids me be of good comfort.
"The Gods (quoth he) be iust, though women be angrie. The Goddesses be all found to haue this fault. <hi>Diana</hi> with <hi>Acte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pallas</hi> with <hi>Arachne, Iuno</hi> with <hi>Teresias,</hi> were angrie without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: so is <hi>Venus</hi> now with thée. The cause with thy remedie shall be tolde thée at <hi>Delphos,</hi> whither straight I must carrie thée."
Which he had no sooner spoken, but by and by I was set in the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where first demaunding my fault, the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle made answere,
"<hi>Thy feare, and not thy faith. And what</hi> (quoth I) <hi>may be my remedie? The best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the beautifullest</hi>", the Oracle straight answered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1368:36"/>With this, <hi>Apollos</hi> Priest tooke me by the hande, recounting vnto me the whole course of my life, whom I loued, and how I lost her.
And when I tolde him of the faithfulnesse of my seruice, and the faultlesnesse of my meaning: of the variablenesse of her condition, and at last, of the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of her apperance: "Ah good <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes</hi> (quoth he:) it is not the kinde of women to be cruell, it is but their countenance. And as for their varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, who so will not applie himself thereto, shall not much please them, nor long hold them. Neither is it to be founde fault withall. Nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe loueth varietie, so it be without deceit. Now for thy faultlesnesse, it sufficeth not. The seruant of <hi>Venus</hi> must not onely haue faith, but also lacke feare. Feare lost thée thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres, and thy boldnesse to enter into <hi>Venus</hi> temple, being vnacceptable, made her strike thée blinde. But <hi>Apollo</hi> biddes me tell thée, the Gods accept whom women forsake. The eies shut from delight, haue mindes
<pb facs="tcp:1368:36"/>
more open to vnderstanding. This punishment shall be thy profite. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> can barre thée but from her feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of loue, but for the deuotion thou bearest to <hi>Apollo,</hi> he giueth thée this gift: to be able to decipher the desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of euerie one in loue, &amp; better to aduise them than the best of her dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: and further now doth promise thée, in reuolution of yeares, thou shalt recouer thy sight. But this shall not betide thée, till at one time, in one place, and in a countrie of most peace, two of the most valiaunt Knights shall fight, two of the most constant louers shall méete, and the most vertuous Ladie in the worlde shall be there to looke on. And when thine eies may beholde that thy hart delighteth in, a Ladie in whom inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth such learning and beautie, as neuer was in any creature, then shal they be opened, and that shall be thy warrant. All <hi>Apollo</hi> saith is sooth. The whilest it is determined, thou shalt dwell in an Heremitage, where nothing that longes to natures vse
<pb facs="tcp:1368:37"/>
shall be lacking vnto thée."</p>
               <p>So sodainely I was shifted to this hill hard by, where I haue winte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many a yeare, far from the woes and wrongs which the world besides is full of. And now (best Ladie and most beautifull) so termed of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and so thought of in the world, what the Enchauntresse told <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus, Sibylla</hi> shewed <hi>Gandina</hi> and <hi>Loricus,</hi> and what <hi>Apollo</hi> saide to me, by your most happie comming is verified. "The most hardie Knights <hi>Contarenus</hi> and <hi>Loricus</hi> here haue fought: the most constant louers <hi>Loricus</hi> and <hi>Gandina</hi> here be mette, and I poore <hi>Hemetes</hi> (as this Knight knoweth) full long blinde, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued againe my sight. All which happened by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of your vertue, which the best so much doe honour, &amp; we are now most bounde vnto."</p>
               <p>And so I present these noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to please you with their seruice, and my selfe to serue you with my praiers. And leauing the louers to their delight, I must leaue <hi>Loricus</hi>
