            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe Queſtion propoſed is, of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> is for the maintenance of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is for the <hi>abrogation of Epiſcopacy.</hi> According to your ſenſe therefore by <hi>Prelacy</hi> I underſtand <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which you have vowed and covenanted to extirpate. Whether upon juſt grounds, or no, ſhall be now enquired. For the Office is either good or bad, lawfull or unlawfull, neceſſary or indifferent. If in it ſelf <hi>bad,</hi> and utterly <hi>unlawfull,</hi> God forbid, but we ſhould joyne in the <hi>extirpation</hi> of it. If <hi>indifferent,</hi> it is in the breaſt of authority, to allow, or diſallow it. But if ſimply <hi>lawfull,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for the being and continuation of a Church, then it is not in the juſt power of man to diſcard it, or caſt it off. And yet you reſolve, that <note n="b" place="margin">I. G. p. 1.</note> the <hi>Kings Oath to uphold Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is ſin.</hi> If <hi>ſin,</hi> then it neceſſarily followes, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in it ſelf is naught, and utterly unlawfull. Thus in the firſt place you condemne all the Kings and Queens of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that have taken this oath. Secondly, you condemne thoſe many Saints of God, that have diſcharged this Office of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> Thirdly, You condemne all thoſe Fathers, and Councels, which juſtify a neceſſity of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And laſt of all you condemn the whole Church of Chriſt, which from her Infancie hath been governed by <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Is not this to <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal 89 50.</note>

                  </gap> if I ſhall make it appeare, That ſome Parliament men have abuſed that truſt, which is committed to them, is therefore a <hi>Parliament</hi> naught? This follows not; but hereby I manifeſt, that they who at that time ſat at the helme in that place, did abuſe that, which in it ſelf is good. Is the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> naught, becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> abuſed himſelf and that? Is <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> bad, becauſe <hi>Gregory</hi> VII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Rome, George</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> or <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> abuſed their place and function? Far be it from me to argue, or conclude in this manner. I have learned to diſtinguiſh between the office and the Officer: The Office may be ſimply good, and the Officer extremely bad. This then is no argument againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> though perchance you may prove, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> hath been ill managed.</p>

               <p n="6">6. Let us take a view of this paſſage, and ſee what truth is in it. <hi>One of the priviledges of the people is,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that the Peers and Commons in Parliament</hi> HAVE POWER TO ALTER <hi>what-ever is inconvenient.</hi> How the Lords will take this, I know not, though of late they have been ſo paſſive. Can they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that their <hi>power</hi> ſhould be onely <hi>derivative,</hi> and that from the people? Your words are plain; <hi>one of the priviledges of the people is, that the peers have power.</hi> As if the Lords had no <hi>power in Parliament,</hi> but what iſſued from the <hi>peoples priviledges.</hi> Why then are they called <hi>Peers;</hi> when they are not ſo much as <hi>Peers</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> but their ſubſtitutes, if not ſervants? Surely you lay the Lords very lowe. And if it be <hi>one of the peoples priviledges that the Lords have power;</hi> then is it alſo <hi>one of their priviledges,</hi> that the Lords have no power, that the people may take it from them, when they pleaſe. <hi>Cuius eſt inſtituere, ejus eſt &amp; deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere;</hi> they that can give power, can alſo take it away, if they ſee good. This of late hath been uſually vaunted againſt the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> and you ſay as much to the <hi>Houſe of Peers.</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:32453:31"/>
Whereas the <hi>peoples priviledges</hi> are but ſeverall grants of the Kings of this Land, proceeding meerly from their grace and favour. Alas, the people hath not ſo much as a vote in the Election of Peers; neither have they liberty to chooſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for the houſe of Commons; no, not ſo much as to meet, for any ſuch purpoſe, untill they be ſummoned by the Kings Writ. So the <hi>peoples priviledges depends upon the Kings ſummons;</hi> no ſuch priviledge till then.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And whereas you ſay, that the <hi>Peers and Commons have power to alter, what-ever is inconvenient;</hi> You are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. When by the Kings ſummons they are met in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they have power to treat and conſult upon alterations, as alſo to preſent them to his Majeſtie, and to petition for ſuch alterations, where they ſee juſt cauſe. But they have no <hi>power to alter:</hi> that is in the <hi>King;</hi> or elſe, why do they Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition him ſo to this day, to make ſuch changes good, as they contrive? <hi>Hoc eſt teſtimonium regiae poteſtatis, vbi<expan>

The truth is, the <hi>Power of making laws</hi> is in him, that gives life to the Law, that enacts it to be a Law: not in them, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it, or Petition for it. <note n="p" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 4.</note>

                  <hi>the Law makes the King the onely Judge</hi> of the Bills propoſed. <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 2.</note>

               <p n="1">1. THe queſtion propoſed is concerning <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> but now you are fallen to the <hi>Rights of the Clergie.</hi> As if this were a ſound and unanſwerable argument, <hi>It is lawfull for the King to abrogate the Rights of the Clergy: Ergo, It is lawfull for him to abrogate Epiſcopacy.</hi> It is for all the world, as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>It is lawfull for the King to take away the Rights of Lawyers; Ergo, he may alſo take away Judicature.</hi> Yet all men would ſay, that this were flat tyrannie; ſince without Judicature no man can compaſſe, or enjoy his own with peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I ſhall return your argument ſo upon you, as ſhall concern you more neerly. <hi>It is lawfull for the King to abrogate the Rights of the Clergie: it is therefore lawfull for him to abrogate Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi> How like you this? Is it not your own argument, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terme <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> into <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Ye have ſtrooke out the former &amp; ſet up the latter in the place of <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> And your ſcholers, by the ſame argument, may live to root up thut too, if any lands be annexed to this great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Thus you have made a rod to ſcourge your ſelves with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But you will ſay, that though it be legall for the King, to <hi>take away the Rights,</hi> yet he may not deſtroy the <hi>Order.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe the <hi>Rights</hi> are granted by man, but the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was ſettled by God: And what God hath ordained, is not lawfull for man to abrogate.

               <p>By what means the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi> may be abrogated, by the ſame means may the <hi>Rights of the Clergie</hi> be abrogated.</p>

Surely it is better to be a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians foot-boy, then <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 4 1.</note> a <hi>Steward of the myſteries of Chriſt.</hi> And yet ſuch we are. Little do theſe men conſider, that all Subjects are born alike capable of theſe Rights, if ſo they be fit to take Orders. The wrong therefore is done alike to all free-born Subjects; perchance to Mr. <hi>Speakers</hi> grandchild. Since then <note n="i" place="margin">I. <hi>G.</hi> p 2.</note> the <hi>Kings Oath</hi> (as you confeſſe) <hi>is againſt acting or ſuffering a tyrannous invaſion on Laws and Rights;</hi> it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that as he may not <hi>act,</hi> ſo he may not <hi>ſuffer</hi> any ſuch <hi>tyranny</hi> to be uſed.

                  <hi>this Oath was ſo framed, when the Clergie of England was a diſtinct Society or Corporation from the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> When was <hi>this Oath,</hi> I beſeech you, framed? You ſhould have done well to have pointed out the time; and not tell us,

                  <hi>this diſtinction is a branch of Popery.</hi> But this is the faſhion of ſuch, as you are, when you intend to diſgrace, alter, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any thing, that concerns the Church, then preſently 'tis <hi>Popery.</hi> Thus you caſt a miſt before the peoples eyes, that loath <hi>Popery;</hi> and yet know not, what <hi>Popery</hi> is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this <hi>His Majeſties Oath</hi> is grounded upon the Word of God, who hath made promiſe to his Church, ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, that <note n="m" place="margin">Eſ 49. 23.</note>

                  <hi>The Clergie and Laitie</hi> (ſay you) <hi>were diſtinct bodies; but this diſtinction is taken away, and Laity and Clergie are now one body Politick. One body Politick?</hi> Are we ſo? Whence is it then, that

the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are thruſt out of the Houſe of <hi>Peers;</hi> and that none of us may vote, or ſit in the Houſe of <hi>Commons?</hi> Are we of the ſame <hi>body;</hi> and yet have no priviledges with the <hi>body?</hi> In at ſubjection, out at immunities? In at taxes, out at privileges? This is one of thoſe even Ordinances, which your bleſſed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath hatched. Of the ſame body we are, under the ſame power, ſubject to the ſame Laws, and yet not capable of the ſame privileges. Is this equalitie? <hi>Scoggins</hi> doal right, ſome all, and ſome never a whit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither do we ſay, that we are a ſeverall or <hi>diſtinct body;</hi> but we are a ſeverall ſtate, or Corporation in the ſame body.

In <hi>Eccleſiaſticall perſons</hi> of this Kingdom are commonly three qualities or conditions: one is naturall, the other two are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall. 1. <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and deniſons of this kingdom we are by birth: 2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie men</hi> by matriculation and education: and 3. <hi>Clergie men</hi> by Ordination. By the firſt we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the privileges of the kingdom. By the ſecond we have an intereſt in the immunities of the Univerſitie. By the third we have an intereſt in the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Church. The later privileges do not annihilate that right or claim, which we have by birth. Neither ceaſe we to be the Kings Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Clergie men.</hi> In taking Orders we put not off Allegeance; we rather confirm and inlarge it. For <note n="x" place="margin">Thou which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? Thou, that preacheſt, a man ſhould not ſteal, doeſt thou ſteal?

Yet thus much is evident to every ſingle eye, that we have had many even and conſcionable Parliaments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Biſhops</hi> have <hi>voted:</hi> what kinde of Parliament we have had without them, ſome will make bold to ſpeak hereafter. But a word in private. Were they not thruſt out, leſt the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have too many faithfull Counſellors in the Houſe? Were they not removed, to make way for theſe civill broils?
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32453:49"/>
The Incendiaries knew full well, that thoſe meſſengers and makers of peace would never have paſſed a Vote for war.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what were the motives, that wrought upon His Majeſtie, to yeeld to have the Biſhops turned out of that Houſe, <note n="z" place="margin">Lex terrae p. 14</note> wherein they had <hi>voted</hi> from the firſt day, that ever <hi>Parliament ſate</hi> in <hi>England?</hi> And before ever there was an Houſe of Commons, they had their Votes in the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Kingdom; as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> manifeſts in his Treatiſe, that <hi>the Soveraigns perſon is required in the great Councels of the State.</hi> p. 3. &amp;c. If at any time they have been forced out of theſe <hi>Parliaments,</hi> or great Aſſemblies, it hath been with ſo ill ſucceſſe, that with all poſſible ſpeed they have been recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Will you hear the motives? Surely they were the very ſame, that drove the King from <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, the Clothiers were perſwaded in a mutinous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to cry down the <hi>Biſhops votes,</hi> becauſe they had no market for their clothes. And now they cry out, that they want wooll to make clothes. Is not this the bleſſing they have gained by that hideous and ſenſeleſſe out-cry?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But why was <hi>this privilege aboliſht, as incongruous to their calling?</hi> Are <hi>Biſhops</hi> unfit to adviſe, or aſſent in framing Laws? Surely they are rationall men, and learned men. By reaſon of their age, and offices, which they have heretofore paſſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they muſt needs be men of much experience. And it is to be preſumed ſo many, for ſo many, as conſcionable, and as much for the <hi>common good,</hi> as any. And ſuch men are moſt fit to prepare, and commend Laws for and to Kings. For I have learned, that <note n="a" place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> in Litleton, l 2. Sect. 138.</note> 
                  <hi>this is a ſtrong argument in Law,</hi>

But now they flowe in by ſhoals, and have Pulpits and Preſſes cloyed with them. Does not your own Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> profeſſe, that never was there ſuch plenty of Sects and Hereſies? As many more in truth, as ever the Church knew in former ages. Onely, as <note n="g" place="margin">Theod. hiſt. l. 3. c. 11.</note> by <hi>Julian the Apoſtata,</hi> both Pulpits, and Preſſes are locked up to the <hi>Orthodox;</hi> no coming there for them, leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they infect the Auditories with ſound and Apoſtolike Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Who ſo robbeth his father, or mother, and ſaith it is no tranſgreſſion; the ſame is the companion of a murtherer.</hi> But to make the <hi>ſacriledge</hi> more odious, I ſhall manifeſt, that ye have not onely robbed your <hi>Father,</hi> but your <hi>Mother</hi> alſo.

For do not you ſay plainly, that <note n="t" place="margin">I. G. p. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>there's a Supremacie in the King, and a Supremacy in the Parliament?</hi> I hope, you know your own language. <hi>Clodius accuſat.</hi> It is an uſuall thing for your confederacie, to charge the King and his good Subjects with that, which your ſelves are either guilty of, or intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What, <hi>two Supremacies,</hi> two ſuperlatives, at the ſame time, in the ſame Kingdom? Is this poſſible? What, becauſe there is <hi>ſummus</hi> and <hi>ſupremus;</hi> becauſe there are two ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſame word, ſhall we therefore have <hi>two Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> in the ſame Realm? Is not this flatly againſt the <hi>Oath of Supremacy?</hi> Wherein you, and I, and your great Patriots, have ſworn, that <hi>the Kings Highneſſe is the</hi> ONELY SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME GOVERNOUR OF THIS REALME, <hi>and of all other his Highneſſe Dominions and Countreys.</hi> But the King hath been ſo long out of your eye, that he is now out of your minde, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall at leaſt be his corrivall in the <hi>Supremacy.</hi> Take heed, take heed of perjury.

Was not that provided for <hi>this State?</hi> In <hi>our State</hi> this is no <hi>error;</hi> in yours it may be; or elſe you are in a <hi>manifeſt error.</hi> Certainly the members have ſworn, that <hi>the King is the</hi> ONLY SUPREME GOVERNOUR OF THIS REALM, or State. And that he is ſo, <hi>as well</hi> IN ALL <hi>Spirituall or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall things, or cauſes, as Temporall.</hi> If He be the <hi>onely Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> how ſhall we find another <hi>Supreme,</hi> or an equall to him within his own Dominions? If He be ſo <hi>in all things and cauſes</hi> both <hi>Eccleſiaſticall and Temporall,</hi> what <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> is there, wherein he is not the <hi>onely Supreme;</hi> or wherein he hath any other <hi>Supreme</hi> joyned to him? For certain, theſe particles <hi>Onely</hi> and <hi>All,</hi> are excluſive of any copartner.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But you will chalk out a way, whereby to elude, or avoid this <hi>Oath,</hi> and the reſtrictions therein. There's a <hi>ſupreme Parliament,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſupreme King.</hi> Or, a <hi>Supremacy</hi> is <hi>in the Parliament, and a Supremacy in the King.</hi> An excellent Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician, he hath learned to multiply; of one, and one onely, he hath made two. Thus have they raiſed diviſion out of unity: and from hence are theſe <hi>diſtractions and diviſions,</hi> which are ſo <hi>repugnant to the weal of the people.</hi> This is one of their new lights, which is borrowed from their multiplying glaſſe, that makes a molehill as bigge as a mountain, and a Spider as large as a Sea-crab. But when the multiplying glaſſe is layed aſide, the ſpider will be but a ſpider.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Well, let us ſee, how you make good this <hi>twofold Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi>

                  <hi>The Supremacy, or the Supremum jus Dominii, that is over all Laws, figere</hi> or <hi>refigere, to make, or diſanull them at pleaſure, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the King, nor in the Houſes apart, but in both conjoyned.</hi> Here then we are fallen back to <hi>one Supremacy.</hi> And this <hi>Supremacy</hi> is not the Kings <hi>onely;</hi> but it is the Parliaments, as well as his.

If they tranſgreſſe either, the King hath a legall power to revoke their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to diſpoſe of them, to whom, and when, he pleaſeth.
