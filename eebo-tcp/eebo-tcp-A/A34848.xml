            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in an Anſwer to one infected with
<hi>ſome Pelagian Errours.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas you ſay that ſome Scriptures ſeeme too hold forth
unto you that a man hath free-will, I deſire you for your
better information to take notice of theſe two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> We do not ſimply deny that a man hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
freedome of will: but only do hold that no naturall man, nor any
man of himſelf, hath a ſufficient power, or freedom of will, unto the
chooſing of that way, which is good and right, and acceptable in the
ſight of God. To the chooſing of evill wayes; wee grant that every
naturall man hath freedome enough, if ſo be this may be termed by ſo
good a name as Freedome. Conſequently, we doe not hold that any
man is compelled or enforced by violence to chooſe the evill, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the good: but that through the corruption of nature man unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
doth willingly and wilfully refuſe the good way, and chooſe
the evill. And whereas the unregenerate perſon can do no otherwiſe,
this is not the fruit of any force or compulſion laid upon him, but only
of the obſtinate wickedneſſe, or wicked obſtinacy of his own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and depraved will. The truth hereof appeares by theſe Scriptures,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8. <hi>James</hi> 1. 13 14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> The elect do indeed with unfained willingneſſe obey the
Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, and chooſe the Lord to be their God: but this
they do when they are effectually called, and not before: and this they
doe, not of themſelves, nor only by the well uſing of an ability or
power given to all men; but by the ſpeciall grace of God to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,
who worketh in them both to will &amp; to do, &amp; this according
to the good pleaſure of his owne will concerning them from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The trueth of this appeares in theſe places; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54. 13. compared
with <hi>Joh</hi> 6 44, 45. 64, 65. <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. 26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5,
11. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1 29. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>James</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66023:3"/>
Theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> being thus laid downe and cleared, I come now
to conſider thoſe Scriptures w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you name to prove that a man hath
free will, or free choice; <hi>viz. Deut.</hi> 30. 19. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. 22. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 14.
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 12. and 66. <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 5-11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19 <hi>I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you, that
I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing: therefore chooſe
life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This place ſhewes what was the duty of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to doe: but
doth not proove that they had any abillity of themſelves to doe it; or
that God gives any ſuch abillity to all men. Compare this place with
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>And if it ſeeme evill unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you
this day whom you will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here I ſomewhat queſtion what part of the verſe you would have
eſpecially to be opened: whether this: <hi>Chooſe you this day whom you
will ſerve,</hi> &amp;c. Or this; <hi>But as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
The firſt implyes that Idolaters doe freely chooſe thoſe Idolls, with
which they commit ſpirituall whoredome. Freely, that is to ſay, not
being enforced or compelled thereunto by any violence conſtraining
them to this motion of their will. This is not denyed, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and held by us, as you may ſee in the firſt propoſition. The
l<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt part of the verſe holds forth the free and conſtant reſolution of the
Saints to ſerve the Lord. This alſo is taught in my ſecond propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But there you muſt likewiſe remember, that this is the fruit of the
ſpeciall grace of God afforded to the Elect, who worketh in them
both to will and to doe; <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. And this worke is wrought by
the infinite power of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. and 3. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 22. <hi>Yee are witneſſes againſt your ſelves, that you have Choſen
you the Lord, to ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is meant directly and only of that which went before in <hi>verſ.</hi>
21. <hi>The people ſaid unto Joſhua, Nay, but we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> They
that were Iſraelites indeed, did in truth and ſincerity make this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
and choice; but this they did not of themſelves, but through
the ſpeciall grace of God, as hath been already proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Goe and cry unto the Gods which yee have choſen.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 12. <hi>When I ſpeake, yee did not heare, but did evill before mine
eyes, and did chuſe that wherein</hi> I <hi>delighted not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jſaiah</hi> 66. 3. <hi>They have choſen their own wayes, and their ſoule delighteth

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66023:3"/>
Theſe three places imply no more then what we cleerly hold; as
you may ſee in my firſt propoſition.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>King</hi> 3. 5. 6. 9. 10. <hi>God ſaid, aske what J ſhall give thee. And Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſaid, Give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the ſpeech plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place ſeemes to you to import, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did freely make
choice to aske of God underſtanding to heare judgement. This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not. But conſider alſo that this choice and petition was the fruit of
the wiſedome and grace which God had already given him. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this place with <hi>Zechar. 12. 10. J will poure upon the houſe of David,
and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace, and of ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>J have choſen the way of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Mary hath choſen that good part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True, but it was the ſpeciall grace of God; the ſpeciall, gracious and
powerfull worke of Gods ſpirit, which cauſed <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to
make that good choice: as alſo hath been already prooved. And
thus have I done with your firſt catalogue of texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond catalogue containes certaine places, in which (as you
conceive) the promiſes of God doe depend upon our doing of his
commands. Hereto I anſwer firſt more generally.</p>
            <p>The Scripture promiſeth eternall life to thoſe that obey the Goſpel
of Chriſt: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. &amp; threatens eternall deſtruction to the diſobedient,
<hi>Io.</hi> 3. 36. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. This we acknowledge, and thus we teach But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that which I have alſo already proved, that the elect of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this obedience through Gods ſpeciall Grace; and that this
ſpeciall grace is freely given to them of God according to this own
purpoſe concerning them from all eternitie; and that God hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promiſed this grace to his elect. All this appeares by places of
Scripture already aleadged for the confirmation of my ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Thus I deſcend to conſider more particularly the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that you here preſent unto me. <hi>viz. Levit.</hi> 26. 3. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. 19.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1 23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>Mat.</hi>

obedience to Gods revealed will in every thing; this was the fruit of
Gods ſpeciall grace to them afforded. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 32. 36.
Theſe cleare truths may alſo free you from your doubts that ſeemes
to ariſe from the next place by you mentioned, <hi>viz. Iſaiah.</hi> 1. 19.</p>

            <p>The former part of this verſe is an exhortation. It is the conceit
of ſome that ſuch exhortations doe alwayes imply that the perſons
exhorted have a ſufficient ability in them to obey the exhortation
directed unto them. But this conceit is a meere preſumption, not only
without ground, but alſo againſt the Scripture, as appeares in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
65. and other places. It is demanded, why then are ſuch exhortations
uſed? I anſwer, 1. To mind the perſons exhorted of their duty, and
to leave them the more inexcuſable in their willfull diſobedience.
2. Becauſe the Lord is pleaſed to worke powerfully upon the Elect by
ſuch exhortations</p>
            <p>The latter part of this verſe containes a promiſe. You (as it ſeemes)
conceive the promiſe to be here made only unto thoſe that obey the
exhortation afore going. Be it ſo. Only remember then, that they
which obey the exhortation, doe obey the ſame through Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace; and that the promiſe ſerves to aſſure them of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and increaſe of grace.</p>

one that ſought to eſtabliſh his owne righteouſneſſe, and to get Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

accordingly had propounded this queſtion? <hi>What good thing ſhall</hi> I <hi>doe
that</hi> I <hi>may have eternall life?</hi> The meaning of our Saviours anſwer is
this; If thou wilt thinke to get eternall life this way thou muſt keep
the commandements; that is, thou muſt be found a perſon not any
way guilty of any tranſgreſſion againſt Gods commandements. This
was a thing of meere and utter impoſſibillity, and our Saviours ſcope
in returning to him this anſwer, was to diſcover unto him the vanity
and madneſſe of his proud and fooliſh imagination. Thus this place
rightly underſtood hath not in it the leaſt ſhew of oppoſition againſt
our doctrine.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here Chriſt promiſeth to give reſt, not to all Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but only to thoſe labouring and heavie laden ones which come
to him, namely by a true faith in him. This maketh nothing againſt
us, it ſtill remaining true, that they, and they only, doe thus come unto
Chriſt, in whoſe hearts God worketh lively faith. And this God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in his Elect, and only in them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The manifeſt ſcope of our Saviour in this place, is to ſhew the open
in excuſableneſſe of the impenitency and unbeliefe of Chorazin and
Bethſaida. The laſt words of the verſe, from which your doubt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
may be underſtood to be a figurative ſpeech, like unto that in
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 40. <hi>If theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately
cry out.</hi> Otherwiſe the words may be thus rendered. <hi>They had poſſibly
repented; or, They would poſſibly have repented.</hi> This tranſlation would
be found well to agree to the ſignification of the potentiall particle
which is here uſed in the Greeke. And then this will be the true and
eaſie interpretation of this paſſage: <hi>viz. A man would thinke they ſhould
have repented.</hi> Beyond this, this place muſt not be ſtretched. For no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
muſt be given of any place of Scripture, which ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
make it to contradict the Scripture it ſelfe in other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would</hi> I <hi>have gathered

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66023:5"/>
The meaning is this; How often have I graciouſly afforded unto
the people of Jeruſalem excellent meanes of ſalvation? but the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
people of Jeruſalem have wilfully refuſed to accept of thoſe
meanes of ſalvation, and to profit by the ſame. This is all that this
place doth import: and this maketh nothing at all againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>The law and the Prophets were untill Iohn: ſince that
time the kingdome of God is preached and every man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words in this verſe which you would have to be opened are
thus commonly rendered: <hi>The kingdome of God is preached, and every
man preſſeth into it.</hi> Suppoſe this tranſlation to be right and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be the ſame that our common expoſitors have held forth in
this enſuing interpretation; <hi>Every man,</hi> that is to ſay, many men or
every order and degree of men <hi>preſſeth into it;</hi> that is, with willingnes
and forwardneſſe receiveth the doctrine of the kingdome; and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
into the kingdome of God. Suppoſe I ſay that this were indeed
the meaning of this place; yet it would be found to make nothing at
all againſt us. For ſtill it will remaine true, that the Elect doe this
through Gods ſpeciall grace. But the truth is, that this interpretation
doth not reach our Saviours meaning in this place. The words ſhould
thus be rendered; <hi>every man offereth violence unto it.</hi> The meaning is
this; <hi>every man;</hi> that is, the whole world of ungodly men. <hi>Offereth viol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence
unto it,</hi> that is, makes a violent oppoſition againſt the kingdome
of God and the preaching thereof. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. compared with

only unto thoſe that obey the aforeſaid exhortation. Even ſo this maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt us, but perfectly agreeth with our doctrine. But let me here mind you
that this promiſe may be underſtood not only to be a promiſe of pardon to them that
repent, but alſo a promiſe of the gift of repentance to the Elect. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. 34.
and <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. The particle <hi>and</hi> here inſerted, ſeemes to make againſt this. But this
need not trouble us, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th it is only a ſupplement or addition of the tranſlators, and is
not in the text.</p>
            <p>3. A profeſſion of repentance and faith, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou are
the Lord our God.</hi> You muſt underſtand this to be the ſpeech of the Elect endued with
Gods ſpeciall grace. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Thus according to your requeſt, according to the abilitie which God hath given
me, I have opened the Scriptures that you have mentioned. The Lord open your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,

God.</p>
