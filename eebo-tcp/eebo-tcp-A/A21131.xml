         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

it falleth neceſſarily vnder your patronage,
as well in regard of the continual incouragement,
which I receiued from the fauor you beare to ſuch
imploiments; as alſo for that this worke of Caeſar
hath alwaies beene held in your particular recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
as the <hi>Breuiarie</hi> of ſoldiers; and thought worthie of as
great regard, as euer M. Brutus attributed to Polybius, or Charles

of this work to haue proceeded from Sir Iohn Scot, a knight
deſeruing great honour for his iudgement and skill in matter of
war, whoſe deſire to vnderſtand the true ſenſe of this hiſtory, and
the myſterie of that diſcipline, firſt mooued me to vndertake this
labour. The obſeruations which I haue taken, are ſuch as offer
themſelues to vulgar wits, vpon the conſideration of ſuch points
as are handled in this diſcourſe: for as an old Gouerneſſe well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in error, directeth her young charge to vertue, by ſuch
documents as riſe from her owne miſtakings; ſo the fruit of this
worke riſeth chiefely from thence, where the benefit of good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is manifeſt; or where ill atchieuement beareth witneſſe of
an error. The ſpecialities of greater conſequence, which are either
skilfully ſhadowed, or neceſſarily implied in the hiſtorie, I leaue
to the wiſedome of iudicious commanders, as an obiect fit for
ſuch iudgments, and impertinent to conceits of an inferiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
That which is alreadie handled ſhall ſerue to witneſſe, that
Caeſars works containe matter ſufficient to entertaine the greateſt

If my labour be accepted with that affection as I offer it, I

and ſpeculatiue learning are of any vſe in
perfecting of their Arte, being ſo different in nature from the principles of
their cunning, and of ſo ſmall affinity with the life of action; wherein the vſe of
Armes and atchieuments of war ſeeme to haue their chiefeſt being. But thoſe

and the mutuall conference of thinges happened, begetteth both ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes
and differences, contrary natures, but yet iointly concurring to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
our iudgment with diſcretion, and to enſtall wiſedome in the gouernment

doe eaſily diſcouer the ignorance of ſuch Martialiſtes, as are only trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp in the ſchoole of practiſe, and taught their rudiments vnder a fewe
yeares experience, which ſerueth to interpret no other author but it ſelfe, nor
can approue his maximes, but by his own authority; and are rather moued to
pittie their hard fortune, hauing learned onely to be ignorant, then to enuie
their skill in matter of war, when they oppoſe themſelues againſt ſo manifeſt a
truth as this: that a meere practicall knowledge cannot make a perfect ſoldier.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:22240:4"/>
Which propoſition that I may the better confirme, giue me leaue to reaſon
a little of the groundes of learning, and diſpute from the habitude of Arts and
ſciences; which are then ſaid to be perfectly attained, when their particular parts
are in ſuch ſort apprehended, that from the variety of that indiuiduality, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
power frameth generall notions and maximes of rule, vniting tearms
of the ſame nature in one head, and diſtinguiſhing diuerſities by differences
of properties, aptely diuiding the whole body into his greateſt and ſmalleſt
branches, and fitting each part with his deſcriptions, duties, cautions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions:
for vnleſſe the vnderſtanding be in this ſort qualified and able by logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
diſcourſe, to aſcend, by way of compoſition, from ſingularitie to catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
conceptions; and returne againe the ſame waie, to the loweſt order of his
partitions, the minde cannot be ſaide to haue the perfection of that Arte,
nor inſtructed in the true vſe of that knowledge: but guiding her ſelfe by
ſome broken preceptes, feeleth more want by that ſhee hath not, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
by that ſhee hath. Whereby it followeth, that a ſcience deuided
into manie braunches, and conſiſting in the multiplicitie of diuers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
being all ſo intereſſed in the Bulke, that's Mayme of the ſmalleſt part
cauſeth either debilitie or deformitie in the bodie, cannot be ſaide to bee
throughlie attayned, nor conceiued with ſuch a profiting apprehenſion as
ſteeleth the minde with true iudgement, and maketh the ſcholler maiſter
in his Arte, vnleſſe the nature of theſe particularities bee firſt had and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>And for as much as no one ſcience or faculty whatſoeuer, in multitude and
pluralitie of partes, may anie waie be comparable to the Arte militarie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
euery ſmall and vnreſpected circumſtance quite altereth the nature of the
Action, and breedeth ſuch diſparitie and difference, that the reſemblance of
their equall participating properties is blemiſhed with the diſſimilitude of their
diſagreeing partes; it cannot be denied, but he that is acquainted with moſt of
theſe particular occurrences, and beſt knoweth the varietie of chances in the
courſe of warre, muſt needes be thought a more perfect ſouldier, and deſerueth
a title of greater dignity in the profeſſion of Armes, then ſuch as content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with a fewe common precepts and ouer-worne rules: without which, as
they cannot be ſaid at all to be ſouldiers, ſo with them and no more, they no
way deſerue the name of skilfull and perfect men of war. Now whether meere
experience, or experience ioyned with reading and diſcourſe, doe feaſt the
minde with more variety and choiſe of matter, or entertaine knowledge with
greater plentie of nouelties, incident to expeditions and vſe of Armes, I will
vſe no other reaſon to determine of this queſtion, then that which Franciſcus
Patricius alleadgeth in his parallely, where he handleth this argument which I
intreat of.</p>
            <p>He that followeth a warre (ſaith he) doth ſee either the courſe of the whole,
or but a part onely. If his knowledge extend no farther then a part, he hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
leſſe then he that ſawe the whole: but admit he hath ſeene and learned the
inſtructions of one whole warre, he hath notwithſtanding learned leſſe then he
that hath ſeene the proceeding of two ſuch warres. And hee againe hath not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22240:4"/>
ſeene ſo much as another that hath ſerued in three ſeuerall warres: and ſo by
degrees, a ſouldier that hath ſerued ten yeares, muſt needes knowe more then
one that hath not ſerued ſo long. And to conclude, he that hath receiued 22
yeares ſtipend (which was the iuſt time of ſeruice amongſt the Romans before
a ſouldier could be diſmiſt) hath greater meanes of experience than another
that hath not ſo long a time followed the campe, and cannot challenge a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
by order and cuſtome: And hence it conſequently followeth, that if in
one or more or all theſe warres, there haue happened few or no actions of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
which might teach a ſouldier the practiſe of Armes; that then his learning
doth not counteruaile his labour. And if the warre through the negligence, or
ignorance of the chiefe commanders haue beene ill caried, he can boaſt of no
knowledge, but that which acquainted him with the corruptions of militarie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
if the part which he followed were defeated and ouerthrowne, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by experience howe to looſe, but not how to gaine: And therefore it is not
onely experience and practice which maketh a ſouldier worthie of his name, but
the knowledge of the manifold accidents which riſe from the variety of humane
actions, wherein reaſon and error, like merchants in trafficke, enterchange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
euentes of fortune, giuing ſometime copper for ſiluer, and balme for
poyſon, and repaying againe the like commoditie as time and circumſtances
doe anſwere their directions. And this knowledge is onely to be learned in the
regiſters of antiquitie and in hiſtories, recording the motions of former ages.</p>
            <p>Caius Iulius Caeſar (whoſe actions are the ſubiect of theſe diſcourſes) after
his famous victories in France, and that he had gotten the prouinces of Spaine,
broken the ſtrength of the Romaine Empire at Pharſalia, was held a ſouldier
ſurmounting enuie and all her exceptions; and yet notwithſtanding all this, the
battell he had with Pharnaces king of Pontus, was like to haue buried the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his former conqueſtes, in the diſhonourable memorie of a wilfull ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
for hauing poſſeſt himſelfe of a hill of great aduantage, he began to
encampe himſelfe in the toppe thereof. Which Pharnaces perceiuing, (being
lodged likewiſe with his campe vpon a mountaine confronting the Romaines)
imbattelled his men, marched down from his campe into the valley, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his forces vp the hill, where the Romaines were buſied about their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to giue them battel. All which, Caeſar tooke but for a brauado: and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
the enemie by himſelfe, could not be perſwaded that any ſuch foole-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
could carrie men headlong into ſo dangerous an aduenture, vntill they
were come ſo neere, that he had ſcarce any time to call the legions from their
worke, and to giue order for the battell: which ſo amazed the Romaines, that
vnleſſe, as Caeſar himſelfe ſaith, the aduantage of the place and the benignitie
of the gods had greatly fauoured them; Pharnaces had at that time reuenged
the ouerthrow of Pompei and the Senat, and reſtored the Romaine Empire to
libertie. Which maie learne vs how neceſſary it is (beſides experience, which in
Caeſar was infinit) to perfect our knowledge with variety of chances: and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
vpon the effectes of other mens aduentures, that their harmes maie be
our warnings, and their happie proceedings our fortunate directions.</p>
            <p>And albeit amongſt ſo manie decades of Hiſtorie, which pregnant wits haue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22240:5"/>
preſented to theſe latter ages, we ſeldome or neuer meete with any one acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which iumpeth in all pointes with an other of the like nature, that ſhall
happen to fall out in managing a warre, or ſetting forth of an armie; and ſo doe
ſeeme to reape little benefit by that we reade, and make ſmall vſe of our great
trauell. Yet we muſt vnderſtand that in the Audit of Reaſon, there are many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which through the ſoueraigne power of the diſcourſiue faculty, receiue
great commodities by whatſoeuer falleth vnder their iuriſdiction, and ſuffer no
action to paſſe without due triall of his nature, and examination of his ſtate;
that ſo the iudgment maie not be defrauded of her reuenues, nor the minde of
her learning: for notwithſtanding diſagreeing circumſtances, and differences of
formes, which ſeeme to cut off the priuiledge of imitation, and fruſtrate the
knowledge we haue obtained by reading, the intellectuall facultie hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

diuerſities, and by the helpe of reaſon to turne it to her aduantage; or ſo to
counterpoiſe the defect, that in triall and execution it ſhall not appeare anie
diſaduantage. For as in all other ſciences, and namely in geometrie, of certaine
bare elements, and common ſentences, which ſenſe admitteth to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
the powers of the ſoule frame admirable Theoremes and Problemes
of infinit vſe, proceeding with certaintie of demonſtration, from propoſition
to propoſition, and from concluſion to concluſion, and ſtill make new wonders
as they go, beſides the ſtrangeneſſe of their Architecture, that vpon ſuch plaine
and eaſie foundations, they ſhould erect ſuch curious and beautifull buildings:
ſo in the Arte Military, theſe examples, which are taken from hiſtories, are but
plaine kinde of principles, on which the minde worketh to her beſt aduantage,
and vſeth reaſon with ſuch dexterity, that of inequalities ſhe concludeth an
equality, and of diſſimilitudes moſt ſweete reſemblances; and ſo ſhe worketh
out her owne perfection by diſcourſe, and in time groweth ſo abſolute in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that her ſufficiency needeth no further directions:<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> but as Lomazzo the
Milineſe, in that excellent worke which he writ of picturing, ſaith of a skilfull
painter, that being to drawe a portraiture of gracefull lineaments, will neuer
ſtand to take the ſymmetry by ſcale, nor marke it out according to rule; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his iudgment habituated by knowledge, and perfected with the variety of
ſhapes and proportions; his knowledge guideth his eie, and his eie directeth
his hand, and his hand followeth both with ſuch facilitie of cunning, that each
of them ſerue for a rule wherby the true meaſures of nature are exactly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The like may I ſay of a skilfull Souldier, or any Artizan in his faculty, when
knowledge hath once purified his iudgment, and tuned it to the key of true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
            <p>And although there are many that will eaſily admit a reconciliation of this
diſagreement, in the reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of accidents being referred to the arbitrement
of a well tempered ſpirit; yet they will by no meanes acknowledge, that thoſe
monſtrous and inimitable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of valour &amp; magnanimity (whereof antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is prodigall, &amp; ſpendeth as though time ſhould neuer want ſuch treaſure) can
anie way auaile the maners of theſe daies, which if they were as they ought to
be, would appeare but conterfeit to the luſter of a golden age, nor yet compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22240:5"/>
to ſiluer or braſſe, or the ſtrength of yron, but deſerue no better title then
earth or clay, whereof the frame of this age conſiſteth. For what reſemblance
(ſay they) is betweene the cuſtoms of our times, &amp; the actions of thoſe ancient
Heroes? They obſerued equity as well in warre as in peace: for vertue rather
flouriſhed by the naturall diſpoſition of men, then by lawe and authority; the
tenure of their Empire was valour in warre and concord in peace; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
treaſure which they eſteemed, were the deedes of armes which they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued
for their countrey, adorning the temples of their gods with pietie, and
their priuate houſes with glory, pardoning rather then proſecuting a wrong,
and taking nothing from the vanquiſhed but ability of doing iniury: But the
courſe of our times hath another bias, for couetouſneſſe hath ſubuerted both
faith and equity, and our valour affecteth nothing but ambition, pride and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
tyrannize in our thoughtes, and ſubtilty teacheth vs to carrie rather a faire
countenance, then a good nature; our meanes of getting are by fraud &amp; extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our manner of ſpending is by waſt and prodigality; not eſteeming
what we haue of our owne, but coueting that which is not ours; men effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and women impudent, vſing ritches as ſeruants to wickedneſſe, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
natures appetite with want on luxurity; ſupplanting vertue with trecherie,
and vſing victory with ſuch impiety, as though <hi>iniuriant facere,</hi> were <hi>imperio vti:</hi>
and therefore the exemplarie patternes of former times wherein true honour is
expreſſed, may ſerue to be gazed vpon, but no way to be imitated by this age,
being too ſubtile to deale with honeſty, and wanting courage to incounter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
I muſt needes confeſſe, that he that compareth the hiſtory of Liuie with
that of Guichardine ſhall finde great difference in the ſubiects which they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
for Liuie triumpheth in the conqueſtes of vertue, and in euery page erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
trophes vnto valour, making his diſcourſe like Cleanthes table, wherein
vertue is deſcribed in her entire maieſtie, and ſo ſweetned with the preſence &amp;
ſeruice of the graces, that all they which behold her are rapt with admiration
of her excellencie, and charmed with the loue of her perfection: but Guichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
hath more then Theſeus taske to performe, being to winde through the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinthes
of ſubtilty, and diſcouer the quaint practiſes of politians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
publike and open deſſignes are oftentimes but ſhadowes of more ſecret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
and theſe againe ſerue as foiles to more eminent intentions; being alſo
diſcoloured with diſſimulation, and ſo inſnared in the ſleightes of ſubtilty, that
when you looke for war, you ſhall finde peace; and expecting peace, you ſhall
fal into troubles, diſſentions and wars: So crabbed and crooked is his argument
in reſpect of Liuies fortune, and ſuch arte is required to vnfolde the truth of
theſe myſteries.</p>
            <p>But to anſwere this obiection in a word, and ſo to proceede to that which
followeth, I ſay thoſe immortall memories of vertue which former time recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
are more neceſſary to be knowne, then any ſtrategems of ſubtler ages:
for equitie and valour being truely apprehended ſo ſeaſon the motions of the
ſoule, that albeit in ſo corrupt a courſe, they cannot peraduenture ſtir vp imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
yet they oftentimes hinder many malicious practiſes, and diueliſh deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
when euill is reproued by the knowledge of good, and condemned by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22240:6"/>
authority of better ages. And if we will needs follow thoſe ſteppes which the
preſent courſe of the world hath traced, and plaie the Cretian with the Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
this obiection hindereth nothing, but that hiſtorie, eſpeciallie theſe of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times; affordeth ſufficient inſtructions to make a ſouldier perfect in that
point.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore anie man deſpiſe the ſound inſtructions which learning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth,
nor refuſe the helpes that hiſtorie doth offer to perfect the weakneſſe of
a ſhort experience, eſpecially when no worth can counteruaile the waight of ſo
great a buſineſſe for I take the office of a chiefe commander, to be a ſubiect ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the greateſt wiſdedome that may be apprehended by naturall meanes,
being to manage a multitude of diſagreeing mindes, as a fit inſtrument to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
a deſſigne of much conſequence and great expectation, and to qualifie
both their affections and apprehenſions according to the accidentes which riſe
in the courſe of his directions; beſides the true iudgement, which he ought to
haue of ſuch circumſtances as are moſt important to a fortunate end, wherein
our prouidence cannot haue enough either from learning or experience, to
preuent diſaduantages, or to take holde of opportunities. Neither can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but as this knowledge addeth perfection to our iudgment, ſo it ſerueth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as a ſpur to glory, and increaſeth the deſire of honour in ſuch as beholde the
atchieuments of vertue, commended to a perpetuall poſteritie, hauing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the like meanes to conſecrate their memorie to ſucceeding ages, wherein
they may ſerue for examples of valour, and reape the reward of true honour. Or
to conclude, if we thirſt after the knowledge of our owne fortune, and long to
foreſee the ende of that race which we haue taken, which is the chiefeſt matter
of conſequence in the vſe of Armes; what better coniecture can be made, then
to looke into the courſe of former times, which haue proceeded from like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
and were continued with like meanes, and therefore not vnlikely to
ſort vnto like endes?</p>
            <p>And now if it be demanded whether reading or practice haue the firſt place
in this Arte, and ſerueth as a foundation to the reſt of the building? Let Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
anſwere this queſtion,<note place="margin">Saluſt. de bello Iugur.</note> who enuying at the nobilitie of Rome, ſaith thus. <hi>Qui
poſtquam conſules facti ſunt, acta Maiorum &amp; Graecorum militaria praecepta legere
caeperint: homines praepoſteri, nam legere quam fieri, tempore poſterius, re &amp; vſu

follow it in courſe of time, for there is no reading, but of ſome thing practiſed
before,) theſe prepoſterous men, after they are made Conſuls and placed at the
helme of gouernment, begin to reade, when they ſhould practiſe that which
they had read; and ſo bewray their inſufficiencie of knowledge by vſing out of
time that, which in time is moſt neceſſarie. This teſtimonie gaue Marius of
reading &amp; booke learning, being himſelfe an enemy to the ſame, for as much as
all his knowledge came by meere experience. But howſoeuer his iudgment was
good in this point: for ſince that all motion and action proceedeth from the
ſoule, and cannot well be produced, vntill the Idea thereof be firſt imprinted in
the minde, according to which patterne the outward being and ſenſible reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
is duely faſhioned; how is it poſſible that any action can be well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22240:6"/>
when the minde is not directed by knowledge to diſpoſe it in that ſort, as
ſhall beſt agree with the occurrentes of ſuch natures, as are neceſſarily intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both in the meanes and in the end thereof? And therfore ſpeculatiue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as the Tramontane, to direct the courſe of all practiſe is firſt to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
            <p>But that I may not ſeeme partiall in this controuerſie, but carrie an equall
hand betweene two ſo neceſſarie yoakefellowes, giue me leaue to conclude in
a word, the benefite of practiſe, and define the good which commeth from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
that ſo nothing that hath beene ſpoken may ſeeme to come from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
or proceede from the forge of vniuſt partiality. And firſt it cannot bee
denied, but that practiſe giueth boldneſſe and aſſurance in action, and maketh
men expert in ſuch things they take in hand, for no man can reſt vpon ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
through the theorike of knowledge, as he that hath ſeene his learning
verified by practiſe, and acknowledged by the teſtimony of aſſured proofe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there are many other acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plements gotten only by practiſe, which grace
the preſence of knowledge, &amp; giue credit to that which we haue read; as firſt to
learne the vſe and aduantage of the armes which we beare; ſecondly, by frequent
aſpect and familiarity of dangers, and accidents of terrour, to learne to feare
nothing but diſhonour, to make no difference betweene heate and cold, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and winter, to ſleepe in all places as on a bed, and at the ſame time to take
paines and ſuffer penury, with many other difficulties which cuſtome maketh
eaſie, and cannot be gotten but by vſe and practiſe.</p>
            <p>And thus at length, I haue brought a ſhallow diſcourſe to an abrupt end, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
with greater zeale of affection then I am able with manifeſt proofe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to demonſtrate the neceſſity, that both theſe partes were by our ſouldiers ſo
regarded, that neither practiſe might march in obſtinate blindneſſe without
learned knowledge; nor this againe be entertained with an idle apprehenſion
without practiſe: but that both of them may be reſpected, as neceſſarie partes to
make a compleat nature; wherein knowledge as the intellectuall part giueth
life and ſpirit to the action, and practiſe as the materiall ſubſtance maketh it of
a ſenſible being, and like a skilfull workman expreſſeth the excellency, which
knowledge hath fore conceiued: wiſhing no man to deſpaire of effecting that
by practiſe which the Theorike of knowledge commendeth. For <hi>Cur deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22240:8"/>
they are in continuall warres with the Germans, which maketh them hardy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert

Sene, Garum, and the vpper part of Rhene for their confines. Aquitania is limited
with the riuer Garume and the Perinaean hils. In each of theſe partes are diuers ſtates

               <p>The chiefeſt reaſon that moued the Heluetians to forſake their countrey, was the
good opinion they had of their owne vertue and magnanimity, and the ſmal capacity

Rhene and Rhone,<note place="margin">The lake of Geneua. Mont ioux.</note> and with the lake Lemanus, and the high hanging rockes of the

to for ſake their countrey, which firſt gaue them breath and being, rather then
it ſhould hinder a correſpondent proceeding to their warlike nature. Theſe coles of

honor to ſuffer no man to border vpon their confines; or ſome other vniuerſal,
which made the place inhabitable and the people willing to vndertake a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie

ſo multiplied, that the place was ouer charged with multitudes of ofſpring, and
like a poore father had more children then it was able to ſuſtaine, the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
ſurplus was ſent out to ſeeke new fortunes in forraine countries, and to poſſeſſe
themſelues of a reſting ſeat; which might recompence the wants of their natiue
country, with a plenteous reuenue of neceſſary ſupplementes: And in this ſort,
we read that Rome ſent out manie Colonies into diuers parts of her Empire:
And in this maner the ancient Galles disburdened themſelues of their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22240:8"/>
and ſent them into Aſia. The Gothes came from the Ilandes of the Balticke
ſea, and in Sulla his time ſwarmed ouer Germany: beſides many other nations
whoſe tranſmigrations are particularly deſcribed by Lazius. But amongſt all
theſe, we find none that ſo forſooke their country, but there remained ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

equall both in equality and number. For after they had parted their common
people into euen companies, they deuided their nobility with as great equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as they could, among the former partitions; and then caſting lots, that part
which went out to ſeeke new aduentures, left their landes and poſſeſſions to the
reſt that remained at home; and ſo by induſtrie they ſupplied that defect which
continuance of time had drawen vpon them. And this was the means which the
firſt inhabitants of the earth found out after the floud, to people the vnhabited

a blow, could paſſe through their Prouince without further violence: and therfore in
this time of deliberation, hee made a ditch, and a rampier from the hill Iura to the
lake of Geneua, containing 19 miles in length. The rampier was 16 foote high with

the firſt volley, if the bullet chance to lie looſe, when the noſe of the peece is

but when the noſe ſhall be raiſed vpward to the ſide of a hill, the bullet
being rammed in with his owne waight, ſhall flie with greater certaintie and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
conſidering the nature of the pouder to be ſuch, that the more it is ſtopt
and ſhut in, the more it ſeeketh to enlarge his roome, and breaketh forth with
greater violence and fury. Concerning other weapons, I take the vpper ground
in the ſhocke and incounter, to be aduantagious, as well for the ſword as the
pike, and would deſerue as great reſpect, if the controuerſie were decided by
theſe weapons, as ſeldome times it is.</p>

as the foundation &amp; ſtrength of euery expedition, without which
no man can manage a warre, according to the true maximes and
rules of the Art military, but muſt be forced to relieue that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience,
with the loſſe of many other aduantages of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence: Which
gaue occaſion to Gaſpard de Coligni that famous Admiral of France amongſt
other oracles of truth, wherewith his minde was maruellouſly enriched, often to
vſe this ſaying: That he that will ſhape that beaſt (meaning warre) muſt begin
with the belly: And this rule was diligently obſerued by Caeſar, who beſt knewe
how to expreſſe the true portraiture of that beaſt, in due proportion and liuely
reſemblance.</p>
                  <p>The order of the Romans was, at the daie of meaſuring, to giue corne to euery
particular ſouldier, for a certain time, which was commonly defined by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
And by the meaſure which was giuen them, they knew the daie of the
next paiment; for euerie footman receiued after the rate of a buſhell a weeke,
which was thought ſufficient for him and his ſeruant: for if they had paied them
their whole ſtipend in money, it might haue beene waſted in vnneceſſarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences;
but by this meanes they were ſure of prouiſion for the time determined;
and the ſequell of the warre was prouidently cared for by the Generall.</p>
                  <p>The corne being deliuered out, was husbanded, ground with hand-milles,
which they carried alwaies with them, &amp; made into haſtie cakes, daintie enough
for a ſouldiers mouth, by no other but themſelues and their ſeruants: Neither
could they ſell it or exchange it for bread; for Saluſt reckoneth this vp amongſt
other diſhonours, of the diſcipline corrupted, that the ſouldiers ſold away their
corne, which was giuen them by the treaſurer, &amp; bought their bread by the day.
And this manner of prouiſion had many ſpeciall commodities, which are not
incident to our cuſtome of victualing: for it is impoſſible, that victualers ſhould
followe an Armie vpon a ſeruice, in the enemies countrey twentie or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
daies together, with ſufficient prouiſion for an Armie: And by that meanes
the Generall cannot attend aduantages and fitteſt oportunities, which in tract
of time are often offered, but is forced either to hazard the whole, vpon vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
tearmes, or to ſound an vnwilling retrait. And whereas the victualers are
for the moſt part voluntarie, reſpecting nothing but their gaine; and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
on the other ſide, careleſſe of the morrow and prodigall of the preſent, in
that turbulent marmarket, where the ſeller hath an eie onely to his particular,
and the buyer reſpecteth neither the publike good nor his priuate commoditie,
there is nothing to be looked for, but famine and confuſion. Where as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
by their manner of prouiſion, impoſed the generall care of the publike
good vpon the chiefe commander, whoſe dutie it was to prouide ſtore of corne
for his Armie; and the particular care vpon euerie priuate ſouldier, whome it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22240:13"/>
eſpecially concerned to ſee, that the allowance which the common weale had in
plentifull manner giuen him, for his maintenance, might not be waſted through
negligence or prodigalitie; which excellent order, the nature of our victuals
will no way admit. Their prouinces and the next confederate ſtates furniſhed
their Armies continually with corne; as it appeareth by this place, that for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
of graine, he depended altogether vpon the Hedui: And when they were
in the enemies countrey, in the time of harueſt, the ſouldiers went out to reape
and gather corne, and deliuered it threſhed and clenſed to the treaſurer, that it
might be kept vntill the daie of paiment. But to leaue this frugall and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarij:</hi> for I omit the velites, as no part of their ſtanding battels,
and of theſe they made three ſeuerall battels from front to backe: in the firſt

were called <hi>Acies prima.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">By triplex Acies.</note> Behinde theſe in a conuenient diſtance, ſtood the
<hi>Principes,</hi> in like ſort and order diſpoſed, and were called <hi>Acies ſecunda:</hi> and
laſtly in a like correſpondent diſtance, were the <hi>Triarij</hi> imbattelled and made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem
tertiam.</hi> Their legion conſiſted of ten companies, which they called co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortes,
and euerie cohort conſiſted of three ſmall companies, which they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Manipuli:</hi> a maniple of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> a maniple of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>Triarij,</hi> as I will more particularly ſet downe in the ſecond booke.
And as theſe three kindes of ſouldiers were ſeparated by diſtance of place from
front to backe: ſo was euerie battell deuided into his maniples; and theſe were
deuided by little allies and waies, one from an other, which were vſed to this
purpoſe: The <hi>Haſtati</hi> being in front did euer begin the battell, and if they
found themſelues too weake to repell the enemie, or were happily forced to a
retrait, they drew themſelues through theſe allies or diſtances, which were in
the ſecond battell betweene the maniples of the <hi>Principes</hi> into the ſpace, which
was betweene the <hi>Principes</hi> and the <hi>Triarij,</hi> and there they reſted themſelues
whileſt the Princes tooke their place and charged the enemie: Or otherwiſe, if
the commanders found it needfull, they filde vp thoſe diſtances of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi>
and ſo vnited with them into one bodie, they charged the enemy all in
groſſe; and then if they preuailed not, they retired into the ſpaces between the
<hi>Triarij,</hi> and ſo they gaue the laſt aſſault, all the three bodies being ioyned all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one.</p>
                  <p>Now if we examine by the current of the hiſtorie, whether Caeſar obſerued
the ſame order and diuiſions in his warres, we ſhall find little or no alteration at
all, for firſt this <hi>triplex Acies</hi> here mentioned, was no other thing but the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Haſtati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarij,</hi> according to the manner of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
And leaſt any man ſhould dreame of that ordinarie diuiſion, which is
likewiſe threefold, the two cornets and the battell, and in that ſence he might
ſaie to haue made <hi>triplicem Aciem,</hi> let him vnderſtand, that the circumſtances
of the diuiſion haue no coherence with that diuiſion; for in that he ſaith of the
Heluetians, <hi>ſucceſserunt Aciem primam,</hi> preſſed neare the firſt battel or vangard,
he maketh it cleare that the Armie was deuided into a triple battell from front
to backe: for otherwiſe, he would haue ſaid, <hi>ſucceſserint dextrum aut ſiniſtrum
cornu, aut mediam Aciem:</hi> for ſo were the partes of that diuiſion tearmed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

the firſt and ſecond battell followed cloſe vpon the enemie, and the third op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

                  <p>But that place in the firſt of the ciuill warres taketh away all ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie,

ſouldiers ſhould be interrupted in their worke, he cauſed the firſt and ſecond
battel to ſtand in Armes and keepe their diſtance, to the end they might ſhroud
and couer the third battel (which was imploied in making a ditch behind them)
from the view of the enemie; and this kind of imbattailing Caeſar obſerued, in
moſt of his fightes: by which it appeareth that he vſeth the verie ſame order and
diſcipline for imbattailing, as was inſtituted by the old Romans.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the auncient names of <hi>Haſtati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarij,</hi> which Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

I grant they are ſeldome vſed in theſe Commentaries, in the ſenſe of
their firſt inſtitution: for the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> when the diſcipline was firſt erected, were
the youngeſt and pooreſt of the legionarie ſouldiers. The <hi>Principes</hi> were the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,

that vertue might bee rewarded with honour, and that time might challenge

in regard of a neceſſarie diſtinction, although peraduenture the <hi>Haſtati</hi> were as
good ſouldiers, as either the <hi>Principes</hi> or the <hi>Triarij.</hi> As touching the ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the maniples, whereinto the firſt battell did retire it ſelfe if occaſion
vrged them, I neuer found any mention of them in Caeſar. Excepting once
here in England, where in a skirmiſh the Brittaines ſo vrged the court of guard,
which kept watch before the Roman campe, that Caeſar ſent out two other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortes
to ſuccour them, who making diſtance betweene them as they ſtoode,
the court of guard retired it ſelfe in ſafetie, through that ſpace into the campe;
otherwiſe we neuer finde that the firſt battell made any retrait into the allies
betweene the maniples of the ſecond battell, but when it failed in any part, the
ſecond and third went preſently to ſecond them, as appeareth in the battell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

but in imbattailing, they drawe theſe three companies all in front, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
two cornets and the battel, without any other troupes to ſecond them. But

The Grecians were very skilfull in this part of the Arte militarie, which
containeth order and diſpoſition in imbattailing, for they maintained publike
profeſſors whom they called Tactici, to teach and inſtruct their youth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
and Art of al formes conuenient for that purpoſe. And theſe Tactici found
by experience, that 16 in flancke ſo ordered as they were in a phalanx, were able
to beare any ſhocke how violently ſoeuer it charged vpon them: which number
of 16 they made to conſiſt of foure doubles, as firſt vnitie maketh no order, for
order conſiſteth in number and pluralitie; but vnitie doubled maketh two, the
leaſt of all orders, and this is the double: which doubled againe maketh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
order of foure ſouldiers in a file, which doubled the third time maketh 8,
&amp; this doubled maketh 16, which is the fourth doubling from a vnite; and in it
they ſtaied as in an abſolute number and ſquare, whoſe roote is 4 the Quadruple

of Alexander the great: with Mauritius, and Leo imperator, where hee ſhall
haue the diuiſions of Tetrafalangia difalangia, Phalangia vnto a vnite, with all
the diſcipline of the Grecians.</p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt thing to be obſerued is, that the Grecians hauing ſuch skill in

the figure in it ſelfe was very ſtrong, or otherwiſe in regard that it fitted
beſt their weapons, which were long pikes and targets. But whether Caeſar tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the battell of the Heluetians a phalanx in regard of their thicke manner of
imbattailing onely, or otherwiſe, for as much as beſides the forme, they vſed the
naturall weapon of a phalanx which was the pike, it remaineth doubtfull. Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio

were pikes. In the fight at the baggage it is ſaid, that manie of the legiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſouldiers were wounded through the cart wheeles, with <hi>tragulas</hi> &amp; <hi>materas,</hi>
which are commonly interpreted ſpeares and iauelins: and I take them to bee

that they would doe, otherwiſe the Acte may formerly be effected, but the mind
neuer approueth it by aſſent. And this maner of exhortation or ſpeech of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,

only meanes to ſtirre vp alacrity: Or if it happened that his men were at any

at the two ouerthrowes he had at Dirrachium; he neuer would adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to giue

pile,<note place="margin">The Roman Pile deſcribed</note> which being a heauie deadly weapon, could hardly be fruſtrated
with any reſiſtance, and in that reſpect was very proper and effectual
againſt a phalanx, or any other thicke and cloſe battell, or whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
els, the ſtroke was certaine, or could hardly deceiue the aime of the caſter:
for in ſuch incounters it ſo galled the enemy, that they were neither able to
keepe their order, nor anſwere the aſſault with a reſiſting counterbuffe. By which
it appeareth that the only remedie againſt the pile was, to make the rankes thin,
allowing to euery ſouldier a large podiſme or place to ſtand in, that ſo the ſtroke
might of it ſelfe fall without hurt, or by foreſight be preuented; as it ſhal plainly
appeare by the ſequell of this hiſtorie, which I will not omit to note, as the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhall offer themſelues to the examination of this diſcourſe. But as touching
the pile, which is ſo often mentioned in the Roman hiſtorie, Polybius deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
it in this manner. A pile (ſaith he) is a caſting weapon, the ſtaffe whereof is
almoſt 3 cubites long, and it hath <hi>palmarem diametrum,</hi> a hand breadth in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The ſtaues were armed with an head of yron, equall in length to the ſtaffe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22240:16"/>
it ſelfe: But in that ſort that halfe the head was faſtened vp to the middle of the
ſtaffe, with plates of yron like the head of a Halbert: and the other halfe ſtucke
out at the ende of the ſtaffe like a pike, containing a fingers breadth in thicknes,
and ſo decreaſing leſſe and leſſe vnto the point which was barbed. This head
was ſo ſlender toward the point, that the waight of the ſtaffe would bend it as it
ſtucke, as appeareth in this battell of the Heluetians. This weapon was peculiar
to the Romans, and was called <hi>Pilum,</hi> as Varro noteth of <hi>Pilum</hi> a Peſtell, <hi>quod
Hoſtes feriret vt Pilum.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia Romana.</note> Lipſius finding that <hi>Palmarem diametrum,</hi> was too great
a thickneſſe to be managed by any mans hand, interpreteth it to be foure inches
in circuit, if the ſtaffe were either round or ſquare, for they had of both ſortes,
and ſo he maketh it very manageable; but nothing anſwerable to the deſcription
giuen by Polybius either in forme or waight. Patricius in his Paralleli, maketh
the ſtaffe to haue <hi>palmarem diametrum</hi> in the butte end,<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> but the reſt of the ſtaffe
he maketh to decreaſe taper wiſe, vnto the head of yron, where it hath the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a mans finger; and ſo it anſwereth both in forme and waight to a Peſtell,
as may be ſeene by the figure, and I take it to be the meaning of Polybius. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius
in that place ſetteth downe foure diſcommodities of the Pile. Firſt a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and hoat ſpirited enemie will eaſily preuent the darting of the pile, with a
nimble and ſpeedie cloſe: And ſo we read, that in the battell which Caeſar had
with Ariouiſtus, the Germans came ſo violently vpon them, that the ſouldiers
caſt away their piles, and betooke them to their ſwordes. And likewiſe in that
worthy battell betweene Cateline and Marcus Petreius,<note place="margin">Salust.</note> they caſt away their
piles on either part. The ſecond diſcommoditie was, that the piles being ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
could not be caſt any diſtance, but were only ſeruiceable at hand. Thirdly,
they could not be caſt with any aime, or as they ſay point blanke: And laſtly the
ſouldiers were to take aduantage of ground backward when they threw them,
which might eaſily diſorder their troups, if they were not very wel experienced.</p>

of their ouerthrow, as farre as the right ſenſe of the hiſtorie ſhall direct
our iudgment, we ſhall finde valour not to be wanting in the Helueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
but rather ſuperlatiuely abounding in the Romans. For that vehement opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:22240:20"/>
of their valiancie and manhood, which carried them out of the ſtreights of
the country, to ſeeke larger fortunes in other kingdomes, was not ſo abated with
the loſle of the fourth part of their Hoſt at the riuer Arar; nor with the terrible
furie of thoſe veteran legions: but it yeelded this effect, which Caeſar in his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of valour thought memorable, that for fiue houres ſpace or more, there
was not one man ſeene to haue turned his backe. Their manner of imbattai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
had not the Romans beene the enemy, was vnreſiſtable: for being caſt
into a phalanx, which in the plaines of Aſia had made Alexander the great and
the Macedonians famous, they did as farre ſurpaſſe any other forme of imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing
(ſuppoſing that the conueniencie of the place did fit that diſpoſition)
wherein the ſtrength of the whol is deuided into many particulars, as the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of a great bodie exceedeth the force and motion of his partes, when it is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſmaller cantons. For as in a phalanx, many particular ſouldiers are by
a cloſe and compact order incorporated into one entire bodie: ſo their ſeueral
vertues are gathered into one head, and are as partes vnited into one generall
force, which eaſily ſwalloweth vp the ability of many other leſſer quantities, into
which a greater ſtrength is equally diuided.</p>
                  <p>The aduantage of the place which they got by retrait, and the double charge
wherewith they ingaged the Romans both in front and flanke, was able in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
conflict to haue made fortune fugitiue, and beare armes on their ſide;
or at the leaſt ſo to haue ſteemed the ſwelling tide of victorie, which carried the
Romans ſo violently in the chaſe, that they might haue beene equall ſharers in
the honour of the daie: had it not flowed from an Ocean of valour, whoſe
courſe could not be hindered with any ſtops and oppoſitions, vntill it came to
that height, which true valour and vnexampled reſolution affected. And yet the
height of this courage could not ſo alaie the heate of the Heluetians furie; but
it brake foorth into dangerous flames, when they came to the place where their
cariages were laide, and coſt much bloud and many mens liues before they
quitted the place: for they fought with that ſpirit and induſtry, as though they
meant to make triall whether their fortune would proue no better in the night
then it had done in the daie.</p>
                  <p>The ouerthrow of the Tigurine Canton at the riuer Arar, proceeded rather
from want of good directions (which is the leſſe to be maruelled at, conſidering
they had no chiefe commander as we read of) then from any defect of valour:

they propounded, would neceſsarily pull on moſt grieuous afflictions. Diuitiacus the

               <p>That Gallia was vnhappely diuided into two factions,<note place="margin">The people of Auuergne.</note> the Hedui were the head of
the one, and the Auerni of the other. Theſe two states contending manie yeares for
the principalitie, the Auerni with the Sequani their Clients, finding themſelues
the weaker partie, hired the Germans to take their part, who at the firſt ſent them
15000 men to ſtrengthen their faction: but afterward taſting the ſweeteneſse and
pleaſure of the Galles, the barbarous people ſo liked the country, that now there were
no leſſe then one hundred and twentie thouſand, that were come out of Germanie
and ſeated in their Territories. With theſe the Hedui and their Clients had once or
twiſe fought, hoping by their proweſse, both to chastice the malice of the Sequani, and
to cleare their country of a barbarous enemie: but their labour effected nothing but
their owne calamitie, and the vtter ouerthrowe of their nobilitie and Senate: for
they were driuen to deliuer the chiefeſt of their citie, as pledges to the Sequani, and
to binde themſelues by oath neuer to ſeeke their releaſe or freedome, nor to implore
the aide of the people of Rome, but euer to remaine their perpetuall bondmen: Only
Diuitiacus amongst all the Hedui could neuer be brought to that thraldome, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that libertie which his reſolution afforded him, he went to Rome and boldly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his diſtreſsed caſe vnto the Senate. But in the ende, the victorie became as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
to the Sequani, as to the Hedui. For Ariouiſtus king of the Germans, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
poſsest of the third part of their Territories, and at that inſtant he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to let go another third part: for there were 24000 Germans come newely
vnto him, that were allotted to that inheritance. If this violent courſe were not ſtaied
by the oppoſition of ſome greater motion, the Galles would ſoone be driuen out of their
country, and beforced
to imitate the Heluetians in ſeeking new habitations and ſeates
of reſt, farre remote from the crueltie of the Germans. Caeſar might by his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or by the preſence of his Armie, or by the renowne of his late victorie, or
by the name of the people of Rome, keepe the Germans from tranſporting any more

her thirſtie fauourites, by ſuppreſſing the better faculties of the ſoule,
&amp; ſetting ſuch vnbrideled motions on foot, as carrie men headlong into moſt
deſperate attempts: for as it had deſerued commendation in either faction ſo

the inclinations of the weaker ſtates; ſo was it moſt odious in the Sequani, to call
in forraine forces to ſatisfie the appetite of their vntempered humor, and in the

it is, to make a ſtranger a ſtickler in a quarrell which ciuill diſſention hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

did vndertake a warre of that conſequence, and put in ieopardie the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Prouince, or what other intereſt the Romans had in Gallia. Wherein
we are to vnderſtand, that when the ſtate of Rome did allot the gouernment of
any Prouince to a Proconſull, they did likewiſe recommend vnto him the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
managing of ſuch accidents, as might any way concerne the good of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.
For conſidering that ſuch cauſes as may trouble a well ordered gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

ſafetie of the Prouince: And this againe with Ariouiſtus, leaſt the Germans
ſhould ſo multiplie in Gallia, that the Prouince it ſelfe might at length bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.
Neither had their Generals authoritie onely to vndertake theſe wars,
but the abſolute diſpoſition alſo of the whole courſe thereof, whether it were to

had required Caeſars aſsiſtance, he would haue furthered them
with his owne preſence. And he thought it as reaſonable that if
it were in his meanes to pleaſure the Romans, Caeſar ought not
to thinke much of the like labour: for his owne part, he durſt not
come into thoſe quarters without an Armie, neither could he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
an Armie without great charge. The thing that he moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at was, what the Romans had to doe in that part of Gallia, which the law
of Armes had made his inheritance. Vpon the returne of this meſsage, Caeſar framed
a ſecond embaſſage, the purport whereof caried this ſenſe: For as much as he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
the honour wherewith the people of Rome had beautified his beſt dignitie (for
in Caeſars Conſulſhip by that controlling authoritie of their Empire, they had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
to eſteeme of him as a king in his dominions, and as a friend vnto their state)
that he diſdained to admit of a Parlee concerning the common good: let him knowe
that theſe were the thinges which he required to be performed by him. Firſt that he
ſhould not ſuffer any more ſauage troupes of the Germans to be tranſported ouer the
Rheine into Gallia: ſecondly, that he ſhould deliuer vp thoſe Hoſtages which he had
from the Hedui and Sequani, and ſhould ceaſe to moleſt them with further iniuries.
Theſe things if he did performe, Caeſar would aſſure him of a gratefull acceptation, in
the behalfe of the people of Rome: otherwiſe, for as much as he himſelfe was Proconſull
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22240:23"/>
of the Prouince in Gallia, his charge extended by the ſame commiſsion to the defence
of their aſſociates and friendes; and therefore he would not neglect the iniurie of the
Hedui.</p>
               <p>To theſe mandates Ariouiſtus thus anſwered: the lawe of Armes kept this tenure
among all nations, that a conquerour might gouerne a ſubdued people according as
he thought beſt for his owne ſafetie. The people of Rome did not direct the courſe of
their gouernment by another mans preſcript, but by their owne arbitrement: and as
he had not directed the Romans, ſo ought not they to hinder the courſe of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
The Hedui hauing tried the fortune of the war, and hauing hazarded their life
and libertie in the caſualtie of many battels, were by right become ſtipendarie to his
Empire, whoſe Hoſtages he would retaine according to the couenants by which they
made their peace. If Caeſar would needes vndertake that quarell; let him know that
no man euer contended with Ariouiſtus, but to his owne deſtruction. Trie when hee
would, he ſhould find what valour conſisted in the Germans, that for 14 yeares ſpace
were neuer couered with any other roofe then the Heauens.</p>

tearmes of mildneſſe and pleaſing accent, and that which is rudely
deliuered, and dependeth rather vpon the plainneſſe of the proiect, then ſuted
with wordes fit for perſwaſion. For that which Ariouiſtus alleadged, to make
good his intereſt in Gallia, was as conſonant to reaſon, as any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
vrged by Caeſar. But as the Lacedemonian ſaid of one, that he ſpake the
truth otherwiſe then it ſhould be ſpoken: ſo it may be ſaid of Ariouiſtus anſwere,
that it wanted that ſweeting humanitie which giueth credit to veritie it ſelfe; for
as much as it proceedeth from a well tempered ſpirit, wherein no turbulent
paſſion ſeemeth to controll the force of reaſon, nor hinder the ſentence of true
iudgment; but rather ſeaſoning her conceptions with humilitie, doth couertly

that were come vnto the riuer Rhene to ſeeke a paſsage into Gallia, conducted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua

of preuention to conſiſt in celerity, leaſt the difficultie of reſiſting ſhould grow greater,
when thoſe newe forces of the Sueui were ioyned with that power which was alreadie

with all his forces was going to take in Beſanſon, and that he was three daies
iourney on his waie alreadie. Caeſar knowing how much it imported him to preuent

he that commanded it might prolong the warre at his owne pleaſure, being incircled
with the riuer<note n="*" place="margin">Le doux.</note> Alduabis, excepting a ſmall ſpace of 600 foote, which was fortified

Armie was ſurpriſed with ſuch an extraordinarie feare, that their mindes were not a
little troubled therewith. For the Romans enquiring of the Galles and marchant-men,
concerning the quality of the Germans, vnderſtood that they were men of a huge
ſtature, of courage inuincible, and of great practiſe and experience in feates of Armes:
Whereof the Galles had oftentimes made triall, for when they incountred them they
were not able to indure ſo much as the ſternenes of their countenance, or the fearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

of his men was wonderfullie appalled. The feare began among the Tribunes, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and ſuch other as accompanied Caeſar in this iourney, and had ſmall or no skill in
matter of warre, theſe men faining ſome one excuſe, and ſome an other of verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

aſſiſt that place which giueth life and motion to all the reſt. In this chaos and
confuſion of Humors and ſpirits, when the multiplicitie of faculties (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
require an ordinate diſtinction in their ſeruice, and by the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſhould be diſpoſed into ſeuerall inſtruments, and be dilated throughout the
body) are thus blended confuſedly together, the conceptions of the minde,
which preſently riſe from theſe aduertiſements, are ſuddenly choaked with the
diſordered mixture of ſo many ſeuerall properties, and are ſtifled as it were in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22240:25"/>
the throng, before they can be tranſported to our iudgment, or examined by
reaſon, for want of that ordinate vniformitie of place which nature requireth
in the powers of the minde. And hence proceedeth that amazedneſſe and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which ſo daunteth the hearts of men when they are taken with this
paſſion, that becauſe the ſoule giueth no counſell, the body can afford no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ſtandeth frozen through the extremitie of the perturbation, benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in ſenſe, and forſaken of the ſpirits. So we read that Theophilus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in an ouerthrow which hee had giuen him by the Hagerans, was ſtroken
with ſuch an exceſſiue feare, that he could not betake himſelfe to flight, <hi>Adeo
pauor etiam auxilia formidat,</hi> vntill one of his chiefe commanders ſhaking him
by the ſhoulder, as though he were to awake him out of a deepe ſleepe, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with preſent death if he would not preuent the ruine of the Empire, by
vſing that meanes, which was only left for his ſafetie.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if in that turbulent conſiſtorie, the ſpirits chance diſtinctly to receiue
any apprehenſion proceeding from the forging facultie of the ſoule, they carie
it preſently to execution before it be examined by reaſon, and follow the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with ſuch vehemencie, that they leaue no place for better aduice and reknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.
And this is the cauſe that oftentimes through extremitie of feare to
auoide one euill we run headlong into a worſe, and finde a greater danger in the
meanes we vſe to auoide a leſſe, becauſe reaſon did not firſt trie the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before it was deliuered to externall agents. And ſo we finde in the battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Germanicus and the Almains, that two groſſe troupes of ſouldiers were
driuen into ſuch an extaſie of feare, that taking contrarie courſes to auoide one
and the ſame danger, they eihther of them fled to that place, which the other had
quitted: neither could they bee aduiſed by each others flight, that the places
which they ſought after afforded them no remedie.</p>
                  <p>And albeit reaſon be called to counſell, when a parlee is ſummoned of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
yet it beareth ſo ſmall a ſway in the conſultation, that the will of it ſelfe
concludeth to betraie vertue to diſhonour; and ſo to purchaſe peace with the
loſſe of the ſoules chiefeſt treaſure: which ought euer to be eſtimated at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rate, then any other happineſſe which can betide the minde. For among all
the ſenſible thinges of this world, there is no creature that hath ſuch a confuſed
feare, or is more amazed therewith, then man is: neither is there anie miſerie
greater, or any bondage more ſhamefull, ſeruile, or vile, then this which maketh
men very abiects, of all other creatures, to redeeme the euill which the danger
threatneth: and then doth ſhame follow after ſo baſe a part, and aggrauatethe
burthen of the ſinne with loathſome diſgrace, and penitent diſcontentment, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
oftentimes aloes to wormewood, and making the end grieuouſer then the
beginning. And thus doth danger breed feare, and feare yeeldeth to diſhonour,
and diſhonour bringeth ſhame, and ſhame being alwaies mingled with wrath
and anger, reuengeth it ſelfe vpon it ſelfe, and bringeth more perill then the firſt
danger could threaten. Wherby it appeareth, that as the affections of the mind
are bred one of another: ſo on the contrarie part, ſome are bridled and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by others; for as enuie, hatred and anger, riſe oftentimes of loue; ſo is ioie
leſſened with griefe, enuie with mercie, and feare with ſhame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:22240:25"/>
But for as much as all ſuch perturbations proceede of ignorance and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſſe,
whereby we thinke that the euill is greater then indeede it is; let
vs conſider what diſpoſition of our iudgment beſt moderateth the violent heate
of theſe affections. And firſt touching the paſſages, whereby the ſoule receiueth
her aduertiſements, as they are of diuers natures, the chiefeſt whereof are the
eie and the eare, ſo are their auiſos different in qualitie, and require a ſeuerall
conſideration to bee rightly diſcerned. The intelligence by the eie is more
certaine, then that which commeth by the way of hearing: foraſmuch as the eie
is a witnes it ſelfe of euery action, whereof it taketh notice; neither is it deceiued
in her proper obiect: and therfore the iudgment is not much troubled, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
definitiuely how great or how ſmall the danger is, when the relations carie
alwaies that certainty. And albeit the eare in like manner be not deceiued in
her proper obiect, for it faithfully giueth vp that ſenſe, which ſound hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vnto it: yet for as much as the fantaſie hath greater ſcope to coine her
vaine conceptions, in regard of the abſence of the action, it is neceſſarie that
the diſcourſing facultie be called for an aſſiſtant before the iudgment can truly
determine: and then it will appeare, that the truth doth not alwaies anſwere the
report which is made thereof, in as much as diſeaſed ſpirits will not ſticke to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
or qualifie relations, according to the key wherein they themſelues are tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And therefore this firſt commeth to bee conſidered of in all ſuch violent
commotions, by which of theſe two ſenſes the firſt intelligence was receiued.
But concerning the iudgment it ſelfe this is moſt certaine, that the more it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the corruptions of the fleſh, the more violent are the affections of
the ſoule: And againe, the purer the iudgment is, and the higher it is lifted vppe
from earthly natures, being no further intereſſed therein, then to holde a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of well doing, the fewer and lighter are the affections, which trouble and
moleſt it; for then it better diſcerneth the truth and falſehood, good or euil that
is in thinges.</p>
                  <p>To redreſſe this inconuenience, Caeſar betooke himſelfe to the fitteſt &amp; moſt

downe a vſurping paſſion which had ſo troubled the gouernment of the ſoule;
recalling it to the meane of true reſolution, which was to moderat audacity with
warines, but not to choake valour with beaſtly cowardice: for theſe Oratorie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

they framed the inward habite of the minde (being the fountaine and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

inquiſitiue as to imagine to himſelfe, whither and vpon what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

of Caeſars Conſulſhippe, moſt earneſtly ſued for the friendſhip of

he ſhould ſo vnaduiſedly goe backe from his duety? For his owne part he was verelie
perſwaded, that if Ariouiſtus once knew his demandes, and vnderſtood the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
offers that he would make him, that he would not eaſily reiect his friendſhip, nor
the fauour of the people of Rome. But if he were ſo madde, as to make warre vpon
them, why ſhould they be affraid of him? or why ſhould they deſpaire either of their
owne proweſse, or of Caeſars circumſpectneſse? For if it came to that point, the enemie
that they were to incounter, had beene tried what he could doe twiſe before. Firſt, in
their fathers daies, when the<note n="*" place="margin">Cimbri, a nation came out of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie and droue out the Aduatici and are now the Zelanders. Teutoni, Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mans.</note> Cimbri and the Teutoni were vanquiſhed by Marius;
and now of late againe in Italie, at the inſurrection of the bondmen, who were not a
little furthered through the practiſe &amp; diſcipline which they receiued of the Romans,
whereby it might be diſcerned how good a thing it is to be conſtant and reſolute: in
as much as whom for a time they feared without cauſe being naked and vnarmed, the
ſame men afterwardes (although well armed and Conquerors withall) they nobly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame.
And to be ſhort, theſe were no other Germans, then thoſe whom the Helue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
had vanquiſhed in diuers conflicts, not onely in their owne country where the
Heluetians dwelt themſelues, but alſo euen at home at their owne dores; and yet the
ſame Heluetians were not able to make their partie good againſt our Armies. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Galles, they were ouercome more by cunning &amp; pollicie, then by force; which
although it tooke place againſt ſauage and vnskilfull people, yet was not Ariouiſtus ſo
ſimple as to thinke that he could enſnare our Armies with the like ſubtilties. As for
thoſe that fained the cauſe of their feare to be the difficultie of prouiſion of corne, and
the dangerouſneſse of the way, they tooke more vpon them then became their place, in
preſuming to teach their Generall what he had to doe, as if he had not knowne what
pertained to his duty. The Sequani and Lingones had vndertooke that charge, and
what the waies were, ſhould ſhortly be ſeene: Whereas it was reported that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
would not obey his mandates, nor aduance their ſtandarts, he little eſteemed it;
for he was well aſſured, that if an Armie refuſed to be obedient to their Generall, it
was either becauſe he was thought vnfortunate in his enterpriſes; or els for that hee
was notoriouſly conuicted of Auarice: but the whole courſe of his life ſhould witneſse
his innocencie, and the ouerthrow of the Heluetians his happines. And therefore that
which he was minded to haue put off for a longer time, he would now put in execution
out of hand: for the night following at the fourth watch he would diſlodge from thence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22240:26"/>
that without further delay he might vnderſtand, whether ſhame and reſpect of dutie
would preuaile more with them, then feare and cowardice. And though he wist that
no man els would follow him: yet notwithſtanding he would go with the tenth legion
alone, of which he doubted nothing, and would accept it as the chiefe band and guard
of his perſon. Vpon the making of his ſpeech, the mindes of all men were wonderfully
changed: for it bred in euery one a great alacritie and deſire to fight: neither did the
tenth legion forget to giue him thankes by their Tribunes, for the good opinion he had

regard of the Romans, being ſuperiour to the Heluetians that had
oftentimes ouerthrowen the Germans; he ſtrengtheneth the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the aduantage of the place, and ſaith that the Heluetians
had put them to the worſt, not onely where the Heluetians dwelt themſelues;
but euen in their owne country, and at home at their owne dores: as though an
enemie were charged with greater furie in the preſence of a mans own country
and deareſt friendes, then in a ſtrange and vnknowne land. This queſtion was
handled in the Roman Senate, by Fabius Maximus, and Scipio ſurnamed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,
when they ſate in counſell how to ridde their country of that ſubtile
Carthaginian, that for ſixteene yeares ſpace had fretted like a canker the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Italie, waſted the land and brought it to deſolation: ſacked their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
or alienated them from their duety, ouerthrowen their Armies, ſlaine
their Conſuls, and threatned their imperiall cittie with ruine and deſtruction.
Fabius vpon the motion to make warre in Africke, thought it agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
firſt to defend that which was their owne, before they attempted other
mens poſſeſſions: when peace was eſtabliſhed in Italy, then let warre be ſet on
foot in Africke; and firſt let them be without feare themſelues, before they went
about to terrifie others: for thoſe forces afforded little hope of victorie in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kingdome, that were not able to free their owne country from ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an enemie. Alcibiades ouerthrew the Athenian common weale with the
like couuſel: and concerning Hannibal, let them be ſure of this, that they ſhould
finde him a ſorer enemy in his owne country, then in an other kingdome. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio
on the other ſide, caried on with the honour of ſo glorious an enterpriſe,
wanted neither reaſons nor examples to impugne Fabius his authoritie: for he
ſhewed that Agathocles the Syracuſian king, being a long time afflicted with
the Punicke warre, auerted the Carthaginean from Cicily, by tranſporting his
forces into Africke: but how powerfull it was to take awaie feare, by retorting
danger vpon the oppreſſor, could there be a preſenter example then Hanniball?
There was great difference in the nature of the action, betweene the ſpoile and
waſt of a ſtrangers country, and to ſee their owne natiue country waſted with
ſword and deſtruction: <hi>plus animi eſt inferenti periculum, quam propulſanti,</hi> for he
that inuadeth an others kingdome, eaſily diſcouereth both the aduantage which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22240:27"/>
may be taken againſt the enemy, and the ſtrength whereupon he reſteth: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the variable euents of warre, many vnexpected occaſions ariſe which
preſent victory to him that is ready to take it; and many ſtrange chances ſo alter
the courſe of thinges, that no foreſight can diſcerne what may happen. With
theſe and the like remonſtrances, this queſtion of no leſſe doubt then impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
was handled by two famous and worthy Captaines, whoſe mindes as it
ſeemed, were intangled with ſuch particular affections for the preſent, as might
rather draw them to wreſt reaſon to their owne humor, then to determine in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of iudgment, vpon what ſpecialities the truth was grounded, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of their poſitions. But to leaue other commodities or diſaduantages,
which are annexed vnto either part, I will only ſet downe ſome reaſons to proue
how valour and courage may either grow or be abated, by the accidents which
riſe in a warre of that nature. And firſt this cannot be denied, the teſtimonie of
an vnfallible truth being grounded vpon the property of mans nature; that as
aduantage bringeth hope of victorie, and hope conceiueth ſuch ſpirites as vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
follow, when the thing which is hoped for, is effected; and thereby the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
becommeth hardie and reſolute in victorie: ſo on the other ſide diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and danger breede feare, and feare ſo checketh valour, and controlleth the
ſpirits, that vertue and honor giue place to diſtruſt, and yeelde vp their intereſt
to ſuch directors, as can afford nothing but diffidencie &amp; irreſolution: Neither
can it be denied, but he that ſetteth vpon an enemie in a ſtrange country, and
ſo preuenteth ſuch attemptes as might be made vpon his owne territories, hath
that aduantage which giueth life vnto action, and ſteeleth his enterpriſe with
reſolution; for beſides the commoditie of leauing when he liſt, and proceeding
as far foorth as he ſhall finde his meanes able to fortunate his attemptes; hee
knoweth that the ſtrife and controuerſie is not for his natiue country, which he
quietly enioyeth, and is reſerued at all times to entertaine him, howſoeuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ſhal fauour his deſſignes: but for a ſtrangers kingdome which his ambition
thirſteth after; wherein for as much as the ritches and wealth of that ſtate are
laide before them as the recompence of their labour, beſides the honour which
is atchieued thereby, euerie mans valour ſoareth at a high pitch, and their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
is increaſed without any trouble or diſturbance of the other faculties of the
minde. But when a Prince ſhall be aſſaulted in his owne kingdome, and in the
ſight of his ſubiectes haue his land conſumed with ruine and deſtruction: the
danger will ſo diſturbe the powers of the ſoule, that through the turbulent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of the weaker partes, the better faculties will loſe their prerogatiue of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing
how the enemy may be beſt reſiſted; when as euery man ſhal apprehend
the terrour of the danger, and few or none conceiue the true meanes to auoide
it. And albeit the preſence of ſuch thinges as are deareſt to his ſoule, as the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
and reſpect of aged parents, the tender affection towards wife and children,
are ſufficient to raiſe valour to the higheſt point of reſolution: yet the motiues
are of ſuch waight as will rather make them diffident of their owne worth as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
to maintaine ſo great a cauſe, then hold them in that key which true
honour affecteth: for as much as the terrour and feare of ſo great a danger
will preſent a greater meaſure of woes to their minde, then the hope of victory
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22240:28"/>
can afforde them ioy. Hence therefore groweth the difference betweene him,
that ſeeketh to maintaine that eſtate which he hath in poſſeſſion by force of
Armes; and an other, that ſeeketh to increaſe his meanes by valour. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is preſented with the danger of looſing all his eſtate, which affrighteth and
troubleth, hauing no other reward propounded vnto him; and the other loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vpon the aduantage, which he gaineth by ouercomming; which much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
his valour, without any loſſe or diſaduantage, if he chance to be put to
the worſt. And therefore there is alwaies great ods betweene him that hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
loſt his goods, and is by that meanes become deſperate, hauing nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to looſe; and another, that yet keepeth his ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but is in danger to looſe
it: for feare will ſo diſmay his mind, that he will rather diſtruſt his owne ability,
then entertaine a reſolution of valour. To proue this, we neede not ſeeke other
examples, then thoſe imperiall cities, in whoſe cauſe this controuerſie was firſt
moued. For when Hanniball was come into Italy and had defeated Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
the Conſull at Trebeas, the Romans were driuen into ſuch an extaſie of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that they beleeued verely that the enemie was then comming to aſſault
the citie; neither had they any hope or aid in themſelues to keepe or defend the
ſame. On the other ſide, Scipio was no ſooner landed in Africke, but there was
ſuch a tumult in Carthage, as though the citie had been alreadie taken: neither
could the opinion of victory, which Hanniball by a conquering Armie in Italy
had confirmed for ſixteene yeares together, preuaile in the apprehenſion of ſo
imminent a danger: And then that which Fabius borowed of nature to teach the
Romans (that firſt men ought to defend their own, before they ſeeke other mens
poſſeſſions) was carefully followed by the Carthaginians: for with all ſpeed they
ſent for Hanniball out of Italy, to be their Champion againſt young Scipio. If
therfore other things be correſpondent, as there are many other particularities
concerning the power and ſtrength of either nation to be conſidered, I take it
much better for a Prince to inuade an enemie in his owne country, then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him at home in his owne kingdome.</p>

that they neuer doubted nor feared, no nor ſo much as
thought that it belonged to them, to determine any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the courſe of the warre, but that it was onely left to their
Emperour; their purgation accepted, and good inſtructions being
taken by Diuitiacus, in the fourth watch he marched forward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the purport of his former ſpeech. The ſeuenth day as he continued on his
iourney, his eſpialles brought him word, that Ariouiſtus with all his forces was within
24 miles of that place: who aſsoone as he vnderſtood of Caeſars comming, ſent embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
vnto him, declaring that foraſmuch as he was come ſomewhat nearer, and that
he might doe it without danger, he was content to admit of a parlee, vpon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Caeſar would bring no footmen to the meeting (for he feared to be ſurpriſed
by treacherie) but onely horſemen, and in that ſort he would meete him. Caeſar accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the condition, hoping at length that he would harken to reaſon and deſist from
wilfull obſtinacie: and becauſe he durſt not commit himſelfe to the French horſemen,
he thought it beſt to take their horſes, and to ſet the ſouldiers of the tenth legion vpon
them, that if he ſtood in neede he might haue a faithfull guard of his friendes about
him. There was a great and open plaine, and in the middeſt thereof a riſing mount,
and thither they came to the parlee: the legion which Caeſar had brought with him on
horſebacke, he placed 200 paces from the ſaid mount; and likewiſe the horſemen of
Ariouiſtus ſtood in the ſame diſtance: Ariouiſtus requeſted that they might talke on
horſebacke, and bring each of them ten perſons to the parlee. Their expoſtulations were
the ſame in effect, with thoſe meſsages which were carried betweene them by embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours.
Much vnkindnes tooke by Caeſar, conſidering the friendſhip which the Romans
had ſhewed vnto Ariouiſtus, that he would not vouchſafe to treate with them: and on
the other ſide as great iniurie conceiued by him, foraſmuch as the law of nations gaue
no ſuch prerogatiue to any one people that they ſhould challenge in other countries by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22240:29"/>
deſert: but that generally it had giuen dominion to valour, and kingdomes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
armies. But while the treatiſe thus continued, it was told Caeſar that Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouiſtus
his horſemen were comming neerer vnto the mount, and that they began to
skirmiſh with his ſoldiours; whereupon Caeſar brake off the treatie, and withdrewe
himſelfe to his men, commaunding them that they ſhoulde not caſt a weapon at the
enemie: for although hee perceiued that without peril of his legion hee might haue
incountered with Ariouiſtus men, yet he would not giue occaſion by putting them
to flight, to haue it ſaid, that he had entrapped them vnder pretence of parlee. At his
returne, when it was reported to the common ſoldiors, howe arrogantly Ariouiſtus
had caried himſelfe in the treaty, forbidding the Romaines all Gallia, and that his
men of armes did offer to aſſault the legion, inſomuch that the treaty was thereby
broken off; the ſoldiors were more deſirous of battell then before, and by theſe degrees
they obtained it. Two daies after Ariouiſtus ſent againe to Caeſar, to haue thoſe
thinges perfited which were begun in the treaty. Caeſar thought it not good to make
any further meeting in his owne perſon, and the rather becauſe the Germaines had
no ſtaie of themſelues the daie before, but they threwe dartes and ſtones at his men;
and whome ſoeuer of his men hee ſhould ſend vnto him ſhould go into great danger,
as caſt into the hands of a ſauage people. The beſt way he could thinke of was, to ſend
Valerius Procillus, a well accompliſht yong man, that ſpake the French toung well,
and had no waie offended the Germaines, and with him he ſent Marcus Titius, a
man well knowne to Ariouiſtus, vſing ſometimes to reſort as a gueſt vnto him: To
theſe he gaue in charge that they ſhould diligentlie marke, and iuſtlie report vnto
him what Ariouiſtus ſaid; But aſſoone as Ariouiſtus ſawe them in his campe, hee
cried out to them in the preſence of his army, asking them what they ahd to do there,
and whether they came as ſpies? And as they went about to make their anſwere, he
would not heare them, but cauſed them to be caſt into irons. The ſame day he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and incamped vnder the ſide of a hill 6. miles from Caeſars campe; the next day
he came two miles beyond Caeſar, neerer to the middeſt of Gallia, of purpoſe to cut off
all corne and conuoie as ſhould be ſent vnto the Romains, by the Hedui and Sequani.
From that day forwarde, by the ſpace of fiue daies togither, Caeſar imbattailed his
men before his campe, to the intent that if Ariouistus pleaſed to giue battell, he
might haue libertie when hee would; but Ariouiſtus all this while kept his armie
within his campe, and daily ſent out his horſemen to skirmiſh with the Romaines.
This was the manner of fighting which the Germaines had practiſed: there were
6000. horſemen, and as many ſtrong and nimble footmen, whom the horſemen had
ſelected out of the whole hoſt, euerie man one for his ſafegard; theſe they had alwaies
at hand with them in battell, and vnto theſe they reſorted for ſuccour; if the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were ouercharged, theſe euer ſtept into helpe them, if anie one were wounded
and vnhorſed, they ſtood about him and ſuccoured him: if the matter required either
to aduenture forward, or to retire ſpeedilie backe againe; their ſwiftneſſe was ſuch
through continuall exerciſe, that hanging on the horſe maine by the one hand, they
would run as faſt as the horſes.</p>

that theſe footmen in the incounter caſt themſelues into one bodie,
and ſo charging the enemy aſſiſted the horſemen. But the circumſtances of this
place, and of others which I wil alleage to this purpoſe, plainly euince that theſe
footemen were mingled indifferently amongſt the horſemen, to aſſiſt euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man as his fortune and occaſion required: and therfore the choiſe of
theſe footemen, was permitted to the horſemen, in whoſe ſeruice they were to
be imploied, that euery man might take his friend in whom he repoſed greateſt
confidence: When they were ouercharged theſe ſtept in to helpe them; if anie
man were wounded or vnhorſed he had his footeman ready to aſſiſt him; and
when they were to go vpon any ſpeedie ſeruice, or ſuddainly to retire vpon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
they ſtaied themſelues vpon the maine of the horſes with one hande,
and ſo ran as faſt as the horſemen could go: which ſeruices they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie
haue performed without confuſion and diſorder, if the footemen had not
ſeuerally attended vpon them, according to the affection ſpecified in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

in the aide of their owne horſemen vpon any neceſſity, not ſo much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their ſeruice vppon the enemie, as the aſsiſtance of their horſemen. But
the Romains had long before practiſed the ſame Arte to a more effectuall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
namely as a principall remedy not onely to reſiſt, but to defeat far greater
troupes of horſe, then the enemy was able to oppoſe againſt them. Wherof the
moſt ancient memory which hiſtory mentioneth, is recorded by Liuie in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
punicke war, at the ſiege of Capua, vnder the regiment of Quintus Fului<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
the Conſul: where it is ſaid, that in all their conflicts, as the Romaine legions
returned with the better; ſo their caualry was alwaies put to the worſt: &amp; therfore
they inuented this means to make that good by Art which was wanting in force.
Out of the whole army were taken the choiſeſt young men, both for ſtrength &amp;
agilitie, and to them were giuen little round bucklers, and ſeuen darts apeece in
ſteed of their other weapons; theſe ſoldiours practiſed to ride behind the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ſpeedily to light from the horſes at a watchword giuen, &amp; ſo to charge
the enemy on foot: And when by exerciſe they were made ſo expert that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty
of the inuention no whit affrighted them, the Romaine horſemen went
forth to incounter with the enemy, euery man carying his foot ſoldior behinde
him, who at the encounter ſuddainly alightning charged vpon the enemy with
ſuch a fury, that they followed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſlaughter to the gates of Capua: And hence
ſaith Liuie grew the firſt inſtitution of the Velites, which euer after that time
were inrolled with the legions. The author of this ſtrategem is ſaid to be one Q.
Nauius a Centurion, &amp; was honorably rewarded by Fuluius the conſull for the
ſame. Saluſt, in the hiſtory of Iugurth, ſaieth, that Marius mingled the Velites
with the Caualrie of the aſſociates, <hi>vt quacunque inuaderent equitatus hoſtium
propulſarent.</hi> The like practiſe was vſed by Caeſar, as appeareth in the thirde
booke of the Ciuill warre; ſauing that inſteed of the velites, hee mingled with
his horſemen 400. of the luſtieſt of his legionarie ſoldiours, to reſiſt the caualrie
of Pompei, while the reſt of his armie paſſed ouer the riuer Genuſum, after the
ouerthrow he had at Dirrachium, <hi>qui tantum profecere,</hi> ſaith the text; <hi>Vt eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri

buckler;<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de excid.</note> but afterwards, they vſed the furniture of the Grecians, which Ioſephus
affirmeth to bee a ſtrong launce or ſtaffe, and three or foure dartes in a quiuer
with a buckler, and a long ſword by their right ſide. The vſe of their launce was
moſt effectuall when they charged in troupe, pouldron to pouldron; and that
maner of fight afforded no meanes to intermingle footmen: but when they vſed
their dartes, euerie man got what aduantage of ground he coulde, as our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
for the moſt part do, and ſo the footemen might haue place among them:
or otherwiſe, for ſo good an aduantage, they woulde eaſilie make place for the
footmen to ſerue among them: But howſoeuer it was, it appeareth by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
howe little the Romaines feared troupes of horſe, conſidering that
the beſt meanes to defeate their horſe was by their foote companies. But to
make it more plaine, of many examples I will onely alleage two; the one out of
Liuie,<note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> to proue that the Romaine horſemen were not comparable for ſeruice to
footemen:<note place="margin">De bello A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricano.</note> the other out of Hirtius, to ſhewe the ſame effect againſt ſtrangers,
and Numidian horſemen, In the Conſulſhips of L. Valerius, and Marcus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius:
Valerius hauing fortunatelie ouerthrowne the Equi and the Volſci,
Horatius proceeded with as great courage in the warre againſt the Sabines,
wherein it happened, that in the day of battell, the Sabines reſerued 2000. of
their men to giue a freſh aſſault vpon the lefte cornet of the Romaines, as they
were in conflict, which tooke ſuch effect, that the legionarie footemen of that
cornet were forced to retreit. Which the Romaine horſemen beeing in number
600. perceiuing, and not being able with their horſe to make head againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
they preſently forſooke their horſes; and made haſte to make good the
place on foote; wherein they caried themſelues ſo valiantly, that in a moment
of time they gaue the like aduantage to their footemen, againſt the Sabines;
and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betooke themſelues againe to their horſes, to purſue the enemy in chaſe
as they fled. For the ſecond point. The Numidians, as Caeſar witneſſeth, were
the beſt horſemen that euer hee met with, and vſed the ſame Arte as the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
did, mingling among them light armed footemen: an Ambuſcado of
theſe Numidians charging the legions vpon a ſuddaine, the hiſtory ſaieth, that
<hi>primo impetu legionis Equitatus &amp; leuis armatura hoſtium, nullo negotio, loco pulſa
&amp; deiecta eſt de colle.</hi> And as they ſometimes retired, and ſometimes charged
vpon the rerewarde of the armie, according to the manner of the Numidian
fight; the hiſtorie ſaieth, <hi>Caeſariani interim, non amplius tres aut quatuor milites
veterani ſi ſe conuertiſsent &amp; pila viribus contorta in Numidas infeſtos conieciſsent,
amplius duorum millium ad vnum terga vertebant.</hi> So that to free himſelfe of this
inconuenience, he tooke his horſemen out of the rereward, and placed his legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there, <hi>ita vim hoſtium per legionarium militem commodius ſuſtinebat.</hi> And
euer as he marched hee cauſed 300. ſoldiours of euerie legion to bee free and

he ſhall finde it to be chiefely the worke of the Roman pile, an vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
weapon, and the terrour of horſemen, eſpecially when they were caſt with
the aduantage of the place, and fell ſo thicke, that there was no meanes to auoid
them.</p>
                  <p>But to make it plaine, that any light armed footmen could better make head
againſt a troupe of horſe, then the Caualry of their owne partie, although they
bare but the ſame weapons: Let vs conſider how nimble and readie they were,
that fought on foote, either to take an aduantage, or to ſhunne and auoide anie
danger; caſting their darts with farre greater ſtrength and more certaintie, then
the horſemen could doe. For as the force of all the engines of olde time, as the
<hi>Baliſtae, Catapultae</hi> and <hi>Tolenones,</hi> proceedeth from that ſtabilitie and reſting
Center, which nature affordeth as the onely ſtrength and life of the engine; ſo
what force ſoeuer a man maketh, muſt principally proceede from that firmenes
&amp; ſtay, which nature by the earth or ſome other vnmoueable reſt, giueth to the
body, from whence it taketh more or leſſe ſtrength, according to the violence
which it performeth; as he that lifteth vp a waight from the ground, by ſo much
treadeth heauier vpon the earth, by how much the thing is heauier then his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
The footmen therfore, hauing a ſurer ſtaie to counterpoiſe their forced mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the horſemen had, caſt their dartes with greater violence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with more certainty.</p>

legions into a triple battell, he marched towardes the campe of
Ariouiſtus. And then at length were the Germans conſtrained
to bring out their power, ſetting euery tribe &amp; people by it ſelfe, in a like diſtance and
order of battell, and inuironing their whole Armie with their cartes and cariage,
that there might be no hope at all left to ſaue any man by flight, that durſt not abide
the fortune of the battell: In theſe chariots they placed their women, that they by their
outſtretched handes and teares mouing pitty, might implore the ſouldiers as they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
by courſe into the battell, not to deliuer them, the authors of their life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
into the bondage and thraldome of the Romans. Caeſar aſsigned to euerie legion
a Legate and a Queſtor, that euerie man might haue an eie witneſſe of his valour:
and he himſelfe began the battell with the right cornet; for as much as he perceiued
that part of Ariouiſtus Armie to be the weakeſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Romaines had foure formes of the front of their battell, the firſt
was called <hi>Acies recta,</hi> when neither the cornets nor the battell was
aduanced one before another, but were all caried in a right line, and
made a ſtraight front; and this was their moſt vſuall manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond forme of the front was called <hi>obliqua,</hi> when as one of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
was aduanced neerer vnto the enemy then the reſt, to beginne the battell:
and this was commonly as Vegetius noteth, the right cornet: for the right cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of an army had great aduantage againſt the left of the enemies, in regarde
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22240:32"/>
of their weapons and furniture: But Caeſar did it in this place, becauſe hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
that the enemy was weakeſt in that part; following a maxime of great
authoritie, that the weakeſt part of an enemie is in the beginning to be charged
with the ſtrength of an army: for ſo fauorable are mens iudgementes to that
which is already happened, that the ſequell of euery action dependeth for the
moſt part vpon the beginning, <hi>Dimidium facti qui bene caepit habet,</hi> (ſaith a Poet)
and not without great reaſon, ſo forcible continually is the beginning, and ſo
connexed to the ſequel by the nature of a precedent cauſe, that the ende muſt
needes erre from the common courſe, when it doth not participate of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
which was in the beginning. Neither can there be any good ende without a
good beginning: for although the beginning bee oftentimes diſaſtrous and
vnlucky, and the end fortunate and happie, yet before it came to that end there
was a fortunate beginning: for the bad beginning was not the beginning of
a good, but of an euill end. And therefore that his men might foreſee a happy
ende in a good beginning, it behooued him with the beſt of his armie to aſſault
the weakeſt part of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The third forme of the front is called <hi>Sinuata,</hi> when both the cornets are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
forward, and the battell ſtandeth backwarde off from the enemy, after
the faſhion of a halfe moone. Scipio vſed it in Spaine, hauing obſerued ſome
daies before, that the enemy continually ſo diſpoſed of the battell, that his beſt
ſoldiours were alwaies in the midſt; and therefore Scipio put all his old ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
in the cornets, and brought them out firſt to charge vpon the weakeſt part
of the enemy, that thoſe might decide the controuerſie, before the other that
were in the midſt could come to fight.</p>
                  <p>The laſt forme is called <hi>gibboſa</hi> or <hi>gibbera Acies,</hi> when the battel is aduanced,
and the two cornets lag behinde. This forme did Haniball vſe in the battell of
Cannas, but with this Art, that he ſtrengthened his two cornets with the beſt of
his ſoldiours, and placed his weakeſt in the middeſt, that the Romaines follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the retreit of the battell, which was eaſily repeld, might be incloſed on each

of the Germaines; and the enemie on the other ſide returned ſo
ſpeedie a counterbuffe, that the legions had no time to caſt their
Piles, and therefore they ſpeedilie betooke them to their ſwordes.
But the Germaines putting themſelues according to their manner into a Phalanx,
receiued the force of their ſwords, without any daunger or loſſe at all. In the battell
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22240:33"/>
there were many legionarie ſouldiers, that were ſeene to keepe vpon the phalanx, &amp; to
pull vp with their hands the targets that couered it, and ſo to wound &amp; kil thoſe that

of the enemy, was ouerthrowne &amp; put to flight. Now while the right cornet was thus
buſied, the left cornet was ouercharged with an vnequall multitude of the Germans,
which young Craſsus the Prefect of the horſemen no ſooner perceiued (hauing more
ſcope and libertie then any of the commanders that were in the battell) he ſent <hi>terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

to the ſhore, with much a doe recouered the other ſide of the Rhene, and ſo ſaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
the reſt were all ſlaine by the horſemen. As Caeſar purſued the German horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
it was his chance to light vpon Valerius Procillus, as he was drawne vp and
downe by his keepers, bound with three chaines, which accident was as gratefull to him
as the victorie it ſelfe; being ſo fortunate to recouer his familiar friend, whom the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

had three ſeuerall times caſt lots vpon his life, whether he ſhould be then burned
or repriued vnto another time; and ſtill he was ſaued by the fortune of the lots: and
Marcus Titius was found in like manner and brought vnto him. The fame of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
being caried beyond the Rhene: the Sueui that were come to the bankes of Rhene,
returned home againe, whom the inhabitants belonging to the ſaide riuer purſued,
and ſlew a great number of them. Caeſar hauing thus ended two great warres in one

of the Heluetian phalanx. Secondly, I obſerue, that Caeſar kept the olde rule
concerning their diſcipline in fight: for although the name of <hi>Triaries</hi> be not
mentioned in his hiſtorie; yet he omitted not the ſubſtance, which was, to haue
<hi>primam, ſecundam, &amp; tertiam Aciem;</hi> and that <hi>prima Acies</hi> ſhould begin the

of them, being in former times ſo generall, that there was no nation
ciuill or barbarous, but were directed in their greateſt affaires, by
the ſentence of lots. As we may not refuſe for an vndoubted truth,
that which Salomon ſaith the 16 of Prouerbs: The lots are caſt into the lap: but
the direction thereof belongeth to the Lord: Through the knowledge whereof,
Ioſua was directed to take Achan, the Mariners Ionas, and the Apoſtles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
Matthias. So whether the heathen and barbarous people, whoſe blindnes
in the way of truth could direct them no further then to ſenceleſſe ſuperſtition,
and put them in minde of a dutie which they owed; but could not tell them what
it was, nor how to be performed: whether theſe I ſay, were perſwaded that there
was any ſupernaturall power in their lotteries, which directed the action to the
decree of deſtenie, and as the Gods would haue it, it remaineth doubtfull. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle
the wiſeſt of the heathen, concerning things naturall, nameth that euent
caſuall, or proceeding from fortune; of which the reaſon of man could aſſigne
no cauſe, or (as he ſaith) which hath no cauſe: So that whatſoeuer happened in
any action beſides the intent of the agent and workeman, was tearmed an effect
of fortune, or chance of habnab. For all other effects which depended vpon a
certaine and definite cauſe, were neceſſarily produced; and therefore could not
be caſuall or ſubiect to the inconſtancie of chance: And becauſe manie and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
ſuch chances daily happened, which like <hi>terrae filij</hi> had no father, and could
not be warranted, as lawfull children, either to nature or to reaſon, by the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of an efficient cauſe, they reduced them all to the power of fortune; as the
principall efficient and ſoueraigne Motor of all ſuch vnexpected euents, that is,
they made nothing elſe the gouerneſſe, and directreſſe of many things: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
grew to ſuch credit amongſt men, that it ſurpaſſed in dignity all naturall
cauſes, and was deified with celeſtiall honour, as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Nos te facimus
fortuna deam caeloque locamus.</hi> By the prouidence of this blinde goddeſſe which
held her deity by the tenure of mens ignorance, were all caſuall actions dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and eſpecially lots; the euent whereof depended onely vpon her pleaſure
and decree: neither could their direction be aſſigned to any other power, for
then their nature had been altered from chance to certainty, &amp; the euent could
not haue been called <hi>Sors,</hi> but muſt haue been reputed in the order of neceſſary
effects, whereof diſcourſe of reaſon acknowledgeth a certaine foregoing cauſe.
Whereby we ſee vpon how weake an axletree, the greateſt motions of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

Rome directed the maine courſe of her gouernment, by the fortune of this
mocke deſtiny. For although their Conſuls and Tribunes were elected by the
people, who pleaſed their own fancie with the free choice of their commanders,
and ſuted their obedience with a well liking authority: yet the publike affaires,
which each Conſull was ſeuerally to manage, was ſhared out by lots. For if an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
were entered into their confines to depopulate and waſt their territories,
the lots aſſigned this Conſull for the gouernment of the cittie; and the other to
command the legions, and to manage the war. If forces were to be ſent into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
prouinces and againſt ſeuerall enemies, neither the Senate nor the people
could giue to either Conſull his taske: but their peculiar charges were authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by lots. If any extraordinarie action were to be done in the citie, as the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of a temple, the ſanctifying of the Capitoll after a pollution, <hi>Sors omnia
verſat,</hi> did all in all. And yet (notwithſtanding the weake foundation of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
in their Theologie &amp; deepeſt diuinitie) we may not thinke but theſe skilfull
Architectors of that abſolute gouernment, wherein vertue ioyned with true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to make an vnexampled patterne: we may not thinke I ſay, but they
foreſaw the manifold danger, which in the courſe of common actions could no
otherway be preuented, but by the vſe of lots. For when things are equally leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
betweene diuers obiects, and run with indifferencie to equall ſtations, there
muſt be ſome controlling power, to draw the current towardes one coaſt, and to
appropriate it vnto one chanell, that the order of nature be not inuerſed, nor a
well eſtabliſhed gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſturbed: So the ſtate of Rome caſting many things
with equall charge vpon her two ſoueraigne magiſtrates, which could not be
performed but by one of them; what better meanes could there be inuented to
intereſſe the one in that office and to diſcharge the other, then to appoint an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter,
whoſe decree exceeded humane reaſon? Of which it could not be ſaide
why it was ſo, but that it was ſo: for if the wiſdome of the Senat had been called
to counſell, or the voices of the people calculated to determine of the matter;
it might eaſily haue burſt out into ciuill diſcord, conſidering the often conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
between the Senat and the people, the factions of Clients, &amp; the conſtant
mutabilitie of euery mans priuate affections neceſſarily inclining vnto one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
their worth were equal &amp; by true reaſon indiſcernable; which might haue
made the one proud of that which peraduenture he had not, and caſt the other
lower then would haue well beſeemed his vertues: And therfore to cut off theſe,
with many other inconueniences, they inuented lots; which without either rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or will might decide ſuch controuerſies. By this it appeareth how little the
ancient law-makers reſpected the ground &amp; reaſon of an ordinance, ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
were great, and the vſe important to the good of the ſtate: for as they
ſaw the thing it ſelfe to be caſuall, ſo they ſaw that caſuall thinges are ſometimes
more neceſſarie, then demonſtratiue concluſions: neither ought the nature, and
ſpeculatiue conſideration of lawes and ſtatutes, belong to the common people:
but the execution and obedience thereof maketh the common weale flouriſh.

hauing receiued two eſpecial aduertiſements from the men of Rheimes, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the multitude of the enemy; and the other touching the ſingular opinion
which was generally held of their manhood: hee prouided for the firſt by perſuading
Diuitiacus the Heduan, that it much imported the whole courſe of thoſe buſineſſes,
to keepe aſunder the powre of the enemy; and to withhold their forces from making
a head, that ſo he might auoide the dange of incountering ſo great a power at one
inſtant. Which might eaſilie be brought to paſſe, if the Hedui woulde enter with a
ſtrong power into the marches of the Bellouaci, and ſacke their territories with
ſword and confuſion, which Diuitiacus promiſed to performe, and to that purpoſe he
ſpeedily returned into his country. Vpon the ſecond aduertiſement which preſented
vnto him the great valour and manhood of his enemies, he reſolued not to be too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
in giuing them battell, but firſt to proue by skirmiſhing with his horſemen what
his enemies by their proweſſe could do, and what his own men durſt doe.</p>

obſerued by prudent and graue commanders, as the ſureſt principle
whereon the true iudgment of the euent may be grounded. For if the

great incouragement to his men, when they ſawe themſelues able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match
an enemie, and knew their taske to be ſubiect to their ſtrength: Neither
did he obſerue it onely at this inſtant, but throughout the whole courſe of his
actions; for we finde that he neuer incountered any enemie, but with ſufficient
power, either in number or in valour to make head againſt them: which equality
of ſtrength, being firſt laide as a ſure foundation, he vſed his owne induſtrie and

leauing it on his backe; and did not rather attend the enemie on the

attempt to paſſe ouer? I will ſet downe the reaſons in the ſequell of
this warre, as the occurrences ſhall fall out to make them more euident. In the
meane time let vs enter into the particularitie of theſe ſixe cohortes, that wee
maie the better iudge of ſuch troupes which were imploied in the ſeruices of
this warre: but that wee may the better coniecture what number of ſouldiers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22240:36"/>
theſe ſixe cohortes did containe, it ſeemeth expedient, a little to diſcourſe of
the companies and regiments, which the Romans vſed in their Armies.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we are to vnderſtand,<note place="margin">A legion what it was. Lib. 4. De vita Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli.</note> that the greateſt and chiefeſt regiment in a
Roman Armie, was tearmed by the name of Legio: as Varro ſaith, <hi>quod legun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
milites in delectu:</hi> or as Plutarch ſpeaketh, <hi>quod lecti ex omnibus eſſent mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares;</hi>
ſo that it taketh the name Legio of the choiſe and ſelecting of the ſoldiers.
Romulus is ſaid to be the firſt author &amp; founder of theſe legions, making euerie
legion to containe 3000 ſoldiers: but ſhortly after they were augmented, as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
recordeth vnto 4000: and afterward againe from 4000 to 4200. And that
number was the common rate of a legion vntill Hanniball came into Italie,<note place="margin">Liu. lib. 22.</note> and
then it was augmented to 5000, but that proportion continued onely for that
time. And againe, when Scipio went into Africke, the legions were increaſed
to 6200 footmen, and 300 horſe. And ſhortly after the Macedonian warre, the
legions that continued in Macedonie to keepe the Prouince from rebellion,
conſiſted of 6000 footmen and 300 horſe. Out of Caeſar it cannot be gathered,
that a legion in his time did exceede the number of 5000 men; but oftentimes
it was ſhort of that number: for he himſelfe ſaith, that in this warre in Gallia his
ſoldiers were ſo waſted, that he had ſcarce 7000 men in two legions. And if we
examine that place out of the 3 of the ciuill war, where he ſaith, that in Pompei
his Armie were 110 cohorts, which amounted to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 55000 men: And
being manifeſt as well by theſe number of cohortes, as by the teſtimonie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
authors, that Pompei his Army conſiſted of 11 legions; if we deuide 55000
into 11 partes, we ſhall finde a legion to conſiſt of 5000 men. Which number
or thereabout, being generally knowne to be the vſuall rate of a legion, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
alwaies expreſſed the ſtrength of their Armie by the number of legions
that were therein: as in this warre it is ſaid, that Caeſar had eight legions, which
by this account might ariſe to 40000 men, beſides aſſociates, and ſuch as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
attended the Armie. Further we are to vnderſtand, that euery legion had
his peculiar name, by which it was knowne and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, and
that it tooke either from their order of muſter, or inrolment; as that legion
which was firſt inrolled, was called the firſt legion; and that which was ſecond in
choice, the ſecond legion; and ſo conſequently of the reſt; and ſo we reade in
this hiſtorie, the ſeuenth, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the eleuenth and
twelfth legion: or otherwiſe from the place of their warfare, and ſo we read of
<hi>legiones Germanicae, Panonicae, Britannicae,</hi> and ſuch others; and ſometime of their
Generall, as <hi>Auguſta, Claudia, Vitellianae, legiones,</hi> and ſo forth. Or to conclude,
from ſome accident or qualitie,<note place="margin">Tacitus 3. hiſt.</note> as <hi>Rapax, Victrix, Fulminifera</hi> and ſuch like.
And this much of the name and number of a legion, which I muſt neceſſarilie
diſtinguiſh into diuers kindes of ſouldiers, according to the firſt inſtitution of
the olde Romans, and the continuall obſeruation thereof vnto the decay of the
Empire, before I come to the deſcription of theſe ſmaller partes, whereof a legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was compounded.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore we are to vnderſtand, that after the Conſuls had made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
choiſe and ſworne the ſouldiers,<note place="margin">Velites.</note> the Tribunes choſe out the youngeſt
and pooreſt of all the reſt, and called them by the name of Velites. Their place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22240:37"/>
in regard of the other ſouldiers was both baſe &amp; diſhonorable: not only becauſe
they fought a farre off, and were lightly armed; but alſo in regard they were
commonly expoſed to the enemy, as our forelorne hopes are. Hauing choſen
out a competent number for this kinde, they proceeded to the choiſe of them
which they called Haſtati,<note place="margin">Haſtati.</note> a degree aboue the Velites, both in age and wealth,
and tearmed them by the name of Haſtati; foraſmuch as at their firſt inſtitution
they fought with a kind of Iauelin, which the Romaines called Haſta: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Polybius his time they vſed Piles; notwithſtanding their ancient name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
vnto the latter time of the Empire.<note place="margin">Principes.</note> The third choiſe which they made
was of the ſtrongeſt and luſtieſt bodied men, who for the prime of their age
were called Principes; the reſt that remained were named Triarij, as Varro ſaith,
<hi>Quod tertio ordine extremis ſubſidio deponuntur:</hi> Theſe were alwaies the eldeſt
and beſt experienced men, and were placed in the third diuiſion of the battell,
as the laſt helpe and refuge in all extremity.<note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> Polybius ſaith, that in his time the
Velites, Haſtati, and Principes, did conſiſt of 1200 men a peece; and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arij
neuer exceeded the number of 600. although the generall number of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
were augmented:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de mil. Rom.</note> whereof Lypſius allegeth theſe reaſons. Firſt bicauſe theſe
Triarij conſiſted of the beſt of the ſoldiors, and ſo might counteruaile a greater
number in good worth and valour. Secondly, it ſeldome came to buckle with
the enemy, but when the controuerſie grewe very doubtfull. Laſtly, wee may
well coniecture that the voluntaries and extraordinarie folowers, ranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
amongſt theſe Triaries, and ſo made the third battel equal to either of the
former; but howſoeuer, they neuer exceeded the number of 600. And by this it
appeareth, that in Polybius his time the common rate of a legion was 4200.</p>
                  <p>In this diuiſion of their men conſiſted the ground of that well ordered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
for in that they diſtinguiſhed them according to their yeeres and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they reduced their whole ſtrength into ſeueral claſſes; &amp; ſo diſpoſed of theſe
different parts,<note place="margin">The vſe of this diuiſion.</note> that in the generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition of their whole bodie euery part
might be fitted with place and office, according as his worth vvas anſwerable to
the ſame: &amp; ſo they made not only a number in groſſe, but a number diſtinct by
parts and properties, that from euery accident which met with any part of the
armie, the iudgement might determine how much or howe little it imported
the whole bodie: beſides the great vſe vvhich they made of this diſtinction
in their degrees of honour and preferment; a matter of no ſmal conſequence, in
the excellencie of their gouernment.</p>
                  <p>The ſoldiours,<note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their companies. Manipuli.</note> at their inrolement beeing thus deuided according to their
yeeres and abilitie, they then reduced them into ſmaller companies, to make
them fitter for command and fight: and ſo they deuided the Haſtati, Principes,
and Triarii, each of them into 10 companies, making of thoſe 3. ſortes of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
30. ſmall regiments, vvhich they called Manipuli: And againe, they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuided
euerie maniple into two equall parts,<note place="margin">Ordo.</note> and called them Ordo, vvhich was
the leaſt companie in a legion; and according to the rate ſet down by Polybius,
contained 60. ſoldiours. In euerie Ordo there was a Centurion, or Captaine,
and a Lieuetenant, whom they named Optio or Tergiductor. The maniples of
the Triarii were much leſſer then the maniples of either the Haſtati or the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22240:37"/>
for as much as their whole band conſiſted but of 600. men. The Velites
were put into no ſuch companies, but were equally diſtributed amongſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Maniples; and therefore the Haſtati, Principes, and Triarij were called <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignanos
milites,</hi> to make a difference between them and the Velites, which were
not deuided into bandes; and ſo conſequently had no enſigne of their own, but
were diſtributed amongſt the other companies: ſo that euery Maniple had 40.
Velites attending vpon it. And now I come to the deſcription of a cohort, which
the hiſtory heere mentioneth.</p>
                  <p>The worde <hi>Cohors</hi> in latine doth ſignifie that part of grounde which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
incloſed before the gate of a houſe,<note place="margin">Cohors. Lib. 3. de re rust.</note> which from the ſame word we call a
court: and Varro giueth this reaſon of the metaphor. As in a farme houſe, ſaith
he, many out-buildings ioined together make one incloſure; ſo a cohort conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of ſeuerall maniples ioined together in one body. This cohort conſiſted of
three maniples; for euerie legion had ten cohorts, which muſt neceſſarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
thoſe thirty maniples: but theſe 3. maniples were not al of one and the
ſame kind of ſoldiors, as three maniples of the Haſtati, 3. of the Principes, and 3.
of the Triarij, as Patricius in his Paralleli ſeemeth to affirme; for ſo there
would haue remained an odde maniple in euery kind, that could not haue been
brought into any cohort: But a cohort contained a maniple of the Haſtati, a
maniple of the Principes, and a maniple of the Triarij; and ſo al the 30. maniples
were included into 10. cohorts; &amp; euery cohort was as a little legion; foraſmuch
as it conſiſted of al thoſe ſortes of ſoldiours that were in a legion. So that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a legion to containe 5000. men; a cohort had 500. and ſo theſe 6. cohorts,
which he incamped on the other ſide of the riuer, vnder the command of Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Sabinus, contayned 3000. ſoldiours: but if you make a legion to conſiſt
but of 4200. which was the more vſuall rate, there were 2520. ſoldiours in theſe
ſixe cohortes.</p>
                  <p>By this therefore it may appeare, that a legion conſiſted of foure ſorts of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,
which were reduced into ten cohorts, and euery cohort contained 3. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples;
&amp; euery maniple 2. orders; and euery order had his Centurion marching
in the head of the troupe; and euery Centurion had his optionem, or Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
that ſtood in the taile of the troupe.</p>
                  <p>When a legion ſtoode ranged in battell ready to confront the enemy,<note place="margin">Alegion ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in battell.</note> the
leaſt body or ſquadron that it contained was a maniple; wherein the two orders
were ioined together, making iointly ten in front, and twelue in file: and ſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
fiue files had their Centurion in front, and Lieutenant in the rereward,
to direct them in all aduentures. In the time of the Emperours, their battai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
conſiſted of a cohort, and neuer exceeded that number how great ſoeuer
the army were.</p>
                  <p>Polybius diſtinguiſhing a maniple into two centuries or orders,<note place="margin">The firſt order</note> ſaith, that
the Centurion firſt choſen by the Tribunes, commanded the right order, which
was that order which ſtoode on the right hand, knowne by the name of <hi>Primus
ordo:</hi> and the Centurion elected in the ſecond courſe, commanded the left or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and in the abſence of either of them, hee that was preſent of them two,
commaunded the whole maniple. And ſo wee finde that the Centurion of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:22240:38"/>
firſt place was called <hi>Prior Centurio:</hi> in which ſenſe Caeſar is to be vnderſtood,
where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">3. De bello ciuili.</note> that all the Centurions of the firſt cohorte were ſlaine, <hi>praeter
principem priorem.</hi> From whence we gather two ſpecialities, firſt; the prioritie
betweene the Centurions of the ſame maniple: for a cohorte conſiſting of 3.
maniples, vvhereof the firſt maniple vvere Triarij, the ſecond Principes, and
the thirde Haſtati; and euerie maniple containing two orders; and euerie order
a Centurion: he ſaith, that all the Centurions of this cohort vvere ſlaine; ſauing
the firſt or vpper Centurion of the Principes.<note place="margin">Prima cohors</note> The ſecond thing vvhich I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
is the title of the firſt cohort: for theſe 10. cohortes, vvhereof a legion
conſiſted, vvere diſtinguiſhed by degrees of worthineſſe; and that vvhich vvas
held the vvorthieſt in the cenſure of the Electors, tooke the prioritie both of
place and name, and vvas called the firſt cohort: the next, the ſecond cohort; &amp;
ſo conſequently vnto the tenth and laſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither did the legions want their degrees of prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, both in imbattai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
&amp; in inca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ping, according either to the ſeniority of their inrolement, or their
fauor of their General, or their own vertue: And ſo we read that in theſe vvars
in Gallia, the tenth legion had the firſt place in Caeſars army. And thus much
concerning the diuiſions, and ſeuerall companies of a legion, and the degrees
of honour which they held in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this deſcription it ſhall not be amiſſe, briefelie to laie open the moſt
apparant commodities depending vpon this diſcipline;<note place="margin">The benefit of this diſcipline</note> the excellency vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
more plainely appeareth, bein compared to that order, vvhich nature hath
obſerued in the frame of her vvorthieſt creatures: for it is euident, that
ſuch workes of nature come neereſt to perfect excellencie, vvhoſe material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is moſt particularlie diſtinguiſhed into parts, and hath euery part indued
vvith that propertie, which beſt agreeth to his peculiar ſeruice. For beeing
thus furniſhed with diuerſitie of inſtruments, and theſe directed vvith fitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
the creature muſt needs expreſſe many admirable effects, and diſcouer
the vvorth of an excellent nature: vvhereas thoſe other bodies, that are but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
laboured, and find leſſe fauour in natures forge, being as abortiues, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
compoſed, vvanting the diuerſitie both of partes and faculties; are no
vvay capable of ſuch excellent vſes, nor fit for ſuch diſtinct ſeruices, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that are directed vvith ſo many properties, and inabled vvith the power of ſo
wel diſtinguiſhed faculties. Which better works of nature the Romains imitated
in the Architecture of their army, deuiding it into ſuch neceſſary &amp; ſeruiceable
partes, as were beſt fitting all vſes and imploiments: as firſt into legions, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
into cohorts, and cohorts into maniples, and maniples into centuries or
orders, and theſe into files; wherein euery man knewe his place, and kept the
ſame without exchange or confuſion. And thus the vniuerſall multitude was
by order diſpoſed into partes, vntill it came vnto a vnitie: for it cannot bee
denied, but that theſe centuries were in themſelues ſo ſenſiblie diſtinguiſhed,
that euerie Soldiour caried in his minde the particular Mappe of his whole
centurie: for in imbtttailing, euerie centurie was diſpoſed into 5. files, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
twelue in a file, whereof the leaders were alwayes certaine, and
neuer changed but by death or ſome other eſpeciall occaſion: and euerie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22240:38"/>
leader knew his follower, and euerie ſecond knewe the third man, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
vnto the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Vpon theſe particularities it plainly appeareth, how eaſie a matter it was, to
reduce their troupes into any order of a march or a battell, to make the front
the flanke, or flanke front, when they were broken and diſrankt to rallie them
into any forme, when euery man knew both his owne and his fellowes ſtation.
If any companies were to be imploied vpon ſudden ſeruice, the generall Idea of
the Armie being ſo deepely imprinted in the minde of the commanders, would
not ſuffer them to erre in taking out ſuch conuenient troupes, both for number
and quality, as might beſt agree with the ſafetie of the Armie, or nature of the
action: At all occaſions and oportunities, theſe principles of aduantage offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themſelues, as readie meanes, to put in execution any deſſigne, or ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
whatſoeuer; the proiect was no ſooner reſolued of, but euerie man could
readily point out the companies that were fit to execute the intention. And
which is more important, in regard of the life and ſpirit of euerie ſuch part,
their ſodalitie was ſweetned, or rather ſtrengthened with the mutuall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and friendſhippe one of another, the captaine marching alwaies in the
head of the troupe, the enſigne in the middeſt, and the lieutenant in the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and euerie man accompanied with his neighbour and his friend; which
bred a true and vnfained courage, both in regard of themſelues, and of their
followers. Beſides theſe ſpecialities, the places of title and dignity depending
vpon this order, were no ſmall meanes to cutte off all matter of ciuill diſcorde,
and inteſtine diſſention: for here euerie man knew his place in the file, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
file knewe his place in the Centurie, and euerie Centurie in the Maniple,
and euerie Maniple in the Cohort, and euerie Cohort in the Legion, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Legion in the Armie; and ſo euerie ſouldier had his place, according to his
vertue; and euerie place gaue honour to the man, according as their diſcipline
had determined thereof.</p>
                  <p>The vvant of this diſcipline hath diſhonoured the martiall gouernment
of this age, with bloudſhed and murthers; whereof France is too true a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as well in regard of the French themſelues, as of our Engliſh forces that
haue beene ſent thither to appeaſe their tumults: for through defect of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which allotteth to euerie man his due place, the controuerſie grew between
Sir William Drurie and Sir Iohn Bowrowes, the iſſue whereof is too well known
to the world: wherein as our commanders in France haue been negligent, ſo I
may not forget to giue due comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation to the care which is had of this point
amongſt the Engliſh troups, in the ſeruice of the ſtates in the vnited prouinces,
where they are very curious in appointing euerie man his place in the file, and
euerie file in the troupe, and find much benefit thereby, beſides the honour of
reuiuing the Roman diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point,<note place="margin">The benefit of ſmall battai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lions: and the diſaduantage of great ſqua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> I will onely touch in a word the benefite, which the
Romans found in their ſmall battailions, and the diſaduantage, which we haue in
making great ſquadrons. And firſt it cannot be denied, but that ſuch troupes
ſtand beſt appointed for diſpoſition and array of battell, which ſtanding ſtrong
to receiue a ſhocke, bring moſt men to fight with the enemie: for the principall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22240:39"/>
thinges which are required in ſetting of a battell, are ſo to order the troupes, that
the depth in flanke may ſerue conueniently to withſtand the aſſault, taking vp no
more men then may well ſerue for that purpoſe; and giuing meanes to the reſt
to fight with the enemie; and in theſe two points, were both their defenſiue and
offenſiue conſiderations comprehended. But ſmaller troupes and battailons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde
this conueniencie better then great ſquadrons, which drowne vp manie
able men in the depth of their flankes, and neuer ſuffer them to appeare, but
when the breaking of the ſquadron doth preſent them to the butcherie of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.
The Macedonian Phalanx, as I haue noted in the firſt booke, neuer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
aboue 16 in flanke, and brought 500 to fight in front. And theſe little bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailons
(conſidering them as they ſtood in battell ray) made as great a front or
greater, then that of the Phalanx, keeping a depth anſwerable to the ſame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the 2 and 3 battell, which alwaies were to ſuccour them, which the Phalanx
wanted: neither would their thicke and cloſe imbattailing admit any ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
behind them. Now if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare the aduantages &amp; diſcommodities, which
by place and accident were incident to either of theſe, we ſhall find great ods
betweene them. Theſe great ſquadrons are not faiſable, but in plaine and open
places, where they may either ſtand immoueable, or make eaſie and ſlow moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without ſhaking, or diſordering their bodie: but the leſſer are a ſcantling
for all places, champion or wooddie, leuell or vneuen, or of what ſite or quality
ſoeuer. And to conclude, if two or three rankes of theſe great battailons chance
to be broken and diſordered, the whole body is as much intereſſed in the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as the ſaid rankes are; and hath leſſe meanes to rally it ſelfe, then any other
leſſer companie: but if any violence chance to rout a maniple, it proceedeth no
further in the Armie, then that part which it taketh: Neither can the diſranking
of any one part, betraie the ſafetie of the Armie to diſorder and confuſion; for
as much as their diſtinction ſerued to cut off ſuch inconueniences, and yet no
waie hindered the generall vniting of their ſtrength into one body. More may
be ſaid concerning this matter, but I onely point at it, and leaue the due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
thereof, to the iudgment of our commanders, &amp; returne to our hiſtory.</p>

did often aſſemble to ſee ſtrange ſightes and publike ſhewes, were
brought in (ſaith he) 60 Iuſtie young men, who after ſome motion,
and ſeemely march, caſt themſelues into a ſquare troupe, &amp; roofing their heads

the third and fourth rankes did more incline themſelues, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vnto the laſt ranke, which kneeled on the ground, and ſo they made a bodie
reſembling halfe the ſide of an houſe, which they called Teſtudo. Vnto this
ſquadron thus ſtrongly combined togither, came two ſoldiours running ſome
fiftie foot off, and threatning each other with their weapons, ran nimbly vp the
ſide of the roofe; and ſometimes making as though they would defend it againſt
an enemy, that would haue entred vpon it; ſometimes againe incountering each

to the ſide of a wall, there aſcended many armed men vpon the ſaid Teſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
and fought in an equall height with other ſoldiors, that ſtood vpon the ſaid

that were in front, and in the ſides of the ſquare, caried not their Targets ouer
their heads, as the other did; but couered their bodies with them, and ſo no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
either caſt from the wall, or otherwiſe throwne againſt it, coulde any waie

them to approach the wall with ſafetie, and ſo either to vndermine it, or to
clime vp: and to that ende they oftentimes erected one Teſtudo vpon another.
Tacitus ſaith, that the ſoldiours climed vppon the wall, <hi>ſuper iteratam teſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>

                  <p>Dio Caſſius in the actes of Anthonie,<note place="margin">Lib. 49.</note> ſaieth, that beeing galled with
the Parthian Archers, hee commanded his whole armie to put it ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

thought the Romaines hadde ſunke downe for wearineſſe and faintneſſe;

and then the Romaines at a watch-worde giuen, roſe againe with ſuch a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that they put them all to ſworde and flight. Dio deſcribeth the ſaide

hath perfectlie diſcouered the nature of the countrey, through which he is to

the way, by which he was to paſſe. But he that leadeth an army, by an vnknown

lapides.</hi> Plinie attributeth the inuention thereof to the Inſulairs called Baleares.
Florus in his third booke and eighth chapter, ſaith, that theſe Baleares vſed three
ſortes of ſlinges, and no other weapon beſides: for a boy had neuer any meate
giuen him, before he had firſt ſtrooke it, with a ſling. Strabo diſtinguiſheth theſe
three ſortes of ſlings, which the Baleares vſed; and ſaith that they had one ſling
with long raines, which they vſed when they would caſt a farre off: and another
with ſhort raines, which they vſed neere at hand: and the third with raines of a
meane ſiſe, to caſt a reaſonable diſtance. Lipſius ſaith, that in <hi>Columna Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
at Rome, he obſerued that the Balearean was made with one ſling about his
head, another about his bellie, and the third in his hand; which might be their
ordinarie manner of carrying them. The matter whereof they were made was
threefold, the firſt was hempe or cotton, the ſecond haire, and the third ſinewes:
for of either of theſe ſtuffes, they commonly made them: the forme and faſhion
of a ſling reſembled a platted rope, ſomewhat broade in the middeſt, with an
Ouall compaſſe; and ſo by little and little decreaſing into two thongs or raines.
Their manner of ſlinging was to whirle it twiſe or thriſe about their head, and
ſo to caſt out the bullet. Virgill ſpeaking of Mezentius ſaith,
<q>Ipſe ter adducta circum caput egit habena.</q>
But Vegetius preferreth that skill, which caſt the bullet with once turning it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the head. In Suidas we find, that theſe Baleares did commonly caſt a ſtone
of a pound waight, which agreeth to theſe dames in Caeſar, <hi>fundas, librales.</hi> The
leaden bullets are mentioned by Saluſt, in the warre with Iugurth; and by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
where he ſaith, that the Conſull prouided great ſtore of arrowes, of bullets,

which they could eaſily reach with their ſling, is expreſſed in this verſe,

gaberdine, nor corſelet could beare out the blow; but he that was hit with
a ſling, was ſlaine <hi>ſine inuidia ſanguinis,</hi> as he ſaith in the ſame place. Lucrece,
Ouid, and Lucan, three of the Latine Poets ſaie, that a bullet skilfully caſt
out of a ſling,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. natu: questions.</note> went with ſuch violence that it melted as it flew: vvhereof Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
giueth this reaſon, motion (ſaith he) doth extenuate the aire, and that exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
or ſubtilitie doth inflame: and ſo a bullet caſt out of a ſling melteth as it
flieth. But howſoeuer, Diodorus Siculus affirmeth, that theſe Balearean ſlingers
brake both target, headpiece, or any other armour vvhatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo two other ſorts of ſlings, the one mentioned by Liuie; and the

ſlope by little &amp; little, vntill it came againe to a plaine, where the legions were imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed.
And leaſt the enemie abounding in multitude, ſhould circumuent his men
and charge them in flanke as they were fighting, he drew an ouerthwart ditch behind
his Armie, from one ſide of the hill to the other, 600 paces in length; the ends wherof
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:22240:42"/>
he fortified with bulwarkes, and placed therein ſtore of engines: and leauing in his
campe the two legions which he had laſt inrolled in Lombardie, that they might bee
readie to be drawne forth when there ſhould neede any ſuccour, he imbattailed his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſixe legions in the front of the hill, before his campe. The Belgae alſo bringing
forth their power, confronted the Romans in order of battell. There laie between both
the Armies a ſmall Mariſh, ouer which the enemie expected that Caeſar ſhould haue
paſſed; and Caeſar on the other ſide, attended to ſee if the Belgae would come ouer,
that his men might haue charged them in that troubleſome paſſage. In the meane
time the Caualrie on both ſides incountered betweene the two battels, and after long
expectation on either ſide, neither partie aduenturing to paſſe ouer, Caeſar hauing got
the better in the skirmiſh betweene the horſemen, thought it ſufficient for that time,
both for the incouraging of his owne men, and the conteſting of ſo great an Army; and
therefore he conuaied all his men againe into their campe. From that place the enemy
immediately tooke his way to the riuer Axona, which laie behinde the Romans campe,
and there finding foordes they attempted to paſse ouer part of their forces, to the ende
they might either take the fortreſse which Q. Titurius kept, or to breake downe the
bridge, or to ſpoile the territories of the ſtate of Rheimes, and cut off the Romans from
prouiſion of corne. Caeſar hauing aduertiſement thereof from Titurius, tranſported
ouer the riuer by the bridge all his horſemen and light armed Numidians, with his
ſlingers and archers, and marched with them himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conflict was hoat in that

a great number of them; the reſt like deſperate perſons, aduenturing to paſse ouer
vpon the dead carkaſes of their fellowes, were beaten backe by force of weapons: and
the horſemen incompaſſed ſuch as had firſt got ouer the water, and ſlewe euerie man
of them.</p>
               <p>When the Belgae perceiued themſelues fruſtrated of their hopes, of winning Bibrax,
of paſsing the riuer, and of drawing the Romans into places of diſaduantage, and that
their owne prouiſions began to faile them: they called a councell of war, wherein they
reſolued, that it was beſt for the ſtate in generall, and for euerie man in particular,
to breake vp their campe, and to returne home vnto their own houſes: and into whoſe
confines or territories ſoeuer, the Romans ſhould firſt enter to depopulate and waste
them in hoſtile maner, that thither they ſhould haſten from al parts, and there to giue
them battell, to the end they might rather trie the matter in their own countrie, then
abroad in a ſtrange and vnknowne place; and haue their owne houſhold prouiſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
at hand to maintaine them. And this the rather was concluded, for as much as
they had intelligence, that Diuitiacus with a great power of the Hedui, approched
neare to the borders of the Bellouaci, who, in that regard, made haſte homeward to
defend their country.</p>

their mindes were ſo caried away with the conceite of warre, that they had no
leiſure to prouide ſuch neceſſaries, as are the ſtrength and ſinewe of the warre:
It was ſufficient for euery particular man, to be knowne for a ſoldiour in ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

of the Romaines: with them were ioined the Attrebatij, and Veromandui,
whom they had perſuaded to abide the ſame fortune of warre with them. Beſides,
they expected a power from the Aduatici; the women and ſuch as were vnmeete
for the fielde, they beſtowed in a place vnacceſſible for any armie, by reaſon of fens
and bogs, and mariſhes. Vpon this intelligence, Caeſar ſent his diſcouerers and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
before, to chooſe out a fit place to incampe in.</p>
               <p>Now whereas many of the ſurrendred Belgae, and other Galles were continuallie
in the Romaine army, certaine of theſe (as it was afterward known by the captiues)
obſeruing the order which the Romaines vſed in marching, came by night to the
Neruij and tolde them, that betweene euerie legion went a great ſort of cariages;
and that it was no matter of difficultie, aſſoone as the firſt legion was come into the
campe, and the other legions yet a great way off, to ſet vpon them, vpon a ſuddaine,
before they were disburdened of their cariages; and ſo to ouerthrowe them: which
legion being thus cut off, and their ſtuffe taken, the rest would haue ſmal courage to
ſtande againſt them. It much furthered this aduice, that, foraſmuch as the Neruij
were not able to make any power of horſe, that they might the better reſiſt the caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of their borderers, whenſoeuer they made any roade into their marches; their
manner was to cut yong trees halfe aſunder, &amp; bowing the tops down to the ground,
plaſhed the boughes in breadth, and with thornes and briers planted between them,
they made them ſo thicke, that it was impoſsible to ſee through them, ſo hard it was
to enter or paſſe through them; ſo that, when by this occaſion, the paſſage of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
army muſt needes be hindred, the Neruij thought the foreſaid counſell not to
be neglected.</p>

as the enemy was at hand; Caeſar (as his cuſtom was) led 6. legions alwaies in

placed the impediments of the whole army. And the two legions which were laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled

If the place affoorded a ſecure paſſage, and gaue no ſuſpicion of hoſtilitie, hee
was content in regarde of conueniency, to ſuffer euery legion to haue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
of their particular cariages, and to inſert them among the troupes, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man might haue at hand ſuch neceſſaries as were requiſite, either for their

diſpoſition, in regard of particular vſe, as diſaduantageous to their ſafety: &amp; cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his legions in that readines, that if they chanced to be ingaged by an enemy,
they might without any alteration of their march, or incumbrance of their cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
receiue the charge, in that forme of battell, as was beſt approoued by their
military rules, &amp; the ancient practiſe of their fortunate progenitors.</p>

differed from their vſuall maner of imbattailing; and therefore it was called <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

in a triple battel, of equal diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one behind an other, euery battel hauing
his ſeueral cariages in front: And if they were by chance attacked by an enemy,
they turned themſelues according to the oportunity of the place, either to the
right or left hande, and ſo placing their cariages on the one ſide of their army,
they ſtood imbattailed ready to receiue the charge.</p>

that way which they found moſt eaſie, both for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; their impediments.
Which order of a march, as it was more commodius then the former, in regard
of particularity, ſo was it vnſafe and dangerous, where the enemy was expected:
And therfore Caeſar much blamed Sabinus and Cotta, for marching, when they
were deluded by Ambiorix,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. de bel. Gallico.</note>

then that which the Romaines obſerued, as the two poles of their motions, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety
and conueniency: whereof the firſt dependeth chiefely vpon the prouident
diſpoſition of the leaders; and the other wil eaſily follow on, as the commodity
of euerie particular ſhal giue occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Concerning ſafety in place of danger, what better courſe can bee taken then
that maner of imbattailing, which ſhall be thought moſt conuenient, if an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were preſent to confront them? for a well ordered march muſt either carie
the perfect forme of a battell, or containe the diſtinct principles and elements
thereof, that with little alteration it may receiue that perfection of ſtrength,
which the fitteſt diſpoſition can affoord it. Firſt therefore, a prudent and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
leader, that deſireth to frame a ſtrong and orderly march, is diligentlie to
obſerue the nature and vſe of each weapon in his army, howe they may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for greateſt vſe and aduantage, both in reſpect of their different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
qualities, as alſo in regard of the place wherein they are managed: and
this knowledge will conſequentlie inferre the beſt and exacteſt diſpoſition of
imbattailing, as the ſaid forces are capable of; which if it may be obſerued in a
march, is no way to be altered. But if this exactnes of imbattailing wil not admit
conuenient cariage of ſuch neceſſarie adiuncts, as pertaine to an armie; the
inconuenience is to bee relieued, with as little alteration from that rule, as in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:22240:48"/>
a warie iudgment ſhall be found expedient: that albeit the forme be ſomewhat
changed; yet the principles and ground wherein their ſtrength and ſafetie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth,
maie ſtill be retained.</p>
                  <p>Neither can any man well deſcend to more particular precepts in this point:
he may exemplifie the practiſes of manie great and experienced commanders;
what ſort of weapon marched in front, and what in the rereward, in what part
of the Armie the Munition marched, and where the reſt of the cariage was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
according as their ſeuerall iudgments thought moſt expedient, in the
particular nature of their occurrences. But the iſſue of all will fall out thus; that
he that obſerued this rule before preſcribed, did ſeldome miſcarrie through an
vnſafe march. Let a good Martialiſt well know their proper vſe in that diuerſity
of weapons in his Armie; how they are ſeruiceable or diſaduantageous, in this
or that place, againſt ſuch or ſuch an enemie: and he will ſpeedily order his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
diſpoſe of his march, and beſtow his cariages, as ſhall beſt fall out both for
his ſafetie, and conueniencie.</p>
                  <p>Caeſars cuſtome was, to ſend his Caualrie and light armed footmen, before
the body of his Armie, both to diſcouer and impeach an enemie; for theſe
troupes were nimble in motion and fit for ſuch ſeruices: but if the danger were
greater in the rereward then in the front, the horſemen marched in the tayle of
the Armie, and gaue ſecuritie where there was moſt cauſe of feare. But if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that they were found vnfit to make good the ſeruice in that place, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
it fell out, and eſpecially in Africa againſt the Numidians: he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
them, as he beſt found it conuenient, and brought his legionarie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which were the ſinewes and ſtrength of his forces, and marched continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the bulke of the Armie, to make good that which his horſemen could not
performe. And thus he altered the antique preſcription, and vniformitie of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
according as he found himſelfe beſt able to diſaduantage an enemie, or
make waie to victorie.</p>

one meaſure, halfe a foot in thickneſſe, a foot in breadth, and a foot and a halfe
in length. But if the place, wherein they were incamped, would afford no ſuch
turfe; they then ſtrengthened the looſe earth, which was caſt out of the ditch,
with boughs and fagots, that it might be ſtrong and wel faſtened. The rampier
they properly called <hi>Agger:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Agger.</note> the outſide whereof, which hung ouer the ditch,
they vſed to ſtick with thicke and ſharpe ſtakes, faſtened deep in the mound, that
they might be firme; and theſe for the moſt part were forked ſtakes, which made
the rampier very ſtrong, and not to be aſſaulted but with great difficulty. Varro
ſaith,<note place="margin">Vallum.</note> that the front of the rampier thus ſtucke with ſtakes, was called <hi>vallum,</hi> a

behind the Emperours tent: and this gate did vſually looke either toward
the eaſt, or to the enemy, or that way that the army was to march. The gate on

one was, the knowledge and experience of the ſouldiers: for by
reaſon of their practiſe in former battels, they could as well
preſcribe vnto themſelues, what was to be done, as any other
commander could teach them. The other was, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Caeſar had giuen commandement to euerie Legate,
not to leaue the worke or forſake the legions, vntill the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were perfited; yet when they ſawe extremitie of danger, they attended no
countermaund from Caeſar: but ordered all thinges as it ſeemed beſt to their owne
diſcretion. Caeſar hauing commanded ſuch thinges as he thought neceſsarie, ranne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelie
to incourage his ſouldiers, and by fortune came to the tenth legion, where he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
no further ſpeech, then that they ſhould remember their ancient valour, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
withſtand the brunt of their enemies.<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I rather take it to bee ſomething els then a word.</note> And for as much as the enemie was no
further off, then a weapon might be caſt to incounter them, he gaue them the ſigne of
battell: and haſtening from thence to another quarter, he found them alreadie cloſed
and at the incounter. For the time was ſo ſhort and the enemie ſo violent, that they
wanted leaſure to put on their headpieces, or to vncaſe their targets: and what part
they lighted into from their worke, or what enſigne they firſt met withall, there they
ſtaied; leaſt in ſeeking out their owne companies, they ſhould looſe that time as was to
be ſpent in fighting. The Armie being imbattailed rather according to the nature of
the place, the decliuitie of the hill, and the breuitie of time, then according to the rules
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:22240:56"/>
of art; as the legions incountered the enemie in diuers places at once, the perfect view
of the battell being hindered by thoſe thicke hedges before ſpoken of, there could no
ſuccors be placed any where; neither could any man ſee what was needful to be done: &amp;
therfore in ſo great vncertainty of things, there happened diuers caſualties of fortune.</p>
               <p>The ſoldiers of the ninth and tenth legion, as they ſtood in the left part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
caſting their piles, with the aduantage of the hil, did driue the Attrebatij, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
with running &amp; wounded in the incounter, down into the riuer; &amp; as they paſſed
ouer the water, ſlew many of them with their ſwordes: Neither did they ſticke to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after them ouer the riuer, and aduenture into a place of diſaduantage, where the
battell being renewed againe by the enemie, they put them to flight the ſecond time.
In like maner two other legions, the 11 and the 8, hauing put the Veromandui from
the vpper ground, fought with them vpon the bankes of the riuer; and ſo the front &amp;
the left part of the campe was well neere left naked. For in the right cornet were the
12 and the 7 legions, where as all the Neruij, vnder the conduct of Boduognatus,
were heaped together; and ſome of them began to aſsault the legions on the open ſide,
and other ſome to poſseſſe themſelues of the higheſt part of the campe.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the Roman horſemen, and the light armed footmen that were
intermingled amongſt them, and were at firſt all put to flight by the enemie, as they
were entering into the campe, met with their enemies in the face, and ſo were driuen
to flie out another way. In like manner, the pages and ſouldiers boies, that from the
Decumane port and toppe of the hill, had ſeene the tenth legion follow their enemies
in purſuit ouer the riuer, and were gone out to gather pillage, when they looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, and ſaw the enemie in their campe; betooke them to their heeles as faſt as
they could. Which accident ſo terrified the horſemen of the Treuiri (who for their
proweſſe were reputed ſingular amongst the Galles, and were ſent thither by their
ſtate, to aide the Romans) firſt when they perceiued the Roman campe to be poſsest,
by a great multitude of the enemie, the legions to be ouercharged and almoſt incloſed
about, the horſemen, ſlingers, and Numidians to be diſperſed and fled, that without
anie further expectation they tooke their waie homeward, and reported to their ſtate,
that the Romans were vtterly ouerthrowen.</p>
               <p>Caeſar departing from the tenth legion, to the right cornet, found his men excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ouercharged, the enſignes crowded together into one place, and the ſouldiers of
the 12 legion ſo thicke thronged on a heape, that they hindered one another; all the
Centurions of the fourth cohort being ſlaine, the enſigne bearer kild and the enſigne
taken, and the Centurions of the other cohorts either ſlaine, or ſore wounded; amongst
whom Pub. Sextus Baculus, the Primipile of that legion, a valiant man, ſo grieuouſly
wounded, that he could ſcarce ſtand vpon his feete; the rest not verie forward, but
many of the hindmoſt turning taile and forſaking the field; the enemie on the other
ſide, giuing no reſpite in front, although he fought againſt the hill, nor yet ſparing the
open ſide, and the matter brought to a narrow iſſue, without any meanes or ſuccour,
to relieue them: he tooke a target from one of the hindmoſt ſouldiers (for he himſelfe
was come thither without one) and preſsing to the front of the battell, called the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
by name, and incouraging the reſt, commanded the enſignes to be aduanced
toward the enemie, and the Maniples to be inlarged, that they might with greater

differ one from another: &amp; in what regard, the one, or the other, were
either inferiour, or ſuperiour: which promiſe I wil now with diligence endeuour
to performe. And for as much as the armies of the Macedonians haue giuen ſo
good teſtimonies of themſelues by their actions, by ouercomming the armies
as wel of thoſe of Aſia, as of Greece; and that the battailes of the Romans haue
conquered, as well thoſe of Africa as all the Eaſterne countries of Europe: It
ſhall not be amiſſe, but very profitable, to ſearch out the difference of either; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ſeeing that theſe our times haue not once, but many times ſeene triall,
both of their battailes and forces; that knowing the reaſon why, the Romans do
ouercome, and in their battailes carie awaie the better: we doe not as vaine
men were wont to do, attribute the ſame to fortune, and eſteeme them without
reaſon happy victors; but rather looking into the true cauſes, we giue them their
due praiſes, according to the direction of reaſon, and ſound iudgment. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the battels betweene Hanniball and the Romans; and concerning the
Romans their loſſes, there is no neede that I ſpeake much. For their loſſes are
neither to be imputed to the defect of their Armes, or diſpoſition of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but to the dexteritie and induſtrie of Hanniball: but wee haue entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therof when we made mention of the battels themſelues, and the end it ſelfe
of that warre doth eſpeciallie confirme this our opinion. For vvhen they
had gotten a captaine equall vvith Hanniball, euen conſequentlie vvith all
his victories vaniſhed. And hee had no ſooner ouercome the Romans, but
by and by, reiecting his owne weapons, hee trained his Armie to their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and ſo taking them vp in the beginning, he continued them on vnto the
ende.</p>
                              <p>And Pyrrhus in his war againſt the Romans, did vſe both their weapons and
order, and made as it were a medlie both of the cohort, and phalanx: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
it ſerued him not to get the victory, but alwaies the euent by ſome
meanes or other, made the ſame doubtfull: concerning whom it were not vnfit,
that I ſhould ſaie ſomething, leaſt in being altogether ſilent, it might ſeeme to
preiudice this mine opinion. But notwithſtanding I will haſten to my purpoſed
compariſon.</p>
                              <p>Now touching the phalanx, if it haue the diſpoſition, and forces proper to it,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:22240:57"/>
nothing is able to oppoſe it ſelfe againſt it, or to ſuſtaine the violence thereof;
as maie eaſily by many documents be approued. For when an armed man doth
ſtand firme in the ſpace of three foote in ſo thicke an array of battell, and the
length of their pikes being according to the firſt baſis, or ſcantling ſixteene
foote; but according to the true and right conueniencie of them, 14 cubits, out
of which are taken foure allowed for the ſpace betweene the left hand, which
ſupporteth the ſame, and the butte ende thereof, vvhiles he ſtandes in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to attend the incounter: being thus ordered, I ſaie, it is manifeſt that the
length of tenne cubites doth extend it ſelfe before the bodie of euerie armed
man, where with both his handes he doth aduance it readie to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
By vvhich meanes it followeth, that ſome of the pikes doe not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
themſelues before the ſecond, third, and fourth ranke, but ſome before
the formoſt, if the phalanx haue his proper and due thickneſſe, according
to his naturall diſpoſition, both on the ſides and behinde, as Homer maketh
mention vvhen he ſaith, that one target doth encloſe and fortifie another; one
headpiece is ioyned to another, that they maie ſtande vnited and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>Theſe circumſtances being rightly and truely ſet downe, it muſt follow, that
the pikes of euerie former ranke in the phalanx, doe extend themſelues two cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites
before each other, which proportion of difference they haue betweene
themſelues: by which maie euidently be ſeene the aſſault, and impreſſion of the
whole phalanx, what it is, and what force it hath, conſiſting of 16 rankes in
depth, or thickneſſe; the exceſſe of which number of rankes aboue fiue. For as
much as they cannot commodiouſly couch their pikes, without the diſturbance
of the former, the points of them not being long inough to enlarge themſelues
beyond the formoſt rankes, they grow vtterly vnprofitable, and cannot man, by
man, make any impreſſion, or aſſault: but ſerue onely, by laying their pikes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhoulders of thoſe which ſtand before them, to ſuſtaine and hold vp the
ſwaies and giuing backe of the former rankes, which ſtand before them to this
end, that the front may ſtand firme and ſure; and with the thicknes of their pikes
they doe repell all thoſe dartes, which paſſing ouer the heads of thoſe that ſtand
before, would annoy thoſe rankes which are more backward.</p>
                              <p>And farther by mouing forward, with the force of their bodies, they doe ſo
preſſe vpon the former, that they doe make a moſt violent impreſſion. For it is
impoſſible that the formoſt rankes ſhould giue backe.</p>
                              <p>This therefore being the generall and particular diſpoſition of the phalanx:
we muſt now ſpeake on the contrarie part, touching the properties and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as well of the armes, as of the whole diſpoſition of the Roman battell. For
euerie Roman ſoldier for himſelfe, and his weapon is allowed three foot to ſtand
in, and in the incounter, are moued man, by man, euery one couering himſelfe
with his target; and mutually moouing whenſoeuer there is occaſion offered.
But thoſe which vſe their ſwordes, do fight in a more thinne and diſtinct order;
ſo that it is manifeſt, that they haue three foote more allowed them to ſtand in
both from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and from backe to bellie, that they maie vſe
their weapons with the better commoditie. And hence it commeth to paſſe,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:22240:57"/>
that one Romaine ſoldiour taketh vp as much ground, as two of thoſe which are
to encounter him of the Macedonian Phalanx: ſo that one Romain is as it were
to oppoſe himſelfe againſt tenne pikes, which pikes the ſaid one ſoldior can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by any agilitie come to offende, or elſe at handy blowes otherwiſe annoy:
And thoſe which are behinde him, are not onely vnable to repell their force,
but alſo with conueniencie to vſe their owne weapons. Whereby it may eaſily
be gathered, that it is impoſsible, that any battaile being aſſaulted, by the front
of a phalanx, ſhould be able to ſuſtaine the violence thereof, if it haue his due
and proper compoſition.</p>
                              <p>What then is the cauſe that the Romaines do ouercome, and that thoſe that
doe vſe the phalanx are voyde of the hope of victorie? (Euen from hence)
that the Romaine armies haue infinite commodities, both of places, and of
times, to fight in. But the the phalanx hath only one time, one place, and one
kinde, whereto it may profitablie applie it ſelfe: ſo that if it were of neceſsitie,
that their enemy ſhoulde incounter them at that inſtant, eſpeciallie with their
whole forces, it were queſtionleſſe not only, not without danger, but in al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie
likelie, that the phalanx ſhould euer carrie away the better. But if that
may be auoided, which is eaſily done: ſhal not that diſpoſition then, be vtterlie
vnprofitable, and free from all terror? And it is farther euident, that the phalanx
muſt neceſſarily haue plaine &amp; champion places, without any hinderances, or
impediments; as ditches, vneuen places, vallies, little hils and riuers: for al theſe
may hinder &amp; diſioine it. And it is almoſt impoſsible to haue a plaine of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of 20. <hi>ſtadia,</hi> much leſſe more, where there ſhall bee found none of theſe
impediments. But ſuppoſe there bee found ſuch places, as are proper for the
phalanx: If the enemy refuſe to come vnto them, and in the meane time, ſpoile,
and ſacke the cities, and countrie round about; what commodity, or profit ſhal
ariſe by an army ſo ordered? for if it remaine in ſuch places, as hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoken of; it can neither relieue their friends, nor preſerue themſelues. For
the Conuoies which they expect from their friends, are eaſily cut off by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whiles they remaine in thoſe open places.</p>
                              <p>And if it happen at any time, that they leaue them vpon any enterpriſe, they
are then expoſed to the enemy. But ſuppoſe, that the Romaine army ſhould
find the phalanx in ſuch places, yet would it not adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture it ſelfe in groſſe at one
inſtant; but would by little &amp; little retire it ſelfe, as doth plainly appeare by their
vſual practiſe. For there muſt not bee a coniecture of theſe things by my words
only, but eſpecially by that which they do. For they do not ſo equally frame their
battaile, that they doe aſſault the enemy altogether, making as it were but one
front: but part make a ſtande, and parte charge the enemie, that if at any time
the Phalanx doe preſſe them, that come to aſſault them and bee repelled; the
force of their order is diſſolued. For whether they purſue thoſe that retire, or
flie from thoſe that do aſſault them, theſe doe diſioyne themſelues from part of
their armie; by which meanes there is a gap opened to their enemies, ſtauding
and attending their opportunitie: ſo that nowe they neede not anie more to
charge them in the front, where the force of the phalanx conſiſteth: but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
where the breach is made, both behind, and vpon the ſides. But if at any
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:22240:58"/>
time the Romaine armie may keepe his due proprietie, and diſpoſition, the
phalanx by the diſaduantage of the place, being not able to doe the like: doth it
not then manifeſtlie demonſtrate the difference to be great, betweene the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their diſpoſition, and the diſpoſition of the phalanx?</p>
                              <p>To this may bee added the neceſſities impoſed vppon an army, which is to
march through places of all natures, to encampe themſelues, to poſſeſſe places
of aduantage, to beſiege, and to be beſieged; and alſo contrary to expectation
ſometimes to come in viewe of the enemie: For all theſe occaſions neceſſarilie
accompanie an armie; and oftentimes are the eſpecial cauſes of victory, to which
the Macedonian phalanx is no way fit, or conuenient: Foraſmuch as neither in
their generall order, nor in their particular diſpoſition, without a conuenient
place, are able to effect any thing of moment: but the Romaine army is apt for
all theſe purpoſes. For euerie ſoldiour amongſt them, beeing once armed and
ready to fight, refuſeth no place, time, nor occaſion; keeping alwaies the ſame
order, whether he fight togither with the whole body of the army, or particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by himſelfe, man to man.</p>
                              <p>And hence it happeneth, that as the commodity of their diſpoſition is aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious:
ſo the end doth anſwere the expectation.</p>
                              <p>Theſe things I thought to ſpeake of at large, becauſe many of the Grecians
are of an opinion, that the Macedonians are not to bee ouercome. And againe,
many wondered, how the Macedonian phalanx ſhould bee put to the worſt by
the Romaine army, conſidering the nature of their weapons.</p>
                              <p>Thus far goeth Polibyus, in comparing the weapons and imbattailing of
the Romaines, with the vſe of armes amongſt the Macedonians: wherein we
ſee the Pike trulie, and exactlie ordered, according as the wiſe Grecians could
beſt proportion it with that forme of battell, which might giue moſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the vſe thereof: ſo that if our ſquadrons of Pikes iumpe not with
the perfect manner of a phalanx, (as wee ſee they doe not) they fall ſo much
ſhorte of that ſtrength, which the wiſedome of the Grecians and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of other nations, imputed vnto it. But ſuppoſe wee could allow it that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
in the courſe of our wars, which the nature of the weapon doth require;
yet foraſmuch as by the authority of Polybius, the ſaid maner of imbattailing is
tied to ſuch dangerous circumſtances of one time, one place, and one kinde of
fight: I hold it not ſo profitable a weapon, as the practiſe of our times doth ſeem
to make it, eſpecially in woody countries, ſuch as Ireland is; where the vſe is cut
off by ſuch inconueniences, as are noted to hinder the managing thereof. And
doubtles, if our commanders did but conſider of the incongruity of the Pike &amp;
Ireland, they would not proportion ſo great a number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery company,
as there is; for commonly halfe the company are pikes, which is as much to ſaie
in the practiſe of our wars, that halfe the army hath neither offenſiue nor defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but only againſt a troupe of horſe. For they ſeldom or neuer come
to the puſh of pike, with the foot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, where they may charge &amp; offende the
enemy: &amp; for defence, if the enemy think it not ſafe to buckle with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but
maketh more aduantage to play vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a far off with ſhort; it affordeth ſmal ſafe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
to ſhake a long pike at them, and ſtand faire in the meane time, to entertaine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:22240:58"/>
a volleie of ſhot with the body of their battailion. As I make no queſtion, but
the pike in ſome ſeruices is profitable, as behind a rampier, or at a breach; ſo I
aſſure my ſelfe, there are weapons if they were put to triall, that would counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
the pike euen in thoſe ſeruices, wherein it is thought moſt profitable.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the Target, we ſee it take the hand, in the iudgement of Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
of all other weapons whatſoeuer, aſwell in regard of the diuers and ſundrie
ſortes of imbattailing, as the qualitie of the place wherſoeuer: for their vſe was
as effectuall in ſmall bodies and centuries, as in groſſe troupes and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
in thinne and ſpacious imbattailing, as in thicke thronged Teſtudines.
Neither could the nature of the place make them vnſeruiceable; for whether it
were plaine or couert; leuel or vnequall; narrow or large, if there were any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
to fight, the Target was as neceſſarie to defend, as the ſword to offend:
beſides the conueniency, which accompanieth the Target in any neceſſitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
vpon an armie, whether it bee to march through places of all natures,
to make a faſt march, or a ſpeedie retraite, to incampe themſelues, to poſſeſſe
places of aduantage, to beſiege and to be beſieged, as Polybius ſaith, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other occaſions which neceſſarilie accompanie an armie. The vſe of this
weapon hath beene too much neglected in theſe latter ages, but may be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
renued againe in our nation, if the induſtrie of ſuch as haue laboured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it vnto theſe times, in the beſt faſhion, ſhall finde anie fauour in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our commaunders. Concerning which Target, I muſt needes ſaie this
much, that the light Target will proue the Target of ſeruice, whenſoeuer they
ſhall happen to be put in execution: for thoſe which are made proofe, are ſo
heauie and vnwieldie, (although it be ſomewhat qualified with ſuch helpes as
are annexed to the vſe thereof,) that they ouercharge a man, with an vnſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
burthen, and hinder his agilitie and execution in fight, with a waight
diſproportionable to his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. For our offenſiue weapons, as namely the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebuſiers
and musketiers, are ſtronger in the offenſiue part, then any armes of
defence, which may be made manageable and fit for ſeruice. Neither did the
Romains regard the proofe of their Target further, then was thought fit for the
readie vſe of them in time of battel, as it appeareth in many places, both in the
ciuill warres and in theſe Commentaries: for a Romaine pile hath often times
darted through the Target, and the bodie of the man that bare it, and faſtened
them both to the ground, which is more then a musket can wel do; for the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
commonly reſteth in the bodie. And although it may be ſaid that this was
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect of an extraordinary arme; yet it ſerueth to proue,
that their Targets were not proofe to their offenſiue weapons, when they were
well deliuered and with good direction. For I make no doubt, but in their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
there were oftentimes ſome hinderances, which woulde not ſuffer ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an effect, as this which I ſpeake of: for in a volley of ſhotte, wee muſt not
thinke that all the bullets flie with the ſame force, and fall with the like hurt; but
as armour of good proofe will hardly hold out ſome of them; ſo ſlender armes
and of no proofe, will make good reſiſtance againſt others. And to conclude,
in a battell or incounter at hand, a man ſhall meete with more occaſions, ſuting
the nature and commoditie of this light Target, then ſuch as will aduantage
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:22240:59"/>
the heauie Target of proofe, or counteruaile the ſurplus of waight, which it
earieth with it.</p>
                              <p>Some men will vrge, that there is vſe of this Target of proofe, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and in ſome ſeruices: which I deny not to thoſe, that deſire to bee ſecured
from the extremity of peril: but this falleth out in ſome places and in ſome
particular ſeruices, and hindereth not but that the vniuerſal benefit of this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
conſiſteth in the multitude of light Targetiers, who are to manage the moſt
important occaſions of a warre.</p>
                              <p>This much I am further to note, concerning the ſworde of the Targetiers,
that according to the practiſe of the Romaines, it muſt alwaies hang on the
right ſide; for carying the Target vpon the left arme, it cannot be that the ſword
ſhould hang on the left ſide, but with great trouble and annoiance: And if any
man ſay, that if it hang on the right ſide, it muſt bee verie ſhort, otherwiſe it
will neuer bee readilie drawne out. I ſaie that the ſworde of the Targetiers, in
regard of the vſe of that weapon, ought to be of a very ſhort ſcantling, when as
the Targetier is to command the point of his ſword within the compaſſe of his
Target, as ſuch as looke into the true vſe of this weapon, wil eaſily diſcouer. But
let this ſuffice concerning the vſe of the pike and the Target.</p>

as euery man beſtirred himſelfe in the ſight of the Emperour,
the brunt of the enemie was a litle ſtaied. Caeſar perceiuing
likewiſe the ſeuenth legion, which ſtood next vnto him, to bee
ſore ouerlaide by the enemy, commaunded the Tribunes by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, to ioine the two legions together, and ſo by ioining
backe to backe, to make two contrarie fronts; and beeing thus ſecured one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from feare of being circumuented, they began to make reſiſtance with greater
courage. In the meane time the two legions, that were in the rerewarde to guarde
the cariages, hearing of the battell, doubled their pace, and were diſcried by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
vpon the top of the hill. And Titus Labienus, hauing won the campe of the
Neruij, and beholding from the higher ground what was done on the other ſide of
the reuer, ſent the tenth legion to helpe their fellowes, who vnderſtanding by the
horſemen and Lackies that fled, in what caſe the matter ſtood, and in what daunger
the campe, the legions, and the Generall was, made all the haſte they poſsibly could.
At whoſe comming there happened ſuch an alteration and change of things, that
euen ſuch as were ſunke downe, through extreame griefe of their woundes, or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpon their Targets, began againe to fight a freſh, and the Pages and the boies
perceiuing the enemie amazed, ran vpon them vnarmed, not fearing their weapons:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:22240:59"/>
the horſemen alſo ſtriuing with extraordinarie valour, to wipe away the diſhonour of
their former flight, thruſt themſelues in all places before the legionarie ſouldiers.
Howbeit the enemie in the vtmost perill of their liues, ſhewed ſuch manhood, that
as faſt as the formost of them were ouerthrowen, the next in place beſtrid their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſes,
and fought vpon their bodies: and theſe being likewiſe ouerthrowen, and
their bodies heaped one vpon another, they that remained, poſseſt themſelues of that
mount of dead carkaſes as a place of aduantage, and from thence threwe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and intercepting the piles, returned them againe to the Romans. By which it
may be gathered, that there was great reaſon to deeme them men of hautie courage,
that durſt paſse ouer ſo broade a riuer, climbe vp ſuch high rockes, and aduenture to
fight in a place of ſuch inequalitie. The battell being thus ended, and the nation
and name of the Neruij being well neare ſwallowed vp with deſtruction, the elder

Senatours they had now left but three; and of 60000 fighting men, there was ſcarce

to a diſtreſsed people, preſerued them with great care, granting vnto them the free

not to offer them any wrong or iniurie at all.</p>

Ramus complaineth of as a confuſed narration: much differing from
the direct and methodicall file, of his other Commentaries. But if that
rule holde good, which learned Rhetoritians haue obſerued in their Oratorie,
that an vnperfect thing ought not to be told in a perfect maner; then by Ramus
leaue, if any ſuch confuſion do appeare, it both ſauoureth of eloquence, and wel
ſuteth the turbulent cariage of the action, wherein order and skill gaue place to
fortune, and prouidence was ſwallowed vp with peraduenture. For that which
Hirtius ſaith of the ouerthrow he gaue to Pharnaces, may as well be ſaid of this;
that he got the victorie, <hi>plurimum adiuuante deorum benignitate, qui cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
belli caſibus interſunt, tum praecipue ijs quibus nihil ratione potuit adminiſtrari.</hi>
For ſo it fell out in this battell, and the danger proceeded from the ſame cauſe,
that brought him to that puſh in the battell with Pharnaces: for he well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that the Neruij attended his comming on the other ſide the riuer Sabis:
Neither was he ignorant how to fortifie his camp in the face of an enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare or danger, as we haue ſeene in his war with Ariouiſtus; when he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the place where he purpoſed to incamp himſelfe with 3 battels, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
two of them to ſtand ready in armes to receiue any charge, which the enemy
ſhould offer to giue, that the third battell in the meane time might fortifie the
camp. Which courſe would eaſily haue fruſtrated this ſtratagem of the Neruij,
and made the hazard leſſe dangerous; but he little expected any ſuch reſolution,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:22240:60"/>
ſo contrarie to the rules of militarie diſcipline, that an enemie ſhould not ſticke
to paſſe ouer ſo broad a riuer, to clime vp ſuch ſteepe and high rocks, to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
battell in a place ſo diſaduantagious, and to hazard their fortune vppon
ſuch inequalities. And therefore, hee little miſtruſted any ſuch vnlikelie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
wherein the enemy had plotted his owne ouerthrow, if the legions had
beene ready to receiue them. Which may teach a generall that which Caeſar
had not yet learned, that a leader cannot be too ſecure in his moſt aſſured cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
nor too carefull in his beſt aduiſed directions; conſidering that the greateſt
means may eaſily bee preuented, and the ſafeſt courſe weakened with an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
circumſtance: ſo powerful are weake occurrences in the maine courſe
of the waightieſt actions; and ſo infinite are the waies, wherby either wiſdom or
fortune may worke. Neither did this warne him, to prouide for that which an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
might do, how vnlikelie ſoeuer it might ſeeme vnto him, as appeareth by
that accident in the battel with Pharnaces: which practiſe of attempting a thing
againſt reaſon and the arte of warre, hath found good ſucceſſe in our moderne
wars; as appeareth by the French hiſtories: notwithſtanding, it is to be handeled
ſparingly, as no way ſauoring of circumſpect and good direction, foraſmuch as

                  <p>The chiefeſt helpes which the Romaines founde, were firſt the aduantage of

in this turbulent aſſault; wherein they caried themſelues as men acquainted with

kept themſelues within the wall: And as they beheld the vines framed, the mount
raiſed, and a towre in building a far off; at firſt they began to laugh at it, and with
ſcoffing ſpeeches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wal, began to aske: with what hands, &amp; with what ſtrength,
eſpecially by men of that ſtature (for the Romaines were but little men in reſpect of
the Galles) a towre of that huge maſſie waight ſhould bee brought vnto the walles?
But when they ſaw it remoued, and approching neere vnto the towne, as men aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
at the ſtrange and vnaccuſtomed ſight thereof, they ſent ambaſſadors to Caeſar,
to intreat a peace with this meſſage: They beleeued that the Romaines did not make
war, without the ſpecial aſſiſtance of the gods, that could with ſuch facility tranſport
engines of that height, &amp; bring them to incounter at hand, againſt the ſtrongeſt part
of their town: and therfore they ſubmitted both themſelues, and all that they had, to
Caeſars mercy; deſiring one thing of his meere clemency, that he would not take away
their armes, foraſmuch as al their neighbors were enemies vnto them, and enuied at
their valour; neither were they able to defend themſelues, if they ſhoulde deliuer vp
their armor: ſo that they had rather ſuffer any inconuenience by the people of Rome,
then to be butcherly murthered by them, whom in former time they had held ſubiect
to their command.</p>
               <p>To this Caeſar anſwered, that hee would ſaue the city rather of his owne cuſtome,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any deſert of theirs; ſo that they yeelded before the Ram touched the wal: but
no condition of remedy ſhould be accepted, without preſent deliuery of their armes;
for he would do by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had done by the Neruij, and giue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement to their
neighbours, that they ſhould offer no wrong to ſuch, as had commended their ſafety
to the people of Rome. This anſwere being returned to the city, they ſeemed contented
to doe whatſoeuer hee commanded them, and thereupon caſting a great part of their
armour ouer the wall into the ditch, inſomuch as they fild it almoſt to the top of the
rampier: and yet (as afterward was known) concealing the third part, they ſet open
the gates, and for that daie caried themſelues peaceably. Towards night Caeſar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the gates to be ſhut, and the ſoldiours to be drawn out of the towne. But the
Aduatici hauing conſulted together before, foraſmuch as they beleeued that vpon
their ſubmiſſion, the Romaines woulde either ſet no watch at all, or at the leaſt,
keepe it verie careleſlie; partlie with ſuch armour as they had retained, and partly
with Targets, made of barke or wrought of wicker, which vppon the ſodaine they
had couered ouer with leather, about the third watch where the aſcent to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
was eaſieſt; they iſſued ſodainly out of the towne with al their power: but
ſignification thereof being giuen by fiers, as Caeſar had commanded, the Romains ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
ſpeedilie to that place. The enemy fought very deſperatelie, as men in the laſt
hope of their welfare, incountering the Romains in a place of diſaduantage, at length
with the ſlaughter of 4000. the reſt were driuen backe into the towne. The
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:22240:61"/>
next daie when Caeſar came to breake open the gates, and found no man at defence, he
ſent in the ſoldiors, and ſold al the people and ſpoile of the towne: the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the towne amounted to 53000. bondſlaues.</p>

is that which the Carthaginians vſed at Cadiz, and is purtraited in the column

                  <p>The compound Ram is thus deſcribed by Ioſephus;<note place="margin">Aries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita.</note> a Ramme (ſaith he) is a
mighty great beame, like vnto the maſt of a ſhip, and is ſtrengthned at one end

This Ram is hanged by the middeſt with roapes vnto an other beame, which

that is able to ſtande before it. The length of this Ramme was of a large ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for Plutarch affirmeth, that Anthonie in the Parthian warre had a Ram
eighty foote long: and Vitruuius ſaith, that the length of a Ramme was vſuallie
106. and ſometimes 120; and this length gaue great ſtrength and force to the

and ſo the ramme plaied continually vpon the wall, without intermiſſion. Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
ſaith, that Titus, at the ſiege of Ieruſalem, had a ramme for euerie legion:
it was oftentimes couered with a vine, that the men that managed it might bee

courage and wiſedome, ranne ſpeedily to Galba and tolde him, that the only waie
of ſafetie was to breake out vpon the enemie, and to trie the laſt refuge in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.
Whereupon they called the Centurions, and by them admoniſhed the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to ſurceaſe a while from fighting, and onely to receiue ſuch weapons as were
caſt into the campe; and ſo to reſt themſelues a little and recouer their ſtrength:
and then at a watchword to ſallie out of their campe, and laie their ſafety vpon their
vertue; which the ſouldiers executed with ſuch alacritie and courage of ſpirite,
that breaking out at all the gates of the campe, they gaue no leaſure to the enemie to
conſider what was done, nor to ſatiſfie his iudgement touching ſo vnexpected a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie.
And thus fortune being ſuddenly changed, they ſlewe more then the third

if it were for no other end, which might ſort to the benefit of either partie,
(as there are many good vſes thereof) yet to holde vp the quarrell and keepe it
from falling, making war, according to the grounds of reaſon, the entercourſe of
meſſengers is not to be interrupted, nor their perſons to be touched with hateful

their rebellion, after they had yeelded themſelues by rendrie, and giuen hoſtages of
their loialtie: the conſpiracie of ſo manie citties, which being now neglected, might

nor yet with ſhipping neither; for againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in an ebbe, the

hauing ſuch ſtore of ſhipping, would eaſily conuey, both themſelues and their

fleete by reaſon of continuall windes and foule weather, durſt not aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to put out of the riuer Loier into ſo vaſt a ſea, wherein the hauens and roades
were fewe, and farre distant one from another, and the tides great. The ſhipping of
the Galles was thus built and rigged: the keele was ſomewhat flatter then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhipping, the better to beare the ebbes, and ſhalowes of that coast: the foredecke
was altogether erect and perpendicular: the poupe was made to beare the huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

this great ſecret; yet for as much as they ſtand for true principles of regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and well approued rules in our Arte of nauigation, let vs take them for no
leſſe then they effect, and giue them that credit in our imagination, which tract
of time hath gained to thoſe forged circles in the heauens: that albeit their
chiefeſt eſſence conſiſteth in conceit and ſuppoſal; yet for as much as they ſerue
to direct our knowledge to a certainty, in that variety and ſeeming inconſtancie
of motion, we eſteeme of them as they effect, and not as they are.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering then the globe of the world, as it maketh a right ſpheare (for
in that poſition, the Naturaliſtes chiefly vnderſtand celeſtiall influence to haue
operation in this liquid element of the water) it is deuided by the Horizon and
Meridian into foure quarters: the firſt quarter is that, betweene the eaſt hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
and the noone meridian, which they cal a flowing quarter: the ſecond, from
the noone meridian, to the weſt horizon; which they make an ebbing quarter:
the third, from the weſt horizon to the midnight meridian; which they likewiſe
call a flowing quarter: and againe, from the midnight meridian to the eaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
the ſecond ebbing quarter: And ſo they make two flowing quarters,
and two ebbing quarters of the whole circuit of heauen. The inſtruments of
theſe ſenſible qualities, and contrarie effects, are the ſunne and the moone, as
they are caried through theſe diſtinct partes of the heauen. And although ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath noted the moone to be of greateſt power in warrie motions; yet
we may not omit to acknowledge the force, which the ſunne yeeldeth in this
miracle of nature.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therfore we are to vnderſtand, that when the moone or the ſunne begin
to appeare aboue the right horizon, and enter into that part of the heauen which
I tearmed the firſt flowing quarter, that then the ſea beginneth to ſwell: and as
they mount vp to their meridian altitude; ſo it increaſeth vntill it come to a
high floud. And againe, as thoſe lightes paſſing the meridian, decline to the
weſt, and runne the circuit of the ebbing quarter: ſo the water decreaſeth and
returneth againe from whence it came. Againe, as they ſet vnder the weſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:22240:68"/>
and enter into the ſecond flowing quarter; ſo the ſea beginneth againe to
flow, and ſtill increaſeth vntill they come to the point of the night meridian:
and then againe, it refloweth, according as the ſunne and moone are carried in
the other ebbing quarter from the night meridian, to the eaſt horizon.</p>
                  <p>And hence it happeneth that in coniunction or new of the moone,<note place="margin">Spring tides.</note> when the
ſunne and the moone are caried both together in the ſame flowing, and ebbing
quarters; that then the tides and ebbes are very great: and likewiſe in oppoſition
or full of the moone, when theſe lightes are caried in oppoſite quarters, which
we haue deſcribed to be of the ſame nature, either ebbing or flowing; that then
in like manner the tides are great: foraſmuch as both theſe Planets, through
the ſymboliſing quarters wherein they are carried, doe ioyne their forces, to
make perfect this worke of nature in the ebbing and flowing of the ſea. And
contrariwiſe, in a quadrate aſpect (as the Aſtronomers call it) or quarter age of
the moone, when as the moone is caried in a flowing quarter; and at the ſame
inſtant, the ſunne doth happen to be in an ebbing or decreaſing quarter, as the
courſe of nature doth neceſſarily require: then are the tides leſſoned, as dailie
experience doth witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as both the right horizon and the meridian alſo, deuide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
diurnall circle, which either the ſun or the moone maketh in their reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
into equall parts; it followeth that euery tide is continually meaſured with
the quantitie of 6 houres: and therfore that which Caeſar here ſaith, muſt needs
be true, that in the ſpace of 12 houres, there are alwaies 2 high tides. And leaſt
any man ſhould imagine, that euery inland citie, ſtanding vpon an ebbing and
flowing riuer, may take the computation of the tide according to this rule: let
him vnderſtand that this which I haue deliuered, is to be conceiued principally
of the ſea it ſelfe; and ſecondarily of ſuch portes and hauens, as ſtand either
neare or vpon the ſea: but where a riuer ſhall run many miles from the ſea, and
make many winding meanders, before it come to the place of calculation; it
muſt needs loſe much of this time before mentioned. And thus much I thought
conuenient to inſert in theſe diſcourſes touching the ebbing and flowing of the
ſea, as not impertinent to martiall knowledge.</p>

of burthen: the third, ſhips that were driuen forward with force of oares, and
the reſt ſounding according to their Names; for I dare not intitle them with
a more particular deſcription. Nowe whether theſe Names <hi>Longas</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarias,</hi>
were a ſeuerall ſorte of ſhipping by themſelues; or the generall

But that which moſt troubleth our ſea-Critickes, is in what ſenſe they maie
vnderſtand theſe vocabularies, <hi>Triremes, Quadriremes,</hi> and <hi>Quinqueremes,</hi>
whether they were ſo tearmed in regard of the number of rowers, or watermen
that haled continually at an oare, as the cuſtome of the Gallies is at this
daie; or otherwiſe, becauſe a <hi>Trireme</hi> had three orders of oares on either ſide,
a <hi>Quadrireme</hi> foure, and a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> fiue: whereof they tooke their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Names.</p>
                  <p>Such as holde,<note place="margin">Lib. 27.</note> that a <hi>Trireme</hi> had on each ſide three rankes of oares, and ſo
conſequently, of a <hi>Quadrireme</hi> and <hi>Quinquereme;</hi> alleadge this place of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
to make good their opinion. In the warres betweene Rome and Carthage,
Laelius meeting with Adherball in the ſtraightes of Gibraltar, each of them
had a <hi>Quinquereme,</hi> and ſeauen or eight <hi>Triremes</hi> a piece, the current in that
place was ſo great that it gaue no place to Arte, but carried the veſſailes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fall of the Billow: in which vncertaintie the <hi>Triremes</hi> of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginean,
cloſed with the <hi>Quinquereme</hi> of Laelius: which either becauſe ſhe
was <hi>pondere tenacior,</hi> as Liuie ſaith, or otherwiſe, for that <hi>pluribus remorum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinibus

bankes of oares, which reſiſted the billowe and ſteamed the current, ſhe ſunke
two of the <hi>Triremes,</hi> and ſo got the victorie. From hence they proue, that a
<hi>Quinquereme</hi> had <hi>plures remorum ordines,</hi> then a <hi>Trireme</hi> had; and therefore it
tooke the name from the pluralitie of bankes of oares, and not from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men that rowed at an oare.</p>
                  <p>But the contrarie opinion doth interpret <hi>Ordo Remorum,</hi> to be a couple of
oares one anſwering another, on each ſide of the veſſaile, which we call a paire of
oares: So that a <hi>Quinquereme</hi> being far greater and longer then a <hi>Trireme,</hi> had
more paires of oares then a <hi>Trireme</hi> had, and thoſe oares were handled with fiue
men at one oare, according to the vſe of our Gallies at this daie.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue this,<note place="margin">Their maner of ſea-fights.</note> and come to their manner of ſea-fights, wee muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that the Romans, wanting the vſe of Artillerie and managing their ſhips
of warre with force of oares, failed not to make vſe of their Arte, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes
and incounters by ſea: for all their ſhippes of ſeruice, which we tearme
men of warre, carried a ſtrong beake-head of yron, which they called <hi>rostrum,</hi>
with which they ranne one againſt another, with as great violence and furie, as
their oares could carrie them. And herein Arte gaue great aduantage; for he
that could beſt skill to turne his ſhip, with greateſt celeritie, and ſo fruſtrate an
offer; or with ſpeedie and ſtrong agitation follow an aduantage: commonly got
the victorie.</p>
                  <p>In the battell,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de bello ciuili.</note> which D. Brutus had with the Maſſilians, we reade that two
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:22240:69"/>
Triremes charging the Admirall, wherein Brutus was one at the one ſide, and
the other at the other; Brutus and his Marriners ſo cunningly handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that when they ſhould come to the hurt, they ſpeedily in a trice of time,
wound themſelues from betweene them, and the two Triremes met with ſuch a
carriere one againſt another, that one brake her beakehead, and the other ſplit
with the blowe.</p>
                  <p>For this skill and fortune withall, Euphranor the Rodian was of great fame
in Caeſars time; although his ende found too true the ſaying of the Hiſtorian,
that Whom fortune honoureth with many good haps, ſhe oftentimes reſerueth
to a harder deſtinie; as other ſeamen beſides Euphranor, can truely witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>This firſt brunt being ended: when they came to grapple and boording one
of another, then the art and practiſes of their land ſeruices came in vſe: for they
erected turrets vpon their deckes, and from them they fought with engines and
caſting weapons, as ſlinges, arrowes, and piles; and when they entered, they
fought with ſword and target. Neither did the legionarie ſouldier finde any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
when he came to the point, betweene their fight at ſea and that at land:
ſauing that they could not be martialed in troupes and bandes, in regard wherof
the ſea ſeruice was counted more baſe, and diſhonourable; and the rather, in
as much as it decided the controuerſie, by ſlinges and caſting weapons: which
kinde of fight was of leſſe honour, then buckling at handy-blowes.</p>

alſo the Galles had aduantage: neither had they any meanes, whereby they might
foile ſo great a nauie, which amounted to the number of 230 ſhippes of warre. One
thing there was amongst their prouiſions which ſtood them in great ſteed: for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
had prouided great ſharpe hookes or ſickles, which they put vpon great and long
poles, theſe they faſtened to the tackling which held the maine yarde to the maſt; and
then haling away their ſhip, with force of Oares, they cutte the ſaid tackling, and the
maine yard fell downe: Whereby the Galles, whoſe onely hope conſiſted in ſayling and
yare turning of their ſhips, loſt at one inſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both their ſailes and the vſe of their ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
And then the controuerſie fell within the compaſse of valour, wherein the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
exceeded the Gals; and the rather, inaſmuch as they fought in the ſight of Caeſar
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:22240:69"/>
and the whole Armie, no valiant act could be ſmothered in ſecret; for all the hilles
and clifts, which affoorded neare proſpect into the ſea, were couered with the Roman
Armie.</p>
               <p>Their maine yardes being cutte downe, and the Romans indeuouring with great
furie to boord them, failed not to take manie of their ſhips: which the Galles percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and finding no remedie nor hope of reſiſtance, began all to flie, &amp; turning their
ſhips to a forewind, were vpon a ſudden ſo becalmed, that they were able to make no
waie at all. Which fell out ſo fitly for the Romans, that of ſo great a nauie, verie few
through the helpe of the euening eſcaped to land, after they had fought the ſpace of 8
houres: with which battell, ended the warre with the Veneti, and the reſt of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritimate

was taken and loſt; ſo that ſuch as remained, knew not whither to go, nor how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their townes any longer: and therefore yeelded themſelues to Caeſar, in whom he
vſed the greater ſeueritie, that he might thereby teach all other barbarous people, not
to violate the law of nations: for he ſlew all the Senat with the ſword, and ſolde the
people for bondſlaues.</p>

within leſse then two miles of Sabinus his campe, brought out his forces daily, and
putting them in battell gaue him oportunitie to fight if he would: which Sabinus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
in ſuch ſort, that he began not onely to be ſuſpected by the enemie of cowardice,
but to be taunted with the reprochfull ſpeeches of his owne ſouldiers; which opinion
of feare being once ſetled in the mindes of the enemie, he vſed all meanes to increaſe
it, and caried it ſo wel, that the enemie durſt approch the verie rampier of the campe.
The colour that he pretended was, that he thought it not the part of a Legate, in the
abſence of the Generall, to fight with an enemie of that ſtrength, but vpon ſome good
oportunitie, or in a place of aduantage. In this generall perſwaſion of feare, Sabinus
choſe out a ſubtile witted Gall, whom he perſwaded with great rewards, and further
promiſes, to flie to the enemie, and there to carrie himſelfe, according to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which he ſhould giue him. This Gall, comming as a reuolter to the enemy, laide
open vnto them the feare of the Romans: the extremitie that Caeſar was driuen into
by the Veneti; and that the night before, Sabinus was about to withdraw his forces
ſecretly out of his campe, and to make all the haſte he could to relieue Caeſar. Vpon
which aduertiſement, they all cried out with one conſent, that this oportunity was not
to be omitted; but ſetting apart all other deuiſes, to go and aſſault the Roman campe.
Many circumſtances perſwaded the Galles to this reſolution; as firſt the lingering &amp;
doubt which Sabinus had made, when he was offered battell: ſecondly the intelligence
which this fugitiue had brought: thirdly the want of victuals, wherein they had bin
negligent and vnaduiſedly careleſſe: fourthly the hope they conceiued of the warre of
Vannes; and laſtly, for that men willingly beleeue that which they would haue come
to paſse. The force of theſe motiues was ſo ſtrong, that they would not ſuffer Virido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uix,
nor the reſt of the captaines, to diſmiſſe the councell vntill they had permitted
them to take Armes, and go to the Roman campe. Which being granted, they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
rubbiſh and fagots to fill vp the ditch, and with cheerefull harts, as though the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
were alreadie gotten, they marched to the place where Sabinus was incamped,
which was the toppe of a hill riſing gently from a leuell, the quantitie of 1000 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
hither the Gals haſted with all expedition; and to the intent the Romans might
not haue ſo much time, as to put on their armour, the Galles for haſte ran themſelues

Sabinus incouraging his ſouldiers, gaue the ſigne of battell, and ſallying out at two
ſeuerall gates of his campe, it fell out that through the oportunitie of the place, the
wearines and vnexperience of the enemie, the valour of the Roman ſoldier and their

but preſently tooke themſelues to flight, of whom verie few eſcaped. And ſo
it happened that at one time, Sabinus had newes of the ouerthrow at ſea; and Caeſar

Caeſar in the firſt of the ciuill warres reſpected the ſame thing, but from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grounds: for hauing ſhut vp Afranius, and Petreius in a place of diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and might haue cut them off without further trouble; yet foraſmuch as
he foreſaw the victorie comming towards him without blow or wound, he thus
anſwered his Captaines that were earneſt vpon the enemie: <hi>Cur etiam ſecundo
praelio aliquos ex ſuis amitteret? cur vulnerari pateretur optime de ſe meritos milites?
cur denique fortunam periclitaretur?</hi> And this courſe did theſe Galles take,
which vnder Sertorius had learned the Romaine Arte, and the Romaine indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
and were now become ſo expert, that they had almoſt beaten the Romains
at their owne weapon. This firſt meanes is principally to be imbraced, as the
ſafeſt waie in theſe vncertaine and caſual euentes: for that which reſteth vpon
corporall ſtrength, and maketh execution the meanes to a concluſion, is verie
terrible euen to the better party, full of hazard and of little certaintie. For it
were a miracle of fortune neuer heard of yet, ſo to carrie a battaile vpon what
aduantage or meanes whatſoeuer, that the victor army ſhoulde buie ſo great a
fortune without bloudſhed or loſſe of men; and erect a Trophee to honour at
the ſole coſt of the enemy, without loſſe or expence of his owne treaſure. And
for the vncertaintie in a battell, who knoweth not what infinite chances and
changes may happen in euery ſmall moment of time, to turne the fortune of
the day to this or that party, and make both ſides vnconſtant in their affections,
by preſenting them interchangeably with hope and feare, ioy and ſorrow? and
therefore Caeſar thought it not beſt to tempt the waie-wardnes of fortune, when
by other meanes he might obtaine his deſires. This I ſay is chiefely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,

the Auxiliarie forces, in the diſpoſition of his troupes to battell;
which is here ſaid to be, in <hi>mediam Aciem:</hi> for as their Armies were
diuided into three battels; ſo euerie battell was deuided into three
partes; the two cornets, and the battell, wherein theſe Auxiliarie forces were in
this ſeruice beſtowed: of theſe he afterward ſaith, that in as much as he durſt
not put any confidence in them, he commanded them to ſerue the Romans in
time of battell, with ſtones and weapons, and to carrie earth and turfe to the
mount. The reaſon why ſuſpected troupes are placed in the battell, rather then
in either of the cornets, is, for that the battell hath not ſuch ſcope to fling out, or
take aduantage of place to doe miſchiefe, as the corners haue: for whereſoeuer
there hath beene ſet battels fought, the ſtrength of their armie conſiſted alwaies
in the cornets, as the two principall inſtruments of the battell; and as long as
theſe ſtood ſound, the victorie went alwaies certaine on that part: for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
kept the enemie both from incompaſſing about the bodie of their Armie,
and had the aduantage alſo of charging vpon the open ſide of their aduerſarie.
At the battell of Cannas Hanniball put the weakeſt of his forces in the battell,
and aduancing them towards the enemie, left the two cornets behind: ſo that,
when the enemie came to charge vpon the battell, they eaſily beat them backe,
and as they followed the retrait fell in betweene the two cornets, wherein the
ſtrength of the Armie conſiſted, and being by them incompaſſed on each ſide,
were defeated and ouerthrowen. And thus we ſee the aduantage which a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
hath, when his two cornets ſtand firme; although the battell ſhrinke in the

which is meant, that he who purpoſeth to winne a fortreſſe well manned and

vpon the rampier, and ſo get the place: for he ſaith, that mounts and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
eleuations are of little vſe againſt fortreſſes or ſconſes, vnleſſe they ouertop
them; which may be eaſily preuented by raiſing the parapet of the fortreſſe in
front, and the curtaine in flanke, according as the enemy ſhall carie his mounts
aloft; and ſo they ſhall neuer come to ouertop the holdes. But all campes and
lodgings are taken by the head: That is, by mountes and eleuations, which by
the aduantage of their height command the champion. For he holdeth it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
to raiſe a mount within the campe in ſo ſhort a time, to conteſt that,
which the enemie ſhall make without. This foundation being laide, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to diſcouer a waie, how to raiſe a mount maugre the enemie, which ſhall
diſlodge them by force of Artillerie, or murther them all within their trenches.
And this he taketh from Caeſar at the ſiege of Gergobia.<note place="margin">Lib. de bello Gallico.</note> The ſubſtance of the
matter conſiſteth in a double ditch, running like vnto the line which the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians

practiſe, I referre to our iudicious ſouldiers, which may, if it pleaſe them, take a
better view of the particularities of this ſtratagem in Brancatio himſelfe. This
much I dare affirme in the behalfe of theſe workes, that they were of high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
amongſt the Romans, when daily experience and exigents of hazard had
taught to finde out the readieſt meanes, both for ſecurity and victorie. And if
our ſouldiers could be brought to taſte the commoditie of theſe workes, either
by perſwaſion or impulſion, it were the beſt part of their warlike practiſes: but
our men had rather flie vpon deſperat aduentures, and ſeeke victory in the iawes
of death, then to cleare all hazard, with paines and diligence.</p>

that warre might quickly be ended, lead his Armie into
their country. At his comming, he found them to carrie the wars
farre otherwiſe, then the reſt of the Galles had done: for vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the greateſt nations of Gallia, which had waged battell with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
were beaten and ouerthrowen; and hauing whole continents of woods and bogs
in their territories, they conuaied both themſelues and their goods into thoſe quarters:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22240:75"/>
Caeſar comming to the beginning of the woods, began to fortifie his campe, not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
any enemy neare about him; but as his men were diſpearſed in their charges,
they ſuddenly ſallied out of the woods and aſſaulted the Romans; but being ſpeedely
driuen in againe with the loſſe of manie of them, as the Romans followed them farre
into the woods, had ſome few of their men ſlaine. The time that remained, Caeſar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to ſpend in cutting downe the woods; and leaſt the ſouldiers might bee taken
vnawares, while they were buſied in that worke, he cauſed them to place all the trees
which they cut downe, on either ſide of the Armie; that they might ſerue for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
against ſudden aſſaultes. A great quantitie of ground was thus rid within a
few daies; ſo that their goods and cattell was taken by the Romans: but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
were fled into thicker woods. At which time there happened ſuch a continuall
raine, as forced them to leaue of the worke; and the ſouldiers could no longer indure,
to lie in tentes of skins: and therefore Caeſar, after he had waſted and ſpoiled their
country, burned their townes, and their houſes; he carried backe his Armie, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

doe entertaine the like courſe of warre, as the Morini did with Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:
the meanes which he vſed to diſappoint them of that practiſe,
was to cutte downe the woods, which if it be thought monſtrous in
this age, or ridiculous to our men of warre; let them conſider that the Roman
diſcipline wrought greater effectes of valour, then can bee made credible by
the vſe of theſe times. For beſides their exquiſite diſcipline, which of it ſelfe was
able to frame patterns of vnexampled magnanimitie; their induſtrie was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the execution thereof, and carried it with ſuch vnceſſant trauell, that
the ſouldiers thought it great happines when they came to wage battell with the
enemie; and could haue meanes to quit their continuall trauell, with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their liues. Neither let it ſeeme ſtrange, that the Romans vndertooke to
cut down the woods; but rather let vs admire their facilitie in ſo difficult a taske:
for as the hiſtorie witneſſeth: <hi>magno ſpacio paucis diebus confecto, incredibili cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate:</hi>
a great quantitie of ground was rid in a few daies with incredible ſpeede.
And after the woods were cut downe, they tooke more paines in placing it on
each ſide of the legions, to hinder anie ſudden aſſault, then they did in cutting
it downe: which deſerueth as great admiration, as the former part. There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place in the ſixt booke of theſe Commentaries, which expreſſeth more
particularly the nature of ſuch warres, and may ſerue to acquaint vs with that
which Caeſar did in theſe difficulties.</p>
                  <p>The Eburones or the men of Liege, had the like commoditie of woods and
bogges, and made vſe of them in the warre they had with Caeſar: The matter
(ſaith hee) required great diligence, not ſo much in regard of the perill of the
whole Armie, (for there could no danger come from an enemie that was frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and diſperſed) as the ſafetie of euerie particular ſouldier, which in part did
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:22240:75"/>
pertaine to the welfare of the whole Armie. For the deſire of bootie caried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the ſouldiers farre from the bodie of the Armie: and the woods being
full of vnknowne and ſecret paſſages, would not ſuffer them to go either thicke
together or cloſe imbattailed. If he deſired to haue the warre ended, and the race
of thoſe wicked men to bee rooted out, hee muſt of force make manie ſmall
companies, and deuide his men into many bodies: but if hee would haue the
maniples to keepe at their enſignes, as the diſcipline and cuſtome of the Roman
Army required; then the place was a ſhelter and defence to the enemie: neither
did they want courage to laie ambuſhments, and to circumuent ſuch as they
found alone, ſtragling from their companies. In theſe difficulties, there was as
much done as diligence could doe; prouiding rather to be wanting in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue
part (although all mens mindes were ſet on fire with reuenge) then to
hurt the enemie with the loſſe of the Roman ſouldier. Caeſar ſent meſſengers
to the bordering ſtates, to come out and ſacke the Eburones, and they ſhould
haue all the praie for their labour: that the life of the Galles rather then his legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie
ſouldiers might be hazarded in thoſe woods; as alſo that, with ſo great a
multitude, both the race and name of that people might bee quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                  <p>There are many particularities in this relation, which concerne the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

was the ill intreatie, which for manie yeares together they had
receiued of the Sueui, the greateſt &amp; warlikeſt nation amongſt
the Germains. For theſe Sueui had one hundred Cantons or
ſhires, which yearely furniſhed their warres, with 1000 men a piece; and kept as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
at home to maintaine both themſelues, and their Armies abroad: and theſe the
yeare following were in Armes; and the other ſtaied at home, and performed the
like dutie; and ſo by this meanes, they all continued their experience both of tillage,

which was the cauſe (what through the qualitie of their diet, their continuall
exerciſe, and libertie of life, being neuer tied to any diſcipline, nor vrged to any thing

hides for their cloathing, which couered but part of their body, the reſt being naked.

being taught to ſtand ſtill in one place, that when they would they might returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of horſe, that vſed Equipage, with a few of their owne qualitie. They admitted no
wine to be brought in vnto them, leaſt it might effeminate their warlike inclination,
or make them vnapt for labour. The greateſt honour in their opinion, was to haue

the diſcouerie of this cholericke paſsion. Wherein I will indeuor to ſhew how
impatiencie, ſodaine reſolution, and deſire of noueltie, are naturall adiuncts
of this humor: And if Caeſar made vſe of this philoſophie in the managing of
that warre, let it not be thought impertinent to the knowledge of a Generall, to
enter into the conſideration of this learning. Wherein firſt, I muſt laie for a
maxime that which long experience hath made authenticall, that the motions
of the minde are either quicke or ſlow, according as the complexion is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
either with heat or cold: for as the flegmaticall humor, is of a moiſt, cold
and heauy nature, begetting weake and groſſe ſpirits, and benumming the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
with a liueles diſability; ſo is the motion of the internall faculties,
proceeding likewiſe after a ſlow maner, according to the qualitie of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereby it moueth: and therefore men of this watriſh conſtitution, are
no way apt to receiue an impreſſion, nor to entertaine any ſenſible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
vnles it be beaten into them, with often and ſtrong repetitions; and then
alſo they proceede as ſlowlie in diſcourſing of the conſequence, and linger in
the choiſe of their reſolutions. On the contrary part, this <hi>flaua bilis,</hi> being of a
hote piercing nature, and reſembling the actiue vertue of the fire, doth ſo puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the inſtruments of ſenſe, and quicken the ſpirits with the viuacity of motion,
that they take the firſt impreſsion as perfectly, as if it had beene oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

that inaſmuch as the <hi>Species</hi> is ſo readily receiued, and poſſeſſeth the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

fit diſpoſition of the inſtrumentes, which proceedeth from heate the chiefeſt
qualitie in choler) that the obiect is at the firſt moment ſo ſtrongly ſetteled, in

then this of anger, which we now ſpeake of: Neither is there any motion
that more pleaſeth it ſelfe in his owne actions, or followeth them with greater
heate in the execution. And if the trueth chance to ſhewe it ſelfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
a falſe pretended cauſe, as the authour of that paſsion, it oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth
the rage euen againſt truth and innocency. Piſo condemned a ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for returning from forraging, without his companion, being perſuaded that
he had ſlaine him: but at the inſtant of the execution, the other that was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
returned, and with great ioy of the whole army, they were caried to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
thinking to haue much gratified him, with the manifeſtation of the truth:
but hee through ſhame and deſpight, being yet in the torture of his wrath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
his anger, and by a ſubtilty which his paſsion furniſhed him withall, he
made three culpable for that he found one innocent; the firſt, becauſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death was paſt againſt him, and was not to bee recalled without the
breach of law: the ſecond, for that hee was the cauſe of the death of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and thirdly, the executioner, for not obeying his commandement.</p>
                  <p>Concerning matter of warre, as it conſiſteth of differenced partes; ſo hath
choler diuers effectes. In caſe of diſcourſe and conſultation, when as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the minde ought to bee cleere of all violent affections, it greatly darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the vnderſtanding, and troubleth the ſincerity of a good iudgement, as
Caeſar noted in his ſpeech to the ſenate concerning Cateline:<note place="margin">Salust.</note> and therefore a
commander muſt, by al meanes indeuor to auoid, euen the leaſt motions of ſo
hurtfull a paſsion; and ſeaſon his affections, with that grauity and conſtancy of
ſpirit, that no turbulent diſpoſition may, either hinder his vnderſtanding,
or with-hold his will from following that courſe, which reaſon appointeth,
as the beſt means to a fortunate ſucceſſe: alwaies remembring, that al his actions
are preſented vpon a ſtage, and paſſe the cenſure of many curious beholders,
which applaud graue and patient motions, as the greateſt proofe of true wiſdom;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:22240:78"/>
and diſallow of paſsionate, and headſtrong affection, as derogating from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
cariage of an action, how iuſt ſoeuer otherwiſe it ſeemeth.</p>
                  <p>Concerning execution and furie of battaile, I take anger to be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
inſtrument to ſet valour on foote, and to ouerwage the difficulties of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
with a furious reſolution: for conſidering that the nobleſt actions of
the minde, ſtande in neede of the impulſions of paſsions, I take anger to bee
the fitteſt meanes, to aduance the valiant carriage of a battaile: for as feare is
trecherous and vnſafe; ſo anger is confident and of an vnquenchable heate;
and therefore a Commaunder ought by all meanes, to ſuggeſt matter of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
againſt an enemie, that his men may behold them with a wrathfull regard,
and thirſt after the daie of battell, to ſatiſfie their furie with the bloud of their
aduerſaries. If any vrge that it hath beene heretofore obſerued of the Galles,
that in the beginning of a battel they were more then men, and in the latter end
they were leſſe then women; and therfore a cholerick diſpoſition is not ſo fit for
ſeruice, as we ſeem to make it. I anſwere, that there is a difference between a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to choler, ſuch as was obſerued in the Galles, and the paſsion of anger,
wel kindled in the minde: for the firſt is ſubiect to alteration and contrarietie of
actions; but the other is furious, inuincible, neuer ſatisfied but with reuenge.
And ſo that of Ariſtotle is proued true, that anger ſerueth oftentimes as a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to vertue; whereunto ſome anſwere very pleaſantly, ſaying, it is a weapon
of a ſtrange nature: for wee doe manage other weapons, and this doeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
vs; our hande guideth not it, but it guideth our hande; it poſſeſſeth vs,
and not wee it, as it happened in the raigne of Tyberius, amongſt the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
legions at <hi>Vetera:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tacit. 1. Anal.</note> and therefore a Commaunder ought to take greate
heede, whome he maketh the obiect of that anger, which kindleth in his army:
for as it is a paſsion of terrible execution, and therefore needeth to bee wiſelie
directed; ſo is it dangerous in regarde of obedience, which was the only thing
which Caeſar required in his ſoldiors.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue this haſtie matter, and fall neerer that which we ſeeke after. I
may not omit the prognoſtication, which Caeſar made of the conſequence of
this accident, by the naturall diſpoſition of the people; the euent whereof
proued the trueth of his predictions; which ſheweth what aduantage a
learned general that hath bin ſomwhat inſtructed in the ſchoole of

which he before ſuſpected: for ſome of the states of Gallia
had ſent meſſengers vnto the Germaines, to leaue the bankes of
Rhene, and to come further into the continent, where they
ſhould find ready, whatſoeuer they deſired. Whereupon the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
began to make further incurſions, and to waſte the lande
as far as the confines of the<note n="*" place="margin">Liege.</note> Eburones. The Princes of the Galles
beeing called together, Caeſar thought it beſt to diſsemble what hee had diſcouered,
concerning their reuolt; and confirming their mindes with an approbation of their
loialtie, hee commanded certaine troupes of horſe to be leuied, and reſolued to make
warre vpon the Germains; and hauing made prouiſion of corne, hee directed his
march towards them. From whom as he was on the way, within a few daies iourney
of their campe, he receiued this meſſage: The Germains as they were not willing to
make warre vpon the Romains, ſo they would not refuſe to make triall of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
if they were iuſtly prouoked; for their ancient cuſtome was to anſwere an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
by force, and not by treaty; yet this much they woulde confeſſe, that they came
thither very vnwillingly, being driuen by violence out of their poſſeſsions. If the
Romaine people would accept of their friendſhip, and either giue them territories to
inhabite, or ſuffer them to keepe that which they had got by the lawe of armes, they
might proue profitable friends vnto them. They only yeelded to the Sueui, to whome
the Gods in feates of armes were inferior; any other nation they wold eaſily conquer.</p>
               <p>To this Caeſar anſwered what hee thought fit; but the purport of his ſpeech was,
that he could not make any league with them, if they continued in Gallia: neither
was it probable, that they that could not keepe their owne, would get poſſeſsions out
of other mens hands. Gallia had no vacant place to entertaine ſo great a multitude:
but if they would they might find a welcome, amongſt the<note n="*" place="margin">Colonia A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gripina.</note> Vbij, whoſe agents were
at that inſtant in his campe, complaining of the iniurie of the Sueui, and deſiring
aide againſt them; this much he himſelfe would intreat of the Vbij. The meſſengers
went backe with theſe Mandates, promiſing within three daies to returne againe
to Caeſar: in the meane time, they deſired him, not to bring his armie any neerer
their quarters; which requeſt Caeſar denied: for vnderſtanding that a fewe daies
before, a great part of their Caualrie were paſſed ouer the Moſa, he ſuſpected that
this delay imported nothing more then the returne of their horſemen.</p>
               <p>When Caeſar was come within twelue miles of their campe, their Ambaſſadors
returned; and meeting him on the way, entreated him earneſtly to march no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towardes them: but being denied of their ſuite, they beſought him to ſende to
thoſe troupes of horſe, which marched before the army, that they ſhould not fight nor
make anie hoſtile incounter; and that he would giue them leaue to ſend meſſengers
to the Vbij, of whoſe entertainement they woulde willingly accept, if the Princes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:22240:79"/>
and ſenate would ſweare faith &amp; ſafe continuance vnto their people: Neither would
they require more then 3. daies, to negotiat this buſines. Caeſar conceiued this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to import nothing elſe, then the returne of their horſemen that were abſent in
pillage, whom they expected within 3. daies; notwithſtanding hee promiſed them to
march but foure miles further that day, to a conuenient watring place: in the meane
time he ſent to the commanders of the horſe that were before, not to prouoke the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to fight; and if they were ſet vpon to ſuſtaine the charge, vntil he came neerer

deriue their concluſions from other principles, whereof inferiour ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects

                  <p>To conclude, the affaires of particular perſons are of ſo ſhort extenſion, and
incircled in ſo ſmall a compaſſe, that a meane capacitie may eaſily apprehend
the aduantages or inconueniences, which may enſue vppon the contract: and
therefore it is requiſite they ſhould ſtande to the aduenture, and their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is worthely taxed with the loſſe: but the buſineſſes of a common weale
are, both ſubiect to ſo many caſualties of fortune, and relie vpon ſuch vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

They doe not denie but that a wiſe Prince maie ſo carrie a treatie, that

his campe, to excuſe their fraudulent practiſe; and withall to
continue their petition of truce. Whereof Caeſar was exceeding
glad, and cauſed them to be kept in hold; and at the ſame inſtant,
brought his Armie out of the campe, commanding his horſemen to follow the legions,
becauſe they had beene daunted with ſo late an ouerthrow: And making a triple bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
marched ſpeedely eight miles, and ſo came vpon the Germans, before they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what had happened; and being terrified with our ſudden arriuall, and the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their owne leaders, knew not whether it were their beſt courſe, to bring forth
their forces, or to defend their campe, or otherwiſe to ſeeke their ſafety by flight. Which
tumult and feare was no ſooner perceiued by the Roman ſouldier, but calling to mind
their perfidious trecherie, they brake into the campe, and were at firſt a little reſiſted;
in the meane time, the women and children fled euery one awaie: which Caeſar per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,
ſent his horſemen to purſue them. The Germans hearing the clamour and
ſchrichings behinde their backes, and ſeeing their friends purſued and ſlaine, did caſt
awaie their weapons, and fled out of the campe, and comming to the confluence of the
Maſe and the Rhene, ſuch as had eſcaped caſt themſelues into the riuer; where, what
through feare, and wearineſſe, and the force of the water, were all drowned. In this
conflict the Romans loſt not a man: the number of the enemie was 430000 with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children. To them, whom he had retained in his campe, he gaue leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
but they fearing the crueltie of the Galles, deſired that they might continue
with the Romans: which Caeſar agreed vnto.</p>

to tranſport his Armie ouer the Rhene into the continent
of Germanie, for manie cauſes: whereof this was not the leaſt,
that ſeeing the Germans were ſo eaſily perſwaded, to bring their
colonies and their vagrant multitudes into Gallia: he thought
it good to make knowen vnto them, that the Roman people
could, at their pleaſure, carrie their forces ouer the Rhene into
Germanie. Moreouer, thoſe troupes of horſe, which were abſent at the late ouerthrow
of the Germans, were fled into the confines of the Sicambri; to whom, when Caeſar
ſent meſſengers to demand them to be ſent vnto him, they anſwered, that the Roman
Empire was limited by the Rhene: and if the Germans were interdicted Gallia, why
ſhould Caeſar challenge any authority in their quarters? Laſtly, the Vbij, who amongſt
all the reſt of the Germans had only accepted of Caeſars friendſhip, and giuen pledges
of their fidelitie, had made earneſt ſuit vnto him, to ſend them aid againſt the Sueui;
or at the leaſt to tranſport his Armie ouer the Rhene: for the name and opinion of the
Roman Armie was ſo great, and of ſuch fame, what with Ariouiſtus ouerthrow, and
this laſt ſeruice, that it ſounded honourable amongſt the furtheſt nations of Germany.
For theſe reaſons, Caeſar reſolued to paſse the Rhene: but to carrie his Armie ouer by
boate, was neither ſafe, nor for the maieſtie of the people of Rome. And albeit it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a matter of great difficultie, by reaſon of the breadth, ſwiftnes, and depth of the
riuer, to make a bridge; yet he reſolued to trie what he could doe, otherwiſe he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
not to paſse ouer at all: and ſo he built a bridge after this maner.</p>
               <p>At two foote diſtance, he placed two trees of a foot and halfe ſquare, ſharpened
at the lower end, and cut anſwerable to the depth of the riuer: theſe he let downe into
the water with engines, and droue them in with commanders, not perpendicularly,
after the faſhion of a pile, but gable wiſe and bending with the courſe of the water:
oppoſite vnto theſe he placed two other trees, ioyned together after the ſame faſhion,
being 40 foote diſtant from the former, by the dimenſion betweene their lower parts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:22240:82"/>
in the bottome of the water, and reclining againſt the courſe of the riuer: theſe two
paire of couples thus placed, he ioyned together with a beame of two foote ſquare, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to the diſtance betweene the ſaid couples, and faſtened them at each ende on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the couples, with braces and pins: whereby the ſtrength of the worke, and
nature of the frame was ſuch, that the greater the violence of the ſtreame was, and the
faſter it fell vpon the timber worke, the ſtronger the bridge was vnited in the coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and iointes. In like manner, he proceeded with couples, and beames, vntill the
worke was brought vnto the other ſide of the riuer: and then he laide ſtraight planks
from beame to beame, and couered them with hurdles; and ſo he made a floore to the
bridge. Moreouer, on the lower ſide of the bridge, he droue downe ſupporters, which
being faſtened to the timber worke, did ſtrengthen the bridge againſt the force of the
water; and on the vpper ſide of the bridge, at a reaſonable diſtance, he placed piles to
hinder the force of trees or boates, or what els the enemie might caſt downe to trouble
the worke: within ten daies, that the timber began to be cut downe and carried, the
worke was ended, and the Armie tranſported. Caeſar, leauing a ſtrong garriſon at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the bridge, went into the confines of the Sicambri.</p>

deſſignes of an heroick ſpirit, and the wonderfull effectes of magnanimous
induſtrie; that ſucceeding ages might not boaſt either of Arte or prowes, which
his vertue had not expreſſed; or otherwiſe might wonder at that worth, which
they themſelues coulde not attaine vnto: And to that purpoſe hee entertained
Virtuuius, the father of architecture, and as worthilie to bee imitated in that
facultie, as his maiſter Caeſar is in feates of armes. By whoſe example a great
commander may learne howe much it importeth the eternitie of his fame, to

of Arte, that no time will ſuffer the memorie thereof to periſh.</p>
                  <p>The workmanſhip of this bridge conſiſted chiefely in the oblique ſituation
of the double poſtes, whereof the firſt order bending with the ſtreame, and the

beames, which were faſtened in the couplings with braces, which

the iointes of the building were vnited, as may better appeare by a modell of
that making, then can be expreſſed by any circumſtance of wordes.</p>
                  <p>I might hence take occaſion to ſpeake of the diuerſitie of bridges, and of the
practiſes which antiquitie hath deuiſed to tranſport Armies ouer riuers: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as it is a common ſubiect for all that vndertake this militarie taske, and
hath beene handled by Lipſius,<note place="margin">Lib. de Machi.</note> vpon the occaſion of this bridge; I will refer the
reader to that place; and only note the ſingular diſpoſition of this action, in as
much as Caeſar made the meanes correſpondent to that end which he intended.
For conſidering that the chiefeſt end of his paſſage was, to let the Germans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the power of the Roman Empire was not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the Rhene;
and that a riuer could not ſo ſeparate their Territories, but that they were able to
ioine both the continents together, and make a common roade waie, where it
ſeemed moſt vnpaſſable: he thought it beſt to paſſe ouer his Army by a bridge,
that ſo the Germans might know the power of his forces, and alſo conceit their
Territories, as vnited vnto Gallia; or to be vnited at the pleaſure of the Romans,
with a firme Iſthmus &amp; plaine paſſage by foot, which in times paſt had alwaies
been ſeparated by a mightie riuer. Neither would a tranſportation by boat haue
wrought that effect, for as much as the daily vſe thereof was ſo familiar to the
Germans, that it nothing altered their imagination, of an vnacceſſible paſſage:
but when they ſaw ſo ſtrange a thing attempted, and ſo ſuddenly performed,
they would eaſily vnderſtand, that they were not ſo farre off, but that they might
be ouertaken; and ſo direct their demeanour accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſuffice therfore to proue, that a paſſage ouer a riuer by a bridge, is
more honourable, ſafe, and of greater terror to the enemy, then any other way
that can be deuiſed; eſpecially if the riuer carrie any depth, ſuch as the Rhene is
otherwiſe, if it haue either ſhallowes or foordes, whereby men may wade ouer,
without any great incombrance, it were but loſt labour to ſtand about a bridge;
but rather to thinke of it, as of a place incombred with ſuch hindrances, as men
often meete with in a march.</p>

not to be negligent in this dutie. Suetonius in the life of our Caeſar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that he neuer vndertooke any expedition, but he firſt receiued true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of the particular ſite, and nature of the country, as alſo of the maners
and qualitie of the people; and that he would not vndertake the voiage into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie,
vntill he had made perfect diſcouerie by himſelfe, of the magnitude and
ſituation of the Iland. Which Suetonius might vnderſtand by this firſt voiage,
which Caeſar would needes vndertake in the latter end of a ſommer, although it
were as he himſelfe ſaith, but to diſcouer.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded by auncient writers, that thoſe demigods that gouerned the
world in their time, gaue great honor to the exerciſe of hunting, as the perfect
image of warre in the reſemblance of all parts, and namely in the diſcouerie and
knowledge of a country; without which all enterpriſes, either of ſport in hunting,
or earneſt in warres were friuolous and of no effect. And therefore Zenophon
in the life of Cyrus, ſheweth that his expedition againſt the king of Armenia,
was nothing but a repetition of ſuch ſportes, as he had vſed in hunting. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
if the infinite examples regiſtred in hiſtorie, how by the dexteritie of ſome

required all thinges to be done at a becke, and in due time. The Councell being
diſmiſſed, hauing both wind and tide with him, he waighed anker, and ſailed eight
miles from that place, vnto a plaine and open ſhore. The Britaines perceiuing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
determination, ſent their horſe and chariots before, and the reſt of their forces
followed after, to the place where the Romans intended to land. Caeſar found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
difficult to land his men, for theſe reſpectes: the ſhips were ſo great, that they
could not be brought neere vnto the ſhore: the ſouldiers in ſtrange and vnknowne
places, hauing their hands laden with great and heauie weapons, were at one inſtant
to go out of the ſhippe, to withſtand the force of the billow, and to fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
whereas the Britaines either ſtanding vpon the ſhore, or making ſhort ſallies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water, did boldly caſt their weapons in knowen and frequented places, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
their horſes as accuſtomed to ſuch ſeruices.</p>
               <p>The Romans being terrified with theſe thinges, and altogether vnskilfull of this
kinde of fight, did vſe the ſame courage, as they were woont to doe in land ſeruices:
which when Caeſar perceiued, he cauſed the Galleies, that were both ſtrange to the
Britaines, and readier for vſe, to be remoued from the ſhippes of burthen, and to bee
rowed vp and downe, and laide againſt the open ſide of the enemie; that from thence
with ſlinges, engines &amp; arrowes, the enemy might be beaten vp from the water ſide;
which ſtood the Romans in good ſteede: for the Britaines, being troubled with the
ſtrangeneſſe of the Galleies, the motion of their Oares; and the vnuſuall kinde of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines;
were ſomewhat diſmaied, and began to retire backe, and giue waie to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:
but the ſoldiers ſtill lingering, and eſpecially for feare of the depth of the ſea, the
Eagle-bearer of the tenth legion deſiring the Gods, that it might fall out happely to
the legion: If you will (ſaith he) forſake your Eagle, O ye ſouldiers, and betraie it to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:22240:85"/>
the enemy, for mine owne part I will do my duty both to the common weale, and to
my Imperator, and hauing ſpoken this, with a loud voice, hee caſt himſelfe into the
ſea, and caried the Eagle towarde the enemy; the Romaines exhorting one another,
not to ſuffer ſuch a diſhonour to be committed, they all leaped out of the ſhip: which
when others that were neere at hande perceiued, they followed them with as great
alacritie, and preſſed towards the enemy to incounter with them. The fight on both
partes was very eager, the Romaines not being able to keepe any order of battell, nor
to get any firme footing, nor to follow their enſignes, foraſmuch as euery man kept
with thoſe enſignes, which he firſt met withal, were wonderfully troubled: But the
enemy acquainted with the flats and ſhallowes, as they beheld them from the ſhore to
come ſingle out of their ſhips, putting ſpurs to their horſe, woulde ſet vpon them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred
and vnprepared, and many of them would ouerlay a few; others would get
the aduantage of the open ſide, and caſt their weapons amongſt the thickest troupes
of them: which when Caeſar perceiued, he cauſed the ſhipboates and ſmaller veſſels
to be manned with ſoldiours, and where he ſawe neede of helpe, he ſent them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
ſuch as were ouercharged. As ſoone as the Romaines got footing on the firme
land, they made head together and charged the enemy, and ſo put them to flight; but
they were not able to follow them, nor take the Iland at that time, for want of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which thing was only wanting to Caeſars fortune.</p>

                  <head>THE FIRST OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon this circumſtance of landing, I may iuſtly take occaſion to
handle that controuerſie, which hath beene often debated by our
Engliſh Captaines, which is, whether it be better in queſtion of an
inuaſion, and in the abſence of our ſhipping, to oppoſe an enemy
at his landing vpon our coaſt; or quietly to ſuffer him to ſet his men on ſhore,
and retire our forces into ſome inland place, and there attend to giue him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell?
It ſeemeth that ſuch as firſt ſet this queſtion on foot, and were of an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we ought not by any meanes to encounter an enemy at his landing; for
ſo wee might much endanger our ſelues and our countrey; did ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vpon the authority of Monſieur de Langey, not obſeruing the difference
betweene an Iland and a continent. For where he ſetteth down that poſition, he
plainly aimeth at ſuch Princes, as border one vpon an other in the ſame conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:
but where their territories are diſioyned by ſo great a barre as the Ocean,
and haue not ſuch meanes to ſuppriſe one an other, it were meere folly to hold
good that rule, as ſhall better appeare by the ſequell of this diſcourſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I will firſt laie downe the reaſons, that may be vrged to proue it vnſafe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
an enemy at his landing, not as beeing vrged by that party; for I neuer
hearde any probable motiue from them which might induce any ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ſet down by ſuch as haue looked into the controuerſies, both with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and good iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it may be obiected, that it is a hard matter to reſiſt an enemy at his
landing, as well in regard of the vncertaintie of place, as of time: for beeing
ignorant in what place hee will attempt a landing, wee muſt either defende all
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:22240:86"/>
places of acceſſe, or our intentions wil proue meere friuolous; and to performe
that, it is requiſite that our defenſiue forces be ſufficient, according to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
qualitie of euery place ſubiect to danger: which conſidering the large
extenſion of our maritimate parts, and the manie landing places on our coaſt,
will require a greater number of men, then this Iland canne affoord. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it coulde furniſh ſuch a competent number, as might ſeeme in ſome
ſort ſufficient; yet the vncertainty of the time of the enemies arriuall, would
require that they ſhould be lodged, either vpon or neere the places of danger,
manie daies at leaſt, if not many weekes, before the inſtant of their attempt,
which woulde exhauſt a greater maſſe of treaſure, then could bee well affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be obiected, that all our landing places are of ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
for the defendantes; that it were no ſafetie at all to make heade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him at the landing: for in aſmuch as ſuch places are open and plaine,
they yeelde no commodity to ſhelter the defendantes from the fury of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie,
wherewith the enemy will plentifullie furniſh their long boates and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
veſſailes; which beating vpon the beach (for moſt of our landing places
are of that quality) will ſo ſcatter them, that no man ſhall bee able to indure the
inconuenience thereof.</p>
                  <p>The thirde obiection may ariſe from the diſparitie both of numbers,
and condition of the forces of either partie: for the firſt it muſt needes bee
granted, that the defendantes being to garde ſo many places at once, cannot
furniſh ſuch numbers to euerie particular place for defence, as the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
may for offence. Concerning the qualitie of the forces, it is without
queſtion, that a great and potent Prince, (for ſuch a one it muſt bee, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
to inuade the territories of ſo abſolute and well obeied a Princeſſe as
her Maieſtie is) woulde drawe out the floure of his ſolderie whereſoeuer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the gallant troupes of voluntaries, which do commonly attend ſuch ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Now theſe being thus qualified, and drawne into one head, and being to
make as it were but one body: how can it be reaſonably imagined (the time and
place of their attempt being vncertaine) that the defendants ſhould equal them
with forces of like vertue and experience?</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the reaſons, which may be drawne from the diſaduantage, which
they haue that go about to oppoſe an enemy at his landing: the reſt that haue
beene vrged, by ſuch as maintaine this opinion, are either impertinent to the
queſtion, or taken altogether from falſe grounds. But before I proceede to the
anſwere of theſe reaſons, I will lay this downe for a principle. That it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for any forraine Prince how puiſſant ſoeuer, to make ſuch a preparation as
ſhal be fitting to inuade a ſtate ſo populous, and reſpectiue of their ſoueragine,
(notwithſtanding the pretenſes deuiſed to diſſemble the ſame) but it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
be diſcouered, before it can bee made able to put any thing in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which I might enlarge by particularizing the infinite equipage, which
is required for ſo great a fleete. But I will reſt my ſelfe in the example of the
yeere 88. which proueth the diſcouery of the pretended inuaſion, before it could
come to execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:22240:86"/>
Concerning therefore the firſt obiection: it cannot indeed bee denied, but
the place of the enemies landing will be doubtfull,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> and therefore our care muſt
generally extend it ſelfe to all places of acceſſe: but that our defenſiue forces
are not ſufficient in a competent maner to garde all ſuch places, according as
the neceſſitie of them ſhall require, that is the point in queſtion. To prooue
that our forces are ſufficient: wee muſt neceſſarily enter into particularities,
wherein I will take Kent for a preſident, as not altogether vnacquainted with the
ſtate thereof; which, if I deceiue not my ſelfe, is a ſhore of as large extenſion
vpon the maritimate partes, as any other within this kingdom, for the breadth
thereof enlarging it ſelfe from the point of Neſſe by Lyd, which is the vttermoſt
skirt vpon the coaſt of Suſſex, vnto Margate vppon the coaſt of Eſſex; is by
computation about twenty foure miles: but notwithſtanding this large circuit,
who knoweth not that the ſixt part thereof is not ſubiect to the landing of ſuch
an enemy, as wee ſpeake of, partly in regarde of the hugeneſſe of the cliffes,
which do incloſe a great part of that skirt; and partly in regard that much of that
quantitie, which may be landed vpon, hath ſuch eminent and difficult places
neere adioyning, as an armie that ſhoulde put it ſelfe there on ſhore, ſhoulde
find it ſelfe being oppoſed but by a ſmall force, ſo ſtraitened, as they would not
eaſily find a way out, without apparant ruine of their whole forces. Further it
cannot be denied, but that generally along the coaſt of Kent, there are ſo many
rocks, ſhelues, flats, and other impediments, that a nauie of great ſhips canne
haue no commodity to anchor neere the ſhore: and for the moſt part the coaſt
lieth ſo open to the weather, that the leaſt gale of wind will put them from their
Anchor: all which particularities duly conſidered, it wil appeare that this large
skirt of Kent will affoord a far leſſer part fit for the landing of an army, then was
thought of at the firſt. And were it that ſo publike a treatiſe as this is, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
with good diſcretion ſuch an exact relation, as falleth within my knowledge
concerning this point, I would vndertake to make it ſo euident, by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
deſcription both of the number, quantity and qualitie of the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
as no man of an indifferent iudgement would imagine our forces to
be inſufficient, to affoord euery of them ſuch a ſafe and ſure garde, as ſhall bee
thought requiſite for the ſame. But foraſmuch as it is vnfitting to giue ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſatisfaction in this publike diſcourſe, giue me leaue, ſubmitting my ſelfe
alwaies to better iudgements, to giue a generall taſte of that meanes as woulde
ſecure all places, with a competent number of men.</p>
                  <p>Hauing ſhewed you before the circuit of the maritimat parts of Kent, I would
obſerue this order: firſt, to make a triple diuiſion of all ſuch forces, as ſhall be
appointed for this ſeruice; as for example, I wil ſuppoſe the number to be 12000
of which I would lodge 3000. about the point of Neſſe, and 3000. about Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
&amp; 6000. about Foulkſton, which I take to be as it were the center: for my
greateſt care ſhould be ſo to diſpoſe of them, as they might not only ſuccor one
an other in the ſame ſhire, but as euery ſhire bordereth one vpon an other; ſo
they ſhould mutually giue helpe one vnto an other, as occaſion ſhould bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
as if the enemy ſhoulde attempt a landing about Neſſe, not onely the
6000. lodged as before, ſhoulde march to their ſuccours, but ſuch alſo of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:22240:87"/>
Suſſex forces as were neere vnto that part; and ſo likewiſe of the reſt: by which
you may ſee how great a force would in few houres bee aſſembled, for the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
of any of theſe out skirts; and the rather, foraſmuch as the one halfe
of the whole forces are thus lodged in the center of the ſhire, which is neerer
to all parts then any other place whatſoeuer. There woulde alſo in the quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of them, an eſpeciall care bee had to the places of daunger, as might bee
anſwerable to the importance thereof: for my meaning is not to lodge them
cloſe together, but to ſtretch them out along the coaſt by regiments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
as the country might affoord beſt oportunity, to entertaine them.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the latter part of this obiection, which vrgeth the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of time, when the enemy ſhall make his approches: I holde it moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
that our defenſiue forces ſhould be drawne into a heade, before the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſhould be diſcouered neere our coaſt ready to put himſelfe on ſhoare: for
it were a groſſe abſurdity to imagine, that companies coulde vppon ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
be aſſembled, without confuſion; and make ſo long a march, with ſuch
expedition, as the neceſſity of the occaſion would require. Nowe for that huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
reſpect of her Maieſties coffers, which is vrged to ſuch extremity, as it
would be vnſupportable for this ſtate to beare: as I doubt not but good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
would much qualifie that ſuppoſed immoderate expence; ſo I aſſure my
ſelfe, that men of ſound iudgement, will deeme it much out of ſeaſon to diſpute
about vnneceſſary thrift, when the whole kingdome is brought in queſtion of
being made ſubiect to a ſtranger:
<q>
                        <l>Vt iugulent homines ſurgunt de nocte latrones,</l>
                        <l>Non expergeſceris, vt te ipſum ſerues?</l>
                     </q>
the enemy (peraduenture) hath kept 30000. men in paie 2. months before, to
make hauocke of our countrey, and to bring vs into perpetuall thraldome; ſhal
we thinke it much to maintaine ſufficient forces vppon our coaſt, to aſſure our
ſelues, that no ſuch enemy ſhall enter into our countrey? the extremity of this
charge woulde bee qualified by our good eſpiall, which would proportion our
attendance, with the neceſſity which is impoſed vpon vs to bee carefull in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of this nature. Let this ſuffice therefore to proue, that our forces are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to keepe the ſea coſt; and that the vncertainty of time, when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
will make his attempts, ought not to hinder vs from performing that dutie,
which the care and reſpect of our Prince and countrey impoſeth vpon euerie
good ſubiect, which is the ſubſtance of the firſt reaſon, which I ſet downe in the
beginning of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the ſecond reaſon, which vrgeth the diſaduantage of the
place,<note place="margin">The anſwere to the ſecond reaſon.</note> in regarde of the fury of the enemies artillery. True it is, that ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as yeelde the enemy commodity of landing, are for the moſt parte plaine
and open, and affoord naturally no couert at all. What then? ſhall a ſoldiour
take euery place as hee findeth it, and vſe no arte to qualifie the diſaduantages
thereof? or ſhall a man forgo the benefit of a place of aduantage rather, then
hee will relieue with induſtry the diſcommoditie of ſome particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
I make no queſtion but an ingenious commander, being in ſeaſonable
time lodged with conuenient forces vpon any of thoſe places, yea vppon the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:22240:87"/>
beach it ſelfe, which is vnapt to make defenſible, as anie place whatſoeuer;
woulde vſe ſuch induſtrie as might giue ſufficient ſecuritie to his forces, and
ouerwaie the enemie with aduantage of place; eſpecially conſidering that this
age hath affoorded ſuch plentifull examples of admirable inuentions in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe:
but this cannot be done, if our forces doe not make head before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of the enemies attempt, that our commanders may haue ſome time to
make readie ſtore of Gabions, handbaskets, with ſuch moueable matter as ſhal
be thought fit for that ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Neither let this trouble anie man, for I dare auouch it, that if our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are not drawne into a heade before the enemie bee diſcouered vppon
the coaſt, although wee neuer meane to oppoſe their landing, but attende
them in ſome inlande place, to giue them battaile; our Commanders will
bee farre to ſeeke of manie important circumſtances, which are requiſite in a
matter of that conſequence. And therefore let vs haue but a reaſonable time to
bethinke our ſelues of theſe neceſſaries, and we will eaſilie ouercome all theſe
difficulties, and vſe the benefit of the firme lande to repell an enemie, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the ſea, toſſed with the billow, troubled with his weapons, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other hinderances and diſcouragementes, which are preſented vnto him
both from the land and the ſea. He that ſaw the landing of our forces in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Fiall, in the yeere 97. can ſomewhat iudge of the difficulty of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for what with the working of the ſea, the ſteepneſſe of the cliffes, the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomnes
of their armes, the ſoldiors were ſo incombred, that had not the enemie
beene more then a coward, he might wel with 200. men haue kept vs from ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any part of that Iland.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the thirde obiection,<note place="margin">The anſwere to the third reaſon.</note> this briefelie ſhall bee ſufficient,
that wee are not ſo much to regarde that our forces doe equall them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as to ſee that they bee ſufficient for the nature of the place, to make
it good againſt the enemies landing: for wee knowe that in places of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and difficult acceſſe, a ſmall number is able to oppoſe a great; and wee
doubt not but all circumſtances duelie conſidered, wee ſhall proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
equall the enemie, both in number and qualitie of their forces: alwaies
preſuppoſed, that our ſtate ſhall neuer bee deſtitute of ſufficient forces trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and exerciſed in a competent maner, to defende their Countrey from
forraine enemies. For the neglect thereof, were to drawe on ſuch as of
themſelues are but too forwarde, to make a praie of vs; and to make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt,
not onelie to oppoſe an enemies landing, but to defende our ſelues
from beeing ouerrunne, as other nations liuing in ſecurity, without due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
thereof, haue beene.</p>
                  <p>And this much concerning the anſwere to thoſe three reaſons, which
ſeeme to prooue that an enemie is not to bee reſiſted at his landing. Nowe
if we do but looke a little into the diſcommodities, which follow vpon the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of an enemy, we ſhall eaſilie diſcouer the dangerouſneſſe of this opinion:
as firſt, we giue him leaue to liue vpon the ſpoile of our countrey, which cannot
be preuented by any waſting, ſpoiling, or retiring of our prouiſions, in ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
a countrey as this is, eſpecially conſidering that wee haue no ſtrong townes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:22240:88"/>
at all to repoſe our ſelues vpon. Whereof wee neede no further teſtimonie,
then is deliuered vnto vs out of the ſeuenth booke of theſe Commentaries, in
that war, which Caeſar had with Vercingetorix.</p>
                  <p>Secondly obedience, which at other times is willingly giuen to Princes, is
greatly, weakened at ſuch times; whereby all neceſſary meanes to maintaine a
war is hardly drawn from the ſubiect. Thirdly, oportunity is giuen to malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and ill diſpoſed perſons, either to make head themſelues, or to flie to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
Fourthly, the madnes to aduenture a kingdom vpon one ſtroke, hauing it
in our diſpoſition to do otherwiſe, with many other diſaduantages, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of any ſuch occaſion would diſcouer.</p>

excuſing it by their ignorance, he commanded hoſtages to be deliuered vnto him:
which they preſently performed in parte; and the reſt being to bee fet further off,
ſhoulde likewiſe be rendered within a ſhort time; in the meane while, they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their people to returne to their poſſeſsions, and their Rulers and Princes came
out of all quarters to commende themſelues and their ſtates to Caeſar. The peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus concluded; foure daies after that Caeſar came into Britanie, the eighteen
ſhippes which were appointed for the horſemen, put out to ſea with a gentle winde,
and approaching ſo neere the coast of Britanie, that they were within viewe of the
Romaine campe: there aroſe ſuch a ſodaine tempest, that none of them were able to
holde their courſe, but ſome of them returned to the porte from whence they
came; otherſome were caſt vpon the lower part of the Ilande, which lieth to the
Weſt warde; and there caſting anchor tooke in ſuch ſeas, that they were forced to
commit themſelues againe to the ſea, and direct their courſe to the coaſt of Gallia.
The ſame night it happened, that the moone being in the full, the tides were verie
high in thoſe ſeas; whereof the Romaines being altogether ignorant, both the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
which were drawne vp vpon the ſhore were filde with the tide, and the ſhippes
of burthen that laie at anchor, were ſhaken with the tempeſt, neither was there
anie helpe to be giuen vnto them: ſo that many of them were rent, and ſplit in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and the reſt loſt both their anchors, Gables and other tackling: and by that
meanes became altogether vnſeruiceable. Whereat the whole armie was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie
troubled; for there was no other ſhipping to recarrie them bcke againe:
Neither had they anie neceſſaries to newe furniſh the olde: and euerie man knew
that they muſt needes winter in Gallia; for as much as there was no prouiſion of corn
in thoſe places where they were. Which thing beeing knowne to the Princes of
Britanie, that were aſſembled to confer of ſuch thinges as Caeſar had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to performe, when they vnderſtood that the Romaines wanted both their
horſemen, ſhipping, and prouiſion of corne, and coniecturing of the paucitie of their
forces, by the ſmall circuit of their camp; and that which was more important then
all the reſt, that Caeſar had tranſported his ſoldiours without ſuch neceſſarie cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
as they vſed to take with them: they thought it their beſt courſe to rebell,
and to keepe the Romaines from corne and conuoies of prouiſion, and ſo prolong the
matter, vntil winter came on. For they thought that if theſe were once ouerthrown
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:22240:89"/>
and cut off from returning into Gallia, neuer any man would afterward aduenture
to bring an army into Britanie: therefore they conſpired againe the ſecond time, and
conuaied themſelues by ſtealth out of the campe, and got their men priuily out of the
fields, to make head in ſome conuenient place againſt the Romans.</p>

ſo ignorant of the ſpring tides, which happen in the full and
new of the moone. It is obſerued by experience, that the motion of this waterie
element is altogither directed by the courſe of the moon, wherin ſhe exerciſeth
her regency, according as ſhee findeth the matter qualified for her influence.
And for aſmuch as all mediterrean ſeas, and ſuch gulfes as are incloſed in ſinues
and boſomes of the earth, are both abridged of the liberty of their courſe, and
through the ſmallnes of their quantity, are not ſo capable of celeſtiall power;
as the Ocean it ſelfe: it conſequently followeth, that the Tuskane ſeas, wherwith
the Romains were chiefly acquainted, were not ſo anſwerable in effect to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the moon, as the maine ſea, whoſe bounds are ranged in a more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

the vertue of the moone. The Ocean therfore being thus obedient to the
courſe of the celeſtial bodies, taking hir courſe of flowing from the North, falleth
with ſuch a currant between the Orcades, and the maine of Noruegia; that ſhe
filleth our channel between England and France, with great ſwelling tides; and
maketh her motion more eminent in theſe quarters, then in any other partes of
the world. And hence it happeneth, that our riuer of Thames, lying with her
mouth ſo ready to receiue the tyde as it commeth, and hauing withall a plaine
leuelled belly, and a very ſmal freſh currant, taketh the tide as far into the land, as
any other known riuer of Europe. And for this cauſe the Romans were ignorant

Caeſar ſuſpecting that which in deede was true, that the Britaines were entered into

commanding other two to take their place, and the reſt to arme themſelues, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

he had marched ſome diſtance from the campe, he ſaw his men ouercharged with the

they had wound themſelues betweene anie troupes of horſe, they forſooke their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots

were ſo readie with daily practiſe, that they could ſtaie in the decliuitie of a ſteepe

along the beame of the coach and reſt vpon the yoake, or harneſse of their horſes, and
returne as ſpeedely againe at their pleaſure. The Romans being thus troubled, Caeſar
came to reſcue them in verie good time: for at his comming, the enemie ſtood ſtill;
and the ſouldiers gathered their ſpirits vnto them, and began to renew their courage
that was almoſt ſpent. Caeſar, thinking it an vnfit time, either to prouoke the enemy,
or to giue him battell; he continued a while in the ſame place: And then returned

this part of militarie knowledge, being ſo ſtrong a meanes to maintaine valour,
and the ſinew of all our abilitie: for order correſpondent to circumſtances, is
the whole ſtrength and power of an Armie. Neither ought there any action in

Romans did neither eate nor ſleepe, without the direction of the Conſull, or
chiefe commander; otherwiſe their valour might rather haue beene tearmed

We are therfore to vnderſtand, that whenſoeuer a Roman Generall had carried

their Empire; that then the ſenate did decree a ſupplication to the Gods, in the

it was a matter of great honour, that in their names the Temples of their

And Liuie in his 26 booke ſaith, that it was long diſputed on in the ſenate, how
they could denie one that was there preſent to triumph, whoſe abſence they had
honoured, with ſupplication, and thankeſgiuing to the Gods, for things happily

with garlands, went to all the temples of the Gods, and there offered ſacrifices,
to gratulate the victorie in the name of the Generall. In which time they were
forbidden all other buſineſſes, but that which pertained to this ſolemnity. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that this time of ſupplication, was at firſt included within one or two daies
at the moſt, as appeareth by Liuie in his third booke, where he ſaith, that the
victorie gained by two ſeuerall battels, was ſpitefully ſhut vp by the ſenat in one

The inner part of Britanie is inhabited, by ſuch as memory recordeth to be borne
in the Iland; and the maritimate coaſt by ſuch as came out of Belgia, either to make
incurſions or inuaſions; and after the war was ended, they continued in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they had gained, and were called by the name of the cities from whence they
came: the countrey is very populous, and well inhabited with houſes, much like
vnto them in Gallia. They haue great ſtore of cattell, and vſe braſſe for money, or
yron ringes waighed at a certaine rate. In the mediterranean partes there is found
great quantity of Tyn, and in the maritimate parts yron: their braſſe was brought
in by other nations. They haue all ſorts of trees that they haue in Gallia, excepting
the figge and the Beech. Their religion will not ſuffer them to eate, either Haire,
Hen, or Gooſe; notwithstanding they haue of all ſorts, as well for nouelty as variety.
The country is more temperate, and not ſo colde as Gallia. The Ilande lieth triangle
wiſe, whereof one ſide confronteth Gallia, of which ſide that angle, wherein Kent
is pointed to the Eaſt, and the other angle to the South: this ſide containeth about
500. mile. Another ſide lieth toward Spaine and the Weſt, that waie where Ireland
lieth, being an Ilande halfe as big as England; and as farre diſtant from it as Gallia:
in the midway between England &amp; Ireland, lieth an Iland called Mona, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſmaller Ilands, of which ſome write that in winter time for 30. daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they haue continuall night, whereof we learned nothing by inquirie, only we
found by certaine meaſures of water, that the nights in England were ſhorter then
in the Continent. The length of this ſide, according to the opinion of the inhabitants,
containeth 700. mile. The thirde ſide lieth to the North and the open ſea, ſauing
that this angle doth ſomwhat point towards Germanie; this ſide is thought to contain
800. miles: And ſo the whole Iland containeth in circuit 2000. miles. Of al the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
they of Kent are moſt curteous and ciuill; al their countrey bordering vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the deſcriptions of the ancient Britains, we may firſt obſerue their
pedegree, according to the Haraldry of that time: wherein we muſt
vnderſtand that in thoſe ages, the Ntiaons of the worlde thought
it no ſmall honor, to deriue their deſcent from a certaine beginning,
and to make either ſome of their Gods, or ſome man of a famous memorie, the
father of that progenie, and founder of their ſtate; that ſo they might promiſe
a fortunate continuance to their gouernment, being firſt laide and eſtabliſhed
by ſo powerfull a meanes. But if this failed, they then bragged of antiquitie,
and caſt all their glory vpon the fertility of their ſoile, being ſo ſtrong and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that it yeelded of it ſelfe ſuch a people, as they were: and ſo we read howe
the Athenians, for as much as they were ignoraunt from whence they came,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:22240:95"/>
ware an Oaken leafe, in token that they were bred of the earth where they dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
And hereupon alſo grew the controuerſie, betweene the Egyptians and the
Scythians, concerning antiquity: wherein the Egyptians ſeemed to haue great
aduantage, becauſe of the fertility and heat of their countrey; whereas the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
inhabited a colde climate, vnfruitfull and an enemy to generation. Of
this ſort were the Britains, that inhabited the mediterranean part of the Ilande:
who not knowing from whence they came; nor who firſt brought them thither,
ſatisfied themſelues with that common receiued opinion, that they were borne
and bred of the earth. The ſea coaſt was poſſeſt by ſuch as came out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and retained the names of the cities from whence they came, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of their progenitors.</p>
                  <p>The forme of the Iland is very well deſcribed, and meaſured out, according
to the ſcale of our moderne Geographers. For concerning the difference of
longitude between the Eaſterne angel of Kent, and the furtheſt point of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,
they make it eight degrees; which in a maner iumpeth with Caeſars dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration:
the other ſides are ſomewhat longer; and therefore. Tacitus in the life
of Agricola, compareth it to a Carpenters Axe, making that ſide which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
vpon France to reſemble the Edge; and the other two ſides to incline by
little and little, one towardes an other; and ſo make the Ilande narrower at the
top, according to the forme of that inſtrument. Hee ſetteth downe the whole
compaſſe of the Iland, according to the manner of the ancient Geographers,
who by the quantity of the circuit, did vſually iudge of the content, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the <hi>Area</hi> of euery figure dependeth as well of the quantity of the
angle, as the length of the ſide. Concerning the temperature of Britanie, in
regard of the colde winters in France, we muſt vnderſtand that Britanie hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beene found of a more temperate conſtitution, in regarde of ſharpe and
colde winters, then any other countrey lying vnder the ſame parallell: whether
the cauſe thereof may bee imputed to the continuall motion of the ſea about
the Iland, which begetteth heat, as ſome haue imagined; or to the ſite thereof,
in regard of other Continents from whence the winde alwaies riſeth, and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with it the nature of the countrey by which it paſſeth; and ſo the Ilande ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no other continent lying North to it, from whence the winde may riſe, but
all for the moſt part vpon the South, hath no ſuch colde windes to diſtemper it,
as other parts of Germany, which are vnder the ſame parallel; but the Southern
wind, which is ſo frequent in Britany, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pereth the ayre, with a mild diſpoſition,
and ſo keepeth it warme; or whether it be ſome other vnknowne cauſe, our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
reſt vnſatisfied. But as touching Gallia, it may bee ſaide, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it beareth more to the South, then this Iland doth, the aire thereof by
reaſon of the continuall heate, is of a farre purer diſpoſition; and ſo pierceth
more then this groſſer aire of Britany, &amp; carieth the cold further into the pores;
and ſo ſeemeth ſharper and of a far colder diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>This Iland, which Caeſar nameth <hi>Mona,</hi> is known at this time by the name of
<hi>Man,</hi> and lieth betweene Cumberland and Ireland. Ptolemie calleth it <hi>Monaeda,</hi>
Tacitus calleth Angleſey by the name of <hi>Mona,</hi> peraduenture from the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Britains, who calleth it <hi>Tyr mon,</hi> the land of Mon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:22240:95"/>
Concerning thoſe places, where the night continueth in the midſt of winter
for 30. daies together, they muſt be ſited 6. degrees beyond the circle Articke,
and haue a day in ſummer of like continuance, according to the rules of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.
In that he found the nights in Britanie ſhorter then in the continent, we
muſt vnderſtand it to be only in ſummer: for the more oblique the horizon is,
the more vneuen are the portions of the diurnall circles which it cutteth; and
the neerer it commeth to a right horizon, the neerer it commeth to an equality
of daie and night: and hence it happeneth, that in ſummer time, the nights in
France are longer then here in England; and in winter ſhorter. The like wee
muſt vnderſtand of all Sotherne and Northerne countries.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I may not omit the ciuility of the Kentiſh men, and their curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpoſition, aboue the reſt of the Britains, which muſt be imputed to that
ordinarie courſe which brought ciuility vnto all other nations: of whom ſuch
as were firſt ſeated in their poſſeſſions, and entertained ſocietie, were the firſt
that brought in ciuill conuerſation, and by little and little were purified, and ſo
attained to the perfection of ciuill gouernment. So we find that firſt Aſſirians
and Babilonians (as neereſt to the mountaines of Armenia where the Arke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and people firſt inhabited) reduced their ſtates into common weales, of
monarchies of exquiſite gouernment, floriſhing with al maner of learning and
knowledge; when as yet other countries laie either waſte, or ouerwhelmed with
Barbariſme. From thence it flowed into Egypt; out of Egypt into Greece; out
of Greece into Italie; out of Italie into Gallia; and from thence into England:
where our Kentiſhmen firſt entertained it, as bordering vpon France; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
with marchants of thoſe countries.</p>

their owne men, beeing too venturous in the purſuit. The
Britaines after ſome intermiſsion of time, when the Romans
litle thought of them, &amp; were buſied in fortifying their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe,
came ſodainly out of the woods and charged vpon thoſe that kept ſtation before the
campe. Caeſar ſent out two the thickest cohorts of two legions, to ſecond their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes:
theſe two cohortes ſtanding with a ſmall alley betweene them, the other
that were firſt charged, being terrified with that ſtrange kinde of fight, boldelie
brake through the chiefeſt of the enemy, and ſo retired in ſafetie to their fellowes.
That daie Quintus Laberius Durus a Tribune of the ſoldiours, was ſlaine; the
Britaines were repelled with moe cohortes, which Caeſar ſent to ſecond the former.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:22240:96"/>
And for aſmuch as the fight happened in the vewe of all the campe, it was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceiued, that the legionarie ſoldiors, being neither able for the waight of their
armor, to follow the enemy as he retired, nor yet daring to go far from his enſigne;
was not a fit aduerſarie to conteſt this kind of enemy: and that the horſemen like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
fought with no leſſe danger, inaſmuch as the enemy would retire backe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and when they had drawne them a little from the legions, they woulde then
light from their chariots and incounter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with that aduantage, which is between
a footeman and a horſeman. Furthermore, they neuer fought thicke and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but thin and in great diſtances, hauing ſtations of men to ſuccour one another,
to receiue the wearie, and to ſend out freſh ſupplies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ppon this occaſion of their heauie armour, I will deſcribe a legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie
ſoldior in his compleat furniture, that we may better iudge
of their maner of warfare, and vnderſtand wherein their greateſt
ſtrength conſiſted. And firſt we are to learne, that their legionarie
ſoldiors were called <hi>Milites grauis armaturae,</hi> ſoldiors wearing heauie armour, to
diſtinguiſh them from the Velites, the Archers, ſlingers, and other light armed
men. Their offenſiue armes were, a couple of Piles, or as ſome wil, but one Pile,
and a Spaniſh ſword, ſhort and ſtrong, to ſtrike rather with the point then with
the edge. Their defenſiue armes were, a helmet, a corſlet, and boots of braſſe,
with a large Target; which in ſome ſort was offenſiue, in regarde of that <hi>vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonem</hi>
which ſtucke out in the middeſt thereof. The Pile is deſcribed at large
in the firſt booke, and the Target in the ſecond: the ſworde (as Polybius wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth)
was ſhort, two edged, yerie ſharpe, and of a ſtrong point: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Liuie in his 22. Booke ſaieth, that the Galles vſed verie long ſwordes
without pointes; but the Romaines had ſhort ſwordes, readier for vſe; theſe
they called Spaniſh ſwordes, becauſe they borrowed that faſhion from the
Spaniarde. The olde Romaines were ſo girt with their ſwordes, as appeareth
by Polybius, and their monuments in Marble, that from their left ſhoulder it
hung vpon their right thigh, contrary to the vſe of theſe times, which as I haue
noted before, was in regard of their target, which they caried on their left arme:
this ſworde was hung with a belt of leather, beſet with ſtuds as Varro noteth, and
theſe were their offenſiue weapons.<note place="margin">Lib. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Helmet was of braſſe,<note place="margin">Pli. lib. 10.</note> adorned with three Oſtrich feathers of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
in length, by which the ſoldiour appeared of a large ſtature, and more
terrible to the enemie, as Polybius ſaieth in his 6. booke. Their breſt plate was
either of braſſe, or Iron, ioynted together after the maner of ſcales, or platted
with little ringes of yron: their bootes were made of barres of braſſe, from
the foote vp to the knee. And thus were the legionarie ſoldiours armed, to
ſtand firme rather then to vſe any nimble motion, and to combine themſelues
into a bodie of that ſtrength which might not eaſilie recoile, at the oppoſition
of anie confrontment; for agilitie ſtandeth indifferent to helpe either a retreit
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:22240:96"/>
or a purſuit, and nimble footed ſoldiors are as readie to flie backe, as to march
forward; but a waighty body keepeth a more regular motion, and is not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a common counterbuffe: ſo that whenſoeuer they came to firme buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keling,
and felt the enemy ſtand ſtiffe before them, ſuch was their practiſe, and
exerciſe in continual workes, that they neuer fainted vnder any ſuch taske; but
the victorie went alwayes cleere on their ſide. But if the enemy gaue waie
to their violence, and came not in but for aduantage, and then as ſpeedilie
retired, before the counterbuffe were well diſcharged; then did their nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
much helpe their weakeneſſe, and fruſtrate the greateſt parte of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
diſcipline. This is alſo proued in the ouerthrowe of Sabinus and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
where Ambiorix finding the inconuenience of buckeling at handy blowes,
commaunded his men to fight a far off; and if they were aſſaulted, to giue
backe; and to come on againe as they ſaw occaſion: which ſo wearied out the
Romaines, that they all fell vnder the execution of the Galles. Let this ſuffice
therefore to ſhew, how vnapt the Romans were to flie vpon any occaſion, when
their armour was ſuch, that it kept them from al ſtarting motions, and made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſutable to the ſtaied and wel aſſured rules of their diſcipline, which were as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
principles in the execution of a ſtanding battaile; and therefore not ſo fit
either for a purſuit, or a flight.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the vnequall combat betweene a horſeman and a footeman, it
may be thought ſtrange, that a footeman ſhoulde haue ſuch an aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a horſeman, beeing ouermatched, at leaſt with a Sextuple proportion
both of ſtrength and agilitie: but wee muſt vnderſtande, that as the horſe is
much ſwifter in a long cariere; ſo in ſpeedie and nimble turning at hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſubſtance of the combate conſiſteth, the footeman farre exceedeth the
horſeman in aduantage, hauing a larger marke to hit by the Horſe, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath. Beſides, the horſeman ingageth both his valour, and his fortune
in the good ſpeede of his horſe, his woundes and his death doe conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
pull the rider after, his feare or furie maketh his maiſter either deſperate or
ſlowe of performance, and what defect ſoeuer riſeth from the horſe, muſt bee
anſwered out of the honour of the rider. And ſurely it ſeemeth reaſonable,
that what thing ſoeuer draweth vs into the ſocietie of ſo great a hazard, ſhould
as much as is poſſible, be contained in the compaſſe of our owne power. The
ſword which we manage with our owne hand, affoordeth greater aſſurance then
the harquebuſe, wherein there are many partes belonging to the action, as the
pouder, the ſtone, the ſpring, and ſuch like; whereof if the leaſt faile of his part,
we likewiſe faile of our fortune: but howe probable ſoeuer this ſeemeth, this is
certaine, that in the courſe of the Roman wars, the horſe were euer defeated by
the foot, as is manifeſtly proued in the firſt of theſe bookes.</p>

and that a great commander hath nothing common with other leaders: but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
he crieth out at the baſeneſſe of the Britains, that woulde ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſo cowardly to be beaten. But if wee looke into the circumſtances of the
action, we ſhal find both Art &amp; good direction therein; for being aſſured by the

difficultie wherof was much relieued by good direction, which conſiſted of two
pointes, firſt, by ſending ouer the horſemen in the front of the legions, who
might better indure the charge of the enemie, then the footmen coulde, that
were vppe to the necke in water; and withall, to ſhelter the footmen from the

whereof, the horſemen durſt neuer aduenture further then the legions, neither was
there anie more ſpoile done in the countrey, then that which the legionarie ſouldiers
did of themſelues. In the meane time, the Trinobantes, being almoſt the greateſt ſtate
of all thoſe countries (from whom Mandubratius had fled to Caeſar into Gallia, for
that his father Imanuentius holding the kingdome, was ſlaine by Caſsiuellaunus) ſent
Ambaſſadours to Caeſar, to offer their ſubmiſsion, and to intreat that Mandubratius
might be defended from the oppreſsion of Caſsiuellaunus, and ſent vnto them to take
the kingdome. Caeſar hauing receiued from them fortie pledges, and corne for his

The Britaines call a towne a thicke wood, incloſed about with a ditch and a rampier,
made for a place of retrait when they ſtood in feare of incurſions from the borderers.
Thither marched Caeſar with his Armie, and found it well fortified both by arte and
nature: And as he aſſaulted it in two ſeuerall places, the enemie vnable to keepe it,
caſt himſelfe out of the towne by a backe waie, and ſo he tooke it. Where he found great

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue heard it oftentimes contradicted by ſome, that vnderſtand not
the waight of a multitude, when it was ſaid, that an Armie keeping
head continually in one part of a kingdome, was more burthenſome
to the common-wealth in regard of the expence of victuals, then
when it was diſperſed into particular cities and families, before the time of the
muſter and inrolement: for (ſay they) in the generall account of the publike
weale, it differeth nothing, whether a multitude of 30000 men be maintained
with neceſſarie prouiſions in one intire body together, or diſperſed particularly
throughout euerie part of the countrie: foraſmuch as euerie man hath but a
competent quantitie allotted vnto him, which hee cannot want in what ſort or
condition of life ſoeuer he be ranged; neither doth the charge of a multitude
grow in regard they are vnited together, but in regard they amount to ſuch a
multitude whereſoeuer. But ſuch as looke into the difference with iudgement,
ſhall finde a maruellous inequalitie, both in regarde of the portion of victuals
which is ſpent, and the meanes whereby it is prouided: for firſt we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:22240:99"/>
that an armie lying continually in one place, falleth ſo heauie vpon that
part, that it quickly conſumeth both the fatte and the fleſh (as they ſay) and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
nothing vnſpent, which that part can affoord them; and without further
ſupply of prouiſions, would in a ſmall time come to vtter deſtruction. This want
then muſt be relieued by taking from the plentie of other bordering quarters, to
furniſh the wants of ſo great a multitude: wherin there cannot be obſerued that
proportion of moderate taking, to vittaile the Armie with a ſufficient compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,
but the partiall reſpect which the purueiers, and vittailers will haue to
their priuat commodity, wil quickly make an inconuenience either in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
from whence it is taken; or in the Armie, for which it is prouided; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the errour may beſt aduantage their particular, what diſcipline ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be eſtabliſhed in that behalfe. Whereas on the contrarie part, when euerie
particular man of that multitude ſhal be billeted in a ſeueral family, throughout
all parts of the kingdome, the charge will be ſo inſenſible, in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the ſaid families, that the country will neuer feele any inconuenience.
And if euerie houſholder that had receiued into his houſe one of the ſaid army,
ſhould giue a true account of that which riſeth aboue his ordinary expence; by
the addition of one man, it would fall farre ſhort of that treaſure, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
required, to maintaine the ſaide number of men vnited together into
one bodie. Neither doth the difference conſiſt in the quantitie of vittailes, which
euerie man hath for his portion, whether they be diſperſed or vnited; but in the
maner of prouiſion, and the meanes which is vſed to maintaine them: wherein
euery maſter or ſteward of a familie, endeuoureth to make his prouiſions at the
beſt hand, &amp; ſo to husband it, that it may ſerue for competencie, and not for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie;
and by that means, the general plenty of the country is maintained,
&amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth floriſheth by well directed moderation. But in the victua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an army, there is no ſuch reſpect had, which may any way aduantage the

waſting, rather then by thrift and ſauing frugalitie: and ſo the common-wealth
is weakned by the il husbanding of that great portion of vittaile, which is
allowed for ſo great a multitude. And if they ſhould haue ſuch varietie of viands
in an Armie, as they haue when they are in ſeuerall families, it were vnpoſſible
it ſhould continue any time together. And therefore the Romans, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the exactneſſe of their diſcipline, could affoord their armies no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
but corne, and larde, as well in regard of the commoditie which that
kinde of diet affoorded them in the courſe of their warres, as alſo for the good
of that countrey, wherein they were reſident. And if it ſo fell out, that the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of the ſeaſon, or any other cauſe, had brought a dearth into the lande,
there was no readier waie to helpe that inconuenience, then by diſperſing their
Armies into diuers quarters; which Caeſar diſpoſed with that care, that they
might be as neere together as they could.</p>

Sabinus &amp; Cotta into their confines, and brought them
in corne to the place, where they laie; at the inducement of

and ſuddenly ſurpriſing thoſe that were gone abroad to get
wood, came with a great power to aſsault the campe. But when our men had tooke
Armes, and were got vppe vpon the rampier, and had ouermatched them in a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
of horſe, which made a ſallie out of the campe vpon the Galles: Ambiorix
deſpairing of good ſucceſſe, withdrew his men from the aſsault; and then after their
manner, they cried vnto vs, that ſome of our companie ſhould come and ſpeake with
them: for they had ſomewhat to diſcouer touching the publike ſtate, whereby they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
all controuerſies might be ended. Whereupon Caius Carpineius a Roman horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and one of Titurius his familiar friendes, and one Iunius a Spaniard, who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:22240:100"/>
diuers times before had beene ſent by Caeſar to Ambiorix; were ſent out to treat
with them. Ambiorix firſt acknowledged himſelfe much indebted to Caeſar; for
manie curteſies, in that by his meanes hee was freed from a penſion which hee pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Aduatici; and for that both his own ſonne, and his brothers ſonne, whom
the Aduatici had held in priſon vnder the name of hoſtages, were by Caeſar relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſent home againe. And touching the aſsault of the campe, hee had done
nothing of himſelfe, but by the impulſion of the state, among whom ſuch was his
condition, that the people had as great authoritie ouer him, as he himſelfe had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the people: who were likewiſe inforced to this warre, becauſe they could not
withſtand the ſudden inſurrection of the Galles, whereof his ſmall meanes might be
a ſufficient argument. For his experience was not ſo little, to thinke himſelfe able
with ſo ſmall a power to ouerthrow the people of Rome; but it was a generall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
throughout all Gallia, vpon this daie to aſsault all Caeſars garrizons, to the end
that one legion might not giue reliefe vnto another: Galles could not eaſily denie the
requeſt of Galles, eſpecially when it concerned their publike libertie. Nowe hauing
ſatiſfied that duetie which he owed to his countrey, hee had reſpect to Caeſar and his
benefites, in regard whereof, he admoniſhed them, and praied Titurius for the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie
that had beene betweene them, that he would looke to the ſafetie of himſelfe,
and his ſouldiers. There were a great number of Germaines that had alreadie paſsed

For oftentimes the minde is ſo diſquieted, with the extremitie
of perturbation, that neither the apprehenſion can take ſound inſtructions, nor
the iudgment determine of that which is moſt for our good: but according as
any paſſion ſhall happen to raigne in our diſpoſition; ſo are we caried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

where as the bodie continueth firme in his owne ſtrength, and

of the ſpirit doe not diſaduantage thoſe meanes, which either our owne
power or oportunitie, hath gained in our actions. Wherein a commander
cannot haue a better rule for his direction, then to beware, that violence of
paſſion doe not hinder the courſe of ſound deliberation: and withall, to bee
iealous of whatſoeuer an enemie ſhall, either by ſpeech or action, ſeeme to
thruſt vpon him, how colourable ſoeuer the reaſons maie be, which are allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to induce him thereunto. For firſt, if the minde be not confirmed by the
vertue of her better faculties, to reſiſt the motion of fruitleſſe apprehenſions,
it may eaſily bee ſeduced either by feare or vaine imagination, diffident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
or ouer eaſie credulitie, with manie other ſuch diſturbing powers,
from that waie, which a good diſcretion and an vnderſtanding, free from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

of our iudgment well ſettled, with a firme reſolution, and with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the minde, before wee enter into deliberation of ſuch thinges, as are
made happie vnto vs by good direction. And then this, amongſt other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
will giue ſome helpe to a good concluſion; when we conſider how
improbable it is, that an enemie, whoſe chiefeſt care is to weaken his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and bring him to ruine, ſhould aduiſe him of anie thing that maie concerne
his good; vnleſſe the profite, which he himſelfe ſhall thereby gather, doe farre
exceede that which the contrarie part may expect. I grant that in ciuill warres,
where there are many friendes on either partie, and haue the aduerſe cauſe as
deere vnto them as their owne; there are oftentimes many aduertiſements gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
which proceede from a true and ſincere affection, and maie aduantage

albeit thoſe thinges were ſpoken by an enemie, yet they thought
them no way to be neglected; but eſpecially it moued them, for
that it was incredible that the Eburones, beeing baſe and of
no reputation, durſt of themſelues make war againſt the people
of Rome: and therefore they propounded the matter in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
wherein there grew a great controuerſie among them: L.
Arunculeius and moſt of the Tribunes, and Centurions of the firſt orders, thought
it not good to conclude of any thing raſhlie, nor to depart out of their wintering
campes, without expreſſe commandment from Caeſar; foraſmuch as they were able
to reſiſt neuer ſo great a power, yea euen of their Germans, hauing the garizons wel
fortified: an argument whereof was, that they had valiantly withſtood the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
of the enemy, and giuen them many wounds. Neither wanted they anie victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and before that prouiſion which they had was ſpent, there would come ſuccor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
other garizons and from Caeſar. And to conclude, what was more diſhonorable,
or ſauored of greater inconſtancy, then to conſult of their waightieſt affaires, by the
aduertiſement of an enemy? Titurius vrged vehementlie to the contrarie, that it
then would be too late for them to ſeeke a remedie, when a greater power of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
accompanied with the Germans, were aſſembled againſt them; or when anie
blow were giuen to anie of the next wintering campes hee: tooke Caeſar to be gone
into Italie, for otherwiſe the Eburones, would not haue come ſo proudly to the camp.
Let them not reſpect the authour, but the thing it ſelfe; the Rhene was not far off,
and hee knewe well that the ouerthrow of Ariouiſtus, and their former victories,
were greeuous to the Germans. The Galles were vexed with the contumelies they
had receiued, being brought in ſubiection to the Romaine Empire, and hauing loſt
their former reputation in deedes of armes. And to conclude, who would imagine
that Ambiorix ſhould enterpriſe ſuch a matter, without any ground, or certaintie
thereof? but howſoeuer thinges stoode, his counſell was ſure, and could bring no
harme: for if there were no worſe thing intended, they ſhould but goe ſafelie to the
next garizons; or otherwiſe, if the Galles conſpired with the Germans, their onelie
ſafetie conſiſted in celeritie. As for the counſell of Cotta, and ſuch as were of the
contrarie opinion, what expectation could be had thereof? wherein if there were
not preſent danger; yet aſsuredly famine was to be feared by long ſiege. The diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
being thus continued on either part, and Cotta with the Centurions of the
firſt orders, earneſtly repugning it; doe as pleaſe you, ſince you will needes haue
it ſo, ſaith Sabinus; and that he ſpake with a loud voice, that a great part of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
might well heare him. For I am not he that moſt feareth death among you,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:22240:102"/>
let theſe be wiſe: and if any miſchance happen vnto them, they ſhall aske account
thereof at thy hands, inaſmuch as if thou wouldeſt let them, they might ioine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
within 2. daies to the next garizons, &amp; with them ſuſtaine what chance ſoeuer
their common deſtinie ſhould allot them; and not periſh with famine and ſword, like
a people caſt off and abandoned from their fellowes. After theſe wordes, they began
to riſe out of the councell; but holde was laide vpon them both; entreatie was made
that they would not obstinatelie bring all vnto a deſperate hazard; the matter was
all one whether they went or ſtaied, ſo that they all agreed vpon one thing; wheras
in diſagreeing, there was no likelihood of well doing: the diſputation was prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vntill midnight; at length Cotta yeelded, and the ſentence of Sabinus tooke
place. And thereupon it was proclaimed, that they ſhould ſet forth by the breake
of day: the reſt of the night was ſpent in watching, euery ſoldior ſought out vvhat
he had to carry with him, and what he ſhould be conſtrained to leaue behind him of
ſuch neceſſaries, as he had prepared for winter: all things were diſpoſed in ſuch ſort,

and may ſeeme not ſo pertinent to this matter, in regard it is a meere Apology,
yet foraſmuch as it freely cenſureth the quality of particular circumſtances, it
may giue great light to that which we ſeeke after.</p>
                  <p>The moderne example is taken out of Guicherdin,<note place="margin">Lib. 9.</note> from the warres which
<hi>Lewis</hi> the French King had with the Pope and the Venetians, concerning the
ſtate of Ferrara and the Duchie of Milan: wherein there aroſe a controuerſie
among the French captaines, whether it were better to go directlie to ſeeke the
enemy, who albeit were lodged in a ſtrong and ſecure place, yet there was hope,
that with the virtue of armes and importunitie of artillerie, they might bee
diſlodged and driuen to a retreit: or otherwiſe, to take the way either of Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
or Bolognia, that ſo the enemy for feare of looſing either of thoſe townes,
might quit their holde, and by that meanes Ferrara ſhould bee freed from the
warre. Monſieur Chaumont the Generall of the French, inclined to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aduiſe: But Triuulce, a man of great authoritie and experience, hauing
beene an executioner in 18. battailes, reaſoned thus in particulars to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
We debate (ſaith he) to go ſeeke the enemy to fight with him; and I haue
alwaies heard great captaines holde this as a firme principle: Not to attempt
the fortune of a battell, vnleſſe there be either an offer of an eſpeciall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
or otherwiſe, compulſion by neceſſitie. The rules of warre giue it to the
enemy that is the inuader, and hath vndertaken the conqueſt of Ferrar, to
ſeeke to aſſaile and charge vs; but to vs, to whom it is ſufficient to defende our
ſelues, it cannot be but impertinent to vndertake an action, contrary to all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and diſcipline of war. I am of opinion, which is confirmed by euident
reaſon, that there is no poſsibility to execute that deuiſe, but to our harmes
and diſaduantage: for we cannot go to their campe but by the ſide of a hill, a
ſtreight and narrowe way, where all our forces cannot be imploied; and yet
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:22240:103"/>
they with ſmall numbers will make reſiſtance, hauing the oportunitie of the
place fauourable to their vertues: wee muſt march by the riſing of a hill, one
horſe after another; neither haue we anie other waie to draw our Artillerie, our
baggage, our cartes and bridges, but by the ſtreight of the hill: and who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not but in a waie ſo narrowe and combrous, euerie artillerie, euerie carte,
or euery wheele that ſhall breake, will not ſtay the Armie a whole houre at the
leaſt? By which impediments euerie contrarie accident may put vs to diſorder.
The enemie is lodged in couert, prouided of victuals and forrage; and wee
muſt incampe all bare and naked, not carying with vs that which ſhould ſerue
for our neceſſarie nouriture, but expect the things to come after; which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ought to go with vs. To attempt newe enterpriſes, whereof the victorie is
leſſe certaine then the perill, is contrarie to the grauitie and reputation of a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and in actions of the warre, thoſe enterpriſes are put to aduenture, that are
done by will and not by reaſon. Many difficulties may compell vs to make our
aboade there, two or three daies; yea the ſnowes and raines ioyned with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie
of the ſeaſon, may ſuffice to detaine vs: how ſhall we then doe for vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals
and forrages? What ſhall we be able to doe in the warres, wanting the
thinges that ſhould giue vs ſtrength and ſuſtenance? What is he that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not, how dangerous it is to go ſeeke the enemie in a ſtrong campe, and to
be driuen at one time to fight againſt them, and againſt the diſcommoditie of
the place? If we compell them not to abandon their campe, wee cannot but
be inforced to retire; a matter of great difficultie in a countrey ſo wholy againſt
vs, and where euerie little disfauour will turne to our great diſaduantage, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And thus proceeded that graue diſcourſe, in the diſcouerie of the particular

that manie of the ſouldiers, that were gone into the woods for
timber and munition, were cut off by the ſudden approach of
the enemies horſemen. Theſe being circumuented, the Ebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones,
Neruij, and Aduatici, with all their confederates and
clientes, began to aſsault the campe. The Romans betooke
them ſpeedily to their weapons; and got vpon the rampier,
with much adoe they helde out that daie: for the Galles truſted much vpon celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
hoping if they ſped well in that action, to be victors euer after. Cicero diſpatched
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:22240:108"/>
letters with all ſpeede to Caeſar, promiſing great rewardes to him that ſhould ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

night there was built in the campe 120 towers, of ſuch timber as was brought in
for fortification, &amp; whatſoeuer wanted of the reſt of the worke, was perfected. The
enemie the next daie with a farre greater power aſsaulted the campe, and filled vp
the ditch: the Romans made the like defence, as they had done the daie before; the
like was continued diuers daies after. The Romaines made no intermiſsion of their
worke at anie part of the night, nor gaue anie reſt either to the ſicke or the wounded.
Whatſoeuer was needfull for the next daies aſsault, was prouided in a readineſſe the
night before; a great number of ſtakes hardened in the fire were prepared, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
murall piles were made; the towers were floored in their ſtories, Pinacles and
Parapets were ſet vp of hurdles: and Cicero himſelfe being ſickly, and of a weake
conſtitution, tooke not ſo much leaſure as to reſt himſelfe in the night time; ſo that
the ſouldiers of their owne accord compeld him, by intreatie, to ſpare himſelfe.</p>

ſhould be preferred one before another, &amp; euery yeare contended
for place of preferment, with much ſtrife and emulation. Pulfio
at a time, that the fortification was very ſharply aſſaulted, called
to Varenus, and asked him why he now ſtood doubtfull? or what
other place he did looke for to make triall of his manhood? this is the daie (ſaith hee)

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries:
wherein we are firſt to obſerue the grounds of this quarrel,
which was their continual ſtrife for place of preferment, which they
ſought after by ſhewing their valour in time of danger, and approouing their
worth by the greatneſſe of their deſert; a contention worthy the Roman diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and may ſerue for a paterne of true honour full of courage, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with vertue. For theſe <hi>Simultates,</hi> which deſire of honor had caſt between
them, brought forth emulation which is the ſpur of vertue, far from enmitie or
hatefull contention: for the difference betweene theſe two qualities is, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
hunteth after deſtruction, and onely reioiceth in that which bringeth to

that vſeth the ſame meanes to attaine to the like end; and is alwaies mixed with

                  <p>A vertue rare and vnknowne in theſe daies, and would hardly find ſubiects
to be reſident in, if ſhe ſhould offer her helpe in the courſe of our affaires, or ſue
to be entertained by the crooked diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our times: for we can no ſooner
conceiue the thoughts that breed emulation, but it turneth preſently to hatred,
which is followed to the vttermoſt of our malice, and reſteth better ſatisfied
with the miſerable end of our oppoſed partner, then with thouſand of Trophes
deſeruedly erected to our honor. Which maketh me wonder, when I looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the difference of theſe and thoſe ages, whether it were the diſcipline of that
time, which brought forth ſuch honeſt effectes of vertue, to their glory and our
ignominy, hauing learned better rules then were known vnto them; or whether
the world weakened with age, want ſtrength in theſe times to bring foorth her
creatures in that perfection, as it did in thoſe daies; or what other cauſe hath
made our worſt affections ſo violent, and our better faculties ſo remiſſe and
negligent, that vertue hath no part in vs but wordes of praiſe, our whole prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
being conſecrated to actions of reproch. The iniuries, murthers, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
cariages of one towards an other, which in theſe daies are ſo readily offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:22240:112"/>
and ſo impatientlie digeſted, will admit no ſatisfaction but priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
which in the firſt monarchies was granted only againſt ſtrangers, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
enemies, as the only obiects of armes and wrath, and capable of that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
which the priuate ſworde ſhoulde execute: for they well perceiued that
theſe ſingle battels were, as ſparkles of ciuill diſcorde, and inteſtine warres;
although not ſo apparant in the generall viewe of their ſtate, yet as odious
in particular, and as diſhonourable to good gouernment. And if there were
a true recorde of ſuch, as haue beene either ſlaine or wounded within theſe
fortie yeeres, either in this kingdome, or in France, or in Germanie, by this
licentious and brutiſh cuſtome; I make no queſtion, but they woulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to a number capable of that fearefull ſtile, which is attributed to ciuill
warres.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any lawe howe rigorous or harde ſoeuer, that can giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
to this diſorder, but the reſtraint will drawe on as great enormities, and as
vntolerable in a good gouernment. Rotaris king of the Lumbardes forbade
his ſubiectes this manner of combate; but ſhortlie after, hee was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to recall the edict, for the auoiding of greater euils; although hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
the thing to bee both inhumane, and barbarous. The like edict was
publiſhed in France by Philip the Faire, but was within two yeeres reuoked
againe, at the inſtante requeſt of his ſubiectes, in regarde of the murthers
and aſſaſinats committed in that kingdome. The onelie remedie, that
I finde to take effect in this caſe, was that of late time, which the Prince of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe
in Piemont, inuented to preuent this euill: for perceiuing howe ordinarie
quarrels and bloudſhed were in his campe, hee aſſigned a place betweene two
bridges for the performance of the <hi>Duellum,</hi> with this charge; that hee
that had the worſt ſhoulde alwaies bee ſlaine, and caſt from the bridge into
the water; the daunger ioyned with diſhonour (which by this decree atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſuch as vndertooke priuate combate) made the ſoldiours wiſer in their
cariage, and put an end to their ſedition and ciuill diſcordes. But that which is
yet worſt of all, is that cuſtome hath now made it ſo familiar, that euery trifle
ſeemeth ſufficient to call the matter to a priuate combate; a croſſe looke
calleth an others mans honour in queſtion; but the word lye is of as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
as any ſtabbe or villanie whatſoeuer. Whereat we may well wonder
howe it happeneth, that wee feele our ſelues ſo much exaſperated at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
of that vice, which we ſo ordinarilie commit; for in the cuſtome of theſe
times to caſt vpon vs the lie, is the greateſt iniurie that wordes can doe vnto vs;
and yet there is nothing more frequent in our mouth. It may be a propertie in
our nature, to ſtand chiefely in the defence of that corruption vnto which wee
are moſt ſubiect: I ſpeake not this to qualifie the fouleneſſe of this vice; for I
holde a lier to bee a monſter in nature, one that contemneth God and feareth
man, as an ancient father ſaith; but to ſhew the crookedneſſe of our diſpoſition
in diſdaining to acknowledge that fault, which wee ſo commonlie commit.
But I would faine learne when honor firſt came to be meaſured with words, for
from the beginning it was not ſo. Caeſar was often called to his face theefe,
and dronkard, without any further matter; and the liberty of inuectiues, which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:22240:112"/>
great perſonages vſed one againſt an other, as it began, ſo it ended with words.
And ſo I thinke our lie might too, for I take him that returneth the lie, and ſo
letteth it reſt vntill further proofe, to haue as great aduantage in the reputation
of honor, as the former that firſt gaue the diſgrace.</p>
