            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12187:9"/>
which is heard, comes short of that which is beleeved; and some there are who arrive at that height, as they leave no place for flattery, fansying themselves greater than flattery can make them.</p>
            <p>Present actions are not with safetie related, nor are they listned unto without danger: well may they be reverenced, never censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: who puts them in print, seeks after an uncertaine glory, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses himselfe to a certaine danger; who leaves it to be done by poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, reapes no other fruit of his present labours, than the meere contemplation of a future imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fruitlesse glory. Worldly glory ends with the world, and for us, the world ends with our lives: to have ones thoughts wholly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied upon the good of posterity, is either a more than humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or else a foolish one; to dedicate ones labours to glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone diabolicall; to accompany them with the good of others, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane:

The Actions of our Ancestours use to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not maligned, for wee not emulate, but imitate them; we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly listen to the praises of such who gotten long since out of the reach of envie, seeme by their deeds of fame to raise the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mortality; and faults which are found in past actions displease not, whilst they take from the evill opinion of present times.</p>

They thinke it no reason for him to command others, who is not able to resist the force of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; neither would subjects be better than their Princes, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unjust, were they not more compelled: they who can have recourse to the sword which Justice holds up in her right hand, seldome betake themselves to the

               <hi>Amulius</hi> was wicked, I confesse, but he knew not how sufficiently to make use of his wickednesse, he bereft his brother of his kingdom, his Neece of her liberty, and tooke from neither of them their lives.

            <p>To take away a Kingdome, and suffer the King to live, is a cruell peece of charitie, wherewith all Tyrants whilst they goe about to deceive the world, they oft-times deceive themselves. The whole will easily meet together, the parts whereof are left alive. To set the Statue of Vertue upon a despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation, is as much as to build a Colossus of gold upon feet of durt: Piety becomes a King, for that his government is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: Cruelty a Tyrant, for that his is violent; courtesie befits the one, force is requisite to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: neither yet doth that secure him, he is not unlike a belly-god, who if hee persist to eat, a surfet kils him, if he desist, a dyet: if the

Tyrant bloudy his hands without respect, he dyes for being cruell; if otherwise, for seeming to bee pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Vice, though in the midst of Vertue, is not secure, because shee contaminates them.</p>

               <hi>The young woman tarried not long amongst the Vestals, before she was brought to bed of two sonnes, having had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Mars,</hi> as she affirmed, to the end that this her necessary errour might not onely, through the eminency of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son prove excusable; but in some kinde worthy of commendations: the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12187:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            </p>
            <p>IT is no shame to be inferiour in power, to what is superiour in nature; nay, were not the combat to be accounted rashnesse, to lose would bee accounted glorious, since the victory of the strongest party redounds to the honour of the weakest.</p>
            <p>To make <hi>Mars</hi> the authour of sacrilege, was to save ones selfe from the severity of man, with the mantle of a god; even good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces run often shipwrack upon this rocke, either in their owne credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12187:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or in that of their people, as being pious, or not seeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. A Tyrant laughes at all which not concernes himselfe; he more feares the power of men, than of God; otherwise, he would not endevour to secure himselfe from the one by that crueltie which doth more incense the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee delivereth the young woman into the hands of the Priests, to be dealt withall according to the severitie of Iustice; he commits the Twins to the charge of a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate officer, with charge to drowne them; but he endevoured to give way to fortune for their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12187:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as also for his own defence; he feared that Revenge which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not being able to bee taken against the Master, doth vent it selfe against the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is no wholesome counsell to trust another with the death of one descended of Royall bloud: he suffers him to live either through pitie, or policie: If he be compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate, he knowes not how to be cruell; if politick, he thinkes the present times will not last long; his thoughts are busied on times to come; he hath one eye upon the Tyrant, another upon him that shall succeed him; and hee ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours more to save himselfe, than to secure his Prince.</p>

To renew things now irreparable, and which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>Rome may be said to have its rise and its increase from us, and it is fatall that fathers should lose in the having of children; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerer to death, by giving life to others, if it be true that the generation of one be the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another.</p>

               <p>Injuries received, tend to the ruine of men, who with the zeale of honour doe not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany wisedome; they run upon revenge for past wrongs, and

Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not had in an instant; Time is not measured by instants. Wisedome is the daughter of Cold, Violence of Heat; things which have not beene done in times past, may well be effected in times to come; but things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie done, cannot be undone againe: occasions are never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to men, but men are wanting to occasions; they may bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,

               <p>Our forbearance is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not despised; the world is his who hath patience, when it proceeds from sagacitie, not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miditie. Generous spirits ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse themselves to endure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent injuries, out of hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture revenge; they reserve their anger to vindicate offences, not to evaporate passion. Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to be blamed, when by the injury of Time, it is not transformed into oblivion; dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation is never worse, than when it becomes forgetfulnesse, never better than when it resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12187:47"/>
for it is easier to let her wax old, than cause her dye: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease is not there had, where there is no motion; nor can Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in peace, increase and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nourishment; new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are augmented by the ruine of old ones; and tender plants, which are hindered by the shade and roots of neighbouring trees, want force to grow up: Rome cannot grow greater without the ruine of our Cities; nor can they ruine our Cities without warre: to wage armes to destroy her, may afford matter for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.

               <p>To raze the walls of strong Cities, when subdued, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth strangers to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of them; to leave them standing, facilitates the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Citizens; and say it were a good advice for places that are within the body of the State; it is undoubtedly bad for frontier places, where it is hard so to doe, as that they may be of defence against the enemie, and not subject to the rebellion of friends: hee leaves mens mindes apt to commotions, who takes not from them all meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

they lose the authoritie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, because they lose the power of punishment; they free themselves from the danger of citizens, they submit themselves to the fidelitie of a Captaine; and he, though he may thinke it ignominious to deliver up the Citie to an enemie, may thinke it may bee borne withall, if hee keepe it for himselfe.</p>
               <p>He who builds Fortresses in weake Cities, depends also too much upon the too mutable faith of the Captaine; nor can they much hinder him that is master of the field, as being only usefull to curbe unarmed Citizens, of no use against armed enemies.</p>

               <p>To keepe Armies stil on foot, to suffocat sullevations in their cradle, is the greatest, and would be the best remedy, if then it were not in the Generals choyce to make a Common-wealth a Monarchie, and himselfe Lord thereof.</p>
               <p>He that were alwayes sure to returne victorious, needed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to secure himselfe; if enemies be vanquished, friends are tardie, because their feare is greater, and their shame lesse; but the successe of war is uncertaine; and it is almost certaine that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions succeed overthrowes.</p>

            <p>The King loves no companion; hee entertaines one, because hee would have none: a Kingdome should have two Masters, if a King could suffer a companion; the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of two is not displeasing to subjects, because the number of the bad, exceeding the number of

            </p>
            <p>IT is an argument of feare, feare an argument of possibilitie of being offended; and the act sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly succeeds such possibility either knowne or beleeved: who makes his people feare, is made feare by his people; their tumults are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer allaid by undaunted men, than by wise men; for they more esteeme the brest than the braine, and are sooner compeld than perswaded.</p>
            <p>A Prince can commit no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter errour, than to seeme capable of offence. What is possible is the onely object of the will, nor doe men covet that which they thinke

            <p>THey detract from the merit of <hi>Romulus</hi> his actions, whilst they augment his nature; they les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the wonder, and increase the reverence; they abase Divinitie, if they thinke it of so small esteeme; they vilifie humanity, if they think it not of so much worth; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people doe easily deifie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; him whom they see greater than many men, they thinke him greater than Humanity; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend their <hi>Genus</hi> to be above that of other individuals; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Infinity to bee there where they cannot reach unto with their

            <p>These are the actions which were by <hi>Romulus</hi> done, in warre and in peace, who wanted not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to recover a Kingdome for his Grand-father, not counsell to build one to himselfe, nor wisdom to strengthen himselfe in Peace, which facilitated by his so many Victories, might be long injoyed by his posteritie.</p>

            <p>Fortune is not sufficient to raise a man to greatnesse, if shee be not accompanied with worth; and worth is vaine, where fortune wanteth: they are, perhaps, more unfortunate than others, that are more fortunate; they are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to see good events ensue, yea, even upon bad advice and counsel;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12187:73"/>
and because they can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their good effects, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes addresse themselves unto them without reason, as if their past good fortune, were a cleare demonstration of future felicitie, and not rather an argument of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching miseries, in a world where the star which in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the Zenith to our head, is at night found to be the Nadir to our feet.</p>
            <p>Vertue, when unaccompanied, is not discerned; counsell is only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the event; and if vertue unaccompanied be discerned, it is either despised as unusefull, or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied as unhappie.</p>
            <p>If God should make the effects of all things succeed contrary to our wisdomes reason, men might perhaps beleeve the world were governed by chance; and if all things did succeed according to wisdome, I am afraid such is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weaknesse as it would deifie her; whereas now, through the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12187:74"/>
only light of Nature, it is forced to beleeve, that there is somewhat without or forth of us, in which all things are.</p>
            <p>Those who have Vertue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Fortune, ascribe all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their wisdome; nor will they acknowledge Fortune to have any share therein, and indeed it behoves them to know, that she hath a great share in affaires, which makes them feare that instability, which cannot be apprehended from else-where.</p>

               <hi>Romulus</hi> was made great by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, guarded by Fortune, till hee became great; Vertue, though faire, useth to be accused of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Lord takes <hi>Moses</hi> from the sight of the Israelites, hee leads him into a Mountaine where hee ends his dayes; he buries him, his death not being knowne. <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was taken from the eyes of the people, was led into some solitary place, was slaine by the Senators, and buried, his death not being knowne. A like case, from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering cause, and differing end;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12187:75"/>
because it was effected by different agents: God because hee saw the Israelites addicted to idolatry, that they might not adore <hi>Moses</hi> as God, would not suffer them to see his bones buried: Gods adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, out of a desire to keepe and continue the Romans Idolaters, to the end that <hi>Romulus</hi> may bee adored as a God, procures that his death bee not knowne, nor his bones seene: the one, because hee is not found, is not worshipped; the other is worshipped, because he is not found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Romulus</hi> his morall faults, were the rape of the Sabine women, the death of his brother, and of his collegue; his politicall error was onely his indowing the Senate with so much power, and then his bereaving them of it.</p>
            <p>The government of a State, is but a slippery path; one onely bad action is sufficient to ruinate a Prince, who hath beene raised up by a thousand good ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:12187:75"/>
I doe not remember that ever any Ruler sped amisse, for having left authority to the Senate, but oft for having taken it from them: If men commit errors, men ought to bee punished, and not the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and if the calling be feared, wherefore was it ordained? but it is not feare which causeth such wickednesse, it is the violent thirst after rule; otherwise they would not leave the condition, when they take away the authority; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no lesse subject to their possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of reuniting, than of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: the institution and permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Senators in the original of commands, is not only done that subjects may be content with their servitude; but because Princes are really satisfied with what they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: It is the nature of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, not the art of ruling. Who prepares for a great leap, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to arrive at the side of the ditch, but afterwards stayes not there: mans understanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12187:76"/>
it hath not in this world any adequate end, coveteth as an end, any thing that seems desirable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and it hath no sooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past that end, but it makes use thereof as a medium to arrive at some other end, which was first hidden from it by the former, and continues to be the desired end till it be obtained; a little master-hood seemes enough, where there is none at all; but where there is but a little, enough seemes nothing, if all be not had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Romulus</hi> in his beginning was followed by the noblest sort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he won upon them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on them authority; in his end he was hated by them, for that hee incensed them by bereaving them of it. Hee cannot suffer the Senate which he himselfe did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, and because they would have him as a companion, whom they accepted for their Prince, hee would make them slaves whom he tooke for assistant Officers: both
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12187:76"/>
exceed their bounds, they in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, he in commanding. The Senate which is made to assist the Prince, thinkes onely how they may lessen him: the Prince who ought governe the Senate, seekes to destroy it: that Magistracy in States is of duration, which is content to execute as a Minister, not to command as a Lord.</p>
            <p>I have nothing of misfortune to recount of <hi>Romulus,</hi> save what was the occasion of his death; and yet therein he was fortunate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was sudden. If there bee nothing else of evill in death, but the troublesome cogitations of the minde, and the painfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body, both which doe precede it, that death which is sudden, preventing torments; that which happens soone, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the troubles of the mind, should be esteemed best.</p>
            <p>There is nothing better in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, than what is worst in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall: the foundation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12187:77"/>
the Colossus of the world, doth erect it selfe to manifest its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is death: it is the most solid part of consort, on which all des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants doe depend. What would there be after the losse of originall righteousnesse, if men did not die? the feare thereof holds in fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate men; the hope thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds unfortunate men from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. Who should take away death, should take away the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone from the worlds Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique, should take away all Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, all order, and should leave nothing but dissonance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: the order of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, is contrary to that of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls. The heavens which of their owne particular nature doe turne from West to East, are by the universall nature carried every day from East to West: Death can neither bee bad nor painfull, if to die be naturall; for naturall things are good. I am of opinion, that to end ones dayes in decrepit
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12187:77"/>
age, is to fall asleepe, not to die: and say to die were to bee accounted amongst the worst of things, yet to bee dead, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be numbred amongst the best.</p>
            <p>One must live, as considering he must live alwayes, not that hee must once die: the Soule which is that which understands, ought not to thinke of death, for shee never dies; and if the Soule doe not, the Body cannot feare it, because it knowes it not, as that which by meanes of contemplation, is a dead carkas before it be dead: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should the Soule rather feare, than desire the death of the Body, which is burthensome unto her? and why should not the body also be desirous to bee bereft of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections? it leaveth frailty, to put on immortality; it dyes base, and may rise glorious; death is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good, but appeares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bee bad, because they are sometimes bad who dye; let a man
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12187:78"/>
live innocent, for he shall bee joyd at the remembrance of death, not terrified; and were not natures frailty subject to lapse, I should be sory shee should bee provoked to do good out of the feare of death, or allured by the love of reward: the very foule ill favorednesse of doing ill, ought to be a sufficient feare; and the comelinesse of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done well, a sufficicent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and if a man would consider that rewards are received, he might consider what reward he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received, when of nothing hee was created to immortality; nor am I any whit the more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with well doing out of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but much when good is done out of love due to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely lovely Nature of GOD.</p>
            <p>Let us then say:</p>
            <p>I doe not only love thee Lord, because thou hast created me; but I will returne againe to nothing for thee. I doe not love thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast promised mee the

            <p>Lord, if I love thee not as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct others to love thee, assist the weaknesse of my nature, with the efficacy of thy helps: Stir up my understanding, direct my will; whilest to the Glory and Honour of thy great Name, in the which I desire to end my life, I put an end to this my Booke.</p>

            <p>It is never safer to write the actions of Tyrants, than under the government of good Princes; the dissimilitude of their manners will not permit them to beleeve that their actions are blamed, whilest the faults of others are related.</p>

when hee marches in the middle, betweene vertue and vice; then is the alteration of the Scene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, when the change is made unlooked for; but such a person instructs not them, because he only teacheth the like, or else the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but so unlooked for an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Scene instructeth not, it terrifieth; since as the worst of Princes are subject to dangers, grounded upon reason, so cannot the best withdraw themselves from events caused by Fortune.</p>
            <p>They who write the Lives of such Tyrants, as haply arrive in the Haven, delight, but ruine Princes; they are well liked, because some would follow their owne sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and be secure, as if they thence might draw precepts how to live well, and governe ill. I write a usefull Tragedy, the life of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Prince, who reigning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, did with reason, to a wicked beginning, and worser pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, joyne an end worst of all.</p>

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:12187:81"/>
To prescribe precepts unto Princes how to governe well, hath in it somewhat of delightfull, but it is a laborious, I had almost said, a proud undertaking; they are for the most part <hi>Idea's,</hi> their being lyes in the Intellect, out of which they have no subsistance; they are coveted formes, and because im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, not obtained. A point which in the abstract is individi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is divided into many parts in the concrete, may suffer infinit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions: I thinke examples fitter for the managing of such an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, than precepts; they tend both to the same end, yet run not the like danger; and in examples, Princes are more pleased, when compared with a worser than themselves, than when with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if the party spoken of surpasse them, they listen to it with shame; with emulation, if hee equall them; but if hee come short of them, with glory. Bad actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of former Princes, redound
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:12187:82"/>
to the praise of the present, if they be not found in them; and say they be, they make them yet bee borne withall. Detraction is applauded, and praise is not beleeved: in the latter, Truth purchaseth the name of flattery; in the former, malice, the name of free spoken; whence it proceeds, that the lives of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than our selves, are both more willingly written and read, than the lives of such as are better.</p>
            <p>If I were fit to prescribe rules to Princes, I could not choose a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes, than by propounding the life of Tyrants; it is much easier to say, a Prince ought not to be thus, than to say, thus he ought to be; the negative, than the affirmative: those who too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely restraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within certain narrow limits, dishearten, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them; whence it oftentimes ensues, that having broken those narrow bounds, and thereby thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they have transgressed the Lawes of a good Prince, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12187:82"/>
head-long, as bad as who is worst. The goodnesse of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty doth not consist in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall point, it hath its lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and so depraved is humane nature, that he is to be esteemed vertuous, who is without vice; hee exceeding good, who is not bad. All men have not the worth of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and though some have it, they want the meanes of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; to propound his life for imitation to one who hath not his endowments, is as much as to go about to erect the like building, where are not the like foundations. Al may easily abstain from <hi>Tarquins</hi> vices, but all cannot imitate <hi>Cyrus</hi> his vertues; he who hath not wings cannot mount towards the skies; and who hath not the eyes of an Eagle, cannot looke upon the Sunne.</p>
            <p>All things of this world are so knit together, that one depends upon another, and upon that, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; who so takes one linke from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12187:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this chaine, breakes it. In a Prince who hath won reputation, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie begets good-will; in another, who is foolish, it begets scorne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the linke of reputation is wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; many lines meet in one point, many wayes lead to one place; he that cannot goe the troublesome way, let him goe the easie, for if he arive not at his journeys end with so much praise, he will yet get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without blame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To give instructions to Princes, it behoves to looke into their nature, and sometimes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to allow him good, when hee cannot bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

            <p>A Princes death, though vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if his whole Race cease in him, is no impediment to the good government of him that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12187:84"/>
if he be not a cause thereof himselfe, through his bad govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where there is none of the bloud, there is no head; where there is no head, people doe but murmur, they take no resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the greatest provocations to revenge, are either necessitie or profit: friendship is maintained with men, seldome with dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses; and if it remaine after death, it is onely for compassion, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Princes ought then to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile their subjects with good turnes, not with weapons; the present moveth more forcibly, than what is past; and though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friendship may hinder some one from applauding, new benefits will retaine him from plots and machinations: one who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a good turne, either doth not budge against his Prince, or if he doe, is followed by none; his past ingratitude teacheth others how dangerous it is to oblige him: But what will you more?
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12187:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wicked men for a punishment of their mis-doings, are confident where danger is, diffident, where securitie.</p>
            <p>Those cruelties which tend not to dominion, are furious, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet; he who useth them is a cruel beast, not a cruell man. It seemes <hi>Tarquin</hi> did better love revenge, than rule; rather to have his hands blouded, than his head crowned. Princes are sometimes borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if necessity of government cause them be cruell; but if they be so by instinct of nature, they are alwayes hated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee who feares hee hath taught others how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Kingdome tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that breach which he hath made by violence, kils all such Senators as were friends to <hi>Servius.</hi>

If it be a hard matter to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tyranny, where a Tyrant is driven out; it seemes impossible to maintaine it, where a good Prince is expeld; in such a case the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot bee preserved from being lost; for hee that will kil all the friends of a good Prince, must kill all his subjects.</p>
            <p>In the putting to death of one alone through cruelty, a Prince obligeth himselfe to commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like facts; the one springs from the other, and the last is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes most fruitfull; hee doubts the tye of Allyes, he feares the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of their friends; and to free himselfe from danger, worketh new cruelties, which never render him secure, but put a necessity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to commit greater.</p>
            <p>He who hath won a Kingdome by the sword, if he lay not downe the sword, the sword will lay downe him; he is too great a foole who will use the same food to continue health, which he did to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12187:85"/>
acquire it; and the Tyrant is not wise, who maketh use of the same meanes to governe a State, which he did to possesse himselfe thereof. This is not written that it ought to be done, but because it usually is done; it is rather the nature, than doctrine of men; they thinke that good alwayes which they have found once good. It is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept convenient for Princes, not becomming Tyrants: goodnesse preserves it selfe with its like, naughtinesse is reduced by its contrary; and so great is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of good, and the weaknesse of evill, that men have often a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of being often good, bee it but to continue themselves the longer bad.</p>
            <p>Far be the sword from the hands of Princes; pardon, not cruelty enforceth mens hearts; the latter used against one alone, begets the hatred of a thousand; the former is not used without the addition of new friends. The Tyrants feare
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12187:86"/>
increaseth with his power, and looke how many he commands, so many he stands in awe of; hee is not worthy to bee obeyed, who useth not the meanes to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
            <p>I blame not Princes, because they make themselves bee feared, but because they know not how to make themselves bee feared. It is not likely that this desire of being feared should take so firme root in the greater number of Princes who begin to rule, if it were not usefull for government; it makes us like unto God: but men in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, suffer themselves oft times to be deceived through ignorance, or miss-led through difficulty; and whilest they endevor to reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is Divine, they fall into what is bestiall.</p>

That Common-wealth neighbours upon corruption, which stands in need of a guard; and that principality is already corrupt, which hath need thereof: Naturall operations proceed from forme. If a State maintaine it selfe by ought else than forme, it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent; if violent, of little durance. An army will not suffice to guard that Prince, whom a few will not serve to guard; because few are enough, where is the love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and many are but few, where is the hatred of all.</p>
            <p>The same sword that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, may kill him, if the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse of a Mercenary man, meet with the liberality of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths man.

Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? no: for wicked men are hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full even unto such as reape bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their wickednesse. Reward? no: for the rewards which other men promise for the death of a Tyrant, are alwayes greater than those which hee himselfe giveth for the preservation of his life.

               </gap>othing can bee worse, than to defend a Tyrant. Shame? no: for it is no shame to foule ones hands in his blood, whose death would make paricide be commendable. Good God! If Princes did but consider how easie and safe a thing it is to governe well, how difficult and dangerous it is to governe ill, Souldiers might well serve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne their Majesty, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</p>

If malecontents issued onely from the tribunall of Justice, and not elsewhere, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would bee a better defence than Souldiers: But a Prince is in worse condition, in bestowing his favours, than in administring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: in the one, necessity defends him; in the other, liberality makes him odious. If Justice goe amisse, it acquires equall number as well of friends, as enemies; whereas reward be it never so well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pleaseth but one, and causeth the hatred of all others that are unrewarded; which is so much the greater, because it proceeds not onely from losse, but from a disregard the Prince seemes to put upon those that share not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually of his favour; declaring them to bee inferiour to him hee hath made choyce to bestow it on.</p>

A Prince cannot then be termed a Tyrant, whilest hee requires a small guard, that hee himselfe may guard many; hee rather deserves that name, when he indevours to secure himselfe from the hatred occasioned by his wickednesse: but howsoever it bee, a Princes guard is not pleasing to the Senat; they imagine it to be invented to offend them, not to defend the Prince; wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>To make his power greater, and himselfe more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, <hi>Tarquin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone takes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of all causes, yea, criminall: whence hee hath opportunity affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

him to condemne such, from whom hee may either hope for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or feare dammage. He hates the vertues of other men, hee covets their riches; which at such a time is an enemy to the possessor; nor can there be a greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse under a Tyrant, than to bee unfortunate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is held as a necessary Maxime amongst Princes, that all things may have their dependancy upon one alone; 'twas strengthned by the testimony of an approved Counseller, who is thought to have put it amongst his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, for the preservation of an Empire. But either I am decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12187:90"/>
or he did not intend such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affaires, as properly belong to justice, whose errors can cause but small harme to the Prince. He surely intended such as belonging to government, are apprehended under that point of determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon which depends the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not being of a Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p>It behoves a Prince as well to abstaine from all things which not become him, as to doe those things which belong unto him. Hee who either too much slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or too much inhaunceth his power, abandoning the degree of a Prince, doth either too poorely serve the Common people, or doth too arrogantly command the Nobles; the one of which errors springs from too much familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the other from too much pride.</p>
            <p>All men though never so wise, or of never so meane understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when they heare the lives of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12187:90"/>
past Princes recounted, bee they good or bad, praise the goodnesse of the one, and blame the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other. Yet are there some who afterwards arriving a supreme authoritie, leaving tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> things which they though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> praise worthy, betake themselves to those which in former times they had blamed. Wherefore, many thinking this to happen out of meere election, cease not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when Princes may live with safety and honour, they chuse to live in feare and diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I verily beleeve that all Princes would be good, but that many are hindred by their Subjects, &amp; some
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12187:91"/>
miss-led by the times. Fortune hath likewise a great share, if not in making a Prince good, at least in making him appeare so. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It behoves not to meet with great resistance, where any great worke is to bee well brought in: the comparisons of the worst, are sometimes necessary to make the best knowne: all Princes may bee good, but not all seeme good. The subjects complaints are of power enough to dazle the writers eyes, so as he see not cleerely those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he writes; the Prince is left alone to speake against all, whereas all speake against him, and injustice is beleeved to be alwayes on the more powerfull side. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are so desirous of liberty, as he that would governe them well, must not governe them at all. He is not accounted a good Prince amongst them, who doth not la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

downe his principality. Cities, where the more powerfull trample upon the Plebeians, can never be well governed, but through ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If he defile his hands in the blood of the Nobility, they cal him Tyrant; they hate him as a Tyrant, and oft times make him become one: If he suffer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to be trod under foot, he is no Prince: that dignity is conferd upon him, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them most, that are least able to defend themselves. I had almost said, it is as hard to know who hath beene a good Prince, as it is to be a good Prince: Had it fallen to the common people of Romes share to give their vote, they would have proclaimed some one for an excellent Ruler, who by the Senate was declared a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but acknowledge that Princes sometimes run vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily into evill wayes, being deceived either by a false good, or false glory; they finde it more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12187:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
troublesome to make good a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, than a principality; they thinke it likewise more glorious; they betake themselves unto it, as if that were more praise worthy which is more difficult than that which is more convenient.</p>

            <p>THe sinewes are taken from the authority of a Senate, when it is reduced to a few: the authority of one Senator, is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd by the exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of it to many: particular men grow lesse esteemed of, because that one man is not so much esteemed of, for arriving at that degree whereunto so many

come, and the reverence of the common people, by how much it is extended, by so much it is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened: one man in a small assembly, either by his worth or fortune, may easily make himselfe umpire; and inequality preserves a Prince, if it be of many; but if it be of one alone, it ruines him. That Prince which is not a Tyrant, ought aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Senate, because great men are more dangerous than great Magistrates. A Prince who is a Tyrant, hath good fortune, if hee finde it lesned, whether his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee to curbe it, or quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it. Those who augment the number of Senators, if they doe it with an intention of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Senate, by how much more they increase it, the more they strengthen it: how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, 'tis alwayes in a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of becomming little, and the authority of a great many, may be managed by the brains of a few. If they doe it with an intention of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12187:93"/>
introducing their well willers, whilest they thinke to make Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors partiall in their behalfe, they lose those subjects which were formerly partiall unto them. Such things are not reall, but rationall: they are not found in realities, but onely in the understanding. The same path which mounts from the foot of the hill, descends from the top: hee who from the Tyrants palace lookes upon the Senate, miss-likes the Senate; but if from the Senate house, hee looke upon the Tyrant, he miss-likes the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Hence it proceeds that many Magistrates of a refin'd judgement, have sometimes brought into the Senate factious people, to make them change their mindes. Hee is the selfe same, which was in the market place, and which is in the Senate-house; but the prospect is not the same from the Senate to the market place, as from the market place to the Senate. Who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the prospect of necessity,

               <hi>Tyrants ought to be hated, not reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by the people; it is not safe to mention him, much lesse to introduce him into a Common-wealth; hee who speakes of him, should make him be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be a Tygre, a Sphinx, not a man.</hi>

instant; and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, said that the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his so long stay, was his having stickled in a difference betweene a father and a sonne.</hi>

            <p>IT would be a great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be borne in times fitted to ones proper <hi>Genius,</hi> if those times were permanent, or if one were to die therein: but since that alterations happen almost alwaies, and death but seldome; it is a great misfortune, to live in a happie time, and dye in an unhappie one: it is not without wonder to bee considered, that wee who with times change our externall habits, will not beleeve with time, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall habits ought also to bee changed: the ignorant, as well as the learned, are subject to this weaknesse, either for that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whereunto they are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or that they beleeve they ought not to change that which hath beene successefull to them; but Fortune often varies with man, because shee changeth the times, and they change not their manners.</p>
            <p>That Lion-like fiercenesse which was was serviceable to <hi>Turnus</hi> in private factions amongst his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, ought to have beene dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with his superiours; win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behaviour, advisednesse, and fiercenesse mingled together, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son any affaire excellently well, when the winning behaviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares sufficiently, the advised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not at all, and the fiercenesse but a little.</p>
            <p>As it is weaknesse to dissemble with ones equall, so not to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ones superiour is rashnes; it is not at all times good to say all what the heart thinketh, though all what the heart thinketh bee good; freedome of speech ought
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12187:99"/>
sometimes to bee forborne, when freedome of life is corrupted; who useth it not in a befitting time, hinders not, but hastens power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who wrought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in by little and little, ought by little and little to be wrought out; to oblige him to doe some great act, by which he may either become, or learne how to become Prince: it is not good to passe by the least errors in an entire Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and it is worse to withstand all in a Common-wealth corrupted; at such times to appear too much a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths man, is the next way to produce a Tyrant; the weight which preserves in safetie an upright pillar, causethit fall, if the pillar leane to one side. Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ought not alwayes to be thrust at, in desperate cases, it is better to commit them into the hands of Fortune, than to seeke to remedy them; where wee cannot helpe our selves, to be busie, can
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12187:100"/>
worke no other effect, than hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effects of a cause superiour to our selves; and whilst that comes by, by unknowne wayes, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in seeking of it out, may easily not afford it leasure to come; or disturbe it, by causing it take some other way: How many hath Nature helpt, whom Art hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned? and how many hath Art slaine, whom Nature would have restored to health?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarquin</hi> sayes no more: he is not wont to defend himselfe with words, who is used to heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but flattery: these speeches take him unprovided, because they are free: to answer all, pertaines to private men; to punish all, to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. Princes ought not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in words, left they the more incense others, or become them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too passionate, and bring their Majestie in question: more place is reserved for craft, when lesse is afforded to choler. A Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant sometimes is well pleased,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12187:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he heares himselfe provoked by great men; hee seekes out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, that hee might commit them; he is glad to receive them, out of a desire to revenge them; if he meet with none, he faines them, either for his better excuse, or that he may be the more incenst.</p>

                  <hi>Tarquin,</hi> that hee might plot the death of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> hath recourse to some of the contrary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by whose meanes, a servant of his is subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to receive great store of armes and weapons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>STrangers have fitting meanes for revenge in a factious Citie: if there be none there obliged to doe ill, there are alwayes enough,

contented to see ill done; if there be none that have the act of anger, there bee enough that have the habit of hatred: a stranger in such places meets seldome with any provocations to bloud, save ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice; because offences are for the most part, either old, and alreadie forgotten, or new, and already revenged; it is neither wisdome nor fore-sight for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen so to embroile himselfe; the stranger is gone, the Citizen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. If the businesse succeed not, the former hath the glory to have attempted, the other remaines in danger, because he hath attempted, and suffers scorne for that it hath not succeeded; such kind of people would not bee found in Cities, were there not many in all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who wanting experience and discourse, abound in nothing but ignorance and malice.</p>

            <p>There is no lye so dangerous, as that which most resembles the truth; many likly propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s seeme to conclude a necessary truth; and many true antecedents, are of force enough, yea, amongst the most wary, to averre a false conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>It happens now and then, that an innocent man can deny no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories, yet will deny the consequence; a thousand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make no difference in time, a thousand points make not one

            <p>It was true that <hi>Turnus</hi> was a proud man, it was true that he was fierce, it was true that he blamed <hi>Tarquins</hi> tarrying, it was true that he had a number of armes hid in his house, but all the rest was false; there is no means to preserve ones selfe from such wicked wayes, and perverse calumnies; they are mines which cannot be avoided, but by fore-seeing them.</p>
            <p>A State is maintained by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, ruined by calumnies. It is a common tenent amongst politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the latter part is not heeded now adayes by the world, because that though men doe not beleeve falshood, yet they give way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Subjects use their pen, not their tongues; and though in what they write, calumnies are oft e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough deserved, yet are they not punished, because the calumniators are not knowne. Such proceedings puzzle the braines of Princes; and

if it cause not diffidence arise in them, it causeth confidence to cease: all are not of his opinion, who at the same time when as he swallowed downe the suspected drinke, put into his friends hand the calumnious paper: it was an action of one void of feare, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call it a wise mans part: false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood when constantly affirmed for truth, if it deceive not even those who know the certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y thereof, it assuredly makes them suspend their judgement: many beleeve, that nothing which is done would be knowne, if this meanes were not used; and I am of beleefe, that but a little is knowne, because it is used; if men were certaine there were no other way of accusation, than by revealing themselves, in things which appertaine unto the State, their dutie and honour would lead them to it; and for what concernes civill conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oftentimes hatred and envie, yea, sometime zeale and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Then if a Prince would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accusers, and punish slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, he would in a short time make happie his estate; for that accusers by little and little winning repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they would at last come to such an height, that men would not be ashamed to accuse, as the most reputed Citizens in the best times have not beene: the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of accusations to goe lesse in reputation, and calumnies to get footing, hath beene the increase of man-slaughter, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of enmity.

and finding it to be true, they make him prisoner; they assemble the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and placing <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his armes in the midst, the anger of those who stood about him did so increase, as not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to speake in his defence, they found a new way of death for him in the Ferentine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN such like cases as this, it is equally capitall to be accused, and to have conspired: there is no defence but impossibility; a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of conspiracie is no sooner seene, but the conspiracie is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: likelihood, if of good things,

An armie composed of sundry Nations likes me well, out of another reason: they seldome mutiny all together, because they joyntly understand not one another; and many times there is caused such an emulation amongst the severall parts, as in the whole makes an harmony, when it is not accompanied with the disagreeing notes of hatred; and this also if the parts bee more than two, will not lessen the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the concordance, though it increase the commanders labour.

IF evill have no essence, what would become of it, were it not supported by goodnesse? This it is, that is the ground worke of the worlds worst things; it is that which maintaines sinne: to be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in warre, if it secures not Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, it at least prolongs it: It suffers not feare to become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, which arrives at the degree of being shamefull, when a Prince is feared, because his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is offorce, not because he is worthy to command. All cruelties are bad enough, but they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endured in a Commander of worth, than in one of no estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in the one weaknesse is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and hath feare for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; in the other fiercenesse, and hath daring for its compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men alwayes goe with a kinde of reverence, when they assault their master, and with feare also, when that master is a brave fellow: and where feare and reverence once enter, conspiracies seldome
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12187:111"/>
succeed well. It behoves that subjects, to the end that they may patiently endure a Tyrant, confesse him to bee a great Prince, if they acknowledge him not to bee a good one.</p>
            <p>Valour is a kinde of Besar, which comforts the hearts of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that they may the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a Tyrants venome: but they seldome arrive at such a degree of vertue, as makes them tolerable; and when they doe arrive there, then they are the more secure, but not altogether out of danger: 'tis true, that reputation may defend severity, but not cruelty; and if cruelty, such as is used in armies, not such as is practised amongst Citizens.</p>
            <p>A cruell Tyrant could bee no where better than in a Campe, were hee but secure of his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Those vices which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable in a Citie, are suffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in an army: 'tis no new thing there to see blood, where nothing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12187:111"/>
but blood is shed; and military dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, if it may not admit of a cruell Prince, requires often a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere one.</p>
            <p>If warre incounter with a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who naturally is given to blood, it augments his cruelty; because the use of seeing dead men takes mercy totally away; if it meet with one who useth cruelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would not be despised, whilest it affords him occasion of making himselfe glorious, it takes from him the occasion of being cruell. Hence is it, that the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of victories is sometimes poyson to Princes; and on the contrary, an antidote to Tyrants: the one sort being already in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, finde themselves oft-times eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on by victory to those vices, from which feare kept them back: the other already famous, finde themselves with-held by glory from those vices whereunto the doubt of being despised had inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</p>

               <p>To become great, it is not sufficient not to feare the sword, if either mens tongues or pens be feared; they blame all meanes, whereby they may be brought in subjection: to purchase immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fame, it sufficeth that all ones actions be great; equall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne is got by a good and by a bad report, if they bee equally great.</p>

higher than the rest, and breake it off; or for that the hatred of pride is so naturall, as it makes not only him who is endued with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, but whatsoever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it; or by vertue of an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site imagination, which making it appeare to us dissonant and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will not permit us with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to suffer it: or else it may proceed from the easinesse of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it shorter: for all such things as doe eloigne themselves from the equality of the others, eloigne themselves also from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>It is not good in gardens for any plant to bee greater than the rest, unlesse it bee a Tree, whose bulke makes it not easie to be snapt in two. A flower which is higher tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another is topt off: a taller Tree is seene with admiration; so in Cities, hee who will bee esteemed and not cut short, must if a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, be equall; if Superior, a Prince.

            <p>CRuell actions are so many <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which are never better taken, than when wrapt up in gold.

            <p>The publike good is a specious name; it is sought for with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the private; otherwise, men would cooperate as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good Prince, as under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
            <p>That doctrine of Philosophers, that private good may bee preferd before the common good, is as pernicious when it beares with it

such a proportion, as the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine to the sicke of a Fever.

            <p>Where liberty is, if great men bee Magistrates, they are hatefull to the people; they willingly see them abased, nor are they aware that they are banks reared up, which though they hinder the sight, yet withstand inundations. The Common peoples hatred to the Senate is so naturall, that they continue it, yea under Princes; and Princes in my opinion (at least in this respect) ought to cherish a Senate, as a fit place for Subjects to vent their complaints on, who alwaies more willingly-complaine of the Senate, than the Prince; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they envie them more,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12187:122"/>
as being nearer them, or fear them lesse, as being lesse powerfull. The Senat matters not much, yet feares to breake off the peoples blowes, who passionately run their lances against a Saracin of wood; it is like fortune, which doth just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, and yet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies curst for doing mischiefe.</p>

            <p>The first and principall secret of Tyranny, is to keepe friendship with the people; which the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of great folkes hinders not, but augments: 'tis the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all things, that one part rise as another falls; if it bee not raised, 'tis eased: the people covet quietnesse, plenty, safety, to live, and suffer others live.

               </gap>y in a City, where the people and great men doe both agree in the desire of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unlesse it bee done without weapons. 'Tis evidently seene, that <hi>Tarquin</hi> was no Tyrant by Art, but Nature; not for his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but delight: the people like better of a Tyrant, than of liberty; when liberty is not popular, and the Tyrant wise. A Tyrant hath none on whom more to trust, nor whom more to feare; hee hath no better friend, no worser enemy: he was therefore wise as I beleeve, who thought the government of a bad Prince, and an uncorrupted people, profitable for a Citie: the one is a curb to the Tyrant, the other to the Nobility. A Prince kept within bounds, a people not corrupted, and an humbled Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, makes an excellent composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <hi>Whilest the Romanes were intent upon their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, a great prodigie appeares. A Serpent is seene to come out of a Columne of wood, which frightens, and puts to flight all the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRodegles which are fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of things to come, are seldome regarded before the things bee come to passe; and if they be sometimes regarded, yet are they not understood. Many have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that in man also there are certaine seeds of Divination of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, not knowne till they be past: I grant it, and should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them to bee the motives of our tutelary Angels, were it not that they are unusefull, either for provision, or prevision. I feare me
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12187:125"/>
the Devill is the framer of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: it seemes to bee the aime of one proud and envious. He shewes us things to come, that hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe might reape honour; hee suffers us not to know them, that wee may not thereby reape profit: or shall we say that those Starres which threaten or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise good or bad influences, whilest they dispose the matter, endevour to introduce the forme, and whilest they doe introduce it, doe produce in such a place, such a thing, such a man, many things which precede, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, and which follow; which though they be not alwaies the same things, yet come they alwayes from the same things. That constellation which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Serpent to enter the Court, is the same which moveth <hi>Brutus</hi> to drive out <hi>Tarquin</hi> from thence. Great alterations require great influences, which when they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cause great diversity in their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:12187:125"/>
working, happen not because the influences are divers, but because they are divers who receive them. Actions are not done by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in an instant; dispositions precede them, the truth of whose effects we doe not know, because the vertue of causes is unknowne to us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, men of themselves understand not things to come, because while they seeke the helpe of Reason, they lose the assistance of the Starres; they with their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes confound the motives of Nature; it is, perhaps, to punish our rashnesse, which willing to make use of the understanding, to arrive at that, where the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing cannot sometimes arrive, goes not thither, whither Nature would lead it; its motive is on the sudden, whilest there is neither thought nor dispute about it; it is not minded, because not disputed; and therefore good, because not disputed. Hence it is that women
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:12187:126"/>
advise well on the sudden, and that children and fooles prophesie; they say what heaven, not reason dictates to them.</p>

            <p>THE Devill did not this as knowing what was to come, but he told what was to come, that he might procure that that might afterwards happen which hee had fore-told; hee endevoured it to winue himselfe credit, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to punish humane arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie; it may be also the truth of Astrologicall predictions are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caused by the Devill, than by the Starres; so by God permitted to confound our rashnesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it happens, that when wee would foretell things, wee doe it by the Devill.

Some seeme desirous to search into them, that they may incounter the good which thereby is promised, and shunne the evill which is thereby threatned; and many times by incountring the good, they lose it, and by shunning the evill, they meet with it; but they seeke after them, that they may finde what they desire; which if they finde not, they beleeve them not; they begge food for their present ambition, with the deceitful hopes of future greatnesse.</p>

            <p>TARQUIN would make good his expences by the riches of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:12187:130"/>
that people, and by ransaking that Citie, reunite his souldiers hearts, who were not well satisfied in their having changed their swords into mattocks; and the emptying of their enemies bosome of bloud, into emptying of sinkes.</p>
            <p>When the Treasury is emptied by magnificent expences, it is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe by wicked meanes.</p>
            <p>Some Philosophers have held it good that Cities should be poore, that they might bee safe; they would have them shunne envie, which hardly can be shund with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into the hands of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.

If riches move desire, they are likewise a help to defence. For one time that a Prince is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

to invade States for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his revenues; hee is a thousand times spurd thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, out of a desire to inlarge his bounds. War is not usually good merchandize, whereby to become rich, but whereby to become great; more is consumed in the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, than the thing acquired is worth; the gaine is alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, the losse certaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilst they were besieging of Ardea, which siege was more tedious, than otherwise troublesome; <hi>Collatine,</hi> and other young men, supt one night with <hi>Sextus Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> and warmed with overmuch wine, there grew a contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12187:131"/>
them concerning their wives, each prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his owne above the rest: they resolve to goe find them out forthwith, that they may be certain of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WIne molests the fancie, by sending up into the braine many grosse vapours; it bounds them not, because they are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid; it agitates them, because they are hot; and whilst by its steame it represents many fancies, it affords occasion of speaking much, and considering nothing; it is good to make mens hearts be knowne, but not their braines: where there is no cold, there is no judgement; where no drinesse is, there is no weighing of words.</p>
            <p>Men are all prone to think well of their wives; whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12187:132"/>
from their husbands great desire that they should be such, or from their cunning in appearing such; or from the gift of Nature, which is never wont to bee defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in things necessary: for I am of opinion, that if all things were knowne in them as they are, and not much beleeved of them, which is not, either more libertie ought to be allowed to women, and so change the law of honour; or if the former ought to be preserved, the latter ought more strictly to bee restrained; since through the mis-fortune of the generall, there are very few of them that are good, and through the good fortune of individuals, every man beleeves his to be one of them; whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that a great part of worldly felicitie is taken upon trust, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting more in beleefe, than reall being.</p>
            <p>Men ought not talke of their wives, no not when sober; who speakes ill of them, incurres blame,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:12187:132"/>
for it is the husbands fault if the wife be bad; who speakes well of them, is in danger to be practised upon, because hee moves desire; men desire the good they possesse should be knowne; and oft-times whilst they make it knowne, they make it be possest: it is true that reall good is in its owne essence communicable, and by being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, receives increase; but ours, which is but an apparition, if communicated, is many times lost. Praise, if it be of any thing within us, is to be desired, because it cannot be taken from us; if of any thing without, or forth of us, it ought bee avoided, because it may be taken from us; praise makes it be desired, and desire makes us lose it: I wonder at those men who complaine of their being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed, when they have done all they are able to make themselves be annoyed: it is a great comfort, it is true, to possesse things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by all men; but as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:12187:133"/>
to counterpoize the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations of the intellect, hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced greatest honour there, where is greatest trouble: so Nature to counterpoize the pleasure of the sense, hath placed most danger there where most delight is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These young men make haste, first to Rome, then to Collatia: they finde <hi>Lucretia,</hi> not like the Kings daughters in law, feasting and rioting; but amidst her women dividing out their work; they grant her the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and here being by her husband invited, a base lust ariseth in <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Tarquin,</hi> occasioned as well by the chastity as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12187:133"/>
by the beauty of <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> the looke of a lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man, is like the looke of a Basiliske, it kils Chastitie by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MEN lustfully given, cause all their senses, yea, the understanding it selfe to minister provocations for the satisfying of that sense; beauty, birth, sweet odours, harmony, all which have nothing to doe with feeling; and which is worse, Vertue her selfe, and amongst vertues, very Chastitie, the very opposite to Lust, doe more incite thereunto: Vertue is so lovely, that she makes her selfe be beloved, yea, even by Vice: those who have written that dishonest women desire that their lovers should bee endowed with all good things, except the understanding, understood it not

            <p>A small matter would satisfie the necessitie of Nature, if men made it not necessary to satisfie what is not necessary; what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it to be clad in rich array, to live in stately Palaces, to feed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on dainty cates, if all cloathes cover us, all houses shelter, and all meats satisfie us? we make necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lust, to delight our selves yea in the imperfections of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:12187:135"/>
his assistance in love; and hee who was wont by sword to vent his angrie passions, knowes not how to lay it aside in tendrest affections; he threatens her, he speakes her faire, and seeing her ready ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imbrace death, than him; ready rather to lose her life than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; he sayes hee will kill some servant close by her, to make her bee beleeved a foule adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse.

            <p>I For my part beleeve that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> yeelded for fear of death, which certainly is much more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when expected from another, than when acted by ones selfe: and if this my opinion were not true, I should have much more cause to marvell at those who (under the rule of Tyrants) either despairing of life, or weary of that kinde of life, have slaine themselves. If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

shun, or desired to meet withall; the reward which profered it selfe unto them, was hope of living ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, or assurednesse not to die without glory: to say they were with-held by feare of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is idle: there is no torment more terrible than death; who feares not death, ought not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing of feare to be in the world: and when he finds such a thing to be, he may alwayes have recourse to the other. Nature hath not bin so niggardly towards us, as not permitting us to live as long as we would, shee hath not at least allowed us a power of dying when we please; if hee lives not, who breathes not, and if not to breathe bee in our choice, who will may die.</p>
            <p>Let it then be lawfull for men to say, that death is more horrid in the hands of an incensed man, than in our owne; and moreover, that it requires more courage, though there bee lesse danger, to kill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:12187:136"/>
than to kill ones selfe; the one proceeds from animosity, the other oft-times either from the weaknesse of the braine, or poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of courage; for a generous heart seldome findes the way so shut, as that hee cannot make his death glorious. It is a yeelding to Fortune, against which, the couragious, till their last gaspe, fight undauntedly. How many sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women are there who have slain themselves, when they durst not have looked upon, much lesse have abided the lookes of an incensed man? And how many are there, who to shun the enemies sword, have throwne themselves downe from rockes, buried themselves in bogs, and drowned themselves in water, without any hope of life?</p>

where bodies governe the mind, where rationality is in habit, not in act, where to command is sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, to obey liberty: let there be regall power; they are people which thinke themselves free, when they are freed from the burthen of commanding.</p>
               <p>To desire liberty and shun ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, is naturall to very beasts; and man seeming to be of worse condition than brute beasts, which as rationall passe by the greater delights of sense to shun subjection; hee as irrationall, passing by the better reasons of the understanding, precipitates himselfe into servitude, as if sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very were the greatest sensuality.</p>

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceeds thus in humane things: evill of it selfe alwayes increaseth, good alwayes dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth. Who will make the sonnes better than the father? Their temperature is composed of the blood of two wicked ones; they are educated by a Tyrant, borne in a commanding Family, more proud than <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> for they are likely to bee more insupportable, who brought up in good fortune, have no reason to remember or feare bad.</p>
               <p>To say that good Princes ought to be begg'd of the gods, and to be borne withall be they what they please, is an instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

how to live, but not how to live well; it belongs to slaves, not free men; it hath respect ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the retchlesnesse of subjects, than honour. When a Prince cannot be made good, he ought to bee driven out bad as he is: he is not to bee suffered, who by sufferance becomes worse.</p>
               <p>The world is growne so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that a good Prince is not so much as to be hoped for. Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome makes him not bee the more esteemed, but craft; the names of things are changed: goodnesse, is tearmed simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Tyranny, policie: and a Prince is thought so much the greater, by how much more hee hath inlarged his Empire or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; nor are the meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined how hee inlarged them, he is praised onely because hee hath inlarged them.</p>

            <p>If by liberty bee intended a power of doing what one will, 'twill turne to licentiousnesse, and that government which hath most thereof, will be worst.

            <p>The Tyrant who heares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe flattered, thinkes himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; he thinkes his being had in reverence, to bee the fruits of his wisedome: and because hee makes away with all those whom hee hates, he thinkes nothing remains for him but love: he seeth himselfe honored, and beleeves he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it; not knowing that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his cruelty, not worth.</p>

that the reverence done them should be reall and not fained, as they rather beleeve he that honors them is himselfe deceived, than that hee deceives them.</p>
            <p>This is the greatest of all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the last, which departs not but with the last breath; common to both good and bad; affected likewise by those who seeme not to value it.</p>
            <p>Observance, reverence, humble bowings of the body, are inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are adulations, which are often done with the feet; and are so much worse than those which are done by the tongue, by how much they seem to be more lawful, by how much they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.

               <hi>These are the actions done by <hi>Lucius Tarquin</hi> the Proud, in the progresse of his reigne of five and twentie yeares; after which <hi>Aristocracie</hi> was constituted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BRUTUS was to blame in the framing of the Common-wealth, to make it too much Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocraticall; for had he granted in those beginnings a share of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment unto the people, hee would not have necessitated them to assume the whole unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; nor would he have put the Citie in danger of being lost, in those Tumults, wherein if he did not ruine the Common-wealth, he did for certaine ruine the forme of that Common-wealth. Perhaps,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:12187:149"/>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> beleeved, the people would give way to the Majestie of the Senate.</p>
            <p>States which are maintained by Art, may well continue, if mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by intelligent Arts-men; but this but for a while; Art will be discovered, nor can it be conceald, if it be often used: if the Cocke should tarry long where the Lion is, after having some few times been afraid of his crowing, the Lion would devoure him: when that would be made seeme to be, which is not, it must be cursorily done, if any good successe be expected.</p>
            <p>Hee who in the beginning of Common-wealths doth constitute the best forme, doth not constitute the most durable; when a man can climbe no higher, and cannot stay himselfe upon a point individible, he must down again, and so doing, oftentimes precipitates himselfe. So a Common-wealth reduced to the very best forme, not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, whilst it seekes after what
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:12187:150"/>
is naturall, it oft-times fals upon what is violent, which doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it. A man must shape his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes according to his materials, and of what he cannot make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossus, be contented to make a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue no bigger than the life.</p>
            <p>The most part of Cities, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> once freed from the hands of Tyrants, have falne into them againe, have done it by reason of this: great judgement is required in the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what forme a City is capable of; and one ought not alwayes thinke of forming there a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; but sometimes where a Tyrant is driven forth, a King should be erected, to shun the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of another Tyrant.</p>
            <p>There is no man, how wise so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who being a former, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Institutor or Law-maker, doth not commit some errors in his first Ordinations, Statutes or Lawes, which in the processe of time may ruine his structure; that Machine is onely of duration, which in the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:12187:150"/>
first appearing of errors, or in the correcting of them, runs not totall ruine.</p>
            <p>It is apparant that the City of Rome, whose people had their weapons in their hands, and were every day verst in the atchivement of new States, did rather require a Democraticall than Aristocraticall government; and that not being to be withstood by a greater force, she would come to it of her selfe; it was therefore her great good fortune, that in approching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto shee fell not, because she made her approch leasurely.</p>
            <p>It is worthy observation, how the formes of state require a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed matter, the which they no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner find, but they introduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: it is not men which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths, or yet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, but a certaine nature or power of interest, which though not knowne suffers them not to be in quiet, till it hath brought them where they have a great proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:12187:151"/>
just as it useth to befall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they goe, being led by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall instinct, never are at quiet, till they arrive at that place, which though being naturall unto them, was not knowne by them.

            <p>Had not <hi>Tarquin</hi> beene driven out by <hi>Brutus,</hi> and had the regall power yet a little longer endured, I doe almost, nay, undoubtedly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my selfe, that Rome had never tasted the sweets of Liberty; not for that the corruptions which were in the King, (as some have beleeved,) entring into the other members of the Citie, had disina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her for this purpose, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that hee would totally have extinguished the Senate, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof being forgotten,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:12187:151"/>
the hope of liberty would have beene likewise lost.</p>
            <p>Those Monarchies which are governed Monarchically, where one onely commands, and all the rest obey, have seldome an end; but those which by meanes of a Senate are governed Aristocratically, end most commonly in an Aristocracie.</p>
            <p>I seldome find that the Senate of Rome hath cast away their chiefe; conspiracies would be sudden, and knowne but to a few, here they are slow, and knowne to many: the greatest harme occasioned hereby to a Prince, is the holding alwayes before the citizens eies, the picture of Liberty; those who see it, desire it, hope for it; and when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon a Tyrant Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, there wants not some amongst them, who will adhere to the bringing in thereof.</p>
            <p>A Senate when uncorrupted, alwayes endevours equality, and whilst it endevours that none be greater than other, it is true, it
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:12187:152"/>
makes a Tyrant lyable to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Common-wealth, which may arise; but it doth almost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from the ambition of such as seeke after Principality.</p>
            <p>But bee the effects of Senates good or bad to Princes, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Princes cannot endure them, and that they endevour to destroy them. Some of which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Titles to Magistrates, have taken away from them the substance; and these have augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted authority, but not secured do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; others have assayd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the Senate, by suffering the old Senatours to dye by course of nature, and not substituting new ones in their places; but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too tedious a way, requiring the life of more than one Prince, it hath seldome succeeded well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause seldome doe two Princes succeed of the same minde. <hi>Tarquin</hi> had likewise this intent, and to free himselfe from the difficultie caused by the length of time, hee
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:12187:152"/>
put them to death; nor yet did this cause good successe unto him: A long cruelty is, by the speech of men, too long remembred and the Prince sooner ends his life, than his cruelty. Moreover, by reducing the Senatours to a small number, where the forme of a Senate is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the forme of a conspiracie is initiated.</p>
            <p>There was one, who on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part, did in his first entrance into government, at one clap put downe a whole magistracie, and he had good successe in living quietly amongst his citizens, and likewise in subduing of strangers, till such time as he met with greater forces than his owne: this mans case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it succeeded well, hath beene by some wicked men in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings commended, and his example by some lewd Princes imitated; it was neither well written, nor well imitated; the one hath reaped lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle honour by teaching it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little profit by following it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:12187:153"/>
This did not damnifie <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> for he did not extinguish that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie to tyrannize, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Citie, and shewing that the <hi>Ephori</hi> would have hindred his right end, being of themselves wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that act bore rather the face of Justice than cruelty: it is not cruelty, when a good Prince puts wicked men to death, because they may not hinder his goodnesse; and if it bee cruelty, it is not mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming; but then it is crueltie when a bad Prince puts good men to death, that they may not hinder his wicked proceedings. He left no desire of revenge, because it was calmly executed; nor did hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards give any occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, for that to a severe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hee added a pleasing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse: and as small present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have no great operation, if they be not preceded by weighty past causes, so weighty past causes have no operation at all, if they want a present occasion.</p>

               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:12187:153"/>
               <hi>Tarquin</hi> did not onely exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Senate, but made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people value him but a little, by his imploying them about buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: which in my opinion was a great cause of his ruine.</p>
            <p>A Prince who hath the people for his friends, let him take heed of treachery, for he may almost secure himselfe from insurrections; hee may be slaine, never driven out. I know that people, though never so much bound unto their Prince, will sometimes be provoked by a sudden scorne, or perswaded by a man of worth. But let him take heed of tumults caused by hatred, for such are not to be withstood, whereas those that are occasioned by a flash of anger, or fitly applied eloquence, may be remedied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion.</p>
            <p>In such a case the people doe nought at all, if not in an instant; he who hath beene assisted by them in the act, let him feare them when 'tis done; for the act is no sooner done,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:12187:154"/>
than by them repented; and often times they turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves against him that did perswade them, either because they will revenge their Prince, or else cancell their owne shame. Water which contrary to its nature is heated, no sooner parts from what did heat it, but it returnes to it first condition: the witchcraft of Rhetorique being ended, which is not long a doing, or the fire of anger being over, which suddenly vanisheth; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaines in the common people but shame, for having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared against a benefactor.</p>
            <p>He who writ of so many things, and writ so masterlike in all, for the maintaining of Tyranny, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the imploying of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout building; and yet this was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the cause why <hi>Tarquin</hi> lost his: nor was this only caused by their being rather sordid than magnificent, but likewise by the difference betweene taking peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from a chargeable idlenesse,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:12187:154"/>
imploying them in a usefull labor, and the taking of them from the molestations of warre, imploying them in the labors of the mattock. Nothing makes the troubles of war more supportable, than the rest and quiet which is hoped for at home; nor is there any thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth more to fight against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, than hope of acquiring glory amongst friends: 'tis strange then, that rest after war should bee greater labour, and the glory thereof turned to shame.</p>
            <p>The examples alledged by that author, are either of barbarous people, their Princes slaves, and who know no other glory, than their belly: or els of Tyrants, who having usurped the liberty, wherin the people had a large share, had reason rather to feare the peoples leasure times, than the hatred of the great ones. But the Romanes were civilized subjects, not slaves, accustomed to war, wonted to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, lovers of repose, when it did
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:12187:155"/>
not repugne their glorie: but <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> had not usurped the peoples liberty, but had rather freed them from the oppression of great ones, over whom till then, he was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Pride likewise had her share in <hi>Tarquins</hi> losse: by pride Princes thinke to shun contempt, and they meet with hatred; they thinke thereby to become majesticall, and they become detested: majestie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires mildnesse, not pride; which is signified by them, who did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe both these, as inseparable qualities, to the Easterne beames of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> But this is a vice almost not to bee seperated from great ones; there is nothing makes us more beleeve, that the sin of the cheefest angel in heaven was pride, than because he was cheefest. Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers (suppose their art be vaine) have notwithstanding united pride to greatnesse, whilest they make the Sunne in regard of manners, the infuser of pride, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:12187:155"/>
of dignity, they make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenser of principalities.</p>
            <p>But to what end doe I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue numbring up his errors, if his whole life was one compact er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? He could not maintaine Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny by goodnesse, accosting it to monarchy, nor yet by craft, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it farre distant from monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie: he was more rash than poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique; more wicked, than warie; he lived ill himselfe, hee brought up worse sons; and being himselfe a wicked king, he left no hopes of a good successour.</p>
            <p>I deny not but that he was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captaine, but to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? If war be to a Tyrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, either hee commits the trust thereof to others, and incurs danger of him who commands the army, or else hee goes himselfe in person, and runs in danger of those who stay behinde. He who praiseth a warlike Tyrant, would (it may be) understand it of one that had beene so, or at least of one
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:12187:156"/>
that did not only wage war with city armes, but likwise with those of strangers, wherewithall hee might bridle a tumultuating Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or oppresse a City that should rebell.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude this my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course better, than by calling to minde to all those that read it, the thankes due to Almighty God, for having caused us be borne in times abounding with good Princes, when Christianity lives happy, void of Tyrants. The most holy, most wise, and most loving head whereof exalted above others, like to the brasen Serpent, is of power and force to free us from the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of such Serpents, if they should arise: and because God doth sometimes permit Tyrants, for the chastisement of mankinde; to see that all his people are this day go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by excellent Princes, makes me beleeve, that the world (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever others thinke) is not now worse than it hath beene, and that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:12187:156"/>
if there be some wicked men that irritate his Justice, there be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some good, that excite his mercy. The which mercy I pray, and humbly turne to pray againe, that it will please his divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to make us partakers of now, and in the houre of death.</p>
