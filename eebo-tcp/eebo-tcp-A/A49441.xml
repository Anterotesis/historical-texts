            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Send you here no new Present,
but such, as you have been long
acquainted with; and did first
by sending me the Question in
the Title, occasion my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
and what I remember St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith in
his Epistle <hi>ad Amphilochium,</hi> in putting the
Question, you taught me. For although a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
man cannot but read of these things here
discussed, yet I am confident they had never by
me been digested into Method, and by that been
so conclusive to mine own and other mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without your satisfaction had provoked
it. Indeed in those sad times when this was
writ, there was a rebellion against virtue it
self, and mens friendship was extirpate, Root
and Branch; For the communication of friends,
<pb facs="tcp:61847:3"/>
scatter'd about the Kingdome, was broken, by
the intercepting, yea, the betraying of Letters,
to the Writers prejudice, which I felt: but yet
we kept an intercourse by that dumb mans lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
of inviting, as oft as we could with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and communicated our thoughts by Letters,
when we could not personally meet. You were
tyed to live in <hi>London,</hi> by a necessary duty you
had to a very near and dear friend of ours, who
was committed to your care; I at a parochial charg
to attend my flock, so long as I could in that
time; How were my thoughts perplexed for you
when those accursed Oaths (for which with their
dependencies I know the Land ought to mourn,
or else I fear will suffer more) flew about,
fearing by some surprise, you might be ensnared,
to act that, which your soul abhorred. I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
satisfied by letters of your freedom, yea,
sometimes by the questions you sent me about
these inquiries which were then started; As my
fears were great before, so my joy in your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
was high afterwards, as my admiration,
how it could be: But do you praise God daily for
that, whose Providence invisibly looked over
and protected you from those evils; And trust in
him, who will always preserve you loving and
fearing him; Amongst others this was one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb facs="tcp:61847:3"/>
you enticed me to write about, which, at
such leasure, as I could steal from Domestique
troubles, I answered in a treatise: You writ to
me to Print it; I knew not, nor could remember
any such thing, which I medled with; when I
came to <hi>London,</hi> you shew'd it me, I knew my
good freind Mr. <hi>Thomas Otwayes</hi> hand, who
took the pains to transcribe it for me; read it,
and knew mine own Notions some of them, and
so gave way to the Press: If there be any thing
which adds to the common Notions of Scholars,
let the Reader thank you, who were the occasion
and informer of my studies in it; and not so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but a preserver of it; In the first, you were a
Father; In the second, a Foster to it and by this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men may take notice of our mutual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and wherein our friendship did consist in
those times; When men could scarce know, how
to live; our thoughts were imploy'd about think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how to live for ever. Farewel, God bless you
you, is the hearty Prayer of him, who is not more
truly your brother, than.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are some things which I
thought fit to acquaint you with;
first, with my self who am here
stiled a Bishop, and so may be
mistrusted to speak, as a man bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
in the cause, writing for my self, and our
Order; but although I am one, yet when this
was writ, I was none: but a Presbyter only,
and never thought to be a Bishop, or to see
one in <hi>England,</hi> nor could; unless I could have
foreseen such a miraculous deliverance, as it
pleased God to give the King; for which his
Name ought always to be magnified; so that
the writer, should not prejudice the Cause,
being then impartial.</p>
            <p>The next thing is concerning my medling
with Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker</hi> of <hi>New England</hi> in
this controversy, which I cannot call to mind
by what reason: But this I remember, that
there was a Clergy-man of mine acquaintance,
who warping that way, highly commended
that Author, and had some Conference with
<pb facs="tcp:61847:4"/>
me about his Book, and it was much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a friend of mine in <hi>London,</hi> who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
my buying of it, an ingenious man
he was, with a very Logical and Methodical
Head; but so overcome with his own opinions;
that even opposite expressions appear to him,
as if they were for him, as will appear in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
the Treatise.</p>
            <p>My way of writing was to follow my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses,
as they lay before me; not consining
my self to any others Method, who had treated
of such things; Many times you may find
me writing the same things, which twenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me have done, <hi>Aliter non sit Avitaliber</hi>
it must needs be so; but sometimes again you
may be rewarded with such notions, as are
not ordinary; without which, a Book is but
repetition, but in all you shall find mine own
manner of expressions, which may possibly
meet with some, understanding more agreeing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than others have done; and so may be
profitable to the quieting of different judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the greatest and most Noble work of
any mans industry; and if I have done it, but in
part, I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in
its own genuine signification is properly
rendered some Serving work, or Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
serving, so Luke 10. 40. <hi>Martha was
cumbred with much s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rving;</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is there rendred <hi>serving.</hi> The places which would illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
this truth might be exceeding many, but, as needlesse, I
let them passe; from hence it comes, that sometimes this word
is used in the New Testament for such Service as is done about
Spiritual things, by such as are destined to that work: so Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8. <hi>If the Ministration of Death was glorious,
how shall not the Ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?</hi>
and so likewise in the 9. <hi>verse.</hi> In all which is signified under
this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the whole Negotiation that Spiritual Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61847:6"/>
perform for the Spiritual good of men. Again, it is used for
a particular Office, which was allotted to the taking Care of the
poor; thus ye may find it, <hi>Acts 6. 1. In those dayes there arose
a murmuring of the</hi> Grecians <hi>against the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>because their
widowes were neglected in the daily Ministration:</hi> there is the
same word again; and upon that ground the Apostles ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ituted
the Office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> as you may see afterwards, and for that
reason because of their Ministration they were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that is, as we use to call them, <hi>Deacons,</hi> but indeed is <hi>Ministers.</hi>
Again, from hence it comes, that this Office being the lowest,
and the foundation of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, because all
that serve God for the good of mens Souls, are at the least Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
or Ministers: That this word is sometimes in its general
Notion applied to the very Apostleship, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 17. speaking of
<hi>Judas</hi> who was one of the 12. Apostles, <hi>He obtained part of this
Ministry:</hi> and verse the 25. speaking of him whom God should
choose, <hi>that he may take part of this Ministry and Apostleship
from which,</hi> &amp;c. where you see the <hi>Apostleship</hi> called <hi>Ministry;</hi>
so likewise 2 Cor. 11. 23. <hi>Are they Ministers of Christ? I
speak as a fool, I am more,</hi> speaking of the Apostles, I am more,
more Ministerial, more industrious. Thus, as we may say, a man
is a vegetable Creature, which is the remote <hi>Genus,</hi> so are
these said to be <hi>Ministers;</hi> but I can never observe, that in any
particular Application, this word <hi>Minister</hi> is used for that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Order of <hi>Presbyter</hi> either in Scripture or Antiquity, as in
this corrupt Age by usurpation it is abused; But I think in this
question you understand by it the whole body of the Clergy
by what Titles soever, and in that sense I mean to speak of it,
and so addresse my self to the consideration of what a Minister
is, and I conceive that I may thus define him.</p>

apparent; Secondly, in his Difference: the first phrase is, <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by God;</hi> that is, by the Command or Institution of God:
There are many Officers that are instituted and ordained by
men, who have power from God to do this Act of Instituting
Officers; but a Minister is an Officer instituted by God: from
him he hath power in Divine things, these no man can have
power over, but he who hath this Authority granted him from
God, and that is it which St. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi> affirms, Heb. 5. 4. <hi>No man
taketh this honor to himself but he who is called of God, as was</hi>
Aaron. Nay presently after he affirmeth of Christ, that he
assumed the Priesthood not of himself, but from the Father;
so then this Ministerial Function requireth Gods Ordination:
but by the word <hi>Ordination</hi> I not only conceive an Institution
of God, but likewise some Duty commanded which God orders
thereunto; So that by giving this <hi>Order</hi> (so the <hi>School,</hi> and we
in <hi>English,</hi> call these holy <hi>Functions)</hi> God exacts a Duty in these
men who exercise it: For the graces given these men being such
as the School calls <hi>gratis datae,</hi> not sanctifying the person who
hath them, but such as are for the sanctification of others, God
who gives nothing in vain, will require an Account of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and abilities. And to this purpose St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1.
<hi>Let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensators
or Stewards of the mysteries of God;</hi> Vers. 2. <hi>Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it is required in Stewards that they should be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi>
that is, to lay out the moneys according to their Lords
appointment and direction, according to the Lords Ordinance;
but there is more intimated in this word <hi>Ordinance,</hi> to wit,
an enabling the person who is ordained to do some superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Work, but the enabling must be understood <hi>in Actu pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
not <hi>secundo,</hi> that is, he is enabled with Authority to do
that is required. A man gives his keyes to his Steward, bids
him search such Rooms, such Boxes for such occasions as he
hath need; here he hath <hi>Clavem,</hi> the Authority and right pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do this Duty to open the doors <hi>in Actu primo,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his hands are weak, he cannot turn the key, or he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
he knows not how to do it, yet what he doth is regular, he
hath Power and Authority to do it, and should another who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61847:7"/>
hath more ability, do it in the second Act, and not in the first,
he doth it like a Thief, not like a Steward: This first right is
certainly Conveyed by the Ordinance of God with holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but not the second: and they who do these duties without
this Authority given them from Christ, are therefore called by
Christ <hi>Thieves and Robbers;</hi> John 10. 1. <hi>He that entreth not by
the door into the Sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, he is a
Thief and a Robber;</hi> they are Thieves, but they who come by
the door, by Authority from Christ, are the right Shepherds,
and have Authority to go into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>old and do their Duty there;
so that though a Minister have Authority given him to do holy
Things, yet he may not have the Science or Integrity to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
but what he hath, so far is ratifyed by God, but
others who have not this Authority, though they do the same
things, yet they are responsible for a presumption; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
out of <hi>Acts 19. v.</hi> 13. where certain Exorcists took upon
them the power Divine of Casting out Devils, which was Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical;
but they stole the keyes of this power, had them
not given them, and the Devils rent and tare them? from all
which it appears, that the enabling with this power such as may
be justifyed, comes from a Divine Ordination, and not else.
The next Term is, <hi>To do something conducing to the Salvation
of mens Souls:</hi> I put this phrase <hi>(to do something)</hi> more largely
than the Schools, and the great Consent of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
use to do, who restrain it only to the holy Communion; as if
holy Orders were only referred to that Mysterie, and so with
wresting, bring in those little Ecclesiastical Officers into the
Number; but we may observe, that for ought I find, a <hi>Deacon</hi>
by his Institution or Practice at the first in the New Testament
had nothing to do with the Communion, nor indeed hath more
now than to assist with the Cup: And the great Power of the
Keyes toucheth not the Act of Communion immediately, but by
reason of admission or prohibiting such as shall or shall not
Communicate: I choose therefore this phrase <hi>(to do something)</hi>
which comprehends all, even that and Preaching, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else conduceth to mans Salvation, but yet we must apply
this to what went before likewise, and take all together; there
are many Acts done by men, who are not Ministers, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to others Salvation, and are very usefull, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61847:7"/>
in them, nay are done out of Duty; as the Example of a
good life, discreet admonishing men of their faults, incouraging
others to virtue, and the like, which are all Acts of Duty from
one Christian man to another, but not Acts of Office; Acts of
Charity as they are Christians, not as they are this or that sort
of men.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore recall the first <hi>Term, (that they must do.
something Conducing to the salvation of men.)</hi> This phrase must
be a little farther cleared likewise. There are things which
Conduce accidentally to the Salvation of others, as persecution,
affliction; so it was with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> sometimes assisting in villany,
which starts up some Divine Speech or Action; so those wicked
persons, who assisted in the Crucifying of our Saviour, their
Wicked Act made them Spectators and Auditors of those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
words, which then declared him to be God, and made
them receive that Faith in him, and confesse that he was the Son
of God; But these persons are in themselves the Devils Ministers,
though Gods almighty power and providence Conjured them
about, as he will the very Devils themselves, and draw his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
out of their Wickednesse, his light out of their Darknesse;
These Acts in themselves Conduce to Hell, but God wrought
them miraculously about to Heaven, and therefore not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
here, but such as in themselves are disposed to it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Heaven is not a result or an Effect naturally arising out of
our Works, but a blessing bestowed upon the Workers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Works, for Christs sake, therefore those things
which Conduce to Heaven in themselves must be such as God
is pleased to Covenant with us, that upon them and the doing
of them he will give this Salvation; for no man can obtain that
by Fraud or Violence, and therefore it must be on such Terms
as he Covenants for: And these things are those of the Word
and Sacraments, (as the whole Christian World hath named
them, though they have no such name given them in the New
Testament) to wit this: God hath provided Salvation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for his Servants, the Means for them to get this Heaven is
by these Covenants, Sealing these Deeds, obeying these Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or which he hath appointed Officers, and given
them Power and Authority to administer these Covenants, (Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Atturney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is a Legal, Juridical businesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61847:8"/>
phrase befits it) to act these things betwixt him and men,
and teach them his Lawes and will, by which they shall be Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of this blessing, and they who have an Office,) and from
that Office Authority to do All or Some of these things, are the
<hi>Ministers</hi> we speak of: And I think this may suffice to speak,
what a Minister is; How he is ordained, and who they are,
will follow.</p>

                  <p>TO understand these heads, we must first conceive, that a
man can receive or assume no such power (that is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)
to himself, unlesse it be given him from Heaven, as St. <hi>John</hi>

how that History shall agree with the Design it had to bring

in Ovo,</hi> in the Foundation, then to shew what Superstructures
the Apostles built upon it, what it was in the birth when it was

a Chick. The first must be sought out of the <hi>Gospells,</hi> or the
beginning of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the Story of our Saviours imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Commerce with this World both in his life, and after his

                  <head>CHAP. III. The Election of the Apostles, and what to do.</head>
                  <p>THE first remarkable business in the Gospel, is the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Apostles, which we may find recorded in
the 3d. of St. <hi>Mark</hi> v. 13. and the 6th. of St. <hi>Luke</hi> v.
13. In St. <hi>Mark</hi> we may observe <hi>that he ordained Twelve, that
they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to
preach;</hi> and in St. <hi>Luke</hi> we may note, <hi>that he gave these Twelve
the Name of Apostles:</hi> out of this we may Consider, that our
Saviour having many Disciples such as had leaned and listned to
his Doctrine, he chose out of them <hi>Twelve,</hi> which he gave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Favours to, and gave them that name of Office to be
Apostles; That there was some Mystery in that Number of
Twelve I am perswaded, because that after the Apostacy of
<hi>Judas,</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> v. 22. St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 109. 7. <hi>another should take his
Office:</hi> It was necessary another should succeed him in that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and they chose one and no more to Compleat the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
What that Mystery is, is not so apparent: That which
fits my Apprehension is this, That our Saviour did, in very
many things, lay the platform of his Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to the pattern of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Polity, and in this
particular he resembled the Twelve Patriarchs; but this he laid
as Pillars only or a foundation, intending it only to support the
rest, not to figure out the Number of these Officers which were
afterwards to be, a Number I know by none pretended to:
but yet they then were so many pillars to support this building,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61847:9"/>
and whatsoever Structure should be raised must be erected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these: But besides their Number we may mark their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which was two-fold, about our Saviour, and about the
Church, or other men; about our Saviour, that they should
be with him hearing and learning his Doctrine, spectators of
his Miracles, and most exemplar manner of Life, that so they
being to bear Witnesse of him and his Actions afterwards, might
the more Constantly and Confidently do it, when they had in
such a manner been Conversant with him. That which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
other men, was, That he might send them forth to preach.
Here was an Office Instituted, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> records it, and to
have power to heal sicknesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Gift of Miracles was
not the Office it self, but a sign and token by which men might
know that they were sent from God; for they taking upon them
a new Office, and pretending that they received it of God; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
it for him, it was necessary that they should bring with
them some evidence that they had it from him, and this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or sign of it was this power of Miracles, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
them. Thus St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath described the Office, and
because men should not be mistaken in these Officers, St. <hi>Mark</hi>
and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have set down the particular Names and Characters
of many of them; upon which I insist not, as not material to my
work. But then it must be marked farther, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> sets
down the Name of the Office, as well as the Officers, and saith
the Name was imposed by Christ, <hi>which he called Apostles,</hi>
which Name is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is <hi>mitto,</hi> to
send, and an Apostle is <hi>missus,</hi> one sent; thus the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the word signifies, and so the word is used <hi>John 13. 16.
Neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
he that is sent, but in this place it is perpetually put for the Name
of this Office; and to the same sense is that word Angel, which
with <hi>Apostle, Amen,</hi> and divers other words, all languages ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and derive from the Original; Angel is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which is <hi>Nuntius,</hi> a Messenger to relate some Affairs to
others, now the Apostles received this Name as men sent about
the most excellent Errand that ever was; the Messengers, the
men sent. In a word, we see there were a certain Number of
men chosen, they are set down what they are, what their Names
were, and the Number of the Committee, and we see the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61847:9"/>
names of their Office, as likewise what their Authority hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
was, that is, to preach. No doubt but <hi>Beza</hi>'s word which he
interposeth, <hi>(to preach the Gospel)</hi> is a good glosse, though I think
it not the right Text. But although they have Election into an
Office provided for them, and a power and Authority to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this Office, when they are sent, yet they must not go before
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ey are sent; we will consider therefore their Mission in the
next place.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. How and to whom the Apostles were sent.</head>
                  <p>AND for that we must come to St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. 1. and to
St. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 1. there we may observe, in either place,
that as before they had the power given them, so in these places
they were Commanded to execute this power. In St. <hi>Mark</hi> it
is said, that <hi>he ordained Twelve, that they might be with him, that
he might send them forth to preach;</hi> ready they were for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they lacked nothing but Mission, and that they had in the
former places. In St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 10. 5. we may observe these
Twelve sent forth, we shall see there the place where they were
to execute the Commissions described; First, negatively, verse
the 5. <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the
Samaritans enter ye not:</hi> then positively, <hi>but rather go ye to the
lost Sheep of the house of Israel,</hi> vers. 6. Not that our Saviour
would forbid Salvation to any Soul in the World, for others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Jews</hi> were Converted; [but accidentally] the Office of
the Apostles, in our Saviours time, was while he lived restrained
to them; And therefore we may observe, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in the 10th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> until he was admonished by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Errors, was of Opinion, <hi>that it was not lawfull for a
Jew to have any Communication or keep Company with a Gentile,</hi> as
he expresseth it to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> vers. 28. So then you see their
Commission restrained in place; and, Secondly, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Commission explained, what they were to preach.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. III. What they were to preach.</head>
                  <p>BEfore, they had Commission to preach, now a Command
what to preach, St. <hi>Luke</hi> the 9th. ver. 2. <hi>to preach the
kingdom of God;</hi> St. <hi>Matth. 10. 7. The Kingdom of heaven is at
hand; the kingdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the kingdom of heaven,</hi> are the
same, called from God as the King; as we may say <hi>Caesars</hi>
Kingdom or Empire, called from Heaven as the place, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Now this Kingdom
is from the Eminency of it called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is as it were the Court where Gods Glory is most
manifestly apparent, that is called his Kingdom, as <hi>Rome;</hi> but
though his Court be there, his Kingdom is on Earth; though
Heaven be the Court, yet Earth is the Country of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
though Heaven be his Throne, yet Earth is his Foot-stool:
So then, by <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> or, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand,</hi> is meant, that Christs Kingdom was comming near; That
now the time was Comming, in which he should conquer the
Devil, and lead Captivity captive; now the time was Comming
in which he should Settle his Dominions in the World: And this
was much the same with the Subject of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Mat. 3. 2. <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of God is at hand;</hi>
nor indeed could other Doctrine be preached, for Christ had
not yet Conquered the Devil, nor setled his Government,
and therefore, as their Commission was setled and restrained to
a place; so it was in the Doctrine much unlike what it afterwards
came to. Thus you see that the Apostles had now at the last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
Commission to preach; you see their Diocesse, <hi>to the Lost Sheep
of the house of Israel;</hi> you see likewise what they were to preach.
The next thing to be Considered, will be, what other Officers
our Saviour Instituted, and what Enlargement he gave to this
Commission, whether any or no.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. What other Commission our Saviour gave to
other men.</head>
                  <p>TO understand this, let us consider <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1. where we
shall find that our Saviour called and sent Seventy, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
and two other Disciples besides these Twelve before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
the diverse Lection of the Number is not material to any
thing in hand; but we may observe, first, that there was the same
businesse, in which they were employed, as the very Apostles
were, out of the 9th. verse, where they were commanded to
preach the same Doctrine: <hi>The Kingdom of God is come nigh
unto you:</hi> That they had the same Assistance for their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the power of Miracles; That they had the same way of
Congratulating Cities or houses, whither they came; That there
was the same Curse upon them that received them not; that they
were so to demean themselves both to the receivers and them
who did not receive them: But herein we see some difference;
the Apostles were first ordained, and then sent; these ordained
and sent together. Secondly, the Apostles were taken into a
Near attendance about Christ, and from that had a more Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Acquaintance with both his Life and Doctrine; and from
thence, although these were sent equally with them in all respects,
yet they only had the Name of Apostles, given them by a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Eminence, which throughout the Gospel is not attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to these later Disciples; Besides these, I read not of any
persons which had any Mission from Christ to do these great
Works concerning mans Salvation. But hitherto we find onely
the Authority of preaching given. We will therefore in the
next place Consider who were made Ministers of these Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of Heaven, called Baptism, and the Lords Supper; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these, all these, or other besides them.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>SECT. V. Who were made Ministers of the Sacraments.</head>
                  <p>TO begin with Baptism: that Baptism was instituted in our
Saviours life time, is very evident out of the 3d. of St. <hi>John,</hi>
v. 22. where it is said, That our Saviour <hi>camo into Judea, and
there tarried with them, and baptized,</hi> that's expounded Chapter
4. v. 2. that he did <hi>not baptize, but his disciples:</hi> out of which it
is evident, besides the Conference he had with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in
the beginning of the 3d. Chapter, That there was a Baptism
used and instituted by our Saviour, and they who were the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of it were his Disciples; But now, when it was instituted;
and what it was that was Instituted, are mighty difficulties, not
fully cleared: For the first part, I leave all those parties which fix
it to any times, which are these two, either when St. <hi>John</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
our Saviour, of which we may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 13. or else in his
Conference with <hi>Nicodemus, John</hi> 3. 5. where he uttered these
words; <hi>Except a man be born again of Water and the holy Spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven;</hi> I can consent to neither
of these: Not to the first, for we find nothing like an Ordination;
but indeed by the descending of the Holy Ghost, and the voice
from Heaven, a foundation for an Ordinance, but not an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
it self: Not the second, for it was a private Conference
between our Saviour and that man, wherein he might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that there had been some such Thing, or that there should
be such a power given; but this did not settle any such power,
nor any form or Minister of it: I conclude therefore, that as
many things were done, without doubt, which are not written, as
St. <hi>John</hi> speaks in the last Chapter of his Gospel, and the last
verse: so amongst many things this is one, which yet was
done, we may safely Conclude, because it would be a mighty
presumption for the Disciples, to usurp a power of baptizing
without a Commission, and that they did baptize is apparent, I
therefore Conclude that it was done, but when is not apparent:
and now let us examine what was done.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. Concerning Baptisme.</head>
                  <p>THis Question seems to me to be very unsatisfactorily hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by those who have treated of it. To understand what
can be comprehended in it, conceive with me, that there comes
a three-fold Baptism in Consideration in this Question: the
Baptism which we are baptized with, which in expresse terms
was ordained by our Saviour after his resurrection; the Baptism
of <hi>John Baptist;</hi> and the Baptism of the Disciples of our Saviour
in the time of his residence upon Earth: the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi>
and the Baptism of our Saviour, have been disputed with a great
deal of vehemency betwixt <hi>Calvin</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
whether it were the same with our Saviours or no? and I am in
this Conclusion against <hi>Calvin,</hi> and do think that he causlesly
rejects the Fathers with a sleight in his <hi>Institutes,</hi> when certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in it self the Question is of no great use to any Design of faith
or piety; I will not trouble the Controversie now, but shall be
ready to give an Account of it to any man that shall require it;
but hint out to the Reader that one place <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. Where St.
<hi>Paul finding Disciples at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>asked them, whether they
had received the Holy Ghost? They answered, that they had not
so much as heard that there was an Holy Ghost:</hi> and he replying,
<hi>to what were ye then baptized? they answered; unto</hi> Johns <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:</hi>
Then in the 4th. verse, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, <hi>that</hi> John
<hi>indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the
people, that they should believe on him who should come after him,
that is, on Jesus Christ. When they heard this, they were baptized
in the Name of the Lord Jesus:</hi> Observe, that it could not be the
same which was instituted by our Saviour, because they had not
heard of the Holy Ghost, which is an expresse phrase appointed
by our Saviour; and then, that they were baptized by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
which was a sign the first was not perfect; This particular is
miserably shifted off by <hi>Beza,</hi> and that shift wonderfully extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Chamier,</hi> when the Text is evident that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Whether the. Baptism of the Disciples before
Christs death, was the same with Johns?</head>
                  <p>THere is a second Controversie, whether the baptism of
the Disciples before Christs Death, differed from <hi>Johns?</hi>
sure it seems to differ; because <hi>Johns</hi> Disciples came to him in
the 3d. of <hi>John,</hi> v. 26. and told him how <hi>Christ baptized,</hi> and
seemed enviously to clamour, that he and his baptism was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
more than St. <hi>Johns;</hi> which, if it had been the same, they
would never have done: because by that their own Church was
encreased; but wherein this Difference was placed, we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern, by the Gospel; for, as I have shewed, their Doctrine
was the same, <hi>that the Kingdom of God was at hand,</hi> and they
could not go further but as Prophets, for yet it was not Come,
but Comming. Now there could be no baptism into any other
Faith, than that was taught: Thus briefly of that second
Question.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VIII. Whether our Sacramental Baptism be the same
with that before Christs death?</head>
                  <p>NOW the third, may be betwixt that Sacramental Baptism,
which we have, and that which they administred before
our Saviours death, whether they are the same? For my part I
am against it, and not I alone, but many more, both Ancient
and later Writers. First, because that preaching the Word,
was only out of Office to be done to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Circumcision still, the legality of the Ceremonial Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not yet abolished, untill our Saviour put a period to it with
his <hi>Consummatum est:</hi> It is finished, at his Death; for although
there might be an use of both together, yet both could not be
used Sacramentally; and although Baptism might have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61847:12"/>
and have Laws made and Directions for it before, as
must needs almost be in the Making of any Laws, yet these
Laws had not their legal force till the execution was ordained,
which could not be untill the Abolishing of the old, which was
not (as I say) untill our Saviours Death; So <hi>Heb. 9. 16. For
where a Testament is, there must be the Death of the Testator; for
a Testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no
force, while men are living.</hi> Now although Christ might
make these Covenants, and this Will and Testament, in his Life,
yet it is of no force, untill after his Death. Again, the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and mystery of Baptism, which it imparts to every bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Man, is not, nor could be before his Death; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rom. 6. 3. Know you not, that as many of us as were
baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his Death: (bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sus Christ)</hi> that is, by Baptism Incorporated into
his mystical body, or as he speaks, planted, verse 5. <hi>(were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into his Death)</hi> by the same phrase incorporated into his
Death, dead with him, and this enforceth the 4th. verse; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are buried with him by baptism into Death:</hi> If we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into him by Baptism, if incorporate into his Death
by Baptism, then we must be buried with him, and then we
must be raised with him: Now this mystery could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
untill our Saviours Death and Resurrection; For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I doubt not that the Death of Christ was powerfull to the
saving of believers, which believed in his Death to: come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came; yet it was a diverse way of Faith which looked
upon Christ to Come, and Christ already Come. And again, as
the Faith was diverse, so the Means to get this Faith and the
Covenants, by which Christ was impar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, were diverse. Now
this Baptism looks upon Christ dead; it could not therefore in
this Notion be applyed to them before his Death, and after his
Death too, And to Confirm this, we may observe, that the very
Apostles themselves were slow in the belief of this Fundamental
Truth, the Death and Resurrection of Christ, untill after it was
done, as you may observe <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. where our Savour
chides their slownesse of belief in these Articles: Now if they
had not a Strong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith in these Articles themselves, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to believe that they preached them to others, and then
not baptized others into it. These reasons are not observed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61847:13"/>
by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Gamacheus,</hi> or <hi>Estius,</hi> or any others I meet
with who handle this; <hi>Gamacheus,</hi> in general, affirmeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this last Argument, that Christs Death was powerfull
to the salvation of Souls even before it was, which I grant (but
not by that means which takes his Death, for a Pattern or a
Stock, in which it must be grafted; for the Graft supposeth the
Stock and the thing drawn the pattern) to such means as are
Types or Figures of Christ to Come, not Impressions or Signs of
Christ already Come.</p>
                  <p>Again, he answers, that it were enough without his Death, if
he institute such a power; but it must be proved then, that he
did institute such a power: for it is most certain, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Covenant God makes, that he will perform; and since God
hath pleased to make such Expressions of this Baptism as have
their foundation upon his Death, it is not probable, nor can we
be easily induced to think that he should do it without his
Death.</p>
                  <p>Another Answer he hath, which bears some shew of prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the first Argument: that although Baptism was not
Compleat <hi>omni ex parte,</hi> in all Circumstances, in respect of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Effect, which is to open the Gate of Heaven, untill the
resurrection of Christ, yet it was essentially perfect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Original Grace, which is its nearest and formal
Effect.</p>
                  <p>I reply: Neither could it do this; For since Circumcision
was yet on foot, which had that Effect proper to it, these
two had not both the same Operation at the same time; and
again, since the Introduction of Original or any Grace must be
by the Death and Merit of Christ, men must receive this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by that, and that communicated by Baptism; for although
these mercies were given by other Covenants before his Death,
which related to his Death to come, yet not by those which
referred to his Death passed, as this Complanting by Baptism
did, <hi>Gamach. in 3. qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>SECT. IX. Another Objection answered.</head>
                  <p>BUT what I find not Objected by them troubled me more
than their Arguments, untill I studyed the reason of it,
which was, What meant all our Saviours Covenants and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
concerning Baptism before his Death, which are understood
by all Consent to be applicable to our Baptism which we use, if
then this Sacrament was not ordained to be exhibited? And to
this we shall find this Answer (I think) most reasonable: That
our Saviour did settle Laws, and Rules and Covenants for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
in his life, which had not their Life and Operation till his
Death, when he setled the frame and manner of it. So you may
find the Doctrine, and Law and Covenant concerning eating
his body and blood delivered in the 6th. of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, ver.
26, 48, &amp;c. which yet had not its truth and force untill the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Communion, and Commission to Celebrate: So
likewise for the power of the Keyes, <hi>Matth. 18. 27. Tell the
Church,</hi> which could not be in force till Churches were setled,
and so must needs these places be understood. I will examine
one, <hi>John 3. 5. Except a man be born of Water and the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> this cannot be understood
at that Instant according to that Generality, a man; any man in
general, which must be taken inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>initely, as the Context
doth mightily evince, because in the 3d. verse preceding it is
said, <hi>except a man be born again,</hi> which hath an indefinite truth:
so likewise in the following 6th. verse, <hi>That which is born of
Flesh is Flesh, that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit;</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
all that are in the World. <hi>Flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God;</hi> therefore that which is not born again, and
so not of Water and the Spirit: Now this cannot have this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at this time; for, as I said before, Circumcision was not
yet abolished: for it was impossible that this Law could at this
time be divulged and communicated to men, and therefore it
was impossible, that a Law made in a Corner without publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it could exact an obedience, and therefore it could not be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61847:14"/>
but like other Laws, it was then made, Christ taught <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
the Doctrine which afterwards should have its force and
vigor, when the time came, that it should be divulged and
taught. Well then, out of this that hath been said, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that although there might be an Institution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Baptism, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch we now use by the Mercy of God for
our Admittance into the Church, for our Incorporation into his
body, although this might be instituted, and many Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it made in his life, yet those Lawes were not of force
till after his death, and the promulgation of them then. We
will in the next place Consider the Communion, and examine
what Minister was appointed for that in the Gospel, for we find
none for Baptism yet in Christs life.</p>

his Death, in those famous places of three of the
Evangelists, (for only three mention it) <hi>Mat. 26. 26. Mark 14.
22. Luke</hi> 22. 19. to speak of which, is only pertinent to the
thing in hand. The two first Evangelists affirm, that only his
Disciples were with him; see <hi>Mat. 26. 19. The disciples came
and said to him;</hi> so <hi>Mark</hi> the 14. 16. <hi>The disciples went forth,</hi>
but St. <hi>Luke</hi> comes more close, and in the 14th. verse of the 22.
Chapt. saith, <hi>And when the hour was come,</hi> (that was to eat the
Passeover) <hi>he sat down with the Twelve Apostles:</hi> So then, here
we have them who were with him, not intimated only by their
general name of <hi>Disciples,</hi> which they had in common with the
Seventy, but the name of their particular <hi>Office,</hi> which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
only to them: St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth particularize in the Case
of these men sent into the Town, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> vers. 17. where
before, leaves it at large<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he sent Disciples, but how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or who, is not discovered by him, St. <hi>Mark</hi> Chap. 14. v.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61847:14"/>
13. punctually sets down the Number, he sent two of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
But St. <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 8. tells who they were, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
I put down this, to shew the punctuality of that Evangelist in his
Description, who writing after the other, seems more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
to set down some things than the other did; especially in
this Story. Well, we see who they were that were with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
at the Celebration of his last Passeover, and the last indeed
that ever was, or could be exacted of the <hi>Jews:</hi> That at the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of it, and so likewise at the Institution of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
his Twelve Apostles were those that were with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now
they being at Supper, in the places before alledged, you may
observe, <hi>that he took bread, &amp;c.</hi> But in the 10th. of the 22. of
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> at the later end of the verse, he said, <hi>this do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> do this thing, this thing ye see
me do: It cannot relate to their own Actions, which were only
eating and drinking, which could in no resemblance Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
the Death of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Consecrate the Bread and Wine
with a Benediction with this Expression, <hi>this is my body, this is
my blood,</hi> and so in my place distribute this in Commemoration
of me; for although in St. <hi>Luke</hi> this very phrase, <hi>do this,</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applyed to the Bread, yet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> according to what he had
received from the Lord, 1 Cor. 11. 25. saith, that he used the
same to the Cup likewise, <hi>this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me;</hi> and indeed, St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth most punctually
imply the same, although not expresly enforce it, in verse 20.
<hi>likewise also the Cup after Supper, saying.</hi> This <hi>likewise</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth, to the Conclusion of the 19. verse,
<hi>Do this likewise in remembrance of me;</hi> he said the same likewise
ter the same manner concerning the Cup. Well, you see both
of these how they are to be celebrated according to Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
now there is a Question raised, which I do not find
from Christs time downward, untile now, Who is the Minister of
this Sacrament?</p>

(as I hear, though I read it not) a Question, Whether
there be any proper Minister, or no, of the Communion? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
therefore with me this Text: There were none with our
Saviour but the Twelve Apostles, it is said to these, <hi>Do this;</hi> from
that Time downward, it hath been held, that none but Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
men, Successors of them, should do it: It is a Thing of the
greatest and highest Concernment to a mans Soul that ever was,
Heaven or Hell is at Stake upon it, if we misse. Consider, it is a
kind of lifting up a Creature beyond its Nature, Bread and Wine
to the body and blood of Christ, it is no matter which way,
one way or other; it is a Command given to a selected Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men: These are described by that Office, not by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Notion, to be the men are spoken to; who then can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but so great a power, with so great a blessing, should be
Committed to such men? Well then, I think it clear, here was a
Covenant instituted, what it was, is in other places and Laws of
our Saviour described; and belongs not to my businesse; this
only appertains to my businesse, That the Apostles were Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and they only the Ministers of it; only this little I will adde,
lest some mens observation may stagger at it.</p>

                  <p>THat though our Baptism may, perchance, appear to take
its force from some Command of Christs, after his Death,
yet this of the Lords Supper was now instituted before, and yet
doth relate to his Death; First, because Circumcision was not

in its Institution: I have done with this: I only Consider, that
as in humane Affairs, he that should take upon him the Kings
person, to act as he, without he make him Chancellor, or Judge,
enters into an high presumption; so, and much greater must
his pride be, that dares to act Christ in the Sacrament, to call
for a Sacramental Virtue to the Elements without his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which seems to be granted only to this Sort of men, and to
none other, thus I think you see the full Commission of the
Apostles, until now restrained to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
as yet Preachers of the Kingdom of God to come; At this
Institution of the Communion the Celebraters of that; That
they and the other Disciples did baptize, before is evident;
That they did not do it without a Commission, in honour to
them and their piety, I am resolved it could not be; But what
that Baptism was, or when, or how farr they had a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and Hell had not been <hi>praemium &amp; poena;</hi> he took therefore
such a Course as might most ordinately bring men to his Service,
without Compulsion; and since he was to leave the World
himself, he took Order with his Servants to Act as if he were

by a Delegate power from him. Therefore in the 16th. of St.

that is, to the Eleven Apostles, for one of them, <hi>Judas;</hi> had

is thought by many to be a little more fully described by St.

he said, <hi>Peace be unto you, as my Father sent me, so send I you,</hi>

28. 18. All power is given me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was never given to any before: I send you therefore with
all power, as my Father sent me; So the power then of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
powers to others, which was never given before but to
my self; and therefore in that place of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the last verse too, <hi>I am with you to the end of the World,</hi>
with you teaching, baptizing, giving Orders to others, for that
is mightily enforced out of the word <hi>Sicut, as my Father sent
me;</hi> and, indeed, else he could not be with them in their persons
to the end of the World, but in their Succession, by which
means he might well be said to be with them to the Worlds
end. Having now touched upon these places, I will Collect this,
here was in the 28 of <hi>Matthew,</hi> vers. 19. Baptism Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Matter, and Form; <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which we read not prescribed before:
we see the Officers appointed, these Eleven in their personal
bodies, or succession; wee see their Diocesse enlarged, <hi>preach
to all Nations,</hi> and as preaching, so baptizing as large, they go
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61847:16"/>
together; we see the Subjects of their Sermons enlarged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christs Death. When they had to do with the <hi>Jews</hi> only,
it was, <hi>the Kingdom of God is at hand:</hi> Now it is, <hi>to observe all
things that I have commanded you;</hi> So that then we see, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviours Death two sorts of Officers, Apostles, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
their Office at the first, limited to preaching, and that to
the <hi>Israelites;</hi> that they did baptize we are assured, but not in
what Form, nor by what Commission, untill after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Death; then we have seen the Holy Communion Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
just before his Death in Matter and Form, and Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
appointed to Celebrate it, to wit, the Apostles; we see
after his Death a full and Absolute Commission granted to
these persons, to whom the Communion was committed, to
do all things, Baptise, preach, celebrate, forgive Sins, to
choose and send forth others; and for ought I can collect in
this Story, the whole Ministerial power invested in them; But
because something may be objected against this which hath
been delivered, which I take to be the foundation of what shall
follow, I will clear those objections which seem most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
to me, and so proceed to shew how the Apostles managed
this Stewardship committed to them.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Whether the power of preaching was given only
to the Apostles?</head>
                  <p>FIrst, It may be questioned, whether the power of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was given to the Apostles, and them only? To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this, we must look back and remember, that the Seventy
likewise were sent, but that was to the <hi>Israelites</hi> only, their
Commission extended no farther, before our Saviours Death;
and after his Death we find no Commission given, but to the
Apostles, and what Authority they, or any else could have to
preach the Gospel, it must be from them; let no man trouble
this or any other part of my discourse with that frivolous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
which is often intruded into these Controversies; We
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61847:17"/>
read not that these, or these men, that these Presbyters recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
new Commissions from the Apostles, and yet find them
preaching; for Answer, once for many other times in which it
may be needfull; it was impossible that the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Epistles</hi>
could keep a Register of all that were ordained by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
or Bishops in their Age; it is enough for us to know, that
all power for these things was given to the Apostles, and we
may reasonably think, that of these 70. which were chosen by
our Saviour, such as proved worthy, should be Commissioned
by the Apostles, and such as were unworthy, (as some were)
should be suspended <hi>ab Officio:</hi> but for these particular Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and how and when each man was, is not apparent, nor to
be expected. Well then, now it seems the Apostles had all the
power of preaching, none others being sent in this Embassy to
the World but themselves. But could none else preach? not
gifted men? Consider these men, never any so Extraordinarily
gifted as these were, yet see (as I observed) they preached not,
without an outward Calling, by Christ, nor then untill he sent
them. Again, it is observable, that by his outward Word, he
directed their Doctrine to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they should <hi>preach the
Kingdom of God was at hand;</hi> and to the Gentiles, <hi>Mat. 28.
20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you;</hi> So then, Christ had given them Command before
what they should preach. I do not find, no not in these, yet any
inspired Sermon, but upon Direction; and although these men
had (no doubt) the most immediate Call that ever any had, and
the most extraordinary Gifts, in the most extraordinary way,
yet for to enable them for their preaching, they had Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Christ, which doth the most resemble the most Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
life of Studious Scholars, which in Books Converse with
God, as possibly a thing can do: so that in that time, in the
time of our Saviours Life, and untill his Ascention, we can find
no place for inward Calling, without an outward, nor an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
execution, without means to enable them for this great
Ministry of preaching, but throughout a most Methodical
Course.</p>

for Baptism?</head>
                  <p>THE next thing to be looked upon, is, Whether these and
these onely had the power of baptizing? No doubt we
may say of this, that they had the Duty only, none other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to either, but they; and when I have named the Duty, I
think I may justly adde the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, The right and Authority will
go along, for it seems to be a branch, and a main one, of that
Great Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and, without doubt, a great piece
of the Power of the Keyes, <hi>John</hi> 20. Now then, they and they
only, that we read of, had from Christ this Commission; those
Questions come not to be handled, whether Bishops, Priests,
or Deacons have this power? there was yet no such distinction
of them, as I find, but whether the Apostles only or no, I do
not find any other; the Seventy had a Commission to baptize
among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as well as they, their Commission of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and baptizing, equal, but what that was I know not; but
here all the power is granted to the Apostles. In whom and
whom alone, I can discern all the Ministerial power belonging to
mens Souls; so that they, or men sent by them, have this power
or none; I know there is a great dispute, whether Laymen can
baptize? and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is mightily offended with
<hi>Calvin,</hi> for saying they cannot; but I do not find the least Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
out of Scripture to confute him, and certainly this place
of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. seems exceeding strong for his Cause, and they
themselves grant, that the ordinary Minister of Baptism is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos,</hi>
by which word they understand Bishop and Priest, that
in their Absence a Deacon may, and so go on to the little Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but in extremity a Layman: For my part, I grant for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the Apostles were the only men Ordained for it. I
conclude, that baptism is necessary, and that it is a great Mercy
of God to the Children of believing parents, that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it; that baptism is necessary, is evident out of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue

ours is like the State of those who were not Circumcised the
eighth day, when Circumcision was due, not of those before
the eighth day, when it was not due: Now upon this reason, the
Care of the Church layd a mighty Charge upon all preachers, to
be diligent, to preach all dangers which might surprise Children
before they come to do their Duty. Now although I place such

                     </gap>, that it was given
to St. <hi>Peter</hi> only; the other, that it was given to the whole
Church. I will examine both. First, for St. <hi>Peter;</hi> this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Us, hath been so
vastly handled in such large Volumes, as it would be a little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence

to offer at it in these few sheets, and to stop my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Course with tedious disputes, which have so often been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and Canvased by others; only I will point my singer at
that which I think may Occasion a Reader in Studying this
Controversie to fix himself upon what is pertinent, and to take
notice of such Things as may easily induce him to the Truth; for
though I am perswaded I could adde something, at least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
to some Arguments which are Discussed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
yet that would drive me from satisfying your doubt,
and make my few lines swell to a Volume. I only say thus
much, That in all those places, <hi>Mat. 18, 19. John</hi> 21. 15,
16, 17. which are the main pillars upon which St. <hi>Peters</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
is setled, no man living can shew me other power,
which a man can Conceive reasonably to be Conferred on him,
than on the whole body of the Apostles; In those two places,
28 <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. &amp;c. and 20. <hi>John</hi> 21. if we should understand him
a Rock in the 16. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which yet without Partiality
a man cannot do; But rather think that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Confession
was that Rock, upon which the Church was built, or that our
Saviour, who by his Confession was acknowledged the Son of
God, was that Rock, hath with some a great Consent of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
yet should we grant him there to be termed a Rock,
yet it must be no otherwise than <hi>derivativè,</hi> secondarily, Christ
is the Chief Corner Stone, the Spiritual Rock, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. and
then there was no more s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id to him, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds of
them all, <hi>Ephes. 2. 20. and are built upon the foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Stone</hi> to them all; the Apostles were secondary foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Rocks as well as he, were that place to be understood to
call him a Rock: Nor can there be any stronger foundation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of him, either in person, or Succession, than of the rest,
<hi>Mat. 28. I will be with you to the end of the World;</hi> that is, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
them in executing their Duty. For the second place,
<hi>Mat. 16. 19. I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven,</hi> it is but a
promise, and he performed it to him and the rest, <hi>John</hi> 20. 22.
For the Third, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> it is a poor Argument drawn
from a meer <hi>Simile</hi> of pastorizing; but let it be what it can,
there can be no more in it, but preach, baptize, give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61847:19"/>
in those two places insisted upon before; and therefore
I desist from further discourse of them; and supposing that the
Apostles had equal Authority to minister Divine Mysteries to
the whole World with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we will now come and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
whether any other men had any such Commission given

                     </gap>al Discipline; and by the Church they will
understand others besides the Apostles. To apprehend which,
conceive with me: First, that this was one of those things which
our Saviour delivered for a Rule, to govern the Church and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
men by; not at that present, but afterwards, when Church
Discipline was setled, for as yet there was no such Thing as any
Discipline setled, but like a Commonwealth in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Contrived and enacted, which
might take their rise and force afterwards, when established.
It is a poor Conceit (methinks) of <hi>Beza</hi> on this place, who
would have it understood of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogue, since he
himself Confesseth that the word <hi>Church</hi> is no where else used
for the Synagogue, nor indeed can it be, and why it should be
forced to that meaning here I see no reason; and therefore the
true understanding of it must be taken, from those setled Laws
which our Saviour made after his Death, of which I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed:
Now that this Law could not extend to any other
men, but these Apostles, who had all the powers given them, as
I have explained, will appear first; First, because it seems to be
a Juridical way of proceedings; and it is impossible that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
should have Juridical Discretion to make a man as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61847:20"/>

                     </gap>ine the limits of Christian men and Religion in
much too narrow bounds, to say it belong only to the learned,
or men enabled for such or so high a work. But there must be
Officers in a Church to hear and judge of such a Cause, which
Officers we understood by the Church, and although this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
ought to be done in publick in the face of the Church, or
the Court, where such Matters are discussed, yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
nor can have a face of reason with it, that every one of
the Church should be there present, or they who are present
should have the Nature of Judges, only such Men as are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
enabled to act in this power; then if Officers, these men

which are here in the 18th verse said <hi>to bind and loose;</hi> So that
then, I can see nothing that can hinder us from agreeing, that

<hi>Acts</hi> the 1. v. 8. where it is promised; so that they had

Preaching, of Giving Orders, of Governing; these will always

be necessary in the Church, and therefore must be insisted upon.
For this therefore; the first thing we find them Acting in this
kind, was to settle their own Society, and Compleat the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Twelve, and this you may find recorded in the 1. of the

for if <hi>Judas</hi> was a Bishop, by being an Apostle, (as he is
termed, vers. 20.) the rest likewise were, or Twelve Deacons or
Ministers, for that phrase is affirmed of <hi>Judas</hi> in regard of his

                  <p>BUT yet we must not leave them, but examine, Whether
there were any Addition made to these Apostles, and what
that was? To understand this: We may find St. <hi>Paul</hi> in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of places called an Apostle; instead of many, take this one
Instance, Galat. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Paul an Apostle not of men, neither by man;
but by Jesus Christ;</hi> An Apostle, not of men, not by man, that
is, who received my Apostleship not from the Authority given
to men as before, when Christ sent his Apostles, as his Father
sent him with power to give these powers, John 20. <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sent me, so send I you;</hi> not then, <hi>of men;</hi> that is, from this
Authority given to them; <hi>nor by man,</hi> that is, by any Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

man, as you may find <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 18. But his Apostleship he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of God, and by God, as the other Apostles did, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Ordination of Christ; and in this I should place the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt these Apostles and others, That they are made
such by an Immediate Ordination of Christ; for it is not enough
that (some sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) to be an Apostle, was to be such a Minister as
conversed with Christ in his humanity, or saw him in the Flesh,
for this did all the Seventy, which yet were not called Apostles;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61847:21"/>
nor is it sufficient, which others say, they were such whose Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
extended to the whole world; for so we shall find in the
<hi>Acts</hi> almost none Confined to any place, but that others as well
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a Care of all Churches; But upon this a man may
justly enquire, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> should in such distinct Terms <hi>(not
of men, nor by man)</hi> describe himself, since it seems every Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
was such. To clear this, and give further Illustration to this
Truth, Observe, that others besides these were called Apostles,
so you may find first <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 14. 14.

they? in particular, vers. 6. he names <hi>Apollo, these things I
have in a figure transcribed to my self and to Apollo, that ye might
learn of us, not to think of men above that which is written.</hi> Now
then, although he may mean others beside himself and <hi>Apollo,</hi> yet
it is sit to conceive that he should be in the number of those are
called Apostles, because he is one of those from whom they
must learn, <hi>not to think of men above what is written;</hi> and among
other Arguments, this is a main one, That we the last Apostles,
<hi>Apollo</hi> and my self, and perhaps more, are unhappy wretched

people, <hi>to the World, to Angels, and men.</hi> I could
here likewise treat of <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 19, where <hi>James</hi> the brother of
the Lord is called an Apostle, who by many is thought, and
from good reason, to be none of the two <hi>James's</hi> which were of
the Twelve, but a third who was made Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> but
I desist: it is evident out of Scripture, that the holy Writ men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
more Apostles besides the Twelve and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and if
besides the Scripture, any mans Language may be heard, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was Contemporary (as he speaks)
with the Apostles, <hi>Paul, John</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> in his Epistle to the

                  <p>NOW then, to draw this Discourse to some period, there
were other Apostles besides the first Twelve, and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> the Thirteenth but why so? because, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> speaks,
upon <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25. in the case of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> before handled,
that he was called <hi>their Apostle, to whom the Care of them was
Committed.</hi> And again, upon the 1 Tim. 3. 1. <hi>Heretofore they
called Presbyters Bishops, and those which we call Bishops, they
called Apostles; but,</hi> saith he, <hi>in processe of time they left the name
of Apostles to them who were truly Apostles, and they gave the
name of Bishops to those which were formerly called Apostles:</hi> So
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61847:22"/>
likewise St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> on Gal. 1. 9. <hi>Procedente Tempore &amp; alii

1. 1. saith, <hi>he was an Apostle not of men, nor by man, but by
Jesus Christ;</hi> to distinguish him from those others, who were
Apostles by Constitution of Apostles, not immediately by God:
and to the same purpose may that be understood of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
2 Cor. 11. 5. <hi>I suppose I was not a whit behind, or lesse, or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the Chiefest Apostles.</hi> Amongst the Apostles the Twelve,
there were not some Chief, and some Inferiour; but the
Twelve were the Chief, and the rest Inferiour. Now he having
his calling and enabling from Christ immediately, was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to them. And though I read, I know not where, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Theodoret</hi> slighted, yet I do not remember what Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

                  <p>AND now (me-thinks) I see the Apostles in the Church,
as Divines say, <hi>Adam</hi> (if he had lived innocent) and his

of the whole World, and all the World would have been
every mans; yet being in their Integrity, would have so enjoy'd
all, that it should have been to the good of all, and hurt of
none: So these holy men were Bishops, Apostles of all the
World, all the Churches throughout the World, had absolute,
not order only, as the School speaks, to give holy Sacraments to
any any where, but Jurisdiction to Govern and rule all. That
which <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, hath some truth, That they divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into several parts of the World, but not appropriating to
themselves any piece, nor excluding any other from that Share
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61847:22"/>
or portion which they superintended, but rebounding back of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
where they had been before; and diverting as Occasions
offered themselves into other Precincts: this they did, and might
do, by that vast Authority was given them; <hi>Go preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
and by that power Equalling their Authority which was
Conferred at the <hi>Pentecost;</hi> but it was not with other men,
that universal Authority would not besit the meaner powers of
those who were to succeed and to follow them; and therefore
we will, in the next place, Consider in what proportions they
Communicated these Authorities to others.</p>

                  <p>THE virtue of which Communication we enjoy at this day,
some for place, some for Authority, some in part, some
in the Lump. For the first, we shall for place Consider, that
their Successors were confined in place, <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet, Timothy</hi>
in <hi>Ephesus, Epaphroditus</hi> in <hi>Philippi;</hi> not that they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
or pegg'd here immovably, (So is no Bishop in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
no not <hi>quoad Officium,</hi> as if his holy Duties which he
performed out of his Diocesse were invalid, or of no force; for
without doubt, if a Bishop baptize, preach, celebrate the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
give Holy Orders, <hi>secundùm materiam &amp; formam,</hi>
Canonically, according to Matter and Form, out of his Diocesse,
they are firm and good to the receivers, although perhaps
without leave, or extreme necessity, they are not Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Nay, without doubt, if either Bishop or Presbyter remove
to other Diocesse or Parish he takes not a new Ordination, but
an acceptation or just Election to that place sufficeth.) Now
his Confining to that place, is to restrain the Ministring of his
Office out of Duty there; so that he is out of Duty to have a
Care of that place, and to look to that flock which is Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Charge, which is part, not the whole as it was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Apostles; and no doubt (that which Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
hath learnedly discoursed upon this subject) in Ancient Times
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61847:23"/>
Bishops were the Pastors of their Diocesse solely, Presbyters
their Assistants and Associates, as the Apostles with that almost
immense power were made Bishops of the World, yet being men
with Confined bodyes, were forced to use Deputyes, and the
help of other men in their Charge even whilst they lived; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Church was better Governed by that Subordination,
than if every one who hath not Apostolical Integrity should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
Apostolical Authority; so it was by these, they had great
Diocesses committed by the Apostles, and (as I shall shew anon)
they had many Inferiors Assisting them; but these were their
places over which they were made Overseers, and they had not
Authority of Jurisdiction over others; Thus I could set down
how almost all the World was divided in the Apostolical Age;
but I let this alone.</p>

Deacons.</head>
                  <p>NExt we will Consider, how the very Office of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship
was divided: And the first thing that comes into
our Consideration (to begin at the foot, and climb upward) will
be the Office of Deacon; in handling which I find some matter
of Dispute: First, about the Institution of him, when this Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was first erected: There is a general Claim to <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the
Story may thus be observed; In the Infancy of the Church, when
it pleased God by the preaching of the Word to encrease the
Church beyond the expectation of men, or lesse power than
Apostolical, there were many poor among the Disciples; but
the piety of the Christians was such, as you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 5.
in ver. 34. of the 4th. Chapter, there was no lack, <hi>for as many
as were possessors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the
price and cast it at the Apostles feet,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> is presently
particularly instanced in; but in the 5th. Chapter we read the
fearfull Story of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi> who would seem righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61847:23"/>
to do as the fashion of Godly men was; but being hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
were punished for their hypocrisies. Now these Sales
bringing in great sums for the relief of the poor, the Apostles,
as it seems, were troubled with it, and the Care to relieve the
poor took them off from attendance upon that mighty work of
planting the Gospel; this was the rather awakened, by a <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
of the Grecians against the Hebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ws;</hi> that is, either such
<hi>Grecians</hi> as were made Proselytes, or else such <hi>Hebrews</hi> as lived,
and perhaps were born amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (for as yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had no Communication with the Gentiles,) now these <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Jews</hi> murmured, because it seems the Apostles (as I can
guess) had left the administration of this Charity to some who
had dealt partially; for I am confident they themselves would
not; wherefore they Convented the Disciples together, and
bid them with all Care (who must needs know the Integrity of
mens conversations better than the Apostles, who could not
search hearts) select some men fit for such a purpose, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Number of Seven; the Disciples did accordingly,
and they <hi>chose Stephen, and Philip, &amp;c.</hi> as you may read in the
5. vers. of the 6. Chap. <hi>and set them before the Apostles; when
the Apostles had prayed, they laid their hands upon them,</hi> no doubt,
rectifying their Choice, and Authorizing them to the work:
Thus we see these men receiving Title to execute this Office.</p>

Instituted, Acts 6.</head>
                  <p>BUT for my part <hi>(salvo semper meliori judicio)</hi> I cannot
conceive how this should prove that Ministerial Office of a
Deacon, which was afterwards used in the Church, from this
place, for these reasons; First, because this was an Occasional
Office, necessary for that Time, in which there being many
poor, which lived under the correction, and rod, and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the politick Magistrate, no legal Course could be taken
for the relief of them, but such as came by Charity out of the
bowels of their own Fraternity, to wit from Christians, who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61847:24"/>
might be perswaded, not compelled to that Duty; and by reason
of this, there was a necessity to have some Officers chosen Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
of the Poor, which by a Religious Tie, where could be no
legal, should be bound to the Execution of this Duty, for which
they instituted this Office; but why these should be called Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
that Ministerial Office used in the Church, I see neither Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
nor Ground in the Scripture for it. That they should
not be annual Officers, as our Overseers of the poor, I can see
no reason; or why in a setled Commonwealth, where the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Lawes provide for the poor, and Law makes such Charity a
Duty to the Commonwealth, there is no Ground. It is true,
in the Times of persecution these things are necessary, as there
is often mention both in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles and the Ecclesiastical
Story; and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate himself, in an Epistle to <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
the Heathen <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or Chief Priest of <hi>Galatia, The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Galileans,</hi> saith he, (under which name he vented his malice
against the Christians) <hi>relieve not their own poor only, but ours,
with a Counterfeit holinesse;</hi> There he acknowledgeth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
abundant Charity in those dayes, when he made all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
poor; and because he would not be out-acted in a Work
of so much piety, he gave that Priest the Collection of vast sums
towards the relief of necessitous people. This was necessary in
Time of persecution; but what further use is there of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches, than those Collectors for the poor which we
have, and Charity and Sweetnesse preached to men, whereby
they may be spurred on to enlarge their hearts, beyond the
Exactions of Statute-Duties, to the overflowing of Charity. Now
then, because it was an Occasional Office necessary then and
there, at such times in such places; we cannot conceive why
it should enforce such an Office perpetual in the Church, and
universally in all places or Churches.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, Consider the businesse they were designed to, we
shall not find that ascending to these Ministerial Duties, it
being only to relieve the body, not the Soul, to take Care of the
Tables, to look that the <hi>Grecian</hi> widows, and poor be not despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
in Consideration of the Native <hi>Jews;</hi> I know it is objected
by <hi>Catherive,</hi> that these Tables there spoken of, was the Lords
Table, and the Ministration they were imployed about, was the
Communion; but these phrases of Daily Ministration, and the
murmure of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> do inforce the other: for if they had
a daily Communion, it is not to be imagined the Apostles would
be standers by at so heavenly a Duty; and if they were actors,
it cannot be thought that any should be neglected in it: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with a mighty Consent of Writers, Conclude, that it was
an Administration of Temporal Things; but the Administration
of such maketh not to that Ministry we speak of, which concerns
things so Spiritual as affect the Soul immediately with some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

and Temporal Things, and therefore could not belong to our

                  <p>A Third Reason may be drawn from the persons which
were elected into the Office, which were (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
reports in the end of his 20. Chapter of his first Book, <hi>Contra

he reckons many more of equal rank, if not an higher esteem

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61847:25"/>
not reason to think that they should be Ordained into an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Order of Clergy, and the lowest of all; for all hold that
they were Presbyters at the least, either by their first Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from our Saviour, when he sent them to preach, and baptize
the lost Sheep of the house of <hi>Israel;</hi> or else by a Confirmation
from the Apostles, after they were invested with the whole Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
power in themselves, by that Grand Charter, <hi>As my

to Presbytery. But lest any man should doubt, whether these
were Presbyters or no? let him Consider that extraordinary
work of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who went up and down (as you may read

of Apology in it, and I know some have drawn a little Body of

                  <p>
                     <hi>PHilip</hi> (saith he) was an Evangelist, and so appointed by
God, as afterwards appears, and by virtue of that, and
not of his Deaconship, he did baptize. Indeed he is called an
Evangelist, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 8. And lest we might think them two <hi>Philips,</hi>
the Text saith, he was one of the Seven; that is, one of those
Seven was chosen, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. to take Care of the Poor, (but by the
way consider, that neither then or elsewhere in Scripture are
these Seven called Deacons.) Well, first Consider, here was a
great space of time betwixt the 8. and the 21. Chapt. he might
be an Evangelist long after, and not one then; Degrees and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
came by steps, not the highest at first; but suppose he
were, and suppose he was one before he was made Treasurer or
Overseer of the Poor, and suppose I conceive an Evangelist did
preach the Gospel, might baptize; then I Conclude that such a
man was at the least a Presbyter, and that he was as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
in being made such a Deacon, by his Consent a Deacon
hath nothing to do with Spiritual things, but only the Treasure
of the Church: And therefore it is strange, that both he and
my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi> in their Speeches at
the beginning of this Parliament, affirmed, That because the
Apostles would not have Ecclesiastical men meddle with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things, they instituted a new Office out of their rank for the
performing even these Duties of Charity, which in nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Text; for it seems, at the first, the Church layd
all the burthen upon the Apostles, when they put it off, then they
chose Ecclesiastical men again, and such as were next them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Septuagint, or else Evangelists; certain we may be,
famous Churchmen, St. <hi>Stephen, Philip,</hi> and the rest, who have

reason that they should, and why should others do it? Yes,

theirs, is of greater power and force with God than twenty
others; they out of Duty must travell through the whole world,
they cannot attend the Care of the poor in a particular City, the
others, though being Evangelists, may upon particular Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and overview their Charge, the people; therefore, when they
could not have their particular eyes over that blessed work, took
those that were next them in that dubious time, to take Care
of the poor, and these men could not therefore be chosen to
an Inferiour Constant Office, such as they feign their Deacons
to be, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Fourth reason may be drawn from the Design which Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> takes for this Office, which is such as would make
any Nation tremble to think upon, an Erection of the greatest
Tyranny which ever was exercised in any Commonwealth; you
shall find it described in the 36, 37 pages where before; For
first, he is Treasurer; this may be without exception. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he must addresse himself to receive what is brought into the
Treasury, but mark, not what is, but what ought to be brought
into the Treasury, to be committed to his Trust; for this (briefly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61847:26"/>
I will set down his sense) purpose he must inform himself, by
advice and counsel from the body, what every mans Free-will
Offerings should be; this upshot results out of his Discourses,
that only Free-will Offerings should be accepted; yet because
the maintenance of Church and poor must not be arbitrary, they
must understand mens Estates as well as they can, if they be
negligent, admonish them, then if they stirr not, go to Christs
Discipline, <hi>tell the Church:</hi> and so upon contempt of that, to
Eccleliastical Censure. To this purpose he cites two places, <hi>Deut.</hi>

transcribed the words without further trouble there could
have no more appeared, but that men should bring their Free-will
Offerings, and then do this or this, but the Sin lay upon him
who was to bring it in, he was not to be compelled to it, nor do
they, perhaps they will say; but I will reply, Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

the greatest Compulsion in the World, and as they order it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a new Opinion into the world, know, that this was the

St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (it is in his 14 Homily upon the <hi>Acts,</hi> about the

Corruption I answer, it is very clear, and no man will corrupt
a Father without a design, which cannot appear in this what it
should be; but rather than yield, he will charge the rest of his
Doctrine, because, saith he, he affirms, <hi>non fuisse Episcopos

any learned men any Consent; the greatest is upon that place

there is no word in Scripture which seems to countenance it, and
I will passe from this Question to the other; What his Office
was to do?</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. What is the Office of a Deacon.</head>
                  <p>THE Office what it was, receives the greatest Illustration
from his Name, which signifies a Minister, a Servant to
the Ecclesiastical Officers, Bishops or Presbyters; so that as
when a man is known to be a Minister or Servant to another, he
is by that made apparent to do such things as Conduce to the
assistance of him who is his Superiour or Prelate in his Office,
so do these in respect of their Superiours, Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I do not find one word in Scripture setting down what
their Office was, we can therefore have no knowledge of it,
but from the History of the Church, from which we receive,
that their Office was to Baptize, to assist at the Communion
with delivering the Cup, and sometimes the Body; but not to
Consecrate: so likewise to assist in the Divine Service; some
other things we find various, according to the Customs of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but all these are subordinate and ministerial Offices; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they had power to preach upon particular occasions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
licenses given, to wit, by that Order they had a qualification
to receive a License; these things I can particularly give an
Account to be the sense of the Ancient Church, if any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, but am loath also to lose Time about it; only I will
now undertake Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>

page 33. in his third Acception of his Deacon, defines
him thus.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, when it (that is, this word Deacon) is taken shortly,
and as it concerns our purpos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in hand, it sets out such Officers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61847:28"/>
who are designed by the Church, to dispose the State and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
to those several purposes for which God hath appointed
them, as the occasions and necessities of the body, and any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof may require.</p>
                  <p>This is his definition, or rather description at large of a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
which I conceive to be very short, because it toucheth but
the poor; concerning whose Care I acknowledge, that in the
primitive Time there were certain persons employed, because
those times were times of persecution, and the poor of the
Church could not exist without some such Collections by
Church Officers to take care of them; but that this was the sole
Office of a Deacon I deny. He proves it thus; <hi>Romans 12. 8.
He that distributes, &amp;c.</hi> Here (saith he) the Apostle reckons
these as a distinct kind from those that went before. In our
Translation it is, <hi>he that giveth;</hi> or in the Margent, <hi>imparteth,</hi>
and that most naturally; but to make it an Office, he changeth
the phrase: Well, from hence, in this place, he thus argues.
Here, saith he, the Apostle reckons these as distinct Offices.
This Term <hi>(these)</hi> might well relate to Prophesy, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
in the 7th. verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as the rest, which is the most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
way with the Ancient Fathers discourse upon that Text;
but he explayned himself before in the first Chapter of this 2d.
Part, pag. 8, 9. That Prophesy is a <hi>Genus</hi> to Teaching and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
and these two distinct Offices under that one head,
of which I shall discourse hereafter, (God willing); but giving,
or, as he calls it, distributing, ruling, shewing mercy, are three

                     </gap>, or Ministry:
so then this word <hi>(these)</hi> must be by him applyed only to these
five at the last named; which exposition he had, as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
from <hi>Beza,</hi> and before him, as I find, none. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself, upon that place, seems to make all these distinct
Gifts; but I passe by this, and will examine his Ground upon
which he builds. [It being (saith he) the Apostles aime by a
Similitude drawn from the body, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to discover several parts,
by the Actions which were in a peculiar manner appropriate to
them; as there are many Members in the body, and all have not
one Office or Action, so in the Church there be many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
but their several Offices appropriate to them. Whereas,
were this a Christian Duty common to all, he should overthrow
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61847:28"/>
his own purpose; for he should have shewed things agreeing to
all alike, when he should have shewed that some things are
peculiar. Thus I have set down his words, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as by him urged.</p>

                  <p>HEre he puts me to a great deal of Trouble to enlarge my
self in expounding this place, which I intend to do, and
shew what I conceive of it, and then refute his imagination,
and shew how inconsistent it is with the sense of these words.
He begins his Exposition from the 4th verse of the 12. Chap.
to the <hi>Romans;</hi> but he that will expound it aright must go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because that verse begins with a <hi>For,</hi> and that relates to
the 3d. verse, and that likewise begins with another <hi>For,</hi> which
must look upon what went before. Let us therefore first exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the first verse; <hi>I besceeh you, &amp;c. present your bodies, &amp;c.
which is your reasonable service;</hi> vers. 2. <hi>Be not conformed, &amp;c.
but be transformed, &amp;c. that you may prove what is that good, that
acceptable and perfect will of God:</hi> The presenting the body a
sacrifice, the not conforming to the world, the transforming by
renewing the mind, all tend to this, that we <hi>may prove what is
that good and acceptable, &amp;c.</hi> that is, have some Arguments by
which you may know it; he that doth thus mortify, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
presents his body thus, that doth transform and conform his
mind, shall find Arguments to prove what is Gods will for him
to do; vers. 3d. <hi>For I say unto you, &amp;c.</hi> you ought to know
this, because ye ought to perform this will of God; therefore
do these things which may make you prove it. Now this good
and acceptable will of God, is, that <hi>you do not think too highly,</hi>
(or higher,) for this phrase <hi>(of himself)</hi> is a Glosse of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators,
not the Text; and indeed this same too high thinking,
whether it concerns a mans self, or his work he hath to do, is that
which disturbs a man in his duty, whatsoever he is, or it is;
as if he think himself too good to be an hearer only, it makes
him thrust himself into the Preachers office; or when he hath
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61847:29"/>
that Office, he thinks too highly of himself, that he is too
good for it; or when he thinks too highly of that Duty which
he doth, it makes him, with the Pharisee, despise his brother, who
is not excellent or eminent in that way; so that this same high
thinking puts a man besides the way of Gods will; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he adds, <hi>but to think soberly,</hi> temperately, modestly; he
must not <hi>plus sapere,</hi> think more or higher than his Condition,
but he must think soberly, be lowly in his own eyes, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
into others businesse, or go beyond his own qualification,
<hi>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of Faith:</hi>
By <hi>Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

as he is intrusted by God, according to that measure of
trust which God hath layd upon him; there will not be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
I guesse, about that, and therefore I let it passe; verse 4.
<hi>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
not the same office; so we being many are one body in Christ, and
every one members one of another.</hi>

                  <p>HEre we see all Christians are one body, of which Christ is
the head; that as they have a duty towards the head, of
obedience, so they being fellow members, one towards another,
have that duty one towards another as fellow member, not to
think too highly, but to consider their mutual assistance each
ought to give to the other. Here now, if I would stop, let us
Consider, how it were possible to urge me farther: Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are not to be haled and pulled farther than the Letter, there
may be more in one part, than another; but an Argument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be drawn farther than the Comparison leads. It is true, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, in the 4th. verse, <hi>that all members have not the same
office;</hi> but can I force that to the parallel, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
not mention it? We may find the like in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that parable of our Saviour of the Sower of the Tares,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. where our Saviour expounds pieces of the parable;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61847:29"/>
we may according to those pieces, from thence draw Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Questions of Religion; but from the rest, which he
expounds not, the Arguments will be but probable; so here I
may say, Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Argument is weak, because members have
diverse offices in the natural body; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, we are a
body, and one anothers members, like the other so far, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out the rest, and diverse Offices distinct; might I not say,
that this doth not enforce it. But let us go on: I will not say so;
for although I think this Text doth not enforce it, yet I think it
true Doctrine, That there are diverse Offices in the body of the
Church, like diverse members in the body; <hi>Anselm, H. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus
Maurus,</hi> with others, have paralelled them in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on this Text. Let us now go on.</p>
                  <p>Although it be true Doctrine, that as in the body many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
have distinct offices and abilities to perform their dutyes,
which are not competible to other: so it is in the Church, there
are diverse Member<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

assisted with diverse Graces peculiar to them, and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
yet this Text goes, not to discourse of the distinction of
Officers, but of the Manage of them: It never parallels that,

                     <hi>HAving then, &amp;c.</hi> I will stand upon no Criticism here, to
talk of an Hebraism without necessity; methinks the Text
is full, <hi>having then diverse Gifts;</hi> mark, <hi>diverse Gifts:</hi> there
are many Organical members, which have besides their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Abilities and Gifts, as beauty, strength, and the like, which
are powerfull Assistants <hi>ad benè operandum,</hi> to do their Office
more dexterously and commendably; Now then, as we find
amongst us there are diverse Officers, and diverse Gifts amongst
these Officers, Abilities of utterance, of knowledge, and the like,
so may in these men here spoken of; but indeed, the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is a Gift of God, to do these things of God, and these
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61847:30"/>
Authorities or Gifts whatsoever are distinguished by the Grace
of God that is given us, not our own Merits, but his Favour and
Grace, both gives the Gift and the Difference; but since it is a
Gift of a Member, therefore it must be used to the good of the
Members, and not for our own private ends: and here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
doth not make that division of Gifts so contradistinct, that
they cannot come together; but saith, that whatsoever Gift any
man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath of doing good, as he must acknowledge it the Gift of
God, so he must use it to the good of his Neighbour, whether
Prophesy or Ministry: that this is the sense, appears out of that
clause in the Similitude not parallel'd. So we see it doth by
this Instance made by the Apostle, where is no opposition in the
persons, but only a difference in Gifts, which may well be in
the same Office, without any inconsistency or reluctancy. If
any man will see this Discourse more fully, let him read the same
Apostle 1 Cor. 12. 4. <hi>There are diversities of Gifts, but the same
Spirit;</hi> then go to verse 9, 10. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit
the word of wisdom, &amp;c.</hi> Let any man peruse them all, and see
whether they were Offices or Gifts, and the same word is used
for those Gifts there as here, which is <gap reason="foreign">

verse, to make these places meet, he deduceth the same <hi>Simile</hi>
out of these premisses of these Gifts, as in this Text he deduceth
the Condition or Scope of the Gifts from that <hi>Simile:</hi> so that
then I conclude some of these Gifts being the same, are used
there, the word the same that is used there, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to force those to Offices; therefore it should be a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to force these: let us come to the particulars, <hi>whether
Prophesy,</hi> &amp;c. Whether this be an Office, or no, is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
I am sure it is mentioned amongst those were no Offices,
1 Cor. 12. 10. But let us conceive what it is? It is possible that
it was the Gift of Prophesy to foretell the will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things to come, of which there were diverse in the first Age of
the Church; or else by Prophesy may be meant preaching,
which expounds the will of God revealed in Scripture: of both
which I may justly affirm that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 3. <hi>He that
prophesyeth speaketh unto men to Edification, and to Exhortation

                     <p>Prophesy, if you will, is a Gift sometimes as well as an Office,

<hi>Hooker</hi> gives this reason, <hi>because,</hi> saith he, <hi>if these</hi> (Prophesie he

what if there were seventeen? If there be so many, what is that
to the purpose? this he speaks, Chap. 1. of his second Book, p.

<hi>that we are one anothers members;</hi> that this man must not think

have looked for a Deacon, for the very word is put; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the word is not to his sense, he lets that slip, and takes his
sense without his word. And it is worth any mans marking, that
in his treating of the Office of a Deacon, which begins Chap.
1. page 32. he first sets down the Acceptation of the Word,
and page 33. he explains the word strictly as it concerns our
purpose, but shews not one place, where this word is used to
his Sense, and indeed he cannot; he had shewed Phrases in the
Scripture for the other, but not for this; but in this very place
the Word is used according to his sense, for the <hi>Genus</hi> of three
Officers, but another for his Office. Well, let us examine it:
this is the general Nature (saith he) to a sort of Ministring
Officers, which come after; he faith so, what proof? none but
his own Authority; and then ask him, where it hath that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained

the most speculative in the World, the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

they cannot be distinct Offices, but parts or Gifts in the same

to prove his Doctrine or Conclusion, and another in Rhetorick
to perswade the practise, and these diverse abilities and Gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon those men by the Grace of God: and therefore in
these, as in the other, have you the whole Gift of Prophecy,
use it as a Member, not thinking too high, but use it for the
good of your brother, who is your fellow Member: so likewise
the Spirit is given in measure, one excells in one piece, another
in another, do all like fellow Members; but no one word, that
these are distinct Offices, as that of the hand, or the eye, or the

                  <p>NOW we come to that, which he makes a Deacon: <hi>He
who giveth in Simplicity</hi> (he who <hi>distributeth</hi> he reads it,)
But why he and <hi>Beza</hi> should do so, since they pretend nothing
out of the Original to force it, (but their own Conceit only of
making this a <hi>Species</hi> of the Minister or Deacon before spoken of)
and all Antiquity, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers reading it
otherwise, and no one that I can find putting in one word to
this purpose, is a strange Conceit; I cannot Conceive why, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be a too much love of their own newly hatch'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But see what weight Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Opinion hath: By this
is meant a Deacon; what word shews it? he saith it is but a
<hi>Species</hi> of that Deacon before spoken of; and if that Deacon
which was before mentioned be the name, then the two other
<hi>Species</hi> must be Deacons as well as he, which he will deny, as you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61847:32"/>
shall see hereafter; then, that this is a distinct Office of a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
that is, was an Office spoken of, no man can prove, but a
pious duty, which God gives men gifts to do for others good,
and therefore no word of distinction here, but without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
a Prophet may do this, a Minister or Deacon, a Doctor or
Exhorter; yea, it will be a good Argument in Exhortation, to
do as I have done my self. I should go on with the next, but I
reserve that for another time, and the rather stayed so long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, because in part I shall stop two Gaps with one Bush;

                  </p>
                  <p>His sense is: That by this <hi>(that distributes,)</hi> is meant an
Office, designed by the Church to dispose the State and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61847:32"/>
of the Church, &amp;c. and so pag. 33. But pag. 9. he saith,
Those several (meaning these Offices expressed in this Text) are
set forth by way of opposition, and contradistinct one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore cannot be subordinate, and meet in one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
where they should be both formally acted. A strange kind
of discourse to deceive men with (as it seems to me) by great
words; for first, the parts in the Text he makes subordinate, to
wit, teaching and exhorting, to Prophesy; secondly, distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
ruling, having mercy, to Ministry: And again, these
things which are subordinate are in the same subject, as <hi>Animal</hi>
and <hi>Corpus</hi> are <hi>in Homine.</hi> But that they are not opposed, or
distinct, or any way inconsistent, will appear presently.</p>
                  <p>To prove my Minor then: First, whereas he saith this phrase
<hi>(he that distributes)</hi> doth signifie an Office, I can deny the
words, and say, they are not found in that place. Secondly, I
say, that those words there do not signifie an Office, no more
than those about them, but a Gift, as it is called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.
Where he saith it is that Office called Deacon, he himself
disproves it, since it is distinct and inconsistent with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or Deacon, which is both one. Thirdly, whereas he saith
it is an Office to dispose the State and Treasure of the Church, Is
there the least mention made of Church, or Treasure of it? not
a word: this word Gift would import otherwise.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IX. Another Argument.</head>
                  <p>NOW to this last, in page the 9th, I frame this Syllogism:
Those Gifts which have been, and are many times in the
same, are not so Contradistinct as they cannot subsist in the
same Subject.</p>
                  <p>But many of these Gifts in the Text have been, and often are
in the same Subject; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Major is clear from the Act: that which hath been, and is,
is possible, and crosseth not the nature of any thing.</p>
                  <p>My Minor may be proved in the Lump: First, I doubt not to
say, that the Apostles had all these; for they were Prophets,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61847:33"/>
they were Minsters, they were Doctors, Teachers, Exhorters,
did give to the poor, did rule, had bowels of mercy, with all
the requisites.</p>
                  <p>Take Prophesy for Preaching, many a man now hath all these
in the same Lump.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Teacher and Exhorter cannot be severed: This
Gentleman stiles himself, Pastor of the Church of <hi>Hertford</hi> upon
<hi>Connecticutt,</hi> in <hi>N. England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> Teacher of <hi>Boston</hi> in
<hi>N. England,</hi> both of them have written concerning these busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
If a Pastor be an inconsistent Office with a Teacher, why
doth Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> teach, and so Logically endeavour to prove his
Doctrine? and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> the Teacher, use Rhetorick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade?
These things seem to me inconsistent, a Teacher, and
not an Exhorter, or an Exhorter, and not a Teacher: so farre
they are from being inconsistent one with the other, that they
cannot exist well one without the other; and for this particular
phrase, <hi>Distributer,</hi> or <hi>Giver,</hi> neither one nor other be good
men, unlesse they be both; the Clergy must not be altogether
upon the receiving hand, there is time and place for them to
give, as well, yea rather than others, and take Care of the
poor, and have bowels of Compassion towards them, and by
their good Example exhort others to do as they do. I have
been something too tedious here; but this will save future
labour.</p>

how he should be qualified, but no one word what the duty of
that Office is, and therefore he draws no Argument from it, but

the full and carefull attendance upon this work, could not stand
with carefull, constant, and consciencious Attendance upon the
Ministry of the Word, as the Office of a Minister so employed
did require; This I deny: because I have proved they were
Ministers of the Word, and have before answered his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawn from the Apostles, <hi>It is not meet, &amp;c.</hi> vers. 3. and
do now adde; It is one thing to say, It is not meet; another to
say, It is inconsistent, it cannot stand with it. Again, many
things might be and were sit for Inferior Ministers, which were
not fit for the Apostles: <hi>It is not meet,</hi> was truly said by the
Apostles: But now I doubt, whether this Office was for this
occasion only, or for their lives. I 2dly. affirm, as before, that
these men were Ministers. And 3dly, I deny that this was of
that Deacon St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, and was after used in the Church.
His continued Discourse is but a repetition, only a passionate
expression or two, that we make a Deacon half a Priest, or a
Preparation to it, and he saith, that this was the first In-let into
the Usurpation of Bishops. I let these things passe, and come to
his Dispute against us.</p>

Argument is lame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which he urgeth out of <hi>Acts</hi> 6. is not

never so called in the Scripture: so I do deny them to be those

as they were men of extraordinary abilities, so they were men

Again, we deny that the Office of a Deacon exacts the duty of a

                     <p>THE Gifts of Deacons which are required by the Apostle,
are such as will not furnish a man to be a Minister; (he

as qualifie a Bishop, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> spake there; but I will
tell you, very like them; and as that Clause is not inserted to a
Deacon, that he should be apt to teach: so it is not required of
him; but when he is found fit to teach, and it is required, he may:

                  <p>THE next particle or Branch of Ecclesiastical Authority
which I will undertake to handle, is that they call a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elder, or a Lay Elder: he is called an Elder, but I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61847:35"/>
Now to understand this, I shall first shew, what manner of
Office this man is imagined to have, and then answer such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as are brought for him; and so Conclude, with mine own
reasons against him: First, the Examination of his Office, what
it is to do, is set down by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Part 2. Chap. 1. pag. 16.
I will not transcribe all he saith, but set down the heads.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II. What those Lay Elders are, according to
Hooker.</head>
                  <p>BEfore the Assembly meet, he is of the Common Council, and
his voyce is to be taken in with the rest in the Consultation
and Consideration of the businesse, (by which, I think, he means
the businesse should be agitated that day) Here he ciphers out
3. places of Scripture, I think to no such purpose; read them he
that will, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Acts</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>When Offences are to be brought to the Congregation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them to ripen and prepare the businesse, by way of prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration,
to state the Cause right, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the Church is met, he may interpose his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without asking leave.</p>
                  <p>These he hath in Common with other Elders: what he hath
peculiar to himself, is;</p>
                  <p>First, visiting the Sick, and such as are any way under Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wants, these men should send for these Elders, and they shall
be the Physitians of their Souls; for this he quotes <hi>James</hi> 5. 14.
but no word there, of a Lay Elder.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the same reason he should seek out such, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is to make peace amongst Members.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If there be a Fame of a Member, that he misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
himself towards such as are without, (that is, I think, not
of their Church) by which the Church may be scandalized, he
is to enquire of the Truth, and (I think) inform, or else all is in
vain.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He is to Consider of the persons that are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61847:35"/>
into the Church, and to pronounce Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in general, we see what manner of Office this is; let us
now examine, whether there be semblances of any such thing
in Scripture, which they pretend should be the Guide in these
Affairs. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>irst, I will begin where I left; for that, in the
first place, he cites <hi>Romans</hi> 12. 8. As he found a word for his
Deacon, <hi>He that distributes:</hi> so he hath another for his Elder,
<hi>He that ruleth, with diligence.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. III. Whether any such Elders truly in Scripture. </head>
                  <p>THis Question Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> enters upon in the same 1st. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the 2d. Part, pag. 8. Here he saith, he hath nothing
to doe but with the Hierarchical party, whose main Arguments
are, a Pursuivant, and a Prison, armed with Authority of an
High Commission. This man, (I observe) though civil in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places to others, yet very passionately bitter, when any
thing crosses him, to speak against that Cause which I conceive
right, and do not doubt but I shall prove it. First, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to prove this Office, that there is such an Office, from the
former place; but goes now somewhat higher, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7. He
argues for it first, thus; The Gifts here mentioned and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
are not such as have reference to a Civil, but to an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Condition; so the words, vers. 5. <hi>We are one body in
Christ.</hi> This is no strong Argument, we are one body in Christ,
therefore that which is spoken of that body or members, must be
Ecclesiastical, not Civil. In the same body, consisting of the
members of Christs Church, his mystical body, there are many
Civil Duties, even as they are Christians, exacted from them, and
as members of that body: Duties of Kings to Subjects, of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to Kings, Husbands to Wives, and theirs to their Husbands,
betwixt Masters and Servants, and so they mutually; a little of
this Divinity will make all things Ecclesiastical, and reduce all
Obedience for Christs sake to a Pastor or Teacher, an Elder
or Deacon. Secondly, the Operations which issue from these
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61847:36"/>
Functions evidence as much, <hi>Prophesying, &amp;c. Exhorting, &amp;c.</hi>
I would he had put in <hi>shewing mercy</hi> too, but we see they do
not; <hi>shewing mercy, giving, ruling,</hi> may relate to any member
of this body. There is nothing therefore in these Arguments
that enforce, these should be Ecclesiastical duties of members in
the mystical body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>He hath another Figure of 2, I think he means by it another
Argument for the Cause, that is, pag. 9.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>An Argument of his answered.</head>
                     <p>GIfts here, are not such as are Common, and belong to all
Christians, as Faith, Hope, Charity, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>What if they are not? are they Ecclesiastical Orders? that
will never follow; but he proves it, although to no purpose, if
it were proved.</p>
                     <p>First, those Gifts are here meant, by which the Members of
the body are distinct one from another, and have several Acts
appropriate to them. He proves that, because verse 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>&amp;c. all members have not the same office;</hi> this, I have said,
is not parallel'd in the <hi>Simile,</hi> and therefore not to be urged fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
But, saith he, Common Graces are not so distinct, for in
them they do agree. I answer, these are not Common, nor yet
Ecclesiastical only, nor the duties required, witnesse this one
which is instanced in, He that ruleth with Diligence: To be a
Ruler, is not only in Ecclesiastical Affairs, but Civil; and he that
ruleth in Civil affairs, is to do it with diligence; so <hi>Origen</hi> upon
this very place: so St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Theophylact, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm,
H. Rabanus Maurus,</hi> out of them; all of which use phrases
to this purpose, <hi>qui praest vel fratribus vel Ecclesiae.</hi> So that by
this, although there is not a Common Grace that is universal
to all Christians, yet it is so Common, as that it belongeth to all
Governors whether Lay or Ecclesiastical, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi>
but these late men; and the duty enjoyned, is as Common as the
Grace given, to wit, to govern or rule, not barely, but with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
So that this Conclusion is Confuted out of this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and may as easily out of any other, but Prophesy, and
teaching and exhorting, although, perhaps, something of this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61847:36"/>
sense may be affirmed of them. Again, he urgeth the Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. The weight (saith he) of
the phrase having the Article in that manner added, notes not
every member, but some by way of Eminency, to whom these
appertain; it is true, and so doth this Instance; He who ruleth,
notes not all men, but Rulers only; but doth it note by these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veats
a Lay-man, ruling in Ecclesiastical Affairs? or if it should,
why not a Chancellor? that were a fearfull Exposition.</p>
                     <p>His 3d. Argument, drawn from the Distinction mentioned
in the 4th. verse, is abundantly answered before, and his new
division of these Offices; I come therefore to his 2d. Argument,
to prove that there is such an Office.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Another Argument of his answered.</head>
                     <p>THis is drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. where the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
many other Offices or Gifts which God hath given to
his Church, he names <hi>Governments,</hi> or, as we read it, <hi>helps in
Governments;</hi> or as <hi>Beza</hi> and he, <hi>helps Governments:</hi> I shall
not trouble my self with that phrase much, here he layes this
Foundation, That the Apostle names here some ordinary, some
extraordinary Offices; amongst those ordinary ones which are
to last in his Church, he reckons (what he pleaseth, and how)
Teachers, Helps, which were Deacons, Governments which were
Elders; were all this granted, will all this prove them Lay Elders?
I can grant likewise his second Foundation that he requires,
That the Gifts themselves are put in the Abstract, yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who were possessors of them were understood in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete;
by these abstract Phrases I can grant his third Foundation
likewise; which is, That although some, as the Apostles, had all
these Gifts, yet they might formally be in some Subjects, as
appointed by Christ to that purpose. I deny not this; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they might be, will it follow affirmatively, therefore
they were; certainly <hi>à potentia ad Actum valet Argumentum
negativè,</hi> It cannot be, therefore it is not; but not affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It may be, therefore it is.</p>
                     <p>Now let us Consider his Arguments: As the Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Teachers were distinct, so are helps and Governments
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61847:37"/>
distinct; for the Apostle puts them in the same rank; I deny
that, for they are put in distinct ranks, first, second, third, and
then these Phrases put <hi>(after that) then, (then)</hi> and no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt. Gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments. I could
here shew the Expositions of St <hi>Chrysostom, Ambrose, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,
Anselm,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in no one of which do I find a Lay
Elder understood, by this phrase Governments. I could shew
you the Expositions of others, some making him an Arch-Deacon,
some a Parochian; but I study brevity where there is
no proof, and I will adde but one thing, which I find observed by
none, which is, That, as if the Apostle would prophetically in
his manner of writing, as well as the words he writes, Confute
this man, and this side of men, if they prove such an Office from
this place, they must prove, that this phrase <hi>Government</hi> signifies
a distinct Order, and that this phrase signifies that thing they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it for; this latter is against Antiquity, and hath no colour for
it The former, upon which the latter is grounded, he thinks he
hath proved, because that Apostles and Prophets, &amp;c. were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Offices or Gifts in distinct persons. I answer, it follows
not; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the two following verses, 29, 30. reckoning
up a distinction of the other Gifts, <hi>Are all Apostles, are all Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
&amp;c?</hi> doth never say, are all Helps, are all Governments?
but doth reckon that which comes after this, <hi>Do all speak with
tongues?</hi> So that methinks the Apostle doth, as it were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to make this not appear a distinct Office from the rest. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all the other are helps, and most of them Governments, and
therefore he could not use this phrase to them, are all helps, &amp;c.?
as he did to the other; but he stands not much upon this, these
are too weak Grounds to support this new Building: The <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
which is ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answered. </head>
                  <p>THE words of the Text, are, <hi>Let the Elders which rule well,
bt worthy of honour, especially they who labour in the Word
and Doctrine.</hi> First, we may observe, that from hence is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no Institution of such an Order. Secondly, that there is
not pretended any Demonstration, that there was any such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
executed with the Approbation of the Apostles; for that
although the Institution were not registred, yet it would Argue
there was such an Office, without which they could not execute
the Office; but the force of Argument is only drawn from this,
that the Apostle should here name two distinct Officers, one,
whose Office was to rule onely, and another, to labour in the
Word and Doctrine. I will first endeavour to expound the Text,
and then satisfie the Objections; In the Exposition I find
these pieces necessary to be opened; who are meant by this
word <hi>(Elders;)</hi> 2dly. what is meant by <hi>(ruling well;)</hi> 3dly.
what by <hi>(double honour;)</hi> 4ly. what by <hi>(labour in the Word and
Doctrine;)</hi> lastly, what by <hi>(especially.)</hi> First, this word Elder
is diversly used in these Epistles, and in this very Chapter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a man of ancient years, which is its genuine significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or else for an Officer in the Church, and of the Church; for
there may be Officers in the Church concerning politique Affairs,
which must have a Discipline, in the Church; of this Sort are all
Officers in a Christian Commonwealth, which are Officers in
the Church, but not of it; but an Elder is taken for an Officer
in and of the Church, having to meddle in Ecclesiastical Affairs;
and this latter is a borrowed sense of it, because that Gray hairs
are stayed and Judicious, which are Attributes belonging to the
Office of a Presbyter; therefore they have their denomination
from that. In the first sense it is taken in the 1. verse of this
Chapter, by the Consent of all, where it is said, <hi>rebuke not an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lder, but intreat him as a father;</hi> there the Elder in Age is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
as all agree, both antient and later Writers: this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61847:38"/>
word is again used in this Chapt. a little after this Text, verse
19. <hi>Against an Elder receive not an Accusation, but before two
or three Witnesses;</hi> How an Elder is understood here, is disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The <hi>Grecians,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact, Oecumenius,</hi>
understand an Elder in Age only, as <hi>Beza</hi> observes; but it is
not so universally true, as he affirms; for <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon that
place expounds it of a Presbyter by Office; and the <hi>Latines,</hi> St.
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> &amp;c. with one Consent suppose it an Office. Here is a
difference, and the Arguments of no moment that are brought
of one side or the other, nor much material; for the Doctrine
is true of the least Elder, there is <hi>Capitis reverentia Cani,</hi> some
Civility to be paid to Gray hairs; such men should not so easily
be accused, or if they be, Accusations not so easily entertained,
as those are made against others; but I have writ this, to shew
that this word Elder is not alwayes taken for an Officer, no not
in this Epistle, in this Chapter; yet here I doubt not but it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for an Ecclesiastical Officer, both because of the word
<hi>rule,</hi> as likewise <hi>labour in the word;</hi> but whether two Officers
or one, will be questioned.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, no man can shew any where in the New Testament
any usage of this word, but either for a meer Senior in
Age, or this one Presbyter, which is the Ecclesiastical Officer;
and besides this place, they themselves will Confess, that no strong
Argument can be produced, it were hard then, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, that this word here should enforce it. Again, this
word Elder is used but once, which hath influence upon both
these Actions of ruling and labouring, which were not proper
in Speech, if they were two Offices, without some Term of
Distinction; for it would be more rightly and significantly put,
an Elder that ruleth, and an Elder that laboureth; but this word
Elder being named but once, it should seem to enforce but one
Office, with diverse Actions; for there are but two sorts of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as I find: either that Lay Elder, which is an Elder by Age,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61847:38"/>
or an Ecclesiastical Elder, who is described how he should be
qualifyed, either in the 3d. Chapter of this Epistle, or the first
of <hi>Titus;</hi> but the first sort are not pretended to here, nor the
second as they pretend; some other word then must afford it,
not this word Elder.</p>

from the other, Presbyter, by their own Consent, this is
a part of that other teaching Elder, he is a Ruler too; and if a
Ruler, then no doubt, if a good teacher, he rules well; or else as
may happen out, he may be a good Teacher, and a weak Ruler,
and again, a good Ruler, and a weak Teacher: So that if Ruling
do not make a distinction in the Office, ruling well doth not; for
Offices are not distinguished by the diligence or qualities of their
Officers, the men that use them, but their Officers, the men
that use them, by their Offices; there are good and bad in every
Office, and so in the Ministry, but his goodnesse or badnesse in
Execution of his Office makes a Man a good or bad Officer,
but not of another kind of Office. By this phrase then, <hi>that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

is due to one, but rather there is a greater Obligation to the
other, not another due; or if there were another Debt, yet
that would not prove another kind of Office, but more obliging
Acts of that Officer. It is then, as if we should speak of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds;
that Shepherd deserves his wages who takes care of his
flock, even he that shall fold them at night carefully, and let
them out in the morning, and do many Shepherdly duties; but
when there are diverse Shepherds belonging to the same flock,
he shall best or chiefly deserve it, who having Cunning to do it,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61847:39"/>
shall industriously, and with great labour of his own, cure their
Diseases, and heal them, and both these may be Shepherds, and
deserve their wages, but especially the latter, and yet not distinct
Offices; and the first sort may grow up to the latters abilities,
and then as well deserve as he; or as we may say of a Privy
Counsellor, he hath a two-fold relation, to the Subject, and to
the King; he deserves his honor well, that rules well; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

This is the sense of the Text, there are two duties in these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to rule, to labour in the Word and Doctrine; they that
rule well, and do that piece well, are worthy of double honour,
but especially they that labour in the Word and Doctrine, their
flock ought to have a more particular Care of them; thus the
Text being explained, as appears to me clearly, the next thing
to do, will be to vindicate it from such Arguments which seem
to be deduced out of this Text, for that Imaginary Office which

it is Ruling Elders, and teaching Elders: but I deny that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61847:40"/>
absolutely, It is not a ruling Elder and a teaching Elder,
but such ruling Elders and such Teachers, which labour not in the
Word; There is a great difference in this sense, it is a falacy
<hi>à benè conjunctis ad male divisa:</hi> see it explained, every Elder is
a ruling Elder, but if he rule ill, he is not worthy of Double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
no, he deserves reproof; It was a mighty falacy put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Reader, to say the Comparison is made between ruling
Elders and preaching: when the words of the Text say,
it is such as rule well, and Teaching Elders are not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch, Extemporary Preachers have nothing to do with
it, but such as labour and take pains in the Word, as St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>
most excellently descants upon that place; and the very
letter introduceth it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from whence <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, here used,
signifieth as much as one that with great labour and pains effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what he doth; not the Sweat in the Pulpit but the Study, as
may be most apparent, is it, which makes him capable of this
Double honour. I wonder much at the Writer therefore, not
that he was deceived, for that is <hi>humanum,</hi> subject to humane
nature; but that he who seems so punctual in Logick, should
offer such a fallacy, the fraud whereof is so manifest; but he goes
on, and I.</p>
                  <p>It is (saith he) especially to be observed, that their Works are
not the Things compared, but the persons notified by the kind
of their Works; for the words are not, the Elders because they
rule well, and because they labour, but those Elders that are
ruling, those Elders that are labouring in the Word.</p>
                  <p>See again, what a mist he layes before the Readers eyes, in his
Exception, he puts the phrase aright in the first place, It is not
because they rule well, Rule well is the phrase of the Text; but
in his affirmative it is (those Elders that are ruling) there that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
Epithete (well) is left out. And then again in his second
Exception, That it is not because they labour; there (in the
word) is left out; but in his Affirmative it is put in, (but those
Elders that are labouring in the word.) This is meer Jugling;
but to his Sense. I grant that the persons are notified by their
Works, although not by such kind as he expresseth; The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I grant distinct, but the diverse persons, and the same Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the Office is not distinct.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds to this Sense, that their phrases are the Subject
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61847:40"/>
of the proposition only, and therefore the persons and Officers
being the Things compared, it is certain they must be distinct
persons. This is the very phrase, he names here only distinct
persons, which I grant, but deduceth this Concession out of
that Addition of Offices to persons, but I will grant they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Officers too, but not distinct Offices, which is the
Question.</p>
                  <p>He goes on: First, those Conceits vanish, that Elders are not
attended for their holinesse or private Conversation, I grant it,
but for their demeanour in the Church. Secondly, (saith he)
nor will the Conceit hold, which saith, there be not diverse El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but divers works of one Elder attended, when <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
are persons compared, not Acts. These phrases, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are
not in the Text, or if they were, it would but inforce diverse
men, or diverse Officers, not diverse Offices, which he must
prove, or he proves nothing to the purpose; but Consider how
fallaciously he deals; now he labours to prove thence diverse
persons, which is granted; then diverse Officers, which is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
under these notions hoping to beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ile the heedlesse Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
when he never comes close to prove diverse Offices, which
is his only Work.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards he comes to discourse of the Consequent, as he
calls it, (let him call it what he will) I will follow him: The
Consequent part (saith he) of this discreet Axiom, is, The first
Elder is worthy of this Double honour, the Second Elder is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Double honour, but with this difference, it is chiefly his
due, (the second he means) First, in the Order to be attended;
2dly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in measure, more of it is due and debt to him. Now
(saith he) it is well known, it is required that the two parts of
a discreet Axiom be not only discreet, but true in themselves:
I consent; let us see what he deduceth.</p>
                  <p>Whence (saith he) again that Conceit utterly van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sheth, which
makes the Comparison to be betwixt the two Acts of one man,
namely, the well ruling of a Pastor is worthy of Double honor,
be it alone in its self considered; which is an Assertion grosly
crosse to the rule of Divinity, as the former was to the rule
of Logick.</p>
                  <p>What the Logick of his deduction is, I have shewed, what the
Divinity, will appear anon; he seems to prove it against Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thus.</p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61847:41"/>
That Interpretation which makes the performance of the
least part of a Pastoral Calling, though it be with the neglect of
the greatest Work, worthy of Double honour; that is grosly
contrary to the mind of God, and the verdict of Scripture, &amp;c.
rather a double Wo is to be denounced against them, than a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>But this Interpretation doth this. <hi>Ergo,</hi>

Preaching, Administring Sacraments, Ruling, Guiding his Flock,
put the question which of these is most excellent, take them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>in sensu diviso,</hi> only in themselves, without Consideration
of times and persons, and whosoever shall affirm either of these
most excellent or usefull for the Church, shall be Confuted by
another, who will say that at such a time or to such persons the
other is most necessary, most honourable: without question to
Heathen people that have not heard of Christ, preaching is
most necessary, <hi>No man can come to God, unlesse he believe that
he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him diligently,</hi>
Heb. 11. 6. <hi>But faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. 14. So then,
to that State of men in that Condition preaching is most necessary
to generate Faith, and lay the Seeds of Religion; but when men
are Converted to a belief in the Principles of Religion, so that
they are ready to cry out with the Converted people in <hi>Acts 2.
37. Men and brethren, what shall we do?</hi> then is necessary and
usefull that which the Apostles did with them; Baptize them
after Conversion by preaching, Baptism is necessary, then the
holy Communion to confirm and strengthen them in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

he is Converted, and studious, himself may persevere in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and improve (no doubt of it) without hearing more
Sermons, but by Study and Contemplation, as in the Times
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61847:41"/>
of persecution multitudes do; and in those places where they are
persecuted, yet their Obedience to Church-discipline and the

may be necessary then and there, and more necessary than the
other, as likewise in the Case of dying men; not the Doctor and

(whose duty they make it to visit the sick, and not to authorize
to preach) are the welcome men; but he that can bring the Seals
of Gods Covenants by Absolution by the Communion, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
Consider again, Such a Church (as many there have
been) which is furnished with learned Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and his endeavours applyed that way will be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

to that which his Disposition is not so fit for. Again, as I
said, to dying men, who can feed their Souls with that Store of
Doctrine which they had stored themselves with before, but
lack the Seals of Gods Covenants, these are most necessary; but
I wonder what a Lay Elder should do with them, who must nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preach, nor apply Gods Seals to any? Again, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
out of the Text, that it is not said, Doth not preach, the
negative is not there; yes he will object, because it is opposed to
those that labour in the Word; It is true: but there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt those who do not labour in the Word, and those
who do not Preach; Labouring, as I have shewed, signifies one
industriously doing it, spending his main source and bent to it:
Now they, who finding their Abilities and the necessities of the
Times and places in which they Converse, requiring Ruling from
them, rather than Preaching, do not bend their Endeavours to
preaching, but to ruling, and yet may sometimes preach like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the most glorious preacher in the
World, yet took sometimes from preaching to bestow upon ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
so may they likewise, who give their labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ruling well, take off some time from it, and give it to
preaching, and yet not be <gap reason="foreign">

the Gospel, it was most necessary; but since not in such places

have said; it is his duty, who finds great abilities in himself for
ruling, to labour in the Word, but to labour in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he may do most good, which is ruling. If he Object, that to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61847:42"/>
Convert Souls, is the best Work, which is the proper Effect of
Preaching. I answer, yet when men are Converted, keeping
them in Ecclesiastical Discipline is more beneficial. And again,
although it be the best Work for him that is excellently Gifted,
yet it is not for him who hath greater Abilities for others, and
lesse for it; and therefore, although he may be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
who as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself did, can rule well, and labour in the
Word likewise, yet he may well deserve double honour who
rules well, and more seldom preacheth; but if he can do both,

                  <p>BUT Pag. 14. he hath another of the same, the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
framed another way with this phrase, or thus I may
reason; If the Apostle in this Text doth not speak only of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Preachers, then he speaks of Elders no Preachers.</p>
                  <p>But the first is true: (what the first is, I know not, for there
is no second, it being but one Proposition.) He speaks in the
place of some Elders, which are no Preachers, which is thus
proved.</p>
                  <p>If he speak only of Preachers, then there were some Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who preached not at all; but there be no Preachers who
preach not at all.</p>
                  <p>The second part is past denyal; The Consequence is proved.</p>
                  <p>If these Elders who are most worthy of double honour are
said but to labour in the Word: Then they who are accounted
but worthy of, &amp;c. did not labour in the Word, but &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have put down his Argument <hi>verbatim</hi> word for word, that
the whole force of it may appear, as well as the weaknesse shall
be manifest: And I answer in a word, It is one thing not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Word, and another not to preach it all. To labour,
as I have said and shewed out of the Word, is to do it industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
with his chief endeavour and might; which doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that he doth it not at all, yea rather that he doth it, and that
he cannot rule well if not preach at all, but not with his might
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61847:43"/>
and main. I will retort this Argument. If none may preach but
Clergy Elders, then it seems here, that these must be Clergy
not Lay Elders, which rule well; for the Text that sayes the one
labours in the Word, implyes with that, that the other doth it,
but not industriously, and therefore must be such Elders who
may preach, and would have more honour if they did it labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
or rather that honour more due.</p>

                  <p>BUT because tbese men seem to place the whole work of the
Ministry in preaching, I would learn from some of them,
what this preaching is, which they magnifie so much, which I
could never know to be so defined, as to make a peculiar Work
of a Minister, so that it should, as they make it, swallow up his
Function, and belong to none but such as they call Ecclesiastical
Presbyters. I hope it will not be unuseful to the Explication of the
Text; nor unprofitable nor unpleasant to the Reader, if I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of an Answer digresse a little, to discourse of
this Theam; <hi>Labouring in the Word,</hi> is not only labouring with
the Word in the pulpit, but an Industrious and studious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and therefore, in the 4th. Chapter of this Epistle, vers. 13.
he adviseth <hi>Timothy, to give himself unto reading,</hi> that is, Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Exhortation, Doctrine; and vers. 15. <hi>Meditate on these
things,</hi> this is labouring in the Word, and this labour is such as
is expressed, like an Oxe, as he expresseth it vers. 18th. of this
Chapter, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out the Corn:</hi> it must be as much, or greater, or else his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
would not hold; It is the labour of the mind by day and
night, reading, meditating.</p>
                  <p>And such are worthy in an especial manner of double honour;
but because the Apostle adviseth to Exhortation and Doctrine,
and every Ecclesiastick Officer is not for himself, but for the
Church, this reading and meditating, must not be for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Contemplation, but for the publique, to teach him to rule
well, upon Occasions to exhort to all piety, to teach the Truth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61847:43"/>
of Gods will, both to believe, and to do all these at their several
Occasions; not only in the pulpit, but in Writings, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences:
Every man who is fit to be a Presbyter, is not cut out
for a popular Auditory, he may have Gifts of an higher strain,
and they ought to bestow their pains upon those greater dutyes:
As I have heard it was answered <hi>Erasmus,</hi> when he scrupled to
receive a Benefice in <hi>England,</hi> because he had not that Language
to teach the people, You teach their Preachers, which is more
than to teach them; so may we say of these, that they may teach
Preachers, which is a greater Work: Preach to them in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
preach to them in their Writings. I have known in mine
experience a learned man, who had not himself the Faculty of
Pulpit-preaching, yet did more good by directing and teaching
others to preach, and advanced the Cause of Christ more than
Twenty peeachers could have done: Did not this Man labour in
the Word think you? Others again who have not that Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of doing it by Conference, have written learned books
for Preachers to study, and by them Preachers preach: Did not
these men labour in the Word? It is reported of <hi>Salvianus,</hi> that
he wrote and penned Homilies, which others preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
which of these (think you) was the Preacher? I think
both: and both took pains, and did their utmost endeavour, and
laboured in the Word and Doctrine; perhaps, one could not pen
exactly, perhaps the other could not Orator-like deliver; or,
perhaps, and it is likely, <hi>Salvianus</hi> could do both; but his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
might serve both places, and did good and was applauded,
in both his own Church and his that preached his Sermon; he
preached, perhaps, in two places at once, and both thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>SECT. XV. What Preaching is.</head>
                  <p>I Can think it nothing but teaching the Gospel of Christ, that
is, his Life for Example, his Doctrine for Precepts, and his
Death and Resurrection for our Meditation; now then this is
done by words written or spoken, either of these a man preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by: He preacheth, that writeth such Arguments as Convince
or Perswade, as well as he that speaks them; yea, perhaps, doth
more by that, and makes an Everlasting Sermon, like a persume
when the body is gone, yet there is a sweetnesse remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
which is gratefull to all such as Converse with it; so, the
Preacher being dead, the Sermons yet live; the fruit remains,
when the Tree is felled. That this is Preaching, is most evident,
because these teach the truth of Doctrine, and these perswade to
Godlinesse, Again, it is pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others words and matter in the Pulpit, perswades the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
either to Christian faith or manners, this is preaching; and
for my part, I conceive the saying or reading a Godly Homily,
to be preaching, and more usefull than those vain Sermons which
Trivial Presbyters and proud men utter, even in pulpits with you
in <hi>London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> I call them proud, bacause many take upon them to
preach, who scarce ever did read a Body of Divinity, nor are
able to ballance the Doctrine they deliver, by the Analogy of
Faith, or if they could do it by leasure and study, take not time
to do it, being alwayes preaching, but never learning; these
men, if they were humble, would content themselves either with
such Sermons as are penn'd by the Church to be read or got
without book; or with such excellent Sermons which St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,
Bazil, Gregory,</hi> or the like made, as the whole Church
of the <hi>Muscovites</hi> do; for by that means both the people should
be instructed in the fundamentals of Faith and Life, and they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from that fearfull presumption, of undertaking to teach,
being not taught, and that vanity of being unestablished in the
Faith, and being carryed about with winds of Doctrine, and
that other pride of seeking their own vain-glory; truly these
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61847:44"/>
thoughts have often made me startle, when I go about to study a
Sermon, and not da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e to adventure on any thing, which I have
not carefully Considered on. To repeat anothers Homily or
Sermon is preaching, it is teaching the people the Gospel of
Christ; for it is not material who penn'd it, so the Message of
God be delivered: and because <hi>Nihil dictum quod non fuit
dictum prius,</hi> I know not why men should be so squeamish
of it.</p>
                  <p>But I will stoop one degree lower; since Preaching is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing,
and that is teaching the Gospels, who can say, that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture in a known Tongue is not preaching, which
teacheth the people out of Scripture all that they ought to know
concerning their Souls Good. Let no man trouble this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> saying, 1 Cor. 9. <hi>Woe is me if I preach
not the Gospel,</hi> and then Glosse upon it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant
none of these preachings I have named; it is true, he did not;
but yet Consider, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching was infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
and there he might have full assurance of what he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Ease, without Pre-thought what he should deliver,
which we have not without mighty pains and study; therefore
his preaching was by the power of his utterance: and yet he, St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> did not only use vocal preaching, but writing, and those
Sermons he wrote have been, I dare say, more beneficial to
the Church than those he preached, and then we read those
very Sermons which he wrote: His Epistles are very Sermons,
we have the same, and there is reason, if we be not self-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they should do as much good amongst us, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

them, unlesse some few of late, who have found a new Road

                  <head>SECT. XVI. To what Preaching every Presbyter is bound.</head>
                  <p>I Have expounded what preaching is; now let us see to what
preaching every Presbyter is bound. First, without Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
every Presbyter should be a ruler; so St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 3d.
Chapter of this Epistle, verse 5. <hi>For if a man know not how to
rule his own house, how shall he take care to rule the Church of God?</hi>
there he supposeth, That he must be a Ruler; otherwise his
Conclusion were nothing, drawn from the Governing his own
house. There ruling is necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry in a Bishop or Presbyter, for
you will see hereafter, that these Offices had one name, and in
many things agreed. Now there you see ruling is required in a
Presbyter, and he himself will not say that this was a Lay Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
But then Consider, that in this whole Character of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
there is no one word of preaching, although there is of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and can you think if a Presbyter were chosen, such as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> here nominates, it were amisse? But it is objected, Tit. 1. 9.
there it is required, that he should be <hi>holding fast the faithfull
word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound Doctrine,
to exhort and convince the Gainsayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may well think this to be a Caution of Advice, not necessity:
But if <hi>Timothy</hi> had chosen and ordained such as were prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him, they might have been men sufficiently qualified, yet
<hi>ex abundanti,</hi> if this might be had in another Condition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that were well, yet this would be better; there is a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in Good, though not in Truth; but then let let us scan the
Text, suppose it be a requisite. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst, let us observe, that <hi>[he must
hold fast the faithfull word]</hi> that is, the word, I conceive, of the
Gospel; hold fast, that is, apprehend it strongly, adhere close
to it, as he hath learned, so we in our Translation; or in learning,
as the Margent; or <hi>secundùm Doctrinam Sermonis,</hi> as <hi>Beza;</hi> the
businesse will not be much. It must either be holding fast that
Doctrine which he hath learned, heretofore, and then there
will be little left for new Invention; or else it must be, he must
hold the faithfull word in his teaching; and then I answer, this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61847:45"/>
will be made good in the reading the Scriptures, in the reading
or repeating Homilies; The next Clause is, <hi>[That he may be
able to exhort and convince Gainsayers,]</hi> This likewise will be
acted in the other; But Consider first, Can any man think, that
this ability must be understood in such a vast Capacity, as that
every Presbyter must be able to Convince all ill Opinions of
Gentilism, Judaism? Surely, I believe not; If so, I dare say,
nor he, nor any Fellow he hath is a Presbyter. I remember
once in a Conference with a Gentleman of his mind, a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I proposed to him an Old Heresie which I had newly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, and those Arguments were made for it, he was forced to
Confesse an inability for that time, and yet a man of as great a
Name as any in <hi>England</hi> of that Side. Well then, what must it
be? that there must be some Capability to this purpose, upon
occasions, not pulpit work, but by discourse, when any such
thing shall be objected, and that such men should endeavour to
improve themselves in their Abilities to this purpose; so that
here is a great Latitude, and Mens abilities in all Elections and
Ordinations should be considered, how far they extend to this
purpose: but I perceive not here that kind of preaching which
is now so magnified, at all exacted. So the Heresie be convinced,
so the men be exhorted to piety, whether by an Homily out of
some Ancient Father, or such which the wisdom of the Church
prescribes, or a Declamation of a mans own penning, it is not
material; for although those who have least Abilities, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do most magnifie the latter, and practise it, yet without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the former is much safer, both for the Strong Convincing
of ancient Heresies, and likewise for sure Grounds of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Put the Case that it were as it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
dayes, that there was such a Reformation, as abundance of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men would not yield to, but rather leave their Benefices than
subscribe, it is necessary that those Churches should have each a
Presbyter in them, you will have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men gifted with abilities to
preach, and make Sermons of their own invention, I presume
there were not then an hundred such in all <hi>England.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had then provided ill for this Church, who should require as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
such Conditions as could not be found; Put the Case
as it is, that there be four or five hundred, yea a thousand,
two or three thousand, that have abilities fit to be licensed to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61847:46"/>
preach Sermons of their own making, it is a mighty matter, yet
what are they amongst those multitudes of Churches and Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
certainly but an handfull, the Parishes are 9284.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be then, that there is a necessity of more abilities
to a Presbyter than to do these Duties in that general way, which
I have discoursed, and so to endeavour in and by such means to
instruct others, and upon Study and Industry either from himself,
or more learned men, upon the starting any new Doubt, by
Study convince the Gainsayers, it is not required he should do
it <hi>ex tempore.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. XVII. What peculiar Interest a Presbyter hath in this
kind of Preaching.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus Considered Preaching in its latitude, it will now
be worth our Thoughts to reflect upon this Officer called
a Presbyter, and see what peculiar Interest he hath in it, distinct
from other men. First then, without Question, such a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as is Occasional, by private Conference, or in publike As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
when in publick Opportunity is offered to manifest the
Glory of God, or Convert or Confirm by Conference any soul
to or in the Christian Religion, or Godlinesse of living, which
indeed is a great part of Christianity, when upon occasions of
Discourse or otherwise, Opportunities shall be granted to any
man, he may, if he have abilities, so Conferre, as to perswade
men to a newnesse of life; and this is preaching in its latitude,
it is preaching the Gospel of Christ, and each man that hath abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
ought to do it, but each man is not bound to have abilities;
a private mans strength is chiefly discerned in holding fast the
Word of Truth, that so he be not <hi>carryed away with the wind of
Doctrine:</hi> he hath other Offices which are his Duties, and in
which he ought to expend his Studies and Endeavours; but to
have abilities, or to endeavour to have some Abilities for this
purpose, is the Duty and Office of a Presbyter. It is the Duty
of the Shepherd to take care of his Masters sheep, but it is a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61847:46"/>
comely Charity in every Servant, though he be not the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
when he finds his Masters sheep run astray, or ready to
starve, to throw them a lock of Hay, or call them back to the
fold; Nay it is his Duty out of Charity, though not out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
but to take upon him the Office when he is not Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to it, would be Intrusion, and it would bring a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
into the Church, as it would into a great Family, where
every man, or every man that would, might take upon him the
Manage of any Office he would. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore saith of
such, <hi>How shall he preach, unlesse he be sent?</hi> that is, how shall he
take upon him the Office of doing it, unlesse he be authorized
for it; let us then Consider who is authorized.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XVIII. Who is authorized to Preach.</head>
                  <p>THat this Authority must be joyned to every Presbyter that
hath power to administer the Sacraments, preaching must
be taken in a large sense, for reading Homilies, for reading the
Scriptures in known languages; for it is not possible to find men
of Abilities to do the other, in such a Nation as ours is, and yet
it is necessary that they should have these Sacraments, because by
them men receive the Covenants of God concerning their Souls,
which to teach and incourage us to, is the chief Duty of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and this is done (I am perswaded) more securely, by the
other way projected before; but then if we will have men preach
nothing but what they make themselves, there had need be a
mighty ability for a Weekly Preacher to do that, and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as cannot be expected from every Presbyter that may be
fit for the other; and therefore, that way of penning their own
Sermons, is not, nor can be exacted from every Presbyter: And
to preach Sermons not penned, although upon urgency there
hath been or may be such a Thing, yet it is nothing but laziness
and supine negligence, and undervaluing of that great Work
(by those to do it Constantly) and not worthy the thought
of Christians. But whether Presbyters alone may do this, is a
Question started in this Age, but was disputed long since by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61847:47"/>
learned men, and how determined I will set down, with mine
observations upon it. The Story is thus; <hi>Origen,</hi> a man most
eminent for learning of any man in that Age, both for humanity
and Divinity, and indeed such as may not only be accounted so
for that Age in which he lived, but deserved to be placed in the
first rank of Scholars, both of his own or any other Age, when
he lived at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> by Authority given him from the Bishops of
<hi>Palestine,</hi> interpreted the Scriptures publikely in the Church when
he was not a Presbyter, nor, that we know of, had received any
degree in Ecclesiastick Office; <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
who envyed the deserved glory of <hi>Origen,</hi> and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which rather as a debt was paid to, than given him, for his
Excellency in Preaching, inveighs bitterly against him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
little else to be offended with him for, saith, it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>of
thing that a Layman should preach, and writes to the
Bishops of <hi>Palestine</hi> about it; They patronage that excellent Work
of their own, and gave him Instance in three or four that they
knew of; and no doubt, (say they) there were more which had
been licensed by Bishops to do so, and did preach even before
them. I could have wished that the dispute had been larger set
down, that so the Arguments from Scripture or reason might
have been set down for our Instruction, but for defence of him,
who it is pity did not write his own Apology. If any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
St. <hi>Pauls How can he preach unlesse he be sent?</hi> I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
he was sent, and by that power that had Authority to send,
that was the Bishops in that Province in which he lived, who
had authority to delegate as Apostles, (of which I shall treat
hereafter) by our Saviours Charter, <hi>As my Father sent me, so
send I you,</hi> to send others, not with a plenipotency, but as they
saw expedient with divided powers, to baptize and no more, to
administer the Sacraments and no more, and why not preach and
no more; this way of preaching; penning, and contriving Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the people, requires great abilities inherent, acquired
by mighty industry and pains; and when men are found so Gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and enabled, although they think themselves not worthy to
take a Pastoral Charge upon them, or to administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yet when they find abilities for this, and their Bishop
think fit; why should they not preach? but not without the
Bishop; he is the Supream Pastor, he may, if he find an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61847:47"/>
fit for that place, give him Authority to feed, or fold, or
drive his Flock, and no more; and he that is authorized by the
Supream Pastor, may do it, and others who without his leave
undertake to do it, are Intruders; but he being so authorized
doth it orderly, lawfully; thus did <hi>Origen,</hi> who had he lived
in our Age, could have discoursed much more powerfully to this
Theam; and I can guesse, that this may satisfie most of that
which many in our Age object concerning their Gifts. If they
are Gifted, let their Gifts be examined, and if he (the Bishop)
find them to be such as can enable them for such a Work, let
them be licensed, otherwise not.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. His Argument answered.</head>
                  <p>I Have been over tedious in this Discourse. Here you may
discern the vanity of his Argument from that Text, if prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
be taken in that late sense, as I have expounded it, I deny
that there are any Presbyters which are not Teachers. If Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
be taken in this strict sense for such as preach Studied Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I say that there are many Presbyters which are not Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and do not <hi>labour in the Word</hi> in that sense, and yet there
are no Presbyters which have not the power of Administring the
Sacraments. It is very weak that he saith there must be Preachers,
which are no Preachers; for Presbytery, doth not depend upon
preaching in this kind, nor doth the name or office signifie a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
but if he will, there may be preachers who do not labour,
make it their Chief pains to preach; there may be differences in
the Industries of men, and industrious men may be industrious
in one piece of their Office, and not in another, 1 Cor. 15. 10.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he laboured more than they all,</hi> that was, without
doubt, in preaching, aud yet 1 Cor. 1. 14. <hi>he baptized but a
few,</hi> industriously attending one, and not so much the other; but
the sense of the Text is apparent, I think, and do you forgive
my tedious digression.</p>
                  <p>But he urgeth, that the Bishops Factors provide ill for them;
for by the Apostles determination, the meanest Minister that is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61847:48"/>
conscientious and laborious in preaching should have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
than his Diocesan, who sits, &amp;c. but labours not to feed
them with the Word of Life.</p>
                  <p>The Text doth not say the meanest conscientious Minister, &amp;c.
but saith, that those who <hi>rule well, and labour in the Word</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
are more deserving that honour, than they that rule well
only. It may be it is spoken only of Bishops; howsoever it is
only an Addition of the obligation to him who labours; and
truly I think that Bishop who doth not <hi>labour in the Word</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of little; but I confine not <hi>labouring in the Word</hi> to preaching
only studyed Sermons; but to instruct Preachers, to write, to
overthrow ill opinions, and the like, and this is labouring in
the Word and Doctrine.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XX. St. Ambrose Expounded.</head>
                  <p>LAstly, he hath found a piece of an Antient and truly to be
honoured Father of the Church, St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which he
rejoyceth in, like one that had met with some unexpected bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
see how he commends it; It carries (saith he) an Amazing
Evidence, and again after the place quoted, The brightnesse and
patenesse of the Witnesse is such as though it had been writ
with a beam of the Sun, and dazles the Eyes of almost Envy it
self. But observe this one thing, as he and that sort of Writers
when they will urge Scriptures which they cannot find to make
any thing for them, they put not down the words but Ciphers: So
here the words seem to serve his turn, but the place where they
are put overthrows it; (but it is not set down by him) I have hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it out, and it is upon the first verse of the 1 Tim. 5. the words
are these. <hi>Apud omnes ubique Gentes honorabilis est Senectus,
unde &amp; Synagoga &amp; postea Ecclesia Seniores habuit, sine quorum
Consilio nihil agebatur in Ecclesiâ, quod quâ negligentiâ obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leverit,
nescio, nisi forte Doctorum desidiâ, aut potius superbiâ,
dum soli volunt aliquid videri.</hi> Now consider, this is Writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first verse before. The Words he comments on are
these, <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but entreat him as a Father, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61847:48"/>
younger men as brethren.</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> with all Commentators
(even <hi>Beza)</hi> doth acknowledge this word Elder to signifie an
Elder in Age; St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his words before these written down
are, <hi>Propter honorificentiam aetatis majorem natu, cum mans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
ad bonum opus provocandum.</hi> And upon that he brings the
words cited, <hi>Amongst all Nations old Age is honourable;</hi> and
this word is as it were put of purpose to overthrow those men,
he useth <hi>Senectus,</hi> not <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which word <hi>Senectus</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
used for an Officer; so then what doth St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> mean,
but that in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogue and in the Church, they used
grave men to assist and counsell, without whose Advice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was done in the Church; I grant it; but these men were
not your Elders, but grave and learned men to advise with; I will
put in, it is fit to be so still; and for that reason Chancellors, men
learned, used to sit in the Consistory. But he gives two cautions
pag. 15. <hi>Wherefore let him know,</hi> (that is, the Reader) <hi>that the
Elders mentioned by</hi> Ambrose, <hi>were such that their places and
offices were almost worn out;</hi> (I agree) <hi>but such were not the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders,</hi> (I agree to that likewise;) but say withall, that
these men were not such Elders who had Office in the Church,
but were Counsellors, as he saith.</p>
                  <p>His second Observation upon St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> is, <hi>That the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the power and Rule of these Elders, came, as he conjectures,
by the sloath, especially by the Pride of the Teachers, because they
alone might be lifted up.</hi> The word in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was <hi>Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
of Doctors, which was a phrase applyed to Bishops, who
in his time were the only Preachers, as appears in the famous
Story of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who when he was a Presbyter, was fain to
have a license to preach; now then, why he should say the sloath
of the Bishops, I cannot tell, for sloathfull men are willing to
have others joyned in Commission with them, that so others
may act what through lazinesse they are unwilling to meddle
with; but what he saith of pride may have some colour, that
they would Act all alone, and so have all the Curchy and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
made to them; therefore they would admit none of these
Lay Counsellors with them. Here is the drift of his Speech, and
what word in all this tends to the Addition of any Ecclesiastical
Officer? much lesse by a Divine right which is pretended to,
but only some Chancellor, as I have said, to advise with; and now
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61847:49"/>
suppose, I say, clean contrary to him, that the sloath and pride of
Bishops put all business upon these Lay men, so that indeed in our
Times they are more Bishops than the Bishops, and all through
their sloath, because they would not act in businesse, and pride,
because they disdained to stoop to petty occasions, I doubt I
should say true, and yet neither his Saying nor mine make one
word for their Elders <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> the rest that he saith vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
of its self; thus they would make thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lves eminent, by
the disannulling the honor of others places, they could not be
such as were of their own rank, or did possess any of their places,
I grant it, neither were they such Elders as we speak of, nor
you.</p>
                  <p>Thus now is apparent, I hope, how weak his Arguments are,
and what he said of that place of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that it had an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
kind of discovery with it, I may say of this whole discourse,
that it hath an amazing kind of discovery; but what it discovers,
is the strangenesse of these men, who opposing a known truth,
and the universal practise of the Christian world from Christs
time downward, dare urge these places for their Conceits, which
had very little semblance for them, although they had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by practise; but having none but great words and
commendations of their own to that purpose, it will easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men that they made first their Form, and then hunted
for something to insinuate a belief, that they were induced by
Scriptures; and thinking with my self upon what design they
should introduce this kind of Ministry, I could imagine no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but as when cunning people would change a Monarchy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Aristocracy, or Oligarchy, they have no way to divert the
people from their old obedience, and introduce it to themselves,
but by making them believe they should have some share in
that Government which was ingrossed by one. So these men
breaking from Episcopacy, would perswade the people from
the old to the new yoak which they would impose, that they
had a Share in Ecclesiastical Government, and that they should
send out of them into the Consistory their Lay Elders, which
would wonderfully provide for their Security and good, much
better than before, with other Things of the like Nature
of which I may speak hereafter; but indeed their hopes are
frustrate in all this design, for they could never set up any thing
more Tyrannical or Arbitrary than this.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. SECT. I. What a true Presbyter is. The Name first
Expounded.</head>
                  <p>I Have done now with <hi>their Presbyter,</hi> of which I see no
footing in the Word of God, or Antiquity; I now come
next to treat of <hi>our own Presbyter,</hi> what he is: and first, that
we may avoyd all Equivocations and doubtfull Interpretations
of Scripture, we will discourse of the <hi>Quid nominis,</hi> what is
meant by this and other Phrases which are used in Scripture to
intimate this Office.</p>
                  <p>First, he is called a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which as it naturally signifies an
Elder in Age, so from that analogy it signifies a grave and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Man; another word is <hi>Bishop,</hi> which we alwayes render
for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and signifies alwayes a <hi>Superintender,</hi> and it is
applyed to Presbyters, who have a Particular Charge to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
and see to. I stay little upon this, because it hath received
very little Controversie; but yet say somewhat of it, because it
will illustrate some future passages; They are likewise called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
or <hi>Shepherds,</hi> because when they are in a Charge they look
over it, as a Shepherd over his flock, to govern or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, and do such Duties; They are called <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi>
because they instruct the people in the Mysteries of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
although perhaps this word may be extended farther
than to them; but these were the Chief names by which that
superiour Order which succeeded the Apostles were called in the
Primitive Church, in the writings of the Apostles and after; and
this is the Sense implyed by these names.</p>

                  <p>BUT now to sever Granted Truths from Questioned, and not
to wast my time in unnecessary discourses, It is granted by
all that I have seen, that these all were ordained by the Apostles
to do these Duties, to administer the Sacraments of Baptism and
the Communion, to preach the Gospel; although, I think, no
man can shew me any place of Scripture expressing such a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
which shall enable such men bearing such names, under
such Titles to be authorized to such Duties, but only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

to do this Duty, we may find rules directing how these
should be performed by them; I let that passe therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
shall now enter the lists against two Opinions which I oppose,
one which makes <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> two Offices; a second
which makes no distinction amongst these.</p>

Part. 2. Chap. 1. pag. 19, 20. And first to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his Opinion, Consider, that he makes two sorts of <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders,</hi> one he calls <hi>Pastors,</hi> and the other <hi>Teachers;</hi> the
scope of the <hi>Pastors</hi> he describes with a great deal of handsom
Circumlocution, exceeding fine expressions of the Rhetorical
perswasive part of a Preacher, the result of all which is, to
perswade by such Arguments as have power over the Will
and the Affections, as it is pag. 19. <hi>The Teachers Office is to lay
the Fundamental points of Christian Faith, the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61847:50"/>
as he expresseth it in the bottom of Page 21, and the top of
22. These two parts he makes distinct Offices in the Church,
both of them being <hi>ruling Elders</hi> as well as <hi>teaching,</hi> and both
of them having power to administer the Sacraments; but in
their preaching the one is to bend his force, his endeavour, to
the Teaching and informing the Understanding, the other to the
perswading and moving the Affection; the first he calls <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
the second <hi>Pastors:</hi> Look for a reason for this distinction
unheard-of till of late; I find none but in a reply to Mr. <hi>Rutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
pag. 7. where it seems Mr. <hi>Rutterford</hi> urged, that these
formal Objects of these two Offices (Information of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Exhorting) are not so different as that they should be
incompetible, pag. 7. Chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>To this he replyes, <hi>that in themselves, and full breadth,</hi> (that
is his phrase) <hi>these are not so incompetible, but look at the special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Gift that fits for one, and which furnisheth for the other
to attend mainly and chiefly upon each according to the Gift, they
will prove inconsistent;</hi> These are his words, and these imply,
that where there are distinctions of Gifts and they diversly to be
endeavoured, there should be diverse Offices, or else I see no
force in this Discourse; but this hath no probability of colour
for it: Consider Civil Offices, <hi>a Justice of Peace,</hi> one Justice
hath a great Cunning in the Statutes, in rendring them to a legal
sense, he applyes himself and endeavours to that most; another
hath a great ability in reconciling and taking up Quarrels, and
perswading men to friendship, he endeavours that most; and
perhaps did either of these by framing himself to endeavour what
he were least fit for, lesse attend what he were more dexterous
in; he might attend his Office in general, but the lesse profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way, and these are both one Office, though in it diverse
Gifts or Abilities, which cannot both be attended with any
mans utmost endeavour. Passe from Civil to Ecclesiastical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and this very businesse: Among Presbyters Preachers,
one hath great Excellency in giving the Grammatical sense of
the Text, another in expounding it Scholastically, a Third in
the Historical part of Divinity; and these are several Gifts or
Abilities, and men according to them apply their utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
but these make not distinct Offices, but several Gifts
and Abilities in the same Office, which is just the same with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61847:51"/>
these; and as there is no foot-step in the Historical part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
to shew any one president: so is there no colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it; But he quotes Scripture. The first is that place so
largely discoursed of before, Rom. 12. 7, 8. <hi>He that teacheth, on
reaching, he that exhorteth, on exhortation.</hi> This place I have at
large shewed in the Case of their <hi>Deacon,</hi> not to signifie distinct
Offices, but diversities of Gifts, and it imports no more, than
that he who finds in himself Abilities of Teaching or Exhorting,
should use his Talent as a member of the same body, to the good
of his brother. But I wonder, why they should not rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish

and are urged for this distinction in his Treatise of the Preachers
Office, Part 2. Chap. 1. pag. 20. but how unluckily, let any
man Consider: The words are these, <hi>And he gave some Apostles,

the Apostle should put these as distinct: Those which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,

of what is for or against them; It is <hi>parum firma

<hi>Ambrose,</hi> for first, he begins with <hi>Apostles,</hi> they (saith he) are

which we translate <hi>Teachers,</hi> were <hi>Exorcists;</hi> this last <hi>Beza</hi>
mentioneth to be not agreeing with his Opinion, I may say, nor
any one of the rest. But take this note of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he took the
words as they lay, and so expounded them, but not observing
that Criticism, which perhaps he looked not on, he gave an
Exposition such as was agreeing to the present face of the
Church in which he lived, which it is possible easily for any
man to do; but did ever any man, who observed and marked
the language of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> think it fit to be cast off with a <hi>parum

the <hi>Latinet,</hi> as <hi>Beza, Hierom, Austin,</hi> I can adde to
them <hi>Anselm</hi> most punctually, and our <hi>Bede</hi> likewise upon the

although <hi>Beza</hi> agree with him in the division, yet his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

nor <hi>Beza</hi>'s opinion with <hi>Hooker:</hi> so they serve one anothers

<hi>Beza</hi> makes this <hi>Teachers</hi> place to be such as should read a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

this: There is (saith he) <hi>Doctor in Schola, &amp; Doctor in Ecclesia,

the difference betwixt a <hi>Teacher in the Schools,</hi> and <hi>in the Church,</hi>
for I conceive these men not putting difference in the places; and
if they take the Church for the Congregation of men, I know
no difference betwixt one and the other, nor can there be this

farre from the language of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> I will adde this only note,
That he nor any other can shew me that place of Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
any Duty to either of these Offices, in their distinct
Notions as they expresse them, which will not agree to both,

                  <p>I Come now to the other dispute, Whether there be any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
amongst these Offices, by Apostolical right? This
is a Question which hath been mightily debated, and therefore a
man can scarce handle any thing which hath not been often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
on before; yet if by varying the Method of Handling it,
or by other manner of expressions, or applying other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in another way than they have done, that which I shall
write shall fit some mens understandings better than other mens
words before me have done, I shall think it an happy work,
and not repent me of my pains: and although I think that other
men have abundantly spoken of this question, and so fully, that
they have satisfied my self; yet because I find others are not
satisfied, I conceive our blessed Saviours Command to St. <hi>Peter</hi>
to be a Precept to all of us, <hi>when thou art confirmed, strengthen
thy brethren,</hi> Luke 22. 32. and although it be but little I can
speak, yet put in that little. For the understanding therefore
of this Question,</p>
                  <p>First, Know, that although this Question about that Order
we now term <hi>Bishops,</hi> whether they have distinction and a right
of preheminence beyond <hi>Presbyters</hi> that are barely such, yet it
is not <hi>de nomine,</hi> barely of the Name, whether this word <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
be such as must alwayes be applied to that Office; but of the
Thing, whether there be such a Thing as a Degree Instituted by
the Apostles, which hath a preheminence above other Presbyters;
and then, because the word <hi>Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Superior,</hi> or <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
or <hi>Superinspector,</hi> being a word applyed to this Office, will
by Consent of a perpetual Language in the Church be well fitted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61847:52"/>
to the Expression of that Office, we may use it often in this
Discourse without prejudice as we shall see occasion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us Conceive (as was before taught) that all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
power was seated in the Apostles, and none else, from
those words, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you;</hi> and therefore
they had power to settle Offices for the Church as they pleased,
and there is no Office which had not its foundation from them:
so that although this question be often handled under these
Terms, whether Bishops be a distinct Order <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> yet
they that hold it Affirmatively, must defend it with this phrase
<hi>Apostolico Divino, Apostolical, by such a Divine Right;</hi> not as
if Christ immediately instituted it, for he instituted none but the
Apostles, as we read of, for the whole World; but by such a
Divine Right as Christ gave his Apostles power to Institute, and
they did institute.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let us Conceive, that although perhaps there can
be found no Law or Decree by either one or more Apostles,
which shall in expresse Terms say, that by the Authority given
us we do erect and institute such an Office; for such Registers
(as I have said) we have not: yet when it shall appear to be the
Apostles practice to ordain such Officers so qualified, we may be
Confident it was not without Authority; for men of such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar
obedience and humility, even to death, would not in their
practice act without Law and Authority.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That where any place of Scripture that directs our
Practice, shall abide a double Interpretation, because <hi>Quisque
abundat sensu suo;</hi> there the doctrine and practice of such men
who were Apostolical, conversed and lived with those Apostles,
themselves must needs be the best Glosse upon such a Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as it is reasonable to think that they should best understand
the Apostles meaning: (for when Laws are newly made, their
sense likewise how they should be understood is fresh in mens
apprehension; but Laws antiquated or grown old must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to the letter) so likewise it is most reasonable to think,
that they could not write or do amisse in these publike Acts or
Writings without Controll; and therefore, certainly, it must
needs be the best Comment, when the Text abides a doubtful
Interpretation, to shew, that the Apostles disciples which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with them, did so understand them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61847:53"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly, That the preheminence that I place in a Bishop over
a Presbyter consists in these two things;</hi> The power of giving
these Orders, which a bare Presbyter hath not; <hi>and secondly,</hi>
The power of Jurisdiction over such as are only Presbyters of the
lower rank.</p>
                  <p>These Truths being granted, as they must without impudence,
I addresse my self to the Question, wherein I can Complain for
lack of mine Adversaries books; for such as write for the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>THE force of it is this, that there a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> are one
thing as well as name, I grant it for this dispute; but let
us see what will result out of it, no more but this, that in the
Apostolical Age this name of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> was used for
one Office; the name <hi>Apostle</hi> was that which was used for the
Superiour Dignity, which, as I shewed before out of <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
when I treated of the Name <hi>Apostle,</hi> that in their Time many
were called Apostles which were none of the Twelve; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61847:54"/>
to avoid Confusion and an Indistinction betwixt the
Original Apostles and the Derivative, for such as were made by
men, the Church used this name of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and reserved the
Name of <hi>Apostle,</hi> to those men who were so Constituted by our
Saviour, and that one who was made by Election of Lott into
<hi>Judas</hi> his place: So we find diverse phrases not used to such
purpose in the New Testament, yet prevailed with the Succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Apostles in such a manner, as they gained a Constant
use among Ecclesiastical Writers; such is <gap reason="foreign">

any Order in the Church of Christ any where in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and yet amongst the Ancients are used for the whole
Order of Priesthood as it includes Bishops, and sometimes for
Bishops alone; but as they are the superiour Order in that sort
of men, and in the latter Age are solely appropriated by the use
of Writers, to that Order, which the Scriptures and the most
ancient term <hi>Presbyter,</hi> inferiour to the Suprea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scripture <hi>Apostles,</hi> and to their Successors, called <hi>Bishops</hi> among
the Ancients; therefore in the reading of Authors, not the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
only, but the <hi>usus loquendi</hi> is to be Considered in words.
<hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Remains</hi> hath a long Discourse like a <hi>Lexicon,</hi>
where we may see to how various Senses in our <hi>English</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
the same words have arrived, by Tract of Time losing
their old, and gaining a new Sense, especially in Offices; so hath
it happened with the words <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter:</hi> they were
most frequently in Scripture taken for one and the same thing;
but the word <hi>Apostle,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> I can never find given to the
Inferiour Sort of Presbyters; But now this word <hi>Apostle</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated,
in the Language of Divines, to the Twelve, and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> only, the word <hi>Bishop</hi> to the Superiour Sort, the word
<hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> to the Inferiour Sort of Presbyters. I shall
leave therefore to discourse of the Names, and come to examine
the Text concerning the Thing, whether there be in this Text
a Parity of Ministers prescribed?</p>

                  <p>FOR this Parity he urgeth nothing, but the Attributing these
two names which we use, in a distinct Sense, to one and the
same thing, which proves no parity of Office, but only the use
of these words in those dayes. But I will go further, and prove
this Office we call <hi>Bishop</hi> distinct from the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> out of that
very Text; St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I have left thee in Creet</hi> to do these
two things, <hi>that thou shouldest set in order the Things that are
wanting, and ordain Elders in every City;</hi> Mark here, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had been in <hi>Creet</hi> himself, he had layd the foundation of the
Gospel, he being to go further into the World, leaves <hi>Titus</hi> to
build upon his Foundation; and he leaves him to do two things;
<hi>that he should set in Order,</hi> or Correct, or supercorrect those
things which were not perfected by himself; here is Episcopacy
in one piece, he had Authority <hi>to correct, to set in order,</hi> things
that were out of Order, to Correct what was amisse; then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>to Ordain Elders in every City;</hi> not to appoint only,

                     </gap>ttle them: I do not know
how a Bishop could more exactly be described, in so few words;
and I wonder much, why these men should produce this Text,
which without a mind much prejudicated with another Opinion,
cannot be wrested to any other sense. <hi>Hooker</hi> takes no notice
of this, but some others say, That <hi>Titus</hi> was an <hi>Evangelist.</hi>

                     <p>THey say so; but do they produce one word out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Antiquity for it: they might say he was an <hi>Apostle</hi>
as well, and with much more semblance; and I think he was of
the Inferiour rank; but then, can they tell me what an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi>
was? This is a shrewd Question; Those four that writ
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61847:55"/>
the Gospels, are only known by that name amongst Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writers: so that if a man should say, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vangelist saith so,
we would Conclude one of them. <hi>Philip</hi> is indeed called an
<hi>Evangelist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Acts 21. but no man else in the New Testament; it
may be, because he was an excellent and powerfull Preacher.
<hi>Beza,</hi> with those who affect new Opinions, makes an <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
to be one who was an Associate and Companion to the Apostles
in their travell;</hi> but there is nothing in Scripture or Antiquity to
give light to that Conclusion: I am sure St. <hi>Chrysostome, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact,
&amp;c.</hi> are against it in expresse Terms, upon the 4th. to
the <hi>Ephes.</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> makes him <hi>a Deacon to the Apostles,</hi>
which hath some shew of reason for it, because <hi>Philip</hi> was an
<hi>Evangelist.</hi> This word <hi>Evangelist</hi> is but three Times used in
Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 8. where <hi>Philip</hi> is called an <hi>Evangelist;

the Gospel of Jesus Christ; or, as some of the Ancients, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<hi>to make full proof of his Ministry;</hi> but is there the least
Colour that this Office should enable him to ordain Presbyters,
or Correct Misdemeanors, or to regulate things that are amisse,
which <hi>Titus</hi> was Commissioned to do. Again, it is generally
agreed amongst them, that this Office of an <hi>Evangelist</hi> was a
Temporary Office; but these Duties of <hi>Correcting,</hi> of <hi>Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elders,</hi> must needs be perpetual in the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not Constitute the nature of that temporal Office:
Well then, to dispell that cloud that would darken the light of
this Text for Episcopacy, by saying that <hi>Titus</hi> was an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,</hi>
there is no word in Scripture, nor any Author in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of any reputation in the World, which offers any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Opinion. 2dly. If they did, yet they would be at as
great a losse to shew me, that the Office of an <hi>Evangelist</hi> was to
do such things as <hi>Titus</hi> is here commanded to do. 3dly. If they
could shew <hi>Evangelizing</hi> to Consist in the performance of such
Duties; yet we might justly then Conceive them to he <hi>Bishops,</hi>
such as we require, and a Standing Office in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Duties are so: and it is evident, that <hi>Titus</hi> had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61847:55"/>
in both these kinds; Therefore there were some men
which had such Authority above others. But let us go on with

Word, diligent baptizing, administring the Communion, but to
Convent or Summon their Flock, or Censure them, or give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and a like Authority to others, of this there is no one word
in particular. To expresse my self: Although many men rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
have thought, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> Convented both <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Presbyters</hi> under that general name of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as Writs

by which word was understood both Earls and Dukes,
although by the Name and Notion called the house of Lords,
So <hi>Bishops</hi> were called along being <hi>Presbyters,</hi> under that name
they are all called both from <hi>Ephesus</hi> and the Adjacent Parts,
though that be put down only; and then St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave them
all their Charge, to look to their Several Duties, and execute
their several Commissions, which they had before received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61847:56"/>
is all that these words can enforce; although this is reasonable,
yet methinks this is more probable, that they were all, or for the
most part, but bare <hi>Presbyters;</hi> for in the first Age of the Church,
when the Conversion of men to Christ was new, and there were
but few Christians, few <hi>Presbyters</hi> were necessary, and then
much sewer <hi>Bishops,</hi> especially the Apostles living and Episcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
one of them enough for Twenty of us; and therefore one
<hi>Bishop</hi> for a great Nation, as <hi>Titus</hi> for <hi>Creet,</hi> where were an
hundred Cities, was sufficient; but Religion increasing in the
hearts of men, more <hi>Presbyters</hi> are necessary, and they increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
there must be a greater necessity likewise of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but
that any of these should be such as we call <hi>Bishops,</hi> to have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and to give them orders, is no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent;
This therefore proves nothing for their parity. But he
addes, that the word <hi>Bishop</hi> is never used in the New Testament,
but the Actions therein required belong to any <hi>Presbyter.</hi> He
excepts the Case of <hi>Judas,</hi> Acts 1. 20. For my part: it is not
material how the word is used, but what I labour for, is, that
there is such a Thing as the word <hi>Bishop</hi> now used doth signifie;
and that the more he or any other Trouble themselves against it,
it will appear the more clearly, as hitherto it doth. I will
proceed therefore with him, page 25. He frameth his Second
reason thus.</p>

it, Pulpit-preaching, the World never yielded more
fruitfull Industries than those of our Bishops, whose Works live
to bear witnesse for them being dead; and therefore I conceive
this to be an Argument of spleen, rather than reason; and for
the second Clause of this foundation, <hi>that they give the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
leave to labour in the Word;</hi> they do much more, for they
Episcopize over them, and look to them, and by Authority over
them make them do it, encourage them who do, and punish
those who do not; If men have misdemeaned themselves in their
Office, no doubt but Twenty <hi>Presbyters</hi> have done so for one
<hi>Bishop;</hi> but yet neither the one nor the other are lesse <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
for that; <hi>Judas</hi> his Office was good, he was an ill Officer.
<hi>Nicholas</hi> his Office was good, he an ill Officer, this chose by
the Apostles, that by Christ himself; thus Offices are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged
by the Officers. But Consider further, that although
<hi>labouring in the Word</hi> with the people, may be a more Excellent
Work than governing or ruling the people, as it is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to perswade, than to compell men to vertuous Actions. They
are but half vertues that are forced; yet governing <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
which is a proper act of <hi>Bishops,</hi> is more excellent than labouring
in the Word to the people, by how much the Extent of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
is more General: It produceth the Good of a Diocesse, as
that of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arish. But once again, although I had thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
had been said to that Text, 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders
that rule well be accounted worthy of Double honour; but especially
they who labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> yet I will adde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for illustration. Suppose this speech were turned from
the Church to the Army, and a man should say thus; Let the
Elders, the Officers of the Army who govern or rule well their
Regiments, or the Army, be worthy of double honour, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
they who labour and toyl in the heat of the battel; could
any man Collect from hence, that it were a better Act to labour
in the Act of fighting, than to steer and direct the fighting?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61847:57"/>
No sure: it is an Act becomming a private Officer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
a few; but the other who rules well, hath the whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the day, the fate of a whole Kingdom sometimes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on him; yet if he can and do upon desperate occasions
thrust himself into great hazard, he hath an especialty of this
Double honour due to him, and yet it would not befit him to
hazard the day, which depends on his providence, by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
direction, to thrust himself into perpetual dangers. These
Bishops are the Generals of this Spiritual Militia, they are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and oversee their Diocesse, to encourage, to command In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Officers to their Duties; when they do this well they
are worthy of double honour; but if when great occasions
shall require, they act themselves what at other Times they
command, and take care that others shall do it likewise, they
have an Especialty of Double honour due to them, which is the
full Sense of that Text; Elders which rule well have a double
honour, because they have a double excellency; both do their
own, and make others do their duty; but if they who have
abilities <hi>do rule well, and labour too,</hi> then especially much more
is that honour due.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I Come now to examine his Third Argument, which I am
sorry to read; for it is so full of illogical deductions, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it should not be possible for any man to think he could
perswade by them: It is thus framed,</hi> If they differ from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<hi>Jure Divino,</hi> then there are some Ministers by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
necessary for the gathering of the Church, and perfecting
the body of Christ, besides that of the Presbyter; for if the
Church can be perfected without these, there is no need of
these.</p>
                  <p>I will stay here a while. This Consequence is not good; for
Ministers may be necessary for the gathering, which are not
necessary for the perfecting the body of Christ: we see Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were necessary for the Gathering, and the Extraordinary
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61847:57"/>
part of Apostles, which are not necessary for the perfecting.
Now here is a Conjunction Gathering and Perfecting. His
second Consequence is as bad: If the Church can be perfected
without these, there is no need of these; this doth not follow:
things may be necessary <hi>ad esse, ad perfectum esse,</hi> and yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things may be necessary to the easie obtaining this <hi>Esse.</hi>
I do but give you the non-consequence of his manner of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
observe his Minor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there is no Minister necessary for the Gathering and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Church, besides that of the Presbyters:</hi> He proves
this: <hi>Because the Apostle setting down the several Ministries
which Christ had purchased, and by Ascention bestowed upon his
Church, when he gave Gifts to men for that end, they are only
comprehended in these two, Pastors and Teachers,</hi> Ephes. 4. 12,
13. <hi>and they who are given for this end, can and shall undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attain it.</hi> Consider here the Inconsequence of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Because (saith he) the Apostle in that place sets down
none other; therefore there is no other. We have examined
that Text sufficiently (I thought) already, but this Starts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Negative note, The Apostle doth not say there, that there
are no other but what he sets down, nor doth he put any Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Term, as these, and these only are they. I am sure in the
12. to the <hi>Romans</hi> he hath another reckoning of things like
Offices, and so in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. I know he may say, that
with a Trick of Wit these may be brought about by subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to amount to the same thing and number, and so I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to two only, Extraordinary, and Ordinary, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and teaching, a principal and subservient; but unlesse he
can shew a Negative or exclusive Term in the Text, he cannot
draw a Negative inference: So that although the means that
our Saviour appoints shall attain its end, yet the means he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
must be totally taken, not one piece without another,
and this Text doth not say, that is the Total means: this is
known in Logick, <hi>posita Causa ponitur effectus,</hi> but it must be
<hi>totalis Causa,</hi> not <hi>partialis.</hi> But now suppose his Consequence
were good in Logick, will the Text bear him out in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Doth the Text name none but these <hi>Pastors and Teachers?</hi>
Yes sure: and although these two (as I have shewed) are but
one, yet <hi>Apostles</hi> are different, and these seem without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61847:58"/>
to be necessary <hi>to the perfecting of the body of Christ,</hi> and

it, as not pertinent; this is enough to shew the weaknesse of
his Argument if the Text were granted to allow his deduction
out of it. But he proceeds as unluckily, as if all this were
granted.</p>
                  <p>Where <hi>(saith he)</hi> the Issue is, if Pastors and Doctors be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will not lose my self in his long period; Suppose these were
sufficient Teaching Ministries, is there no more requisite but
teaching? Yes; to look to them that they do teach, and teach

                     <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>if these be enough, all others be superfluous.</hi> I

the whole <hi>Presbytery;</hi> now the Third place, is this in my
Text. In the two first places, <hi>Presbytery</hi> is taken for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates

then from the use of the word in other places, it cannot be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that this should particularize this lower Order, which he
fancieth, sith there is no place to parallel it: But because <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
doth signifie an <hi>Ecclesiastical Order</hi> in the Ministery,
therefore this <hi>Presbytery</hi> should do so likewise; but in as large a

in this place I am not to prove, but answer; and I reply,
that neither they, nor any, I think, can shew me this word
<hi>Presbytery</hi> used in any other place than these I have named, and
then I am sure it cannot be proved that it should signifie that

to <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Inferiour Priests and Levites.</p>
                  <p>Whence it abundantly appears, that not only St. <hi>Hierome</hi>
otherwhere, but even here opposeth these men expresly in the
Case of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and surely evidently enough in the business
of Jurisdiction, Comparing the <hi>Bishops</hi> to Generals and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
But then mark these mistakes in his Quotation, where he puts
<hi>Collocaverunt</hi> for <hi>Collocatum,</hi> as if the Presbyters had given him

any force to this purpose out of St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> phrase, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they had one elected out of their number which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in an higher degree, and called a <hi>Bishop,</hi> not naming who
ordained him, or who elected him; but suppose they should
Elect him, would it follow that they had power of Ordination?
Certainly no; the people or Patron may elect their Parson, but
not ordain him: or, if they should elect and ordain him, which
will never be granted; yet would it follow, that he had Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and sole power of ordaining others: a Master of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is elected to his Office by the Fellows, and ordained
according to the Lawes, yet unlesse by Authority delegated
from him, no Fellow can choose, much lesse make the least
Fellow or Scholar in the House. Take St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Instance;
The Emperor or General of an Army dies, in his place the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
chooseth and Constitutes another Emperor, as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in <hi>Rome,</hi> when they had made their Election, then he
had power both of Jurisdiction in Governing them who chose
him, and of Ordaining inferiout Officers which were under
him, but over the rest of the Army: So that although it be
true in Nature, that which can do the greater, can do the lesse;
yet it is not true in Politick Affairs, as thus. In an Elective
Kingdom, or the Empire, they who have power to choose the
Emperour himself, yet, when they have chosen him, have not
power to choose the least Constable or Inferiour Officer, but
the Emperor only: so that here are wonderfull Inconsequences
in this Discourse, if much more were granted than indeed is
any way true; and yet, as if all were true, he deduceth strange
Conclusions; <hi>Whence it followes</hi> (saith he) <hi>first, that Bishops
were first Presbyters:</hi> I grant it; <hi>secondly, that they had their
first Constitution and Election from them:</hi> I deny that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
First, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apostles Constituted many <hi>Bishops</hi>
in their several precincts, <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> many more: Then

men easily to credit it, because that the Church in the old Law
seems to be governed by such a Discipline, where (as I said out
of St. <hi>Hierome)</hi> there was <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Priests and the Levites;
for although this Argument be not necessary, yet because the
Wisdom of God is not to be parallel'd in Polity so well as Nature,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61847:61"/>
it should be reasonable for men to think, that where is no
Ground for a Difference in this second Church under the New
Testament, from that former under the Old, there God should
not vary in the Discipline; and, I think, no man can shew me a
reason for such a Difference: either that men are more united,
or that the Church doth require a lesse Union now, than then;
which two, as they are the heads from which we enforce Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
in that matter of Government: so they must be the heads
from which any strong Argument of force must be deduced, to
shew the difference. This being so, it is fit for us to Conceive,
(without strong reason against it) that there is such a Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
especially if to this be added the great uniformity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
that the Ancient Levitical Law had to our Ecclesiastical
(which might abundantly be shewed) in other things, without
some Language expressing a difference in a dubious Case, it were

                  <p>But then again, our Saviour in his life-time hatching a Church
<hi>in Embrione.</hi> He, as I have shewed, made two distinct Orders,
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and these both Preaching Orders,
without there were some main reason to the Contrary, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

as I have shewed, we ought not to seek for expresse Terms to
shew that they made a Law in such peremptory Words, That
this or this we enact perpetually for the Government of all
Churches, this or the like is not to be found any where, nor doth
any Government pretend to it. There is no Book unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

given to a Presbytery, which they can never do. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61847:62"/>
Let them Consider, it would be as safe, nay much safer,
for me to say, that power given to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> must be by
the Sole virtue of Association with the Supreame, as they can,
when I shew a Commission given to one Man, say it is meant of
him in the Company of others, and the more agreeing to sense;
because when this Commission is granted, it implyes at the least
that he must be of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> which to none others could be
enforced: And again, when we read such a Precept given to
any man, it must be understood, that he must have power to
execute that Authority, which certainly if he could only Act in
Commission with others, he could not; because suppose St.
<hi>Paul</hi> Chargeth him to Ordain Elders in every City, such, and
so qualified, he might answer, in many Cases the others will
not joyn. Suppose he should stop the mouths of Deceivers, It
is likely the great deceivers would be amongst the Presbytery
themselves; he can do nothing without their Consent, which is
nothing of himself; not he, but they therefore must have the
Charge given them; for he is not, by these men, capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it; and as for their Charge, it is no where given: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these reasons, I cannot see a possible Colour to avoid this
Text, but that <hi>Titus</hi> had such a Commission <hi>Episcopal,</hi> as <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi>
is taken with us.</p>

he could and should do it, <hi>Beza</hi> saith, he cannot do it not at all,

where <hi>Timothy</hi> is said to receive the power by the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

already, and God willing shall more hereafter; but
what is all this to the purpose? <hi>Timothy</hi> is Commanded, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could do it, yea, he is commanded not to do it suddenly;
therefore he could do it both wayes, leasurely and suddenly;
and he himself, in his Short Notes upon the same Text, saith, that

this, when a man is authorized to do any thing; or, Do it by

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61847:63"/>
From whence thus I discourse: <hi>Timothy</hi> was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Accusations against Presbyters, or not receiving, which
is a great piece of Judicial Authority; he was likewise Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively
to rebuke or correct Presbyters, in such sort, as if they
were Sinners, and Guilty of the Accusation laid to their Charge,
that others by their punishment might learn to avoyd their faults
Do these things sound like fellow Presbyters without a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Jurisdiction? Can one fellow Presbyter Censure another,
or he who is barely a Temporal Speaker or Mouth of the rest?
This seems to me as full as could be, how his Authority was not
like Presbyters, only over their flock, but like a Superiour
Shepherd over Inferiours.</p>
                  <p>But here, with some more Colour, in the Case of <hi>Timothy</hi>
they plead he was an <hi>Evangelist;</hi> because, 2 Tim. 4. 5. he is
bid <hi>do the Work of an Evangelist,</hi> and therefore, by the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
belonging to that Office, he might do these works of
Jurisdiction; surely, although he was bid <hi>do the work of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist;</hi>
yet that may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Evangelist</hi> is nothing but either a Writer or a Preacher of the

preach the Gospel: and I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nd one man among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
that makes <hi>Timothy</hi> an <hi>Evangelist</hi> by Office; but, I do find
St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. peremptorily saying, That both
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

among the Ancients, nay I may adde <hi>Beza</hi> himself, or <hi>Calvin,</hi> no
one man making it a part of an <hi>Evangelists</hi> Office either to give
<hi>Orders,</hi> or the power of <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi> But these later make them
a Subservient Office to the Apostles; and if we should allow that,
what more proper Service than that their name implies, to
preach the Gospel about with them, as they travelled? So that
it seems to me, that these Writers when they utter such Things,
being learned men some of them, and reasonable, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves with those Shadowes, but think to drive on
their Design with the people, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ication genuinely the same
sense with <hi>Apostle,</hi> and therefore may well be fitted to the same
Office; and as that was never applyed to any under a <hi>Bishop;</hi>
so neither this, as any man can shew me in the whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That it is a name likewise appropriated to Spirits sent
about Apostolical Employments, and endowed by God who
sends them with Apostolical Authority: So that then, whether
<hi>Angel</hi> be applyed to Spirits, or men, it will in both or either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Common sense to be understood, That these persons,
whether Spirits or bodies, have divine Authority to act those
things they are employed about: Now then, thus the word
being of such a sense, and no where otherwise understood, we
may from hence think it most reasonable, that this name should
be affixed to such men; nor do I find any man adventuring to
shew any place where this word doth lesse than signifie a
Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Then let us Consider, that they are called after in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter, <hi>The Angel of the Church of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>the Angel
of the Church of</hi> Smyrna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being great and populous
regions, could not reasonably but have many Presbyters in them,
and then to write to one <hi>Angel</hi> (if the name <hi>Angel</hi> did stoop so
low as <hi>Presbyter)</hi> were to write to no man knew whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there were so many there; but if <hi>Angel</hi> (as it is) be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of one in an higher and more exalted State than the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61847:64"/>
rest, who might be known by this name <hi>Angel,</hi> as peculiarly
due to him; then and then only we may understand who it is
that is meant by it; but if any man should allow nothing but
Scripture to prove so clear truth, and say there was but one
<hi>Presbyter</hi> in each of these Churches, he may find that Acts 20.
ver. 17, 18. St. <hi>Paul</hi> sent for the <hi>Presbyters</hi> (in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and when they were come to
him he said to them; still <hi>they and them,</hi> in the plural number.
That Text will require a further Examination perhaps hereafter.
In the mean time take this, because it is urged for a Unity of
Office <hi>betwixt a Bishop and a Presbyter,</hi> from the 28th verse;
where St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Take heed to your selves and to all the flock

then those that were called <hi>Presbyters</hi> before, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Bishops</hi> afterwards: I have often said before, that the name
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> I conceive to be taken promiscuously in
the New Testament for the same Office; That the word <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
was solely that name which was used, by the way of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to that Office, both to themselves who were originally such,
and to those who by their Appointment succeeded them; But
this is it I contend for, That amongst them which they made
their Successors, they gave to some of them a greater and fuller
power than to others, both to govern, and to ordain, which
since the Church hath called <hi>Bishops.</hi> Now then from hence,
whether there were many <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or
many Presbyters only, yet many there were, and these many
were so inferiour to one, that he is called the <hi>Angel,</hi> which name
was so appropriated to him, as he might know to whom the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was directed; or else, as if a Man should write a Letter, and
superscribe it, to the Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> where are many, no
man could know whither to send it, or who should receive it;
but if a man superscribe it to the Mayor, every man knows who
that is: Thus must it be with these, he to whom this Letter is
superscribed must have this <hi>Angelical Condition</hi> so fitted to him
that he must be known by that name, that name solely agreeing
to him. But some here offer at an Answer, That he might be
like a Mayor, have a superiour Dignity above the rest, such as
is notified by that name <hi>Angel,</hi> which yet may not make a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
such as we require. He may be a Temporary Governour
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61847:64"/>
such as the Presbyterian allows, a President of a Synod who
this year governs, but the next resig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s his place, and when he
is there he hath no more to do but regulate the Synod, no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Authority than the rest. To both these in their Order;
No Temporary <hi>Bishop</hi> or Superiour, I am Confident that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read of any such Thing, and therefore am perswaded, that
no man can shew me out of Ecclesiastical Story, that any man
was outed of his Bishoprick, but for Heresie, Schism or Gross
Impiety of Life; when men have grown, through old Age or
Infirmities, otherwise incapable of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xecuting their Office, they
have had Coadjutors and helpers in their Office, but not been
deposed, but by Death, or some such occasion as before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
and those that by Ecclesiastical Story were reckoned <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
of these places, at this time are recorded to dye <hi>Bishops.</hi>
And it seems a mighty Selfishnesse to me, that any man should
oppose his reasonlesse Conjectures against all Story, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
these Epistles cannot be expounded but by Story, as in
particular, the 13th verse of the 2d. Chapter, where speaking to
the <hi>Angel</hi> (or <hi>Bishop</hi> I may call him most Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idently) of the
Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> He commends him, <hi>because thou hast not
denyed my Faith, even in those days wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>was my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Martyr;</hi> If a man would ask what Commendation of his
Faith was this? What was the Excellency of it? Can any man
answer me but out of Ecclesiastical Story? where it is recorded,
that after a long and pious life full of all virtue led in <hi>Pergamus,</hi>
he was in the dayes of <hi>Domitian,</hi> for the Testimony of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
put into a brazen Bull, and in that Bull burnt: now then
this <hi>Bishops</hi> faith was Eminent, that in such a cruel and fiery
Tryal he kept his Integrity, even in such a Time when tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
horrid President of the death of <hi>Antipas</hi> was set before him.
Thus, I say, Ecclesiastical Story is necessary for the Exposition
of these Epistles, as you may find prophane Story necessary for
the Exposition of the Prophets in the Old Testament; for a man
then to talk of such an Officer, concerning which there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Word, nor any in Story, but a Poem, a fictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of
their own Imagination, is not like men that guided themselves
by Scripture, to undertake.</p>
                  <p>I close therefore with the 2d. Exception, which is, that their
Government was not such as is Episcopal; but only such as is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61847:65"/>
the president of a Synod, to direct the businesse, not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
more than others, and this certainly the frame of these
Letters doth Confute mightily, for they make the <hi>Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ls</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible
for the faults and heresies which were under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which they could not be, if they had only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Presidents, but not of <hi>Bishops;</hi> for a President of a
Synod hath no Coercive power in himself, but as conjoyned
with the rest of the Synod, and involved: Nor hath he any
particular Interest in the ruling or swaying the Affairs of the
Church, but is the mouth of the Synod; therefore, although if
he neglect his duty in the Synod he may well be censured for it;
yet he cannot have the faults of the Inferiour Clergy or people
layd to his Charge in particular: take one Instance in the 15th
verse of the 2d. Chapter; the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi>
is censured, because he had them <hi>which held the Doctrine of the</hi>
Nicholaitans, <hi>which Christ hates:</hi> Should any one ask why the
President should be Censured for these things; He could answer,
I am but one man, perhaps they can master me in the Synod, I
have nothing to do alone; but a <hi>Bishop</hi> who hath Coercive
power, and can both examine and censure any who are in his
Diocesse, he may be punished, because he did not oversee the
flock of Christ, over which the Holy Ghost had made him a
Ruler.</p>
                  <p>And now here again discern the necessity of Ecclesiastical
Story, to expound this Scripture; What, can any man tell, is
<hi>the Doctrine of the</hi> Nicholaitans <hi>which God hates,</hi> and so we
ought to hate, but by Ecclesiastical Story? which sets it down
to be as well in the Error of Opinion, the Doctrine concerning
the Creation, that it was not by God; as likewise that of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
that it was lawfull to have Wives in Common; now by
Ecclesiastical Story we are taught, that these things were the
<hi>Nicholaitans</hi> Opinions, and these are they which God abhorrs.
And now Consider, what fault would it be in the <hi>Angel,</hi> that
these things were he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in his Church, but that he had Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rcive
Authority to Command, and hinder the proceedings of these
Opinions.</p>
                  <p>A Third Exception is, That these Epistles were written to
the <hi>Angels,</hi> the Presidents, but by Name, but to the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
by Intention: so that although he direct his Epistle but to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61847:65"/>
one, yet it is intended unto all; as when a man should send a
Letter to the Speaker which is to be read in Parliament. But
this is Confuted in the Text most evidently, because all these
things that are Commended or censured in any of these Epistles,
are in the singular number: so Chap. 2. vers. 2. <hi>I know thy works
and thy labour, &amp;c. thy,</hi> in the singular number, and so in the
rest; now if he had meant it to the whole Synod, although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the President, it would have been <hi>your works;</hi> nor
could the Speech be proper to say <hi>thy works,</hi> when the whole
body was intended; nay it is not imaginable, that those eminent
virtues with which he and the other Bishops are honoured should
appertain to the whole Assembly or Synod of them: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the fault he condemns that <hi>Angel</hi> of, vers. 4. that he
should <hi>forsake his first love,</hi> is not likely to be affirmed of the
Synod; so it is most remarkable in the Epistle to the Bishop of
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> vers. 10. when he speaks of the rest, he changeth his
phrase, <hi>The Devil shall cast some of you into prison,</hi> and the like;
So likewise to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> vers. 24.
<hi>To you I say and unto the rest in</hi> Thyatira, <hi>as many as have not
this Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> Here it is evident, that when the Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
others, he advertiseth the <hi>Bishop</hi> to acquaint them with it,
and he changeth his manner of Speech, that notice may be taken
what was personal to him, and what to others. Thus you see
with how much wit, and with what shuffling the Intention of
these Scriptures hath been diverted, but to little purpose, among
such as Consider and weigh them.</p>

                  <p>I have put down his very words, and do intend (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
to handle all these Questions; but because he seems to me
to follow an unjust method, I shall begin with his Third Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
To shew what that <hi>Ordination</hi> is of which we dispute; for
till that be Cleared, we dispute <hi>de non Concessis,</hi> as he doth in this
Discourse. I will first examine his Definition, because I will not
multiply unnecessary Contentions. He defines it thus.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II. His Definition of Ordination confuted.</head>
                  <p>ORdination is an Approbation of the Officer, and Solemn set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Confirmation of him in his Office by Prayer, and
laying on of hands.</p>
                  <p>In this Definition, that which I can blame, is, first that which
he makes the <hi>Genus,</hi> to wit, an Approbation of the Officer. This
is a prevenient Circumstance, not an Essential part Constituting
<hi>Ordination;</hi> First, men are Approved, then Ordained; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he calls it a Description not a Definition, which phrase
abides a larger sense than Definition doth; yet even there this
Term is faulty, for it must be a Description of <hi>Ordination</hi> of
which this is no part, no more than many other Circumstances
belonging to it. Again, where he saith it is a <hi>Setling and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
him in his Office.</hi> If by Office he Conceive a particular
Congregation, as by his whole discourse he seems to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then
that is not large enough to contain that Act which it is directed
to; for men may, yea must be Ordained before they are setled
in particular Congregations: So that as his <hi>Genus,</hi> Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61847:66"/>
on, precedes Ordination, so setling thus in his Office, is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to it; last of all, the whole Description is too wide for
the Thing described. He takes setling in his Office in that
sense I have shewed, for it agrees to the Mission of <hi>Barnabas</hi>
and <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 13. 2, 3. who were ordained before, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
after, and is yielded elsewhere by him. This Description
of his is page 75. where before.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III. My Definition set down and explained.</head>
                  <p>HIS Definition being thus briefly perused, now take mine.
<hi>Ordination is an Act by which some Man is Constituted in
some Ecclesiastick Order of Divine Institution.</hi> This I conceive
to be a Logical Definition, for Definitions should be as short as
may be, so they be full, and explain the nature of the Thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.
The <hi>Genus</hi> is an Act in General which agrees to it, and
diverse others; The Object of this Act is a Man; the Immediate
Effect and End it Aims at is the Constitution of an Ecclesiastical
Order; the Explication of which will be the Chief businesse to
understand the whole Definition: Order is the disposition of
things either accor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing to their place or time; For time, as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
to day, Order disposeth when it should be done, or in
place, before, behind, at the right hand or the left, above, below;
Now because there are many degrees in Church Affairs, where
one is above or below another; therefore, when any man is put
into any degree of these, this is called a Church Order; that
which hath no degrees, but is where it was, is the lay sort of
men; These are (as we speak in Logick) of <hi>Individuums,</hi> they
are not <hi>in serie praedicamentali.</hi> Now therefore it is said Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Order, because there are Orders which are not Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as Kings, Judges, &amp;c. where there is a <hi>sub &amp; supra</hi> in the
Common-wealth, but belong not to our businesse. Again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are many Ecclesiastick Orders in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which are not truly such; but only additions of human Invention,
according as their Church fancyed would conduce to the <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
of Gods Service, I adde this Term of Divine Institution,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61847:67"/>
which must be understood of divine Apostolical constitution, and
then it may again be put in these Prases, that <hi>Ordination is an
Act by which a Man is Constituted a Minister,</hi> as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Treatise the Minister is defined, for the Man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
and the Minister before will be all one. And so now
the nature of Ordination being explained, I shall encounter
with <hi>Hooker</hi> in his first Question, <hi>Whether Ordination is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before Election?</hi>
                  </p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IV. Ordination is not before Election.</head>
                  <p>IN answering this Question, we shall agree to say, No, it is not
before Election; nor surely can it possibly be: for a Man must
be elected and chosen, as fit to be ordained, before he is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But because Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> as he expresseth it, page 39,
doth conceive this Election belongs to the People, and that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
is like the making of a King, the Election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
like the giving and appropriating this ring to the finger, by
choosing this man to this place, which <hi>Hooker</hi> opposeth; I shall
quit my self from <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and then apply my self to <hi>Hooker:</hi>
I say therefore, that first a man must be chosen, before he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
a Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yter; but it is not necessary he should be Chosen
by the people, there is no semblance of any such Thing in the
Scripture; nor indeed do <hi>Rutherford</hi> or <hi>Hooker</hi> exact it, but out
of his mistake, That they suppose no man should be made a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
which should not at that instant or before be Elected to
some benefice of the which the people should be Electors.</p>

the People.</head>
                  <p>NOW the Contrary is most apparent in some Case; As
suppose Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> were adjudged fit
men for the Conversion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> they had need be sent
with Presbyterial A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thority, for else they could not have right
Authority to admit Converted men into Christs Church, but
the people to whom they were sent could not choose them, these
men must be ordained Presbyters before they are sent, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
before Ordained, but not by the people to whom they
are sent, or the people, that is, the Commonalty from whom
they are sent, who are not Capable to discern the fitnesse for
such a Work; but their Drift is, the people over whom they
are to Pastorize. Thus then it is evident, that in some Cases Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Congregation or Church over which a Presbyter is
put, cannot alwayes precede his Ordination.</p>
                  <p>But suppose again, a Company of Christians whose Presbyter
is dead, in many Cases they may elect one to be ordained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is ordained; and in many cases they may elect one to this
Charge after he is ordained, (supposing that the power of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

without Exception; As suppose his or Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Church, or if Elected, must he have another Ordination? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he will not say so; Well then, in this Question the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

Commend the Ingenuity of the man; for it is evident out of the

his Arguments inforce no more but the presence of the people;

the old was dead, and adhered to whom they would when he
was alive, unlesse the Emperor interposed, as oft he did, or some
Council Provincial, which likewise was used; but for Divine
right, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh of nothing, but <hi>plebe praesente,</hi> they
were chosen in the presence of the people, but to the Benefice,
whether Bishoprick or Parsonage, the Electors have been various
in all Ages, and may be so; there being nothing determined,
by Apostolical Constitution, or practise; yet there is nothing
in all this that shews that Election to a Benefice must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ordination, not the least word, but rather after; for if it
lies in the people to elect a worthy Priest (I so translate <hi>Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos)</hi>
to his Benefice, then he must be a worthy Priest before:
for else it should be, they should elect a Worthy man to be
Priest, not elect a Worthy Priest to a Benefice, of which St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> seems to speak, and which is his Aym; for his other
Quotations, they are of such men as are of little use with me, or
with any their Adversaries; and therefore I trouble not my
self to examine them.</p>

2dly. It was to such an Office which might easily fall under the
Cognizance of the people, to wit, the Caring for the poor, and
they might better discern the sufficiency of men for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
than the Apostles themselves; First then we see here falls
to the Ground, that if the people had this liberty in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Officer, there was much greater reason they should have
it in an Officer of higher degree, in whom they had greater
Interest, and by whose administration they were to receive grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
good. This follows not, for this Office was of such a
Thing as they might best know, the Integrity of those men
with whom they Conversed; but the other, of an higher nature,
they could not be Judges of so well: and therefore there is a
diverse Case, the people may be fit to choose a Collector for the
Poor, a Tithing-man, but can they be fit to choose a Judge? And
indeed it favours of an high presumption, which his delight in
this Conceit transports him with, when he saith, as he doth in
that page, That the liberty of the Apostles in ordaining was not
so great, as the peoples in choosing; when the Apostles had all
Divine Authority from Christ solely delegated to them, and the
Apostles did not only ordain these men but their very Office it
self. I may adde to this, that the people in this inferiour office
did not <hi>authoritativè</hi> of themselves choose these, but by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
direction and command from the Apostles. I have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as I conceive, all that he speaks concerning his first Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether Ordination or Election be first? He Conceives it
not much material; and therefore concludes, the proof of this
will appear in the Explication of the other particulars, which he
undertakes, and I will follow him.</p>

                        <hi>COncerning the first of these, he makes his first Conclusion
thus;</hi> There is a Causal virtue put forth in a Subordinate
way by some under Christ, to bring the formality or specifical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Ecclesiastical Office to a person or party that is Called
thereunto, or stands possessed thereof.</p>
                     <p>Alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what mighty words are these, and how easily might the
businesse of this Proposition have been expressed to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of any Reader, if he had said, there is some power under
Christ to Constitute Ecclesiastical Officers; there is no need of
such high and difficult Terms of Causal virtue, Formality, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
being, which do amuse a weak Capacity, and no way
satisfie an Intelligent.</p>
                     <p>The Drift of his Conclusion is to prove, that there is an
outward Call necessary to a Minister, which, he saith, is by none
denyed, but by Anabaptists and Familists, which folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
labours (as he saith) with the loathsomnesse of it self: so
he contemns them, but truly they are now grown a Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

I am considen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they cannot justly; and indeed I grant this whole
Conclusion, and let alone his proofs of it. But yet because he
placeth a necessity upon it as surely is Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the necessity be not required out of the part of such as are

not lawfully called, (to use his own phrase;) but then why doth
he despise the Bishops Seal and Parchment in a Box, as he speaks

Explication of it, which he hath omitted; there is a physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cause, and a Moral Cause. This word Cause at the first
reading sounds like a Physical Operation; and although in
his second Conclusion he addes this Term, Instrument or means,
yet that is not to be allowed in a physical notion; for these pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in men have no physical influx into these Effects, no not as
Instruments; for, as the Philosophers speak, an Instrument hath
its particular work in the Effect: so a knife or axe, which be
both Instruments, have their several wayes of Operation, though
used by the same hand, and do their work according to their
particular and proper dispositions; but now these Agents have
no Influence on the Subject, but only as moral Instruments; as
a hand and feal have no physical Nature to pay a Debt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a moral force, which is granted it by the Law of the Realm;
and from thence it hath this moral force, not a physical. Of this
nature I conceive this power granted to men to give Orders, and
it is founded upon that great Commission; <hi>As my Father sent
me, so send I you,</hi> with that Authority to grant powers to other
men; so that the powers, the Authority granted by them, are
Confirmed by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they having a moral Causality to do such
Things which God will Confirm, but they working not so much
as Instrumentally any physical Effect. Thus the Conclusion
being explained, I grant it, but in his handling of it, many things
deserve Censure; for although he bragg at the Top of the 44th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Page, that he will lend such help to the weakest Reader, that he
may lay his finger upon the several Things; yet indeed he is
mightily perplexed and intricate, which I passe, and granting
his Conclusion, will not disturb his manner of handling it, only
repeate what he saith at the bottom of the 45 page, <hi>whoever in
a Compleat way hath received this outward Call, he is then a
Compleat and true Officer, and may act any part of his Office,
though not inwardly graced or fitted worthy of such a place or
Work by God;</hi> this I put down, lest he may start from it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and so will passe it over, and proceed with the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctnesse
to his second Conclusion, which is p. 48. and is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is an Act of power as an Instrument or means under Christ
to give an Officer the being of an outward Call in the Church.</hi>

the essential of this power may be Conveyed?</p>

Essence of this outward Call.</p>
                  <p>In the handling this Conclusion, there are two thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
upon; First, to shew that the Prelatical party are Popishly
affected in this Doctrine; 2dly, to dispute against the Indelible
Character: for the first, he draws it from the Answer in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism
which is in the Book of Common Prayer, where it is
said, <hi>that there are only two Sacraments as generally necessary to
Salvation,</hi> not as he puts it down, two only Absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Salvation, and then glosses on it, <hi>q.d.</hi> there are more,
and those necessary, but not absolutely necessary. These are
his words, which you see is a false Quotation; But because that
ever-to-be-honoured Book the Common Prayer is named, I will
first vindicate that, and then proceed: Know then, It is the
first time that ever read the Prelatical party accused under that
Notion, that the Common-Prayer Book held the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because it was the most Authentique piece
which expressed the Doctrine and Religion of the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> 2ly. Let the Reader observe, that this word Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a Term not found in the New Testament, but an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Term taken up by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>athers, and used by all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
for that thing which is Ordinarily defined, <hi>a visible sign of
an invisible and spiritual Grace;</hi> Now if that have the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Word Sacrament expresseth, then Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
cannot deny Orders to be a Sacrament, because he grants an
outward Call to be necessary, which is an outward Sign, and he
grants the Effect of that Call to be the Order given by it, which
is an Invisible grace, as Grace is taken largely for <hi>Gratia gratis
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61847:71"/>
data;</hi> and yet the Common Prayer Book is most true, which
saith, there are two only generally necessary, that is, to all men;
for Orders are not generally necessary to all men, as Baptism
and the Lords Supper are, but only to such persons as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
such Duties. Let this suffice to have been spoken to that
which he unnecessarily to his businesse or mine inserted.</p>

that he and they speak of, is the relict of that gift of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which the Ordained is enabled to do these Duties he is
ordained to. Now that there is some such Thing he must needs
confesse, who discourseth of the Causation of these Essentials,
which imports an Effect, and certainly this Effect must be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
remain in the Ordained, or else he hath nothing in him
which should Authorize and enable him for those duties. Now
then, it is in vain for him to fustian the Reader with the various
opinions of the School; whether this Effect be a Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lity or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and such unnecessary Discourse, unlesse he could shew what
it is, if not one of these, since he holds that it is somwhat, &amp; I must
needs say, that the worst of those Writers hath done better than
he, because those Authors have expressed something with a
guesse of reason to it, but he without reason to the contrary
laughs at them all, and yet hath said so much as invincibly proves
there is a Character, but not said what. If it were pertinent to
his or my Discourse, I would insist upon it, but although he is
Tedious in such impertinencies, I will not follow him in them,
it is enough that there is a Character, something left in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a man, (perhaps that is a righter phrase, than to say in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soul, or Understanding, or Will, unlesse for <hi>subjectum quo.)</hi>
But something there is left by that Act of Ordination, by which
that man in whom it is left is capable to do those Divine duties,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61847:71"/>
whether this be delible or not, is not yet material to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;

When <hi>(saith he)</hi> the reason is the same in both, and stronger in
Presbyters, because the people have a greater dependance upon the
other, and are engaged to greater subjection to them, and to provide
for their honour in a more especial manner.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Arguing forceth me to a repetition: Conceive

choose such as should be their Judges in Spiritual Things, and

against himself, which he saith is ordinarily in the mouth of the
Prelates, and indeed deserves to be likewise in their heart, Tit. 1.

which according to these men should be the Electors of their
Elders, durst assemble together in places where the persecutors
were powerfull; without an uproar this could not be imagined;
and therefore no other Election can be understood, but that of
the Apostles, that they chose whom they thought hittest, and
dismissed them to their Parishes; and yet I am confident that
<hi>Geneva</hi> reading cannot be enforced out of the Original, as I
shall more largely discourse elsewhere, God willing; and if that
reading were true, yet you see what Election must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
for although if these Apostles <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had
been in quiet places, and Ordained these men for those quiet

follows in a Moral necessity, that this Election was made by the
Apostles, and not by those Churches, who could not there be

Duty; and herein observe a strange license of expounding
Scripture, to abuse a cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I reply, there is no rule of Christ given, which saith so, he

                  <p>HIS Second Argument in the bottom of Page 52. is thus
framed: <hi>It is not the scope of Ordination, by God appointed,
to give the Essentials of an Officers call; therefore from thence it
is not to be expected in an Orderly way.</hi> He supposeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
undeniable, and therefore undertakes only the proof
of the antecedent, for which he Cyphers out that place, 1 Tim.
4. 14. <hi>Neglect not the Gift which is in thee, which was given
thee by prophesy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</hi>
out of this he would prove his Conclusion; he therefore <hi>in the
fear of God</hi> (as he speaks) addresseth himself to the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of three things.</p>
                  <p>What the gift is here said to be in <hi>Timothy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly. How it was given by Prophesy?</p>
                  <p>3ly. What the laying on of the hands of the Elders was, and
why used? In the search of which he spends many pages, page
54. he begins, and ends page 59. I will draw the summe of
what he saith; For the first <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, rendered <hi>Gift,</hi> he after
Discourse of diverse acceptations, conceives page 55. <hi>That those
spiritual Graces and abilities with which</hi> Timothy <hi>was enabled to
do his great work of his supposed Evangelizing are meant;</hi> but
before I go further, here he Contradicts himself; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of page 26. where he produceth this and this only place to
prove that Ordination is the work of the whole Presbytery; but
here he distinguisheth the Abilities from the Office, as Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
Expositions.</p>
                  <p>For the 2d. Term, what was meant by <hi>(given by Prophesy)</hi> he
first discourseth impertinently of the Office of an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> to
shew it was extraordinary; yet sometimes given by means, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of, which hath any foundation in Scripture: That he saith,
<hi>Philip</hi> was made an <hi>Evangelist</hi> immediately, without the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of man, hath no one word of Scripture for it, but only
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. where he is called <hi>an Evangelist,</hi> but not described
which way Authorized, either immediately or mediately. For
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61847:73"/>
the 2d. That one should be made an <hi>Evangelist</hi> by the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, he produceth this Text, where there is no word of
Scripture nor Exposition of any Antiquity, which saith, That
he was by this Ordination made an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> but Antiquity,
<hi>Theophylact,</hi> and abundance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> say Bishop. Again, he confesseth it,
against his own Exposition of this word <hi>Gift,</hi> which before was
only Ability, but now must be both Ability and Office: so hard a
thing is it for Error to be constant, and to raise a strong building
upon a tottering foundation. Then he proceeds, which is most
pertinent to his intent, to shew what is meant by <hi>Prophesy;</hi> and
concludes, pag. 57. that <hi>Prophesy</hi> is taken here for a <hi>dictate of
the Spirit to the Apostle to ordain</hi> Timothy. I will not oppose
this, as not prejudicial to this cause. Then he comes to his 3d.
Term, <hi>Eldership</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which he saith, <hi>notes not the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but Officers;</hi> I will yield it, although unconstrained to it:
Then he sayes, <hi>that this Imposition of hands added not to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of</hi> Timothy <hi>his Office,</hi> gave not essentials thereunto, but
only a solemn Approbation: I will yield it, but not his reasons;
that <hi>which was</hi> (saith he) <hi>beyond the power of the Presbytery,</hi>
that they could not communicate; but to give the Essentials to
<hi>Timothies</hi> place was beyond the power and place of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
where can he read that? He proves it, because his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was extraordinary, and theirs Ordinary: by this Office ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
he intends an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> I suppose, which he cannot
prove to be an Extraordinary Office. Much inconstancy is in
this Discourse, just now he brought this Instance, to prove that
an <hi>Evangelist</hi> might be called by the mediation of Men, now
he is above their reach; and then his second reason confounds
this; For, he saith, he hath proved, that an Office was not
meant by this, but by <hi>Gift</hi> was meant an Ability to do it. A
strange uncouth way of Argument. He concludes, pag. 58.
<hi>the outward gifting and fitting an Officer to his place, especially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
as beyond the power and place of a Presbytery.</hi> But
the first is here.</p>
                  <p>This is most fearfull incongruous stuff to abuse Readers with;
Who can but guesse by his unusual language there is something
in it, but he cannot tell what. Who can tell what that is which
he calls the outward gifting and sitting an Officer for his Call?
I thought this <hi>Gift</hi> here spoken of had been an Inward (as he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61847:74"/>
calls it elsewhere a gracious endowment of the soul) which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him to serve God in his Bishoprick, which <hi>Gift</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> describes, not an outward thing,
nor can any man imagine what that outward thing should be.
Then he draws this Conclusion, that the sense of the place is,
<hi>Despise not those gracious Qualifications which God by his Spirit
in the Extraordinary way of Prophesy hath furnished, and betrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee withall, the laying on of the hands of the Eldership by way
of Consent and approbation concurring therewith, to thy farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and Confirmation in this work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now suppose all this were true, will this prove, that the scope
of Ordination by Gods appointment, is not to give the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of an Officers Call, which was his antecede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to be Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from this Text, there is no manner of Coherence betwixt
these two Propositions; suppose this were not an Ordination of
<hi>Timothy</hi> to an Office, yet doth this prove that the word of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. <hi>By the laying on of my hands,</hi> mark the
phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as I before observed, and indeed he now observes
out of <hi>Didoclavius;</hi> (although I wonder what use they can
make of it against us, though perhaps it may be of force against
Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Presbyterian Ordination.) I say, all this doth
not prove, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not ordained by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> laying
on of his hands; or if it did, doth it prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not
ordained at all, because we do not read of it? Or, that he could
not ordain without a Prae-election of some Congregation to
a Cure, when he is Commanded, 1 Tim. 5. 22. <hi>not to lay hands
suddenly on any?</hi> These things are all silently passed over, and the
inference from the Tedious vaunting Discourse can be nothing
to this purpose: whosoever will read it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t large, with these notes,
must needs loath it as unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>His Inferences pag. 59. are without all relation to the former
Discourse; <hi>Hence it is plain</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Ordination therefore
prae-supposeth an Officer Constituted, doth not Constitute.</hi> The rest
are like this, in which there is no manner of Dependance betwixt
the Antecedent and the Consequent: So that I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that a man of so fine words could have so little reason, but
that these things were fragments found in his Study, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into this place.</p>

                     <hi>HIS third Argument, is,</hi> That action which is Common to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and performances, or imployments, and applyed to them,
when there is no Office at all given; that Action cannot properly be
called a Specificating Act to make an Officer, or give him a Call.</p>
                  <p>But the Act of Imposition of hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is applyed to persons and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
as special Occasion is offered, when there is no Office
given, nor intended; therefore it is not an Act which gives in the
Essentials to an Officer.</p>
                  <p>Consider, in this Argument, how it never enforceth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
which he is to prove. His Conclusion is this, <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Call of a Minister.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now instead of <hi>Ordination</hi> he brings in only an outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
which is Imposition of hands; as if a man disputing of
the efficacy of the Lords Supper, should say, other men may
take bread and bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k it which do not Communicate; for such,
and such only is the force of his Argument, Imposition of hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
is used in such Acts where Orders are not given; therefore the
Essentials are not given by the Imposition of hands. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this therefore, Conceive, That Imposition of hands may be
and hath been used in Apostolical Times, for other purposes than
this, for Confirmation; and in that instance he gives, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1,

Now although Imposition of hands be sometimes taken for
that most holy Rite which we call Confirmation, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17.

upon which particular he should look, and breaking

sometimes used in Scripture for the Communion: so likewise
Imposition of hands, which is used in other duties, is sometimes

Offices. I can well suppose a mighty great flock which requires

of every <hi>Apostle</hi> in all the whole Catholick Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually,
not actually, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61847:76"/>
                     <hi>Apostolical Man</hi> as they call him, <hi>the Pope,</hi> and all this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for them as <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is, men sent for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel, to the planting and confirming of Churches,
other powers they had of Languages, of Miracles, which were
necessary to the first plantation, but no longer; and therefore
they were not peculiar to them, but others had them besides,
as likewise that mighty power of being Inspired to write Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which did not appear in all of them; and some others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
them had that power, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Marke;</hi> and some
think St. <hi>James</hi> to be the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> who writ that
Epistle.</p>
                  <p>But now of those which were the <hi>Apostles,</hi> it is evident that
these <hi>Gifts</hi> were not <hi>Apostolical,</hi> as belonging so to them as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and it will appear in the other Cause, That the <hi>Bishops</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them in every thing that was <hi>Apostolical,</hi> although not in
these extraordinary Endowments, for the <hi>Apostolical</hi> power of
planting, setling Churches, of propagating the Gospel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World, and enlarging the Kingdom of Christ,
must remain for ever, and therefore, though the manner of
doing it by such Signs and Wonders be not communicated, yet
the Office must; and therefore he who is a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi>
by divine right, is such throughout the whole Word; to this
purpose you may observe in that famous place of <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.
so much and so often canvased by them who handle these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in other points, but not thought on in this, you may
observe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to divers <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi>
(which you will) he saith, <hi>Take heed therefore to your selves, and
to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers
or Bishops, to feed the Church of God which he purchased with his
own blood.</hi> Observe here that he spake to many, and diverse
<hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> (I stand not upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke to
them in the plural Number; but when he speaks of the flock
they were to <hi>pastorize</hi> over, he puts it in the singular Number;
now if the Holy Gho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> had made them <hi>Bishops</hi> of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
only, it must have been the flock, every one his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral;
but being all made Pastors of the Catholick Church, he
names it one flock; and so likewise to feed or Sheperdiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> over,
not the Churches but the Church of Christ, which indeed
were no way congruous, if the Holy Ghost had made them
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61847:76"/>
Officers of particular Churches, and confined them there, but
making them Officers of the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> which Christ
had purchased with his blood, and all Officers of that, it is
rightly put in the singular number flock, and Church. This
likewise the Holy Ghost intimates, every where describing the
Church to us by the name of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ield, a Vineyard, a City, and
multitudes of such Expressions, which as much as this of a flock
intimate the unity of that Body, which is his Church, his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lock,
over which these are <hi>Pastors</hi> in their several wayes, not only
their little Congregations. Now the wisdom of the Church,
finding that although the potential and habitual power is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
yet the actual cannot be exercised further than where
they have some manner of residence, hath therefore restrained
the execution of it in other places than where they have that
residence, both to avoid Confusion, which otherwise must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
arise out of the Intermedling in other mens precincts,
and likewise because the main scope of their endeavours may be
applyed to that place in a near Obligation, every one being
for the most part worthy of the Incumbents utmost labour.
And this they did by the <hi>Apostles</hi> own example, who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Timothy, Titus, Epaphroditus,</hi> their several Diocesse; yet
we must further Concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, that this Alotment of the Church is
not such as doth lay any restraint upon the power given by the
Spiris, but directs it only; for although a Particular man may
offend by intruding into another mans Pastoral precincts, and
Officiating there, yet <hi>factum valet:</hi> so that if a <hi>Bishop</hi> give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in another mans Diocesse, as was the famous Case of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in St. <hi>Chrysostoms Diccesse</hi> at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
or a <hi>Presbyter</hi> Administer the Communion in anothers
Parish, which is the common practice; these things although
done without leave from the peculiar <hi>Pastor,</hi> are valid to the
receivers, although punishable in the Actors: Yea, yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
although a man be placed in a Pastoral Charge, and shall
either find upon his own certain experience, or the Judgement of
his Superiours, that he can advance the Glory of God, or improve
his own Commission by removing to another place, either for
a time, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the rest beneficed in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
places, were yet upon urgencies of the publick good called
aside from the more particular Charge to the more publick,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61847:77"/>
where they were employed; or else, if their whole residence
may more advance the general Good of the whole Flock, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which they are made Overseers, they ought to remove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
to that great Occasion: So when a man of great Abilities
shall be beneficed in a private Corner, where perhaps lesse Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
would as well, if not better agree, it becomes him to be
removed to a place better befitting his Qualifications, or a man
indowed with the strength of rational Divinity, such a man to
be sent to the propagating the Gospel in the <hi>Indies</hi> among the
Heathen, and he ought to endeavour to put himself into such an
employment; because he is a <hi>Pastor</hi> of the whole flock for
which Christ dyed: So that now I think it appears manifestly,
that an <hi>Apostle</hi> and another <hi>Pastor</hi> differ not in this, that one
was an Universal <hi>Pastor,</hi> and the other a Particular; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise
they are both <hi>habitually,</hi> or <hi>Potentià, Pastors</hi> of the
whole Word, actually pastorizing in some particular only.
This caused all those admonitions from one <hi>Bishop</hi> to another,
of which the Fathers are full; This made sometimes Contentions;
because it was the Duty of every man that was a Pastor to take
care of the whole flock he is Pastor over; and therefore to
endeavour their good: So that here you see his Argument
fully answered by a flat denial of his Minor, <hi>he is not a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
without a Flock, nor an Officer</hi> sine Titulo, he hath Title
to the whole Catholick Church, he is <hi>Pastor</hi> at large; He hath
a long Dispute with Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> about Preaching and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
the Communion out of his own Congregation, and
the Communication of Sister Churches, which touch me not; yet
I will give the Reader a Note, that whereas before he made
Preaching almost the whole Act of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> he now seemes to
make it no proper duty of a <hi>Pastor,</hi> pag. 63, 64. But I let these
things passe as not pertinent, and apply my self to his fifth and
last Argument, pag. 67. which is.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XV. His Fifth Argument answered.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IF Ordination gives Essentials to a Pastor before Election, then
by that alone he hath Pastoral power.</hi> Against which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
thus, <hi>He that hath Compleat power of an Office, and stands
an Officer without Exception, he cannot be hindred Justly from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Acts of that Office; but this is the Condition of a Pastor.
Ordained without the Election of the people, he may according to
rule be justly hindred from Executing any Act of a Pastor.</hi> I
could quarrel, were I pinched with this Argument, with almost
every word; as first, the changing of the Terms of that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
he was to prove. In the Proposition he was to prove the
Terms were, <hi>give the Essentials of a Pastor,</hi> now they are, <hi>a
Compleat power and an Officer without Exception.</hi> Many things
are essentially right which lack Completion, and are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exception: Then again, where it was in his first Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>A Pastor before Election;</hi> here is added in his second,
<hi>Election of the people.</hi> But I insist upon this, upon which the
Ground of his Argument is founded, That an Ordained Officer
may according to rule be hindred from executing any part of his
Office, as he enforceth: Suppose all Congregations full. To
which I answer, Ordination doth not give the <hi>Act,</hi> but the
<hi>Jus,</hi> or <hi>right</hi> to execute, and a man may have the Essentials
when these do not work: Mark, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was a Pastor when
asleep, and had the Essentials of it, but not the Operation: Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
do work their proper work, <hi>omnibus positis ad agendum
requisitis:</hi> The fire it self, although it have the Essentials of sire,
cannot burn things too remote, or such Things which are not
combustible; the reason is, that those things which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to burning, as fit distance, disposure of the matter, are not
rightly disposed; I may say the same of the Eye; Place the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
too near, too far, in the dark, it cannot see; the requisites
to sight are not sittingly disposed, although the Eye have all the
Essentials belonging to sight: So I may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay of a man Ordained,
If there be not a place, not any piece of the flock of Christ which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61847:78"/>
hath need of him, or having need he knoweth not of their
need, or knowing their need, cannot by distance, or some such
moral Impediment come to supply then need, the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
required to his Operations are so taken away that he cannot
do the Duties in Act which he hath power to do. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
himself could not officiate any where where others of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were labouring, yet he had Authority and was ordained by
God; but saith he, <hi>if all places are full, he may according to rule,
be hindred from executing any part of Pastoral Office,</hi> I would fain
know by what rule the <hi>Apostles</hi> were Authorized by Christ to
preach to all Nations, and so are all <hi>Pastors</hi> by Ordination, they
have Authority over the world, but are restrained by Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Law founded upon the Law of Nature, which forbids any
thing to go into a full place, which with another Law saith, <hi>Deus
&amp; Natura nihil faciunt frustra.</hi> And again, <hi>non sunt multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candae
Entia sine necessitate:</hi> so that when one looks to this part,
then the other should not intermeddle without the first give way
to him, yet he hath the power and can do the work of a <hi>Pastor,</hi>
when any place is empty, and he invited to it; But yet Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with me, he doth not only build who layes on the bricks,
and mortar, or timber, but he who brings these Materials, and
helps to make the mortar; yea chiefly he who steers the work,
and directs this or that way: So is it in building this House, this
City of God, his Church. The Builders may study to provide
Materials for it, and improve their Abilities by Study in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities,
and if they are not called thence may live there, and
write such Things as may direct the Workers in this Building,
and by that rather build than they; however they have such a
power as may be reduced into Act, when all Circumstances are
fit, which is enough to give the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssentials to an Officer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus you see an Answer to his Arguments out of this
Discourse, Conceive it applyed to that Proposition,</hi> He that hath
Compleat power of an Office and stands an Officer without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
cannot justly be hindred from doing all parts of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                  <p>This should have been, who hath the Essentials of an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
as I said before; but let it run as it doth, I deny it slatly in
these Terms, <hi>Ab Actu ad potentiam non valet Argumentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativè,</hi>
he can be hindred from working, therefore he hath not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61847:78"/>
the power, doth not follow; when a man sleeps he is hindred,
and that justly, from working, yet is a <hi>Pastor;</hi> it is true, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
it is true in Moralty, that which hath essentially the power
of working may be hindred in nature, you may put the light
out of your Chamber, which essentially hath power to enlighten
it. In morality, he who hath the virtue of Valour in a gallant
and high portion, I speak of Active valour, of Military valour, as
suppose our Saviour himself, of whom this Question is disputed
in the School, he had all virtues in the highest degree, and yet
for lack of Opportunity to use this virtue, did never produce an
Act of this virtue. In policy the same, We have in <hi>England</hi>
many Barresters, learned men in the Law, yea perhaps as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as any Pleaders, who by their degree of Barresters have
power to plead in any Cause at any Barr, yet because not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Clients, do not plead, yea cannot plead, are justly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from pleading; the same footsteps of that Axiom are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in all Practique businesses: so that that Consequence, he
may be hindred from working, therefore he hath not the power
to work, is very weak, when the hindrance is without;
but if it be within that <hi>omnibus positis ad agendum requisitis</hi> in
outward Accommodations. If then he cannot do his pastoral
Duties, then it is an Argument he is no Pastor; but his Case is
otherwise; I say again, he who is a Bishop or Presbyter may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
to the flock of Christ any where throughout the World,
when places are voyd, and opportunities given, otherwise
not.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see I have enlarged my self upon this Conclusion,
which being little spoke of by others, required more discourse,
and I hope not impertinent.</p>
                  <p>He saith now, <hi>that he hath finished the negative part of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
What it is doth not give the Essentials of the Call of a
Pastor;</hi> and I think I have shewed he hath prevailed little in this,
because he builds upon that false foundation, That a <hi>Pastor must
have a particular flock.</hi> Then he comes to the positive and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
part, to shew what doth give the Essentials, pag. 66. which
I find is false printed, and should be pag. 67. as the former 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>HIS Conclusion is,</hi> Election of the people rightly ordered by
the rule of Christ, gives the Essentials to an Officer, or leaves
the Impression of a true outward Call, and so an Office, power
upon a Pastor.</p>
                  <p>This is the Proposition he undertakes to prove; and here I
expected an explication of his Terms, especially of that, what
he means by <hi>leaves an Impression;</hi> for since he before had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the <hi>Schools</hi> for treating of an <hi>Indelible Character,</hi> not only
for making it indelible, but for making it a Character, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
both its being quality or relation; I did justly expect
he should expound what he means by this <hi>Impression of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outward
Call, left in the receiver;</hi> but not a word. It must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be one of those, either quality or relation; for it cannot
he substance, or quantity, and nothing else can pretend. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I expected he should have shewed, what was that <hi>rule of
Christ</hi> he spake of, which should order the Election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for without we know that, we dispute at random; for that
must be our sole guide; and indeed, at the first blush, when
<hi>Christ</hi> is called and his rules to countenance any Cause, it will
stagger any heedlesse Reader; but be not troubled with it, Christ
never gave rule to the people to do any such Thing, If he had,
this man would have shewed it; but the Truth is, he did not,
all the Rules he gave were by his Apostles, as before expressed,
and therefore Christ cannot Countenance that Cause with
which he had not the least businesse to do: and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Lawes of Disputations would have required this at
his hands, yet he wisely avoids them, and from his Conclusion
leaps into proofs of it; the first of which is.</p>

He introduceth not his Conclusion, nor is it possible for him,
out of these premisses; for the natural result out of these Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
can be only, That therefore Pastor and People give the
Essentials one to another, in which is not one full Term of his
Conclusion. But I will examine his Major, <hi>One Relate gives
being, &amp;c. Relationis esse est ad aliud, non ab alio;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
relation, the whole Predicament is termed by the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of <hi>Aristotle, Ad aliquid,</hi> not <hi>ab aliquo,</hi> the whole being is
a relation to another, not from another: it is true they cannot
exist severed, without either is neither is in a Relative Notion;
yet so we may say an Accident, it cannot be without its substance,
yet that Accident doth not give the Essentials to the substance.
So here you see were high amazing words to amuse the Reader
with, but no force to his purpose: It may happen indeed, That
one relate may Cause the other, for Cause and Effect are Relates;
the Father causeth the Son, but the Son doth not give Essential
being to a Father, no not as a Father, but that Act which made
him a Father did it. I write this to let a Reader see, that when
Propositions are delivered even by such a one as Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who
may have Authority with the Reader, and it may be thought
will deliver nothing as an Axiom, which is not such, yet men
are as partial to their Opinions as their Children, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
every Thing that comes in their way to the Advantage of
them, yea, it will seem so to them; and therefore even these
Propositions are not to be swallowed without Examination.
But yet suppose this were granted, that <hi>one Relate</hi> (as he phrases
it) <hi>did give the Essentials to another,</hi> would this prove, That
the Election of the people by the rule of Christ did it? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no: for the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>people</hi> are the <hi>two relates,</hi> not the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi>
and <hi>Election of the people; People,</hi> and <hi>the Election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61847:80"/>
are two Things; This latter an Act of the former. He sayes Mr
<hi>Rutherford</hi> seems to be much moved with this Argument; I have
not seen his books, but by that I have heard of him; it would
be strange he should; but I leave them together, and see what
he urgeth for Confirmation of this Argument which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my businesse; Pag. 68. He saith, <hi>the Proposition is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Fundamental Principles of Reason, so that he must raze
out the received rules of Logick that must reject it;</hi> High language!
But why so, I ask? He answers immediately, <hi>Relata sunt quorum
unum constat mutua alterius Affectione;</hi> This is non-sense; for
should I ask, if <hi>Vnum,</hi> which of the two? he could not answer,
the reason is, because as <hi>relates</hi> there is the same reason of one as
of the other; But I think he means <hi>utrumque;</hi> but Consider
then, what is this to his purpose? Suppose they did Consist in a
mutual Affection one of another, could one properly be said to
give the Essentials to the other? The Father indeed gives the
Essentials to his Son, and Father and Son do mutually as Father
and Son depend upon a reciprocal Affection, as he calls it, one
upon the other, but the Son cannot be said properly to give
the Essentials to the Father, no not as Father, because all he hath
he hath from his Father; as Suppose again a Master and Servant
are <hi>relates,</hi> neither of these give the Essentials one to another;
But properly that Covenant which engaged them in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Duties, that Covenant gave them the Essentials of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
not one another; and therefore this Discourse, though
he think it very Evident, yet begets no Acceptance in me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
declared with the name of a fundamental principle: That
which he deduceth, that <hi>relata</hi> are <hi>simul natura</hi> is most true, but
not deduced, yea it is against that principle he deduceth it from,
for that which Constitutes anothers being is <hi>prius natura</hi> to that
which is Constituted, but these are <hi>simul,</hi> and therefore cannot
give Essentials one to another. His Assumption, that <hi>Pastor</hi> and
<hi>Flock</hi> are <hi>relates,</hi> no man (saith he) that hath sip'd in Logick,
can deny; I grant it: Then (saith he) the Conclusion follows,

and the Logicians say, that although absolute Accidents <hi>Numero
tantùm distincta,</hi> cannot exist in the same Subject at the same
Time, yet relative may. So one flock may have many pastors,
the Catholick Church a Thousand visible ones, invisible only
Christ. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would desire no more, but that
you grant, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lock must have but one Pastor; they will
quickly prove the Catholick Church one Flock, and then will
follow, the Pope to be the Universal Pastor; for none else pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to it; but indeed they themselves grant many Pastors to
the same slock, for their <hi>Teachers</hi> are Pastors, and their <hi>Lay-Elders</hi>
have Pastoral Authority of Governing. But now pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
after a long Discourse: A <hi>Paster</hi> and <hi>Flock</hi> are relates,
there may be many <hi>Pastors</hi> to one <hi>Flock;</hi> where the <hi>Flock</hi> is
great there must be; the <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi>
in which he hath placed many <hi>Pastors,</hi> and there is no Christian
man who is a Member of Christs <hi>Flock,</hi> wheresoever he is, in
the World, and finds any <hi>Pastor,</hi> but he may receive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Duty of a <hi>Pastor</hi> from him, and he ought to give it
him. Again, there is no <hi>Pastor</hi> wheresoever he is in the world,
if he find any of his Masters <hi>Flock</hi> in any place who have need
of him, but he ought, out of duty, if he can to supply his
lack. And thus are the mutual bond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christs <hi>Pastors</hi> and his <hi>Flock</hi> supplyed; as soon as he is made

                     <p>
                        <hi>AND so I passe to his Second Argument, which is this;</hi>
It is lawfull for a people to reject a Pastor upon Just
Causes, (if he prove pertinaciously scandalous in his Life,
or haeretical in his doctrine) and put him out of his Office;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it is in their power to call him outwardly, and to put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Office.</p>
                     <p>The Consequence is plain from the Staple rule, <hi>Ejusdem est
Instituere</hi> (he would say I think) <hi>&amp; destruere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Antecedent is as certain by Gods word, Beware of Wolves,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. Beware of false Prophets, <hi>Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Now because he begins with his Consequence, I will so
likewise; and that which he so highly commends for a
Staple Rule, I will examin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and from henceforth receive this
rule: That great words with him are forced to be the Cloaks
of least performances; I do not believe he read that Staple
rule in any Logick Author; and am very Confident it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
false in all Sciences. In nature it is most evident, that
water which destroyes fire cannot make it. If he answer, that
in general the power of Nature which by Water doth destroy
fire, by another hand of power doth make. I will apply this to
our particular, and say, that in general men destroy it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men give it, by the same way as Nature by water
destroyes fire, and by fire makes it. If we look into Policy, we
shall find that sometimes when Kings have setled power, the
people have pluckt them down; Those whom the people have
Instituted, Kings have destroyed; but perchance he may say, that
lawfully out of right the same power can destroy, that did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
perhaps there may be Legality in some of these Instances, but
see a Clearer: A Tithing man is elected by his parish (like as
he would have Pastors) afterwards he is sworn by the Steward
of the Court (like his Ordination) or perhaps by some Justice of
Peace; The Parish for his misdemeanours cannot pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> him out,
but the Justices who cannot choose him, may. A Barrester who
received his Degree at the Innes of Court, is degraded by the
Judges, who cannot make him a Barrester. I think I speak
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61847:81"/>
Law; if I do not, I am sure this may be Law without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the policy of this Nation, and then I am sure this rule
is false; and indeed besides Instances, there is reason that that
which gives life should preserve, not destroy, and that men
should look for other hands to pluck down, besides those that
set up; but as it is not universally true, so it is not universally
false; and I think will not be false in this instance he speaks of,
and therefore I will apply my self to his Antecedent, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, he saith, it is as certain as the other by warrant
from the Word, and no more certain: His places out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are, <hi>Beware of Wolves,</hi> Mat. 7. 15. <hi>Beware of false Prophets,</hi>
Phil. 3. 2. Here I expected to have found these two Texts in
these two places; but it is not so: both in the same manner are
in the first, and something like that he saith in the other. The
words of the first are, <hi>Beware of false Prophets which come to you
in sheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi> A
man may wonder how he could deduce hence that Conclusion,
That it is lawfull for a people to reject, or put a Pastor out of his
Office; Consider the words, Suppose it had been said, Beware
of a wicked Judge when your Cause is to be heard, or beware
of false Lawyers which will come to you in sheeps cloathing
with fair and excellent Language, but within are ravening
Wolves, will secretly destroy you; would any man think, that
here were Commission granted to put either out of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?
It is Just so here, <hi>beware of false Prophets,</hi> such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
they are Prophets, but are not, or false Prophets, such as
prophesie f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lse Things, nor can there be more meant in this, than
that we should not be deceived by them; for though they come
in sheeps cloathing, speak never so fair words, commend their
Doctrine never so much, it will destroy you, there can be no
more in it; This Speech is spoke, no doubt, to all and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in singular, yet I hope Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth not think that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
every man must beware he is not deceived by them, yet
that every man, every p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rticular Man can depose his Pastor.</p>
                     <p>The same reasons which have disproved the force of this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation,
will likewise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> overthrow the Strength of the second
against this Cause. The 2d. Text is, Phil. 3. 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs,
beware of evil Doers, beware of the Concision:</hi> Suppose all or some
of these were <hi>Pastors,</hi> which can in no strength of reason be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61847:82"/>
induced, yet what can this word beware enforce? Can it imply
depose? there was never such an Exposition, but only take heed
of them, that ye be not deceived by them; so that there is not
the least thing in the Word of God to prove that the people
may depose their Pastor, and yet all his discourse which follows
in page 65. is as if this were most true, <hi>sublato uno relatorum
tollitur alterum;</hi> but where is either <hi>relatum</hi> taken away, or
by whom? <hi>Again,</hi> (saith he) <hi>this rejection cuts him off from
being a Member of that Congregation where he was, and so from
every visible Congregation, and therefore cuts him off from having
any visible Church-Communion with Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Consider
how he builds upon a foundation in the Air, hath no reality;
nor indeed were his foundation good, are his Consequences,
and see what an unhappy Condition such a Pastor were in, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th
it is evident these Texts of Cautions are directed to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man, and then the malice of one particular man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
a Pastors Interest in heaven, because he can put him from
Church-Communion with Christ: but suppose these Texts were
understood of whole Congregations, yet sometimes they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few: or, if an hundred, it is hard that the Opinion and Error
for the most part of Ignorant men, though an hundred, should
shut a man out of the pale of Church-Communion; these things
fall of themselves; <hi>beware,</hi> therefore <hi>depose,</hi> is not, cannot be
admitted amongst reasonable men; yea the clean contrary might
rather be urgent; Beware, therefore they cannot depose, for
what a man can depose, he need not much Caution about it, the
work is quickly done. But here if any should ask, What, must
the people submit to any Pastor, though heretical, though scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
in his life? If not, what can they do? Certainly, to the
first; there are some things which Heresie or wickednesse of life
do not hinder, that is, administring the Seals of Gods Covenants
in the holy Sacraments. To this purpose he himself speaks, as I
think, I forewarned, in the latter end of page 45. and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of page 46. in higher and fuller Expressions than I make,
but I need not set down; only Consider this, that such Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
as deny the Trinity, because they will not nor can baptize
in the form prescribed by our Saviour, that is, the Name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, their baptism is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and by their Ministry, erring in the root, cannot effectually
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61847:82"/>
apply those Seals; but for other mistakes in opinion, not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,
nor such as immediately reflect upon that Seal they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister;
so they set the Seal rightly to, according to matter
and form, their Act is good; and a man, a Lay-man may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto them, but take care not to be misled either by his false
Doctrine or wicked life, of which he is not to take upon him,
like a Judge, to censure his person, but like a Cautelous hearer
to avoid what is ill, and suck out what is good; The sheep do
not refuse the good hay, though they swallow not the worse,
which the Shepherd delivers; they may complain to them who
have Authority, the Bishops, who are to receive the Complaints
made against Elders, and so have him soberly Convented and
adjudged, but without this course they have no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him; and this I think they ought to do, and more than this
they have no power granted them to do.</p>

others, which is by all understood of Ordination: So then there
is evident a delegate power given by men of Authority, by which
others are Authorized to operate in this Divine Administration,
I need say no more to this, but enter his Second Conclusion,
which he is briefer in, but is indeed the foundation of this other.
This you may find page 72. thus. Secondly, <hi>There is a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
power by voluntary Subjection, when though there be no

themselves to be ruled by another, desiring and calling him to take
that rule, he accepting of what they yield possessing that right
which they put upon him by free Consent;</hi> I put down his very
words which are not sence, making no Compleat Proposition,
but it may be the fault of the Printer, and therefore read it <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that right, &amp;c. (for possessing.) The reason</hi> (saith he) <hi>is,
those in whose Choice it is, whether any shall rule over them or no,
from their voluntary subjection it is, That the party Chosen hath
right, and stands possessed of rule and Authority over them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Argument is mighty Lame, for the Minor which is not
set down, if produced, would be, that the Case stands thus with
Christians; That it is in their Choice whether any shall rule over
them or no, which is absolutely false, taking Christians for such
men who have given themselves and their names to Christ in

baptism, and supposing that they intend to be saved by perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
according to that Covenant, for without doubt such must
submit to this Government; and indeed I wondered how any
man had Confidence to obtrude such a Conclusion concerning so
high and material points, without pretence of reason or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as he doth in this place; but I remember how heretofore
I had read something to this purpose, in his First Part, and it

of the formal Cause of a visible Church, and he puts
this Conclusion; <hi>Mutual Covenanting and Confederating
of the Saints in the fellowship of the faith according to the Order
of the Gospel, is that which gives Constitution and being to a Visible
Church.</hi> This Term <hi>Consederating of the Saints</hi> is indefinite, and
seems therefore that he should mean all the Saints should Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
which is impossible in any of their Congregations; if he
had meant of any limited Company of Saints, he should have
said of a Company of Saints, or a number of them, which he did

                  <p>HIS Conceit is, as I apprehend it, That a Company of Saints,
as he calls them, enter into a Covenant one with another,
and with one which they call <hi>Pastor,</hi> to submit to him in Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
duties, and he to perform Pastoral Offices among them, as
likewise in respect of themselves to submit to and exercise
Churchly Censures one towards another; some such Covenant
(if I can reach his sence) is that which gives to the receivers an
Obligation and bond, and it is in Conscience one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which bond is the formal Essence and being of a Church;
I conceive this, but for lack of some Copy of one of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
I can only guesse at it; by the main drift of his Discourse
he denyes Baptism or Profession to give the being to a Member,
and only makes a Covenant to be it, a superadded Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Baptism. Page 47. he delivers, that this Covenant is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Explicite</hi> or <hi>Implicite; Explicite,</hi> when there is an open ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and profession of this Engagement in the face of the
Assembly; <hi>Implicite,</hi> when in their practice they do that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they make themselves engaged to walk in such a Society, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to such rules of Government which are executed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and so submit themselves thereto, but do not
make any verbal profession thereof.</p>
                  <p>And thus he saith the people in the Parishes of <hi>England,</hi> where
there is a Minister put upon them by the Patron or Bishop, they
constantly hold them to the Fellowship of the people in such a
place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being warned, that upon their grounds there
could be no Church in the Christian World, but in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he could not choose but allow this Implicite Covenant to be
sufficient (which is the common opinion among them) although
I doubt in some other Things he will reject an Argument drawn
from an universal practice.</p>

of that Covenant to the memory of a Christian is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
enough. This likewise answers his 2d Argument, page
49. <hi>They are</hi> (saith he) <hi>thereby kept from Cavilling and Start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside from the Tenure and Terms of the Covenant which they
have professed and acknowledged before the Lord, and so many
Witnesses.</hi> I answer, as before, If the Terms be additions to
what was in Baptism, he ought not in general to prescribe them
to all Christians. If they are not Additions, then that Covenant
is the strongest he can make which was made in Baptism. The
same answer may be applied to his third reason; <hi>For</hi> (saith he)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61847:85"/>
                        <hi>thereby their hearts stand under a Stronger Tye.</hi> I answer, no

                  <p>THen he enters into a Second Question, how far this
Covenant requires Cohabitation? His handling of which
is very weak, in my Judgement; for since he allows Merchants
and others upon diverse Occasions to be absent sometimes divers
years, he gives no satisfaction at all to shew how these men in
their absence can partake of Church-blessings: But me-thinks
they must live without Preaching, without Sacrament, or any
blessing of any Covenant of Gods, because their Pastors and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
reside at their constant place; but contrarywise our
Doctrine, which makes each Presbyter an Officer of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and each Christian a Member of it; it follows, that
any Ship may carry a Pastor, and every man receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and blessings of Gods Covenants from him, which is like
our Saviours providence for all and every particular. But I
omit this, at this time, as not necessary for our businesse; and

gives the Essentials to a Church; which he begins, page

                     <hi>HIS first Argument is thus framed, in these words,</hi> Every
Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Corporation receives its being
from a Spiritual Combination.</p>
                  <p>But the visible Churches of Christ are Ecclesiastical or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
<hi>Therefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can justly complain here, that the Terms are altered, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61847:85"/>
In a Logical Discourse should be the same; I will reduce them
therefore, and so discourse upon it; Combination must here be
taken for Covenant, or a Combination by Covenant; so that the
sence of that Proposition is, <hi>Every Ecclesiastical Corporation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
its being from a Combination by Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Examination of this Proposition, I will follow his own

the Corporations of Towns and Cities: <hi>There</hi> (saith he) <hi>they
have their Charter granted them from the King or State, which
gives them warrant to unite themselves, to carry on such works,
for such Ends, with such Advantage: So</hi> (saith he) <hi>their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sider now, that the form of
every thing is that which last comes, to give every thing its
being, and make it Compleat; Secondly, it is that which enables
every thing to do its proper work. Now Consider, a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath first a Charter by which they are enabled to unite, by
Authority of which they assemble and come together, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
enter into some Engagement required by that Charter; by
this Engagement they are made the Matter of this Corporation;
but the form is the Influence of the Charter, by which these men
so engaged by Covenant are authorized to do this: So in every
question when it is moved concerning any Action, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the form; Ask why this did heat or burn? It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
because it was fire, had the form the burning form of fire:
Why did that grow? because it had a vegetable form. Now
ask, why did a Corporation do this or that, let this Lease, make
that man free? The answer is not made, because they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
by a Covenant, but because they have a Charter to do it;
so that the influence which that Charter hath upon the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is the thing which gives that Corporation its being, not
their Union by Covenant, which makes them but the Matter,
when the other gives the life and being, force and operation
solely to the Corporation.</p>
                  <p>To apply this to our purpose: Suppose every little particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church were a Corporation, first they must have a Charter
to unite in a Covenant, which nor he nor any man living can
shew me; and although these men vaunt mightily of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61847:86"/>
and Contemn all Doctrine which is not delivered there,
yet this which seems to me their Corner Stone and main founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they have, no not the least shew of any words of Scripture,
which can authorize, much lesse exact any such Covenant; but
then suppose they had some such Commission, yet not their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Commission, but the other Authorities expressed
in the Charter must be it which enables them to do whatsoever
they do, not their union by that Covenant; for ask, why any
man preacheth, administreth the Sacraments, or the like, the
answer is not made from any union, but from the Charter which
granted it.</p>

of the living God,</hi> (this is the phrase he must pitch upon to

<hi>and an innumerable company of Angels;</hi> then vers. 23. <hi>to
the General Assembly and Church of the first-born, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of
just men made perfect.</hi> I cannot imagine with what colour of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61847:86"/>
reason this can be applyed to a particular Church; for although
it may be affirmed, That such men who are religiously united
to such Churches are come to this glorious Society, yet that
that peculiar Church should be <hi>this City, this mount</hi> Sion, <hi>this
heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, cannot be admitted; for first it is called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
not <hi>Cities:</hi> now if one Church be this <hi>City,</hi> another cannot
be it; it is the <hi>heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>an Innumerable Company of
Angels, the General Assembly, the Church of the first-born,</hi> which
can be spoken of none but the universal Catholike Church, of no
particular in the world. That it is this, and such a Company;
let us look then upon his second place, where he saith his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church is called an house, 1 Tim. 3. 15, <hi>That thou mayst
know how to behave thy self in the house of God, which is the Church
of the living God.</hi> Hence he collects, or no where, that a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church is a Corporation, because an house; A poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
but see, is this spoken of a Particular Church? Mark
the words following, <hi>the pillar and ground of all Truth:</hi> Can
this be spoke of any particuliar, of a little handfull of men in
<hi>New England,</hi> or in one Corner there? I am sure the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath much more semblance for <hi>Rome,</hi> than they can have
for any of their Congregations, which have been and are most
unstable themselves, much lesse supports for Christs Truth. His
3d. place to prove this, that particular Churches are Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is because they are termed the <hi>body of Christ,</hi> for this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
Eph. 4. 13, 16. The 13th verse hath not that phrase bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but only saith in general, that Christians must grow up in
the unity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith to the perfect Stature of Christ; but in the 16th
verse there is the name <hi>body, from whom the whole body fitly joyned
together and compacted, by that which every joynt supplyes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Effectual working, &amp;c.</hi> To understand this, read the
preceding verse, where Christ is called <hi>the head,</hi> and then think
with your self, whether this little Congregation can be his body
spoke of, or the whole Church? or whether Christ be the head to
so many bodies? or whether all Christians are not Members of
the same body? His last place is, 1 Cor. 12. 12. <hi>for as the body
is one and hath many Members, &amp;c.</hi> I am weary of transcribing;
Consider, the body is one; therefore not every Church a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
body, but there is one body, the Catholick Church. Then
he urgeth, ver. 27, 28. of the same Chapter, verse 27. <hi>Now ye
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61847:87"/>
are the body of Christ, and Members in particular:</hi> Can a man
choose but wonder, to think that any man should offer to apply
this to a particular Church, to say it is the body of Christ? The
28th verse reckons up the diverse Officers which God gave to
govern these Churches, which can be affirmed of none but the
universal, I am sure not of their particulars, they have no <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
neither <hi>literally</hi> nor <hi>successively Bishops,</hi> no way. This doth
weary me; but now you see all that is brought to prove this
mighty Conclusion out of Scripture. In brief, to illustrate this
Truth a little farther: Conceive, that the universal Church of
Christ is like a City, of which he is the King, or Supream. All
men in baptism submit themselves to his Government. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
Officers over the whole, as I have before expressed,
these cannot actually be present every where, and therefore by
consent appoint these and these in their particular Wards or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts;
and as any man when he comes to plant in this or that
City, implicitely submits to the Government, as of the City, so
of that particular part of the City where he lives: so is it with
Christians where they go any where in the Christian world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in general by Baptism submitted themselves to Christ
and his Discipline, take it in all places wheresoever it is. So
likewise the Church is an <hi>house,</hi> Christ the Master, in which
every person, in what room soever he rests, can receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but from his Officers. The Church universal is a <hi>body,</hi>
he the <hi>head,</hi> from which flow all those Spirits and Graces by
which the body is enlivened. Now, as nothing can induce me
to believe, that each house in this City should be the City, each
Chamber in the house should be the house, each member should
be the body: so a man cannot be perswaded that these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Congregations which are parts of the whole, should be that
whole which is called by these Names.</p>

                     <hi>Therefore they must by mutual Agreement and Engagement

affirm, that every Christian is our spiritual brother of what

are organized for that purpose, may entertain that relation:

Ears, but his Tongue, which is the part fitted for that purpose.
The Church is Christs body, it hath many parts; when you are

speaks, it is not with hands or eyes, but with the Churches

                  <p>COnsider what makes a Church, that if it be visible consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
a Church visible; and certainly for the first, if we
consider the Church to be the body of Christ, the City of God,
the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then as we must conceive it consisting
of many men, we must conceive it likewise having these men
united in some form of Government under Christ, and like a
City, an house, a body ruled by their King and head Christ, who
by his Inferiour Ministers and Officers rules and governs this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
this City; he is of this City, who is ruled and governed by
the Lawes of this City; of this House, who is governed by the
Oeconomical discipline of this house; of this body, who is guided
and governed by the head of this body; So he is of Christs
Church who is governed by the Lawes of his Church; we are
not born Citizens of the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but re-born by
Baptism, by which we submit to that Discipline, and are Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into his body: Now then, as a man of any City if he
live in the East part, so long as he lives there, is governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of that City by the Constables and Officers,
whose Authority is there prevalent; yet if he remove to the West
part, by the Lawes of the same City he is governed by other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61847:90"/>
yet by force of the same Law which ruled him before; so
a Christian submitting himself to Christs Discipline by Baptism,
if he live in any part of this City, submits to those Governours
which are there, if in another, to those which rule in that, and
all because a Citizen of that City; and these are the powers of
that City; yea, perhaps there are kinds of Governments in one
part of the City diverse from another, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity. This likewise is apparent in an house; A Servant
admitted into an house (so a man by Baptism) submits himself
to the Oeconomical Discipline of that house, and according to
the diverse rules of that house in diverse rooms of it, submits
himself to divers men, perhaps diverse Disciplines: So in the
Hall he meets with one Governour, with another in the Kitchin,
another in the Larder, another in the Pantry, and in all these he
hath diverse Officers to submit to, and diverse wayes of Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in diverse Things. Consider it a Body, and in a Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
those parts which walk up and down, and go to several parts
of the body, as blood and spirits; each of these, by that general
rule and Law of being Ministerial parts of the body, in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
through diverse parts receive diverse disciplines, and are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to several Lawes in the heart, the hand, the head, yet all
by that obedience they have to the Law of humane bodies, not
by a New Covenant in every particular place, but by virtue of
that first Covenant to be Servants to that head which governs all:
Now then, thus you see by Baptism we are made Citizens of the
<hi>Heavenly Jerusalem,</hi> and that being a visible sign, makes us visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>I Would willingly leave this Truth so clearly expressed, as it

that I do not conceive that Baptism is the Form which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
a Church Member, but that Baptism is that visible Act
by which a man is made a Member, a visible Member of Christs
Church, and the Effect of that Act is that form which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes

of that Indenture, and is the formality of his Apprenticeship.</p>
                  <p>Now because Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> seems to oppose this Doctrine, I
will examine his Arguments, which he enters upon, Part 1. Chap.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rst Minister; Did the Church, or Christ choose
their first Ministers, the Apostles? Did <hi>Crete</hi> choose, or St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ordain <hi>Titus</hi> their Minister? In the second part he supposeth all
true which he had discoursed in the first; in the first part he
supposeth all true which he means to discourse of in the second,
and indeed both grosly false, Ministers were before Churches,
and did constitute Churches, not they them; but he gives an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
page 56. <hi>Let it be supposed the coming of some Godly man</hi>

him; may not these men choose him for their Pastor, &amp;c.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

before) they could make him their Pastor, or that he
hath power by any Call of theirs to administer the Seals; and I
can give Instances in particular passages of the same nature in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Story; but that which is an invincible reason against
this, and the whole force of this matter, is, that although people
may have power to dispose of their own obedience to whom
they will give it, yet they cannot of Divine benedictions which
God shall give them; they must in that submit to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and they who are not authorized by him cannot be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by them: and therefore they cannot choose him a Pastor,
where God doth not make him his Officer for that purpose;
which, unlesse he is a Presbyter; he is not.</p>

To understand the force of this Argument I must deviate a
little, and discourse of what it is to be a Member of the Church,
of the force of Baptism in this work. Know then that the
Church is a body, and an org<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nical body, which hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
which have diverse Offices, an eye, a foot, &amp;c. and as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> philosophyes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and all this body is animated and
informed by the same soul, the holy Spirit, the head of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is Christ, all this needs no proof I think; but then, that men
are made Members of this body by Baptism, that I shall apply
my self to. Consider therefore the 13. verse of that 12 Chap.
of 1 <hi>Cor. By one Spirit we are baptized into one body, whether we
be Jewes or Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> Having in the preceding verse shewed
that there are <hi>many members,</hi> he shews here which way we are
made <hi>members</hi> of it, that is, Christs body; to wit, <hi>being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the same Spirit into Christ;</hi> the Spirit which enlivens us
makes Baptism effectual to the incorporating a man into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ; For what else can that phrase be, <hi>into the body,</hi> as
a work of Baptism but into the body of Christ, his Church? Well
then, Baptism is the Act, the relict of Baptism, as before, is the
Thing which makes us members and parts of this body. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then next, Gal. 3. 26, 27. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by
faith in Christ Jesus; for as many of you as have been baptized into
Christ, have put on Christ.</hi> Here you see phrases wonderfully
expressing the same thing. As God is considered in Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks
so he is a father, so by Baptism we are adopted the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God; as Christ is the head of the body, so we are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into him and engrassed (as the Spirit speaks elsewhere) <hi>into
the body.</hi> Suppose Christ to be an holy Garment, with which
the Crimes and Sins of his Servants are hid, by Baptism you
cloath your selves with his righteousnesse, and you put on Christ,
under whom your unrighteousnesse shall be hid, and your sins co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
or else, as others expresse it, Matters put on a form, &amp;c.
But then if you will adde the last verse, <hi>If ye be Christ, ye are
Abrahams seed, &amp; heirs of the promise,</hi> you may see these 3. things,
<hi>Children, Members, Heirs,</hi> most heavenly united in the second
Answer of our Catechism, <hi>In my Baptism, wherein I was made
a Member of Christ, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven;</hi> which three in expresse Terms are put down

it) of another Covenant can adde to a further union than this,
matters not much; Well then, it is proved that Baptism doth
constitute a Member. Now I will examine how this may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
against his Objection, which consists only of Instances
against this, and no proof of them; <hi>An Excommunicate man</hi>
(saith he) <hi>hath no Membership, He that renounceth the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

their Union dissolved, because it is wrought by man, and mans
hand guards it; but it shall never be so with Christs body, it
shall be a pillar, a strong support of all truth, yea the ground and
foundation in which Truth is inherent, and by which Truths are
supported: that instance therefore falls of its self, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is cast down, and then the Castle hangs only in the Air.</p>

                  <p>I Apply my self then to the first Instance of an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man, in which case I would have wished he had brought
some reasons to have proved they were not of the Church; but
he not doing it, I will undertake the question against such Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
as I can find elsewhere. The Question is, whether an
Excommunicate man be a visible member of Christs visible
Church? I put the Terms as strict as I can, because I will avoid
all future Cavilling, and I answer affirmatively, he is; he brings
no proof to the contrary: So we are upon even Terms, if I
should say no more, only the difference will be in the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Speaker, in which I think he will prevail; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will examine it by reason, and as well as I can satisfie the
Objections made by some Jesuites against it.</p>
                  <p>To understand this: Consider that any part continues so long
a member of its body, as it is united to it, and so long it is united
to it, as it can receive influence from the head, and be active
and operative in its proper works, by the fountains and originals
of those motions, assisted any way, by any outward applications
or inward medicines; the members of a mans body (as it haps
out in some Palsies) may be utterly unactive, so that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stirre or move, no not feel or be sensible of any hurt, and
yet these parts remain members of the body still, and it may
be by Physicians directions be restored to former vivacity, and
be quickened by spirits as before coming from the same foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and this is a Sign it is a member still of this body. That
which is a member of another body, canot by any Act be
made a member of this, nor that which is an entire body of it
self; so that when physick can restore a member, though it
appear to our Senses never so dead, yet it is still a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>Again, Consider for the other Term of distinction, That if
a baptized man though excommunicate be a member by his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61847:93"/>
Baptism, he is likewise a visible member by the same Baptism,
for Baptism is a visible sign of the Effect it produceth, and is as
visible in the Excommunicated man, as in him that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Consider that many parts of the body are by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
hindred from that influence of blood and spirits which
would enable them to do their duties, which yet, that obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
removed, hold the same Commerce and Society, with giving
and receiving mutual correspondence in their several offices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with both head and members. These things premised, as
I think apparent Truth, I now addresse my self to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.</p>

Priests of God,</hi> (I render it) <hi>is delivered to Sathan:</hi> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
out of the Church the Devil is, as in the Church Christ, I
grant all these phrases to have their Truth: That the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61847:94"/>
man is out of the Church, as I said before, that is, out
of the participation of all those heavenly Covenants and mercies
which are appropriated to them who in a more constant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and fellowship have Commerce with it, yet he loseth
not all union. Suppose then the Church <hi>a Body Politick, a City,</hi>
this Baptized person one of the Corporation, for some fault
by him committed he is by them expelled the City, untill such
time as either he humble himself for his fault, or else give such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
as is enjoyned; This man so long as he is out of the
City loseth all priviledges of a Citizen, yet not all union; when
he satisfies, he is re-admitted upon his first Title: so that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
is a kind of suspension from the participation and
execution of those Divine benedictions which other members
have; it is not a degradation from his Christian being; like a
Tree which is dead in the Winter, and brings forth neither fruit,
nor leaf, yet revives in the Spring; or else like a withered part,
which by Chirurgery is recovered to a lively being. Consider St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> expression, Rom. 11. 17. and the following part, we are
said <hi>to be graffed into Christ;</hi> now that Act which grafts us in is
baptism: Now, as we may see some branch of a graft in the Fruit
season bearing neither fruit nor leaf, giving forth no expression
of livelyhood; yet when we find by any Experience that there
is any hope in it, or a possibility of restoring it to a vivacity with
care of Husbandry, we know that branch is not dead, nor ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
hath lost union, because his restitution is by physick, not
re-grafting: so it is with Baptized persons, which being Grafts,
not Sprouts, when any decay whatsoever is restored or repaired
by repentance and sorrow for Sins, not by re-grafting by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
it is a certain and undoubted sign that it retains still an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the former Grafti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g: So that this Act of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is nothing but his suspension from his Acting many duties
of a Christian, and an obstruction of the influences of many
Graces of God to him, but yet not a total destruction of either;
for as he may pray, repent in himself, and upon that justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Absolution, and the Church is bound to give it: so before
these he may receive motions and incitements to them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the use of those Talents proceed from grace to grace, until
he obtain such a measure of humiliation and repentance as ought
to be accepted of the Church, and accepted upon humiliation,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61847:94"/>
not Baptism again; which is a sign the branch was not cut off,
but sick only: so that now having spent (I hope not wasted)
so much time and paper in Explicating what Excommunication
doth, Conceive my Answers to these pieces of Fathers thus; By
Excommunication a man is put out from many Actual priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and blessings, which those who are not excommunited enjoy,
that they are put out of the Lap, the Bosom, the near Caresses
and Embraces of the Church; not out of the absolute being in
or with her: And lest any man should think this a forced Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
take an Instance in Mat. 27. 46. Our Saviour complains,
<hi>My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> How can this be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood?
Not that the Deity had taken away that supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>natural
hypostatical union; but that, for that while there was a suspence
of the influx of the fulnesse of those all-comforting graces, which
were other whiles constantly attending his humanity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> disputes out of reason: First, <hi>Because Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
deprives a man of all Spiritual Commerce;</hi> and he
urgeth a piece out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> for it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 39. of his <hi>Apology:</hi>
But the sence of him and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Supposition is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as I before Explained, he is deprived of the Actual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Church in many things, not the union; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Tertullian</hi> in that place saith, <hi>summum futuri Judicii praeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi>
the greatest prejudice in this World of the future Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the greatest Injury towards it that a man can have, to be
barred from the Communion, from the association of prayers;
but it canot exclude his own praying, or the power of it by
Jesus Christ to obtain Mercy, to whom he remains knit by his
Baptism.</p>
                  <p>Again he urgeth, <hi>It is the greatest punishment the Church can
inflict.</hi> I answer, The greatest Excommunication is the greatest
punishment, but neither man nor men have power to sever that
member from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Again</hi> Bellarmine, Excommunication cannot be to any but
Contumaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us and Incorrigible Sinners, because they will not hear
the Church.</p>
                  <p>I answer, what follows? but that they who now are Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious,
anon at another time will be humble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast of all he urgeth, <hi>In Absolution the phrase is,</hi> Restituo te,
<hi>I restore thee to the unity of the Church, and participation of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:61847:95"/>
I answer, he might have added what follows by way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Explication in their forms of Absolution, and to the Communion
of the faithfull. A man is restored to the full enjoying his union,
his membership, by such a Communion which he had not before,
but only an union: So now I think it appears, if you apprehend
the Church as a body natural, Excommunication is an Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which stops many Influences with which both head and
members Communicate, but not union. If you apprehend the
Church a political body, Excommunication is a Suspension from
City powers and priviledges untill some satisfaction, but Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
not an absolute annihilation of his Charter, and this will
appear out of that Phrase of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Chapter urged by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>Deliver such a man to Sathan for the
destruction of the Flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of
the Lord Jesus;</hi> so that it seems by this, Excommunication is a
sharp Physick for the good of that man, to make him ashamed,
to humble him, for his correction, not destruction; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
again by his restitution, which is only an Absolution, not
a new engra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing, or an Absolution by a new readmission, not
a new Incorporation; and this answers all the Objections that I
have read either in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or in any other.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">

                  <p>I Must now addresse my self to <hi>Hookers</hi> second Objection,
which is, <hi>That such as renounce the fellowship of the Church,
though they have true Baptism, yet are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

By this renouncing, I think he means professing against it, or let
it be what it will, turning <hi>Turk,</hi> renouncing Christ, he is yet a
member, he retains his true Baptism, for by Baptism a man is
accepted a Child of God; and no more than he who renounceth
his Father doth by that Act make himself not his Son, no more
can he unchild himself by any of these Actual oppositions. Here
in this he only sets down his Conclusion, but brings no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his 3d. Book <hi>De Ecclesià militante,

and Apostates which are baptized be parts and members of the

                     </gap>st Argument against it is drawn
from Scripture, 1 Tim. 1. 19. where it is said, <hi>That some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

them to be Hereticks and Apostates, I grant the Church their
Ship, I grant them in the Sea ready to perish, yet even when
they are there they belong to the Ship, and perhaps were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
members of it, not in it, but of it; and therefore read the
next verse, <hi>of whom were Hymeneus and Alexander whom I have
delivered unto Sathan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</hi> This
great Pilot took care of them, as members of his ship, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
their recovery, which was a sign they were still in union
with the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>this is signified by the parable of our Saviour,</hi>
Luke 5. <hi>of the Net which was broken by the multitude of Fishes;</hi>
That word Parable slipt from the Cardinal un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dvisedly. It was
a real Story; but the learnedest man in the world may let slip
such an Expression. But why any such sence should be forced
on that Story, I know not, but only that such a Thing was done,
and if such a sence were granted, it yields no more, but that
some men are slipt out of the blessing of the Church, when they
are ready to come to the shore, even to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But he urgeth further, <hi>Titus 3. 10. A man that is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
after the first and second Admonition, reject,</hi> Vers. 11. <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned

who intends the good of his Children by withholding Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
favour for a season: that so his Son may be ashamed, and

I grant it, out of that glorious Communion and participation of
Heavenly mysteries, which belong to men of right faith and
manners.</p>
                  <p>But he addes another place out of the 1 of <hi>John 2. 19. They
went out from us, but they were not of us;</hi> which he expounds out
of St. <hi>Augustine, That they went out of the Church, but if
they had been of the Church by Election, they would not have gone
out from us</hi> I am sorry to read so learned a man forget himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I am sure in another Controversie he would not allow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
nor can I allow it in this; for without doubt many
Elect do go out of the visible Church, understand Election in the
most rigid way, they do go out and come in again; that cannot
be the right exposition therefore. If you would have my sence
of it, we may observe, that in the preceding verse the Apostle
speaks of many Antichrists, of these he saith, <hi>that they went out of
us,</hi> that is, out of the Communion with us; now (saith he) <hi>they
were not of us;</hi> that is, when they went out from us; it may be
they had been before, but then they were grown to a defiance
of us; <hi>for if they had been of us, they would not have gone out from
us;</hi> if they had had the same Principles they would not have left
us. This I Conceive the sence of this Text; and indeed, I know
not whether any man hath given it this Exposition. Those which
I have looked in have given me no satisfaction, of what Religion
soever: Now let us see what concerns this Text; and perhaps
will serve to Illustrate other Doubts. The difficulty will be in
this phrase, <hi>to be of us,</hi> that is, <hi>our Society;</hi> that may be diverse
wayes, in respect of that Inward Thing which unites us to
Christ, either in a perfect union, or in a remisse, or in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree: In a perfect union, that is, by it which St. <hi>James</hi>
phraseth a lively faith, a faith quickned and infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Charity, that dare with <hi>Abraham</hi> forsake all Lands, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
yea offer his Son himself a sacrifice to the good pleasure of
God; this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls an informed saith, actuated
and informed with Charity; this is the highest union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Then there is an union lower than this, which is, the
faith which believes aright, and makes a profession of it, but will
not bide the Test of a Confession, when it comes to the Touch,
and these are by all held so long to be in the Church, as they have
this union with Christ, and so long retains its Community, untill
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61847:96"/>
some Temptation of fear, or hope, or perhaps some Carnal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
perswade otherwise, and then they fall into Heresie or
Apostacy, to have or g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in something; and these I think to be
those of whom the Apostle spake, men who lived in a formal
shew of a right faith, by conversing in a seeming manner with
the Godly and the Church, but then went from them, (I will
not dispute the falling from Grace here.) But thus, when men
had this faith before spoken of, and professed it; or professed it,
and had it not; they had an union with the Church, at the least
outward, if but by profession, but inward likewise if they had
that second sort of faith, yet <hi>they were not of us,</hi> the number of
those who had justifying faith then when these left us; but now
there is another union, and that is <hi>per Sacramentum fidei,</hi> by the
Sacrament of Faith, as Baptism is called, the which no man leaves;
and this is an union by which a wicked man after his repentance
hath a Title to claim mercy and absolution, as likewise the Church
owes it him: So that I dare say <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> nor any Jesuite I
have read against this Doctrine, can deny that there is such a
Title, or that that Title is not by this union: So then <hi>they went
from us,</hi> that is, the Communion with us, that shewed they
<hi>were not then of us,</hi> of that dear union of a lively faith, for then
they would not have left us; you see this cannot be understood
of lack of Election: The Elect may go out, and come in again:
It cannot be understood that they left union, but Communion;
for the Antichrist himself hath a union with the Church, though
he keeps a Communion against it. I think this is enough to
shew, that although this departure which St. <hi>John</hi> speaks of be
by Heresie or Apostacy, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> insinuates, yet it is not a
leaving all union of and with Christ, but only Communion, as
I have before expressed. Reader, be not hasty to Judge of this
Conclusion, and then I hope thou shalt find it most agreeing to
all principles of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Bellarmine <hi>quotes the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>Can. 8.
&amp;</hi> 19. Where, <hi>saith he,</hi> Hereticks are said to be received into the
Church, if they will return, upon certain Conditions.</p>
                  <p>For Answer: It is worth our marking, that those two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
are made for two sorts of Hereticks, the 8th Canon for the
<hi>Cathari</hi> or <hi>Puri,</hi> as the Canon calls them; or the <hi>Novatians,</hi> as
<hi>Balsamon</hi> expounds it, for they were the same; these the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61847:97"/>
receives into the Church upon repentance, with Imposition
of hands only, but they must expresse their profession in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>The other in the 19th Canon were the <hi>Pauliani,</hi> or <hi>Paulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
who were re-baptized upon their re-admission; the first
was a reception of such who had gone out of the Communion of
the Church, by denying re-admission of Penitents, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
their Religion, by sacrificing to Idols, and communication
with the <hi>Digami,</hi> such as had been twice marryed, whom they
held unclean. These things were their Heresies, and therefore
were called <hi>Cathari,</hi> because they must by these Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

themselves holyer than other men; but these being not
things which nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed Baptism, although pertinaciously held, they
could not be rebaptized. But for the <hi>Paulinians,</hi> because they
they denyed the Trinity, they could not baptize according to
Christs Institution, and therefore such as came from them to the
Church were re-baptized. You see now, how upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these Canons of that most sacred Council, the Case is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for me, because it seems the <hi>Cathari</hi> had but left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as is before expressed, and therefore the removing the
Obstruction with proper physick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; but the <hi>Paulinians</hi>
had no union, and therefore to be grafted into the body.</p>
                  <p>I have insisted the longer upon this, because the Story of these
several Heresies is not perhaps apparent to every one, and that
difference of Condition upon the diversity of the Heresie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
by a negligent Reader would not have been observed.</p>
                  <p>What he produceth out of the Council of <hi>Lateran, That the
Church is</hi> Congregatio fidelium, I need not examine, I yield
it; but he saith, <hi>That Hereticks are not</hi> fideles, is denyed by
many of his own Religion; for although that they have not a
fulnesse of faith, which he cannot exact in a member, yet they
may have faith in many Articles, which may preserve them in
the unity of members, though sick members; but this serves
not my turn, comes not home to my businesse; I therefore say,
that as <hi>homo</hi> is <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> which is one of the compleatest
Definitions given to any thing, and the most exemplar, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of man is not <hi>rationale;</hi> the hand cannot discourse, nor
the feet: so the Church is <hi>Congregatio fidelium;</hi> but it doth not
follow, that every part of the Church is faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Infants are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61847:97"/>
members of the Church, and such members as are in a saving
Condition, yet they have but <hi>Sacramentum Fidei,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in
<hi>Potentiâ,</hi> they are not <hi>actually sideles,</hi> nay, perhaps not <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
I am certain as we know of, they have no habit of it. But
it may be objected, that these <hi>non ponunt Obicem,</hi> as the School
speaks; as they reach not out their hands of faith to lay hold on
Christ, so they do not hinder or oppose it, but these men do with
violence thrust Christ from them: I answer, that violence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to their own Soul, in thrusting themselves out of the state
of grace and favour with God <hi>protempore,</hi> for that time they do
so, and it hinders Grace in its <hi>operari,</hi> in its great and noble Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which it drives at, but doth not extinguish it in its first Act,
which is to make a man a member; yea therefore they are more
sinfull, than if done by an Heathen or any who had not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods Law, nor been admitted into his membership:
Therefore the Apostle urgeth this Argument, <hi>Shall I take the
members of God, and make them the members of an Harlot?</hi> In a
word therefore, the Church is the <hi>Congregation of the faithfull;</hi>
the Essential and Constituting parts of it are such, yet many parts
of it are not such: which no man can deny if understood <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
because no man can have actual faith at all Times, nor is it
necessary that faith should be habitual in every member; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
cannot be proved to have it, but only <hi>Sacramentum fidei,</hi>
which is the first hand which gives an Interest in Christ, and thus
much these have of whom we dispute.</p>
                  <p>The Sentences which he alledgeth out of the Fathers, may be
answered out of what hath been already delivered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His only reason is,</hi> That because the Church is a multitude
united, and this union chiefly consists in the profession of the Faith,
and in the observation of the same lawes and rights, no reason will
permit that we should have any of the body of the Church, which
have no Conjunction with that body; he means in these things, but
he handles this Controversie negligently.</p>
                  <p>I answer: The perfection of the union consists in these things
he names, such are in the highest, and nearest and dearest way in
the Church, but the absolute union consists in Baptism.</p>
                  <p>I have perused many later Jesuites, but they are almost all
<hi>Excerpta</hi> out of him, scarce changing his words; but because
in his Answer to one Argument which is objected against him,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61847:98"/>
he confesseth in my Judgement what I require, I will put down
that, and so passe on.</p>
                  <p>It is Objected 3dly. (saith he) <hi>That Hereticks are in the
Church, because they are Judged by the Church.</hi> So saith St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. <hi>What have I to do to Judge them which
are without? therefore they are in the Church.</hi> He answers,
<hi>That although Hereticks are not of the Church, yet they ought
to be.</hi> This is poor hitherto, for then they ought not to be
Judged untill they are of the Church; and yet he addes, <hi>Et
proinde ad eam pertinent;</hi> How do they pertain to it, if they
are not of it? <hi>Yes</hi> (saith he) <hi>as a stray Sheep belongs to
the fold, as we use to say, this Sheep belongs to this fold;</hi>
This speech pleaseth me, That fold hath an Interest in that
Sheep, and that Sheep in that fold; though it have now
no Communion with it, yet it hath an union and interest
in Communion, whensoever he shall legally lay Claim to it,
to be sed with the rest, and every way provided for as
they are: Thus I think all stray Sheep which are mark'd
by Christ for his, belong to his fold, his Church, and by
his mark in Baptism may claim it, and the Church exact a
Christian observance from it, neither of which can be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
man.</p>
                  <p>Thus I apprehend <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Confession hath assisted me
in giving him satisfaction; hut because this Question hath
been little pryed into by such Writers as have come into
my hands, I will for far farther Illustrations adde some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which may clear it from some Oppositions, which
arise out of mine own understanding, rather than in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any Adversaries Writing.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V Some difficulties cleared.</head>
                  <p>THe mighty difficulty which troubled my mind all this
while I have been discoursing of this union, was, how
it may be said that the same person shall be a member of Christ,
and yet in the state of Damnation, as without doubt many a
baptized person is? Somewhat like this I read in Cardinal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan,</hi>
who in his Treatise of the Pope and a Council, <hi>Chap.</hi>
22. having been pinched with an Argument against the Popes
Supremacy, and being the visible head of the visible Church,
that the Pope may be an Heretick, yea an Apostate, and so
no member, much lesse the head of the visible Church; He
flyes to my Conclusion for refuge; (I will not meddle with
the force of it against the Conclusion he Treats of, but only
as he handles it in its self) <hi>That the Pope must be a baptized
person, and that union of Baptism will retain him in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership;
Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>if we will cast the eyes of our minds a
little higher, we shall see that he who hath only the Character
of faith, (which is a baptized man) is at the same instant
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>h faithfull and unfaithfull, a Member of Christ and his
Church, and</hi> extra membra Christi, <hi>without the Members of
Christ and his Church in diverse respects, and therefore diverse
and contrary things are affirmed of such a man by the Doctors:</hi>
In a word, he saith, <hi>That such a Man, as much as is in his own
power, is out of the Church; but Christ by his power keeps him in.</hi>
This is his Sence, and he goes further, <hi>That he who hath this
Character is a Member, though in Hell.</hi> But his Expressions
and Explications of this Conclusion are not so full as I could
have desired; he saith, he is <hi>aliqualiter membrum, after a sort
a Member,</hi> but sets not down clearly after what sort: <hi>Bannes</hi>
in his large Notes upon 2. 2dae Quest. 1. Art. 10. saith, <hi>that
in the Constitution of the visible Church there are two Things
Considerable, one visible, and the other invisible; one Internal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the other External: In respect of what is visible a baptized
man is a member of the Church; but if he be an Apostate or an
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61847:99"/>
Heretick, he is not a Member internally.</hi> This is somewhat
he saith, but it is not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ough; for if there be no internall adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it will be rather a shew, and outward appearance of a
thing, than a reality of it. Other expressions made by <hi>Jacohus
Granado,</hi> or such later Writers as I have seen, scarce come up so
far; <hi>Secundum quid</hi> (saith he) they are Members, and such
phrases, which make a man to know no more than if they had
said nothing.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore express my self in this manner;</p>
                  <p>First, If you take the proportion of this body, called the
Church, from that communion it hath with a naturall body, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to do, we shall then find a baptized man grafted
into the stock, and whilest he clings to it by faith, and brings
forth fruit, by charity he is a lively member of this body, as
those branches in all bodies are which bring forth their fruit in
due season; the best branch bringeth not forth fruit in all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
not in winter, and yet is a lively branch; if it bring forth
its fruit in its proper time, and so more or less excellent in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
kinds, as it enlargeth its self in bringing forth fruit; but
if it bring not forth fruit when the season for fruit requires it,
then it is not a lively branch, but yet living, which we may
know, because many such a branch hath afterwards brought
forth fruit again, by the discipline of pruning and husbandry.
The same may be said of the parts of a mans body; and yet to
express this fuller, it is likely that this branch is then in the state
of mortality, and would perish, were it not repaired by husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.
Here you perceive a baptized man ingrafted into Christs
body, you see him bringing forth fruit, and lively, you see him
not lively, but living, and whilest he yet lives in the state of
death and destruction, unless he be pruned and disciplined by
repentance. Now it is an invincible sign that that branch is yet
knit to the body, because its livelihood is repaired by pruning,
not grafting again, and this according to the Analogy betwixt a
<hi>natural body</hi> and <hi>its members,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Draw the proportion from a Politick body, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.
Suppose a Corporation, with this fundamentall
clause in its Statutes, that whosoever is once admitted, though
he may be thrust out of it for such and such offences, though he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61847:99"/>
thrust himself out, yet if he return again, making satisfaction,
although not of equality, yet such acknowledgement as being
ordained by Law shall be accepted, this man shall be admitted
into his former community of the priviledges of that Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This man by being once admitted loseth not this union,
untill he come unto that condition of never laying hold of the
priviledges of that Charter; he keeps his union, though he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
not the communion of that Corporation. This is the state
of this apostatizing man, and by the Laws of God granted by all
he is upon these terms admitted again, whether he thrust himself
out of the communion, or be thrust out. Thus this man (in
Answer to the former Argument) is at the same time in the
state of a man that is damned, having put himself out of <hi>Noahs</hi>
Ark, the Church, in which alone is salvation, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and untill repentance, which is commonly called,
<hi>Secunda post naufragium tabula,</hi> he is in that state of damnation;
and yet if he lay hold on that planck after his shipwrack, he
shall be saved, and hath title to a room in that Ship, a place in
that Corporation; and this is the union I labour for, and that
which sufficeth to answer mine own Argument and <hi>Hookers:</hi> the
same member is at the same time a member of Christs mysticall
body, and in the state of damnation, a member though not
lively, but only living; and in the state of dead men, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance must be in that state for ever, yet by his Baptism
hath a foundation for that to work upon; thus to my self, then
to Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> This man who is baptized, is still by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in the Church, <hi>Tanquam pars in toto,</hi> though not <hi>tanquam
locatum in loco;</hi> he is a member in the first act, though he by
his sins and opposition neither may nor can use any priviledge of
a member in the second act, to receive blessings from or with
them, like a dead branch; dead to the second act, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in the union: he hath not lost his membership by these acts,
but only communion in the second.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. Another Argument answered.</head>
                  <p>ANother Argument I can frame somewhat like this former
out of Scripture; First, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. (as it is urged
after by such who draw Conclusions from curtalled Scripture)
<hi>There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.</hi> These
Apostates who are baptized, by your Doctrine should be in
Christ, therefore there should be no condemnation to them,
which is impossible to be; for if there be none to them, then
there is none to any.</p>
                  <p>This Argument may be blown away by the very air and
breath of the following words, rather than need any Answer;
for the following words are, <hi>who walk not after the flesh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Spirit:</hi> But to such who are in Christ by Baptism, and in
their lives are far from him, their condemnation is more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
just, and their very Baptism, by which they Covenanted
to serve God, will arise in judgement against them.</p>
                  <p>Again it may be Objected, <hi>John</hi> 10. That <hi>Christs sheep hear
his voice and follow him;</hi> these run away from him, therefore
not his sheep.</p>
                  <p>It may be Answered; His sheep who are in his fold do hear his
voice, so long as they keep in that blessed communion; but
when they leave that, and go into the wilderness with the stray
sheep, then they listen not to it, nor follow him, but go from
him, as is in the parable of the lost sheep, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. But yet it
is evident that sheep belonged to his flock, by the shepherds
search after him, and that it was called his sheep, though a stray
one, and gone cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n from the fold and communion with the rest
of the flock; so that it owed obedience to his voice, and to his
steps, to follow him, though it ran from him: and this is all I
require, a bond of duty, the obligation of a Covenant, not the
force of any violent Tye.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Rom. 8. 17. Answered.</head>
                  <p>IT may be Objected once again, that the baptized are by that
made the Sons of God, <hi>and if Sons, then Heirs,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
disputes the Case, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. But these Apostates cannot be
accounted Heirs of Heaven, therefore they lose their filiation and
their Sonship by such wickedness, and so may all those other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of the Adoption of that Covenant.</p>
                  <p>This Question is fully handled by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. in
the Story of the prodigall Son: there is no Apostate can do more
than that dissolute young man did, but only perseverance, and
yet when he returned was not begot anew, that cannot be, but
admitted into his former estate of a Son. Take it therefore lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically,
by way of Answer; He that is a Son, <hi>quatenus,</hi> as a
Son, he is by that title an Heir, but yet he may so dispose of
himself, like the Prodigall, like <hi>Esau,</hi> that he may aliene and
sell his Birthright, and in that state he is not Heir, though a Son:
So that a Son, <hi>non ponenti obicem,</hi> if he alien not his Birthright,
in himself is an Heir, but if he do, he hath no Inheritance, though
an Heir, he loseth his Birthright. But how then, may one say,
is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> saying true, <hi>If a Son, then an Heir?</hi> Thus; because
by being a Son, he hath a title to the reversion of his Fathers
estate, but he may aliene it, which he could not do, unless he
had title to it: And yet we may say, that although he is by his
Adoption the right Heir, yet he is by his lewdness disinherited.
So that as the prodigall Son, so long as he lived in that dissolute
and prodigall estate, received no favour from his Father, nor
any relief from his estate, yet when he returned, he was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to all again. So it is with a Christian; a baptized Christian
once adopted the Son of God, hath Heaven so entayled, that
he cannot aliene it without a power of revocation, which power
it then acted, when with true repentance and humiliation he
shall prostrate himself before the Throne of grace for mercy,
when he shall with the prodigall Son have a sence of his misery,
by living in that dissolute condition, and longing after the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61847:101"/>
of his Fathers house, shall creep to him, confessing his sins
and begging his favour, with a, <hi>Father I have sinned against
Heaven, and before thee,</hi> &amp;c. This is the state of every baptized
man, who by that is adopted a Son of God. I will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those large and tedious discourses of Gods hardening mens
hearts, by dereliction of them, or of that which is termed the
sin against the holy Ghost, how these may devest a man of his
Inheritance. It is enough for my purpose that any baptized man
hath such an interest in God, as when he repents he is sure of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
and therefore though many Laws have been severe in
punishing Delinquents, as enjoyning penances for many years,
sometimes more or less, as sins were adjudged greater or less,
and of later times, and at this present in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
there are <hi>Casus reservati,</hi> reserved Cases not to be pardoned,
some not by the <hi>Parochian,</hi> some not by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
some reserved only for the Pope, yet in case of death all
these Ecclesiastick Constitutions are adjudged dissolvable by the
best Casuists, and the <hi>Parochian</hi> hath power to absolve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them. So that, for Answer to this Argument, I may justly
say that these baptized Apostates are still Heirs of Heaven, but
such as have aliened their estate, with a power of revocation upon
certain conditions, which when they perform, the estate is theirs
again: and agreeing to this will the Answer be to another place,
which is much insisted upon by the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and many
others symbolizing with them.</p>

                  <head>SECT, VIII. The 1. of St. John 3. 9. expounded.</head>
                  <p>THat is, 1 <hi>John 3. 9. Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit
sin;</hi> from which is deduced, That sinners are not Gods
children, are not born of God, not heirs, therefore have not
title to him and his blessings: if not sinners, much less so great
sinners as Apostates.</p>
                  <p>To understand which Text, and farther to illustrate this truth,
conceive with me, First, That this phrase <hi>sinneth not,</hi> or <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not sin,</hi> (that will not be materiall) cannot be understood
of doing nothing that is sin, for our Apostle in this very Epistle
hath declared the contrary, <hi>Chap. 1. 8. If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Again,
<hi>Verse 10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him</hi> (that
is, God) <hi>a liar, and his Word is not in us.</hi> Again, <hi>Chap. 2.
verse 1, 2. If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi>
Then, they sinned, and in such manner, as they have need of
Christ for a propitiation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I cannot conceive these words so as <hi>Beza</hi> expounds
them, in the 4th verse, which he would have guide the whole
sence of the phrase, throughout this Chapter; he saith, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth differ from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; to commit sin,
differs from sinning, because to <hi>commit sin, is to do it knowingly
against his conscience.</hi> To conclude, he makes it an high kind of
sinning, and to sin with reigning sin. I know no necessity to
force any such exposition from the phrase, and I am sure he
chose a most unlucky verse to obtrude that exposition upon;
for in that place the Apostle saith, <hi>He who commits sin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
the law, for sin is the transgression of the law;</hi> phrases
which are affirmed of him that committeth sin, but agree to all
sins, for every sin is the transgression of the law; and therefore
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to commit, or do, or make sin, is no more than to sin:
and to this inconsideration in <hi>Beza,</hi> fuller, the Apostle in verse
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61847:102"/>
6. useth only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>He who remains in him, sinneth
not.</hi> There, because the sence is as pregnant to shew the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the birth or being in Christ, and sin, as before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the Reader to the fourth verse, so that there was a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the 4th verse betwixt sinning and committing sin, but here
there is none in the 6th verse; but to sin, must be to do it, as is
expounded, with an high hand. But I have shewed, there
could be no such sence in that verse, and therefore much less in
this, where was not the least phrase guiding to it. I come now
to the Text; I have tumbled over divers Expositors, and he
that pleaseth me best is Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> in his Comments upon
the Text, who seems to me to dive deeper into, and drive closer
to the sence of the Text than others. <hi>Vasques Comes</hi> in a word or
two towards it likewise, and many touch upon it; his sence is,
that he who is born of God, and he who remains in him, sins
not, nor can sin: this must be taken (saith he) <hi>formaliter,
formally, quatenus,</hi> say the Logicians, <hi>as he is born of God.</hi>
This we may perceive to be the sence of the Text, because
throughout this Chapter the Apostle describes two sorts of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
good and evil, two principles from whence they came;
the good from God, whose sons we are called that do good, and
are as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imilated to him by such actions; the evil from the devil,
<hi>verse</hi> 8. Now these two principles are in every man; when he
doth well his actions come from God, and so far forth he is from
God; and when he doth evil his actions are from the devil, and
so far forth he is from the devil: nay we may not only find these
two principles working their effects in the same man, but like
<hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> strugling at the same time in the same womb,
who shall come out first, and like fire and water contending at
the same time for preheminence, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. insomuch that in the 24th verse it made him
cry out like a woman in labour of this birth, <hi>O wretched man that
I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> So that
these two principles are in the same man; perhaps sometimes he
sins, in that he sins, <hi>quatenus,</hi> as he sins, he is not born of God;
then he doth righteousness, out of that regard as he doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
he is born of God. Now yet that you may farther see
that this is the sence, see that this thread, this clew, must lead

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to the exposition of the pieces in this same business of this
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61847:102"/>
Chapter, <hi>verse 6. He who sinneth hath not seen God, nor known
God.</hi> This must be understood, <hi>quatenus,</hi> in that regard every
man hath sinned, then no man hath seen or known God, no,
but <hi>quatenus,</hi> in that regard that he sinneth, he hath not seen
God, nor knoweth him, he sets not God before his face, so that
there is a necessity of this exposition from the like speeches of the
Apostle; so likewise from that phrase in the 9th verse, <hi>He cannot
sin.</hi> (Certainly he who cannot sin, cannot but do righteously)
because he is born of God, out of that cause and principle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
he keeps himself close to that, <hi>quatenus,</hi> as he is born of God;
as likewise he sinneth not, because the seed remaineth in him:
yet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whilest the seed was in him, did sin, but not <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
A man may have the seed of God, and the seed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
together; the seed of God brings forth good fruit, the seed
of the Devil that which is ill; as he works from the seed of God
he cannot sin: and <hi>A Lapide</hi> expresseth in another phrase,
much conducing to the same purpose, <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a man working by that principle he cannot sin, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Devil he shall sin, but taking a man in <hi>sensu diviso,</hi> as
not knit to that principle, nor working by the divine seed, he
may sin.</p>
                  <p>Let us see then this Text applied to this business, <hi>He who is
born of God by Baptism, sinneth not,</hi> not <hi>quatenus, not so long as
he works according to the design</hi> and intent of Baptism, which is to
forsake the Devil, and follow Christ; and <hi>this seed</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<hi>remaineth in him,</hi> to produce sanctity and holiness of life,
which so long as it is watered and cherished, it will do: and be
sure when you do evil, you work from another principle; but
this no whit derogates from the constant union which such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
keeps as a member, or a filiation.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="section">

                  <head>SECT. IX. Another Argument against the Filiation
wrought in Baptism, answered.</head>
                  <p>I Would willingly clear this from all seeming opposition, and
therefore will discuss whatsoever appears to me of any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>I seem to place the Adoption, the Filiation of a Son of God,
in the Covenant of Baptism, and because that remains firm,
therefore this Filiation doth so likewise, and is not extirpate by
these greater sins. But now if it appear that this work is done by
other things, and not by it, then the foundation of this discourse
perisheth, and what is built upon it must fall to the ground; but
the Antecedent is true, <hi>Gal. 3. 26. Ye are all the Sons of God by
faith in Christ Jesus;</hi> there faith, not Baptism, is set down as
the mean of our Filiation.</p>
                  <p>I do not find faith put there as a constituting cause of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
but may well be a motive to it, and have a proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in it, but not the constitution of it. To understand
which, consider, that this Filiation is an Adoption, and so
there is two things requird, the consent of the parties, and the
obligatory Covenant which they both enter into. This is in this
Adoption; Christ would have all men to be saved, to repent and
come to him: they do covenant with him by Baptism to serve
him, as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> covenanted in Circumcision, to
serve God according to their Judaicall Laws, so do they with him
in Baptism, according to his Evangelicall Laws. Now as no
man will submit himself to any Father, by being adopted to him,
unless he believe that he will bless him, that his Covenants upon
Adoption shall be made good to him; so no man cometh unto
God, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God must believe
that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him.</hi> This
act of faith must precede every access to God; no man would
take this Covenant, no man be baptized and adopted without it:
and therefore although faith do not constitute the child of God,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61847:103"/>
yet it is the means of his constitution, but without which no man
would be constituted, and indeed not only <hi>sine quà non</hi> (as the
<hi>Logicians</hi> speak) but likewise a means moving, and inclining
men to it.</p>
                  <p>There is commonly objected the case of Infants, that they can
have no faith preceding their Baptism. I must not entangle my
self in all controversies of these times, and here handle this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
otherwise than this Objection exposeth it self against this
Conclusion; and therefore Answer, that as Infants have not
actuall faith of their own that any man can know of, so they do
not come with their own feet to Christ, neither doth Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
it of them, or any other, more than they can do: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may observe in that famous story recorded in our Baptism,
<hi>Mat. 19. 13. Mark. 10. 13. Luke</hi> 18. 15. That when they
<hi>brought little Children,</hi> or Infants, (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls them) <hi>and
the Disciples rebuked them who brought them, our Saviour rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Disciples, and said to them, Suffer little Children to come
unto me.</hi> First, mark this here, That these three Evangelists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
this fact, although they varied in other phrases, yet all
agree in these two, that these little ones were brought by other
men, and that our Saviour said, <hi>Suffer little Children to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me;</hi> whereas in things not substantiall to a story, the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
most oft vary in the relation: and we may observe so great
difference both in the phrases by which they are exprest, and
likewise in the very matter, that mens wits are much troubled to
reconcile them. So in materiall points the matter is constantly
the same; but when the phrase is the same likewise, it is a most
assured Argument that things were so disposed in that very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and words, and some excellent thing of high note is delivered,
which I conceive thus; If the Disciples had here replyed, we do
not hinder them from coming, we forbid only others to bring
them, oru Saviours reply was couched in the very words. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Infants, come with others feet when they bring them; now
no men come to God but believers; they come then with others
feet, why not believe with others faith as well? Nay there seems
to be great reason for it, because faith is necessary to coming,
that is, personall in them that can have personall faith, as their
own feet in them that have feet, but other mens feet serve the
turn for them who have none of their own, &amp; so other mens faith:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61847:104"/>
and for my part I wonder why we should be so shy to allow this
faith, since there is nothing more frequent in Scripture, than (as the
Bishop spake of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> though a man of a loose life, and carried
away with those wicked and horrid Opinions of the <hi>Manichees, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
tantarum lachrymarum non potest perire;</hi> He who had a Mother
so zealous for him with such showers of tears, would not perish;
her piety was powerfull with God for his good.) That other
mens faith and prayers are prevalent with God for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
or Friends good, I need not repeat the story of the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
Mat. 8. whose faith was powerfull to the curing of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<hi>verse</hi> 13. So likewise <hi>Mark</hi> 9. where Christ cured a
mans Son by the prayer of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ather, and did it upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
faith, as is evident by verse 23. <hi>If thou canst believe, all
things are possible to him that believeth;</hi> all things, then for other
men as well as for themselves. There are many such stories, but
men throw them off with this shift, that those things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their bodies, not their souls: Alas, what more reason is
there for one than the other? But see it more closely; read
<hi>Mark</hi> 2. 3. There many men bring <hi>one sick of the pulsie, who was
carried of four, and let down from the top of the house,</hi> verse 5.
It is said, <hi>That Jesus seeing their faith, said to the sick of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n, thy sins be forgiven thee.</hi> Observe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were divers
persons whose f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith he saw, and but one to whom he spake;
and because some avoid it, and say, that within this word <hi>(their)</hi>
is involved his who was sick, his faith as well as theirs who carried
him: although this will appear a forced explication to them who
consider the Text, yet let it be granted; I hope they will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> say
his faith alone, then theirs co-operated with him in the work,
then they could operate themselves, for no second causes do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
one with another, but when each hath the power, then
they had force of themselves towards the procuring of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
Consider then the blessing, <hi>Son, thy sins are forgiven
thee;</hi> what this was appears by the Dispute which followed: the
Scribes said, <hi>He spake blasphemy, none can forgive sins but God;</hi>
and our Saviour proved immediately that he was God, in the
21. verse, by saying <hi>to the sick of the palsie, arise, take up thy
bed, and walk,</hi> and did the miracle: so that it appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
first, that faith precedes to induce Baptism, before men can
come to God, that the coming of Infants is by others feet, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61847:104"/>
the faith pre-required in Children is other mens faith: for as it
is with all supernatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all works, there is a passive faith in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
necessary to make it capable of that miracle, without which,
miracles (in the course of Gods ordinary doing them) are not
wrought, and with which all things are possible, both for our
selves, or those which belong to us; and this faith in a Father is
powerfull for his Son, in a Master for his Servant. So is it in
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptism; faith is necessary to this great work of Adoption, but
faith of others in Children is only necessary: and this is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exprest in the practice of the Civil Law, which whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its rise from this, or Circumcision, or that the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which direct one, are evident in the other, I dispute not,
but it is some comfort even in Religion to see it illustrated by the
wayes of prudent nature, and the universall Axiomes of it. This
then is so illustrated, although Adoption requrie the consent of
both parties, yet personally that is only done in such as are <hi>sui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
grown to such years as they are masters of themselvs, and
their own actions: but such as are of such weak years, as they are
governed, and under parents, they can be, and are adopted by
their parents to another; an adopting Father, and their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
for the behalf and in the name of the Child, both oblige the
Child to filiall duties towards his new Father, and likewise the
Father to a fatherly care of the Son, both in life by protecting
him, and in death by estating him in his Inheritance. Thus did
God with the Children of the <hi>Jewes</hi> at Circumcision; that act by
the Parents made the Child a debtor to that law, and God to his
Covenant of mercy to him. So here is the hand of God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this act of Parents for their Children, in Nature, in the Law,
and in all footsteps of Gods Government, the same discipline is
observed. I will conclude somewhat like that passage in <hi>Petrus
Claniacensis,</hi> a man famous for learning and piety as any of that
Age, in the Treatise of his against the <hi>Petro-brusians,</hi> whose
Opinions agreed in the point with our <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> You see
multitudes of men in Scripture had a faith prevalent for others,
and those but single persons, or a few men that carried the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick;
shall not the faith of the world of the whole Church be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
to these Infants? A Father begs for his Son, a Master
for his Servant, shall not Christian Parents, yea the Christian
Church, be heard in prayer for these Infants? God hath Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61847:105"/>
                     <hi>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will
give it you,</hi> John 16. 22. Ask (say Divines) constantly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
for good things, according to Gods will, <hi>non ponenti Obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi>
either for himself or others, who do not stop by self-wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
the power of prayers; can then the constant prayers of the
Church, with that unshaken faith of hers, be denyed its efficacy,
in a thing so pleasing to God, to such persons who actually can
put no hinderance to the power and efficacy of that prayer?
These things in Christian men canot be denyed; and therefore
in brief to the Argument: Faith in all introduceth this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in Baptism, and moves the receiver to be adopted to God;
and therefore observe, that the Apostle, as he, verse 26. <hi>Ye are
all the Children of God by faith;</hi> so in the 27th verse he brings a
reason, <hi>For as many as are baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</hi>
The reason why they are the Children of God by faith, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that such as have this faith are moved to be baptized, and
they put on Christ. The faith of him who is master of his own
actions, makes him be baptized; the faith of him who is master
of his Childs actions, causeth him to bring his Child to this Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and yet (methinks) it hath not only power concerning
this blessing, before the act of Adoption, to bring men to it,
but even in it to accept it; for although there were all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the world to it before, yet if faith fail in the Act,
that man would hold from accepting such a Covenant, whereby
he had no confidence to be blessed: but this faith doth only
make him Covenant, but it self is not the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thus I suppose I have spoken abundantly to Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Argument, and to such Objections which I have thought
upon, as most opposing this Doctrine I have delivered: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I could frame many more of this nature, yet what is said
to these will serve the turn for them likewise; and therefore I
let them pass.</p>

This Tenent doth necessarily evidence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
to be a true Church, which is thus gathered.</p>
                  <p>Where all the members are true members, there the Church is a

                  <p>But all the members in all the Congregations of <hi>Rome</hi> are true
members, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Minor he proves, because they are baptized. I would
first know, what is the harm if we allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
be a true Church; true in the essentials of a Church, though
sick, and full of corrupt Doctrines. I have shewed, and it is
most true, that many men be in a Church, yea in the Catholick
Church, and not be saved; and perhaps there may be an whole
Church, such as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would have, and scarce a man of
them saved without the same means, as many in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are saved by. And therefore by the way I adde, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not only a Church, but a saving Church,
such as I doubt not but multitudes are saved in; for they have
not only a Doctrine of essentially true Baptism, to admit men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, but they have a Doctrine essentially true of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to let men out of it: and I am confident, that those
men which so die, with their repentance and contrition for sins,
and a desire of a new life, and a trust in Christ, that he hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for their sins, and have no wilfull errors, but their other
errors are such as are invincible, and upon that ground beg, with
<hi>David,</hi> the Lord to forgive them <hi>their secret sins;</hi> I say, such a
soul shall be saved, notwithstanding multitudes of errors both in
belief and practice. And this Doctrine is taught in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> although mixed with many errors, for which yet they
have many such seeming reasons, as to such who are not allowed
to converse with men, or read Books of another belief, may be
sufficient to excuse them at the last day. So that although the
errors taught in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are not safe, yet the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61847:106"/>
taught among them, annexed to that Doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
may be accepted by Almighty God, according to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in Jesus Christ, to their salvation. This Controversie
hath been most learnedly handled by <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and others:
I let it pass therefore, and will examine his Major, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
far from truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where all the members are true members, there the Church is a
true Church.</hi> This Proposition is false: all the members of a
dog are true members, all the members of a man are true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
but there is no true Church where that Turk is, or where
that dog is. Thus as he sets it down, it is grosly false; nor can
I adde any one term to mend it: the likeliest I can may be
this;</p>
                  <p>That Church where every member is a true member, that
Church is a true Church: But yet this is false, according to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for a Church as we dispute of, it is <hi>totum Integrale,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that notion we conceive it to have members, but many times
there may be many hands and many feet which stick together,
and yet do not make a true <hi>totum Integrale,</hi> which consists of a
perfect body, with all its severall parts, and yet these are true
parts of their severall bodies, these hands of <hi>Richard,</hi> those of
<hi>William:</hi> so there may be divers Lay-men Congregated, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Pastors, which are severally each of them true members per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of other Congregations, yet in that body make not
up a true Church, which consists of all parts, Pastors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me adde one term more; In that Church where all the
members are true members of it, there that Church is a true
Church. This is false likewise: for in a representative Officer,
each member is a true member of him; of a false or counterfeit
King, each member is a true member of him, but he is not a true
Officer, or true King; and for him to urge that he who is a false
Officer is no Officer, and that Congregation which is not a true
Church is no Church, then he by making these members of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and calling it a Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> makes it a
true Church himself. So that either this Proposition means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or it is absolutely false.</p>
                  <p>This I speak, to shew that although the Conclusion which he
conceives of an undeniable evidence, were true, (as I have
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61847:106"/>
proved it false) yet it would in no means be deduced from that
Major, no not with the addition of two or three the most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
terms I could adde to it; and so I come to his fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
which is thus framed.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. XI. His fourth Argument answered.</head>
                  <p>THat which is a Seal of the Covenant, and our Incorporation
into the Church visible, that cannot be the form of it.</p>
                  <p>At primum verum, Ergo.</p>
                  <p>I put down his very words, which forceth me to adde his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<hi>But Baptism is the Seal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo, Baptism is not the
form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proposition he proves thus, <hi>Because the Seal comes after
the thing sealed, but the form goes before.</hi> These things are so
grosly delivered, and so without all illustration, that it is hard
to speak to it, for this is all he speaks in that place to this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
what he addes against Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> I am nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in, nor do I know what Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> replyes to this,
nor can conceive it by him. In a word, I deny his Major.
That (say I) which is the Seal may be the form of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
in such cases where the Seal is made an essentiall part of it,
as in such deeds where Sealing is necessary, as in Law, where
signing, sealing, and delivering, altogether, make the form of that
Covenant where they are so required; and Baptism is all these:
so that if he had said, that which is a Seal alone cannot make the
form, I would have denyed his Minor, and have said, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
is not a bare Sign, as he will and doth confess, but signing
and delivering on both sides.</p>
                  <p>Now to illustrate this Proposition; in such cases such Seals as
I have described, are the form of those Covenants. Consider,
that the form of every thing is that which gives it ability to work
that which is its proper work; this doth signing, sealing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
do: every Deed is like a dead body before, but when
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61847:107"/>
sealed it receives a soul, and is able to work, which it could not
do before. Again, the form of every thing is the last addition
to it; that which he speaks, in his proof that a form goes before
the thing sealed, or rather informed or constituted, and a Seal
comes after, is very vain and weak: for it is true, as it being a
constituting principle, and a cause of that it produceth, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the <hi>Logicians</hi> speak, <hi>prius naturâ, non effectu,</hi> before it in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not in time. The Sun is in nature before its light, because
its light proceeds out of it; fire before heat, yet they are <hi>simul
tempore,</hi> children of the same birth, and one cannot be without
both are. The soul of man is before a man in nature, because it
is a constituting cause; yet by them that hold it created, <hi>Crean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
infunditur, &amp; infundendo creatur;</hi> and they that hold it <hi>ex
Traduce,</hi> give it no prae-existence in time to the man; and what
he sayes of a Seal, it comes after: in such cases where Seals are
essentiall, they are before the Seal comes, and like a soul put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a body, it gives it ability to work, and in that state is prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in nature. So that you see, Seals in such Deeds as well as
forms, are before the vivacity of a Covenant in nature, though
both are <hi>simul</hi> in time; and therefore such Seals may be forms,
and indeed are forms, as is before exprest, being that which gives
the Covenant sealed its form and power to work, and likewise the
last thing which comes to actuate that thing in which it is: but
because that when the Seal is gone, yet the form of the Covenant
remains, and forms having permanent beings as Seals transient,
it may be further doubted how Seals can be forms. This I urge,
though not a Book-Objection, (as indeed I do not find the
Question disputed in the School under this Notion) but only
which started it self in my thoughts whilest I was writing, and
indeed may do so with others, for I am unwilling to let any thing
pass which may disturb a Readers assenting; and therefore in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this Objection do say, that although the Seal be gone,
yet its image, its likeness, when it is gone, remains in the Wax,
which is as valid to all its intentions, as it self, and is the Seal, <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,</hi>
in its morall existence, to all those morall effects which
it produceth: so it is in Baptism; there is that the School calls
the <hi>Character,</hi> which remains after the act of Baptism is gone,
and is powerfull to all its effects. I did avoid to speak of
this intricate business, hoping I might have escaped it; but
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61847:107"/>
since I cannot, do thus undertake it now, and define it
thus.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. What the Character left in Baptism is; and
this Character defined.</head>
                  <p>THe Character or Relict of Baptism, by which a Christian is
constituted a member of the Catholick Church, is a spiritual
power, by which the baptized man is interessed with right,
both to receive and do what belongs to a member of Christs
Church.</p>
                  <p>First, It is a <hi>power:</hi> Powers are either <hi>active,</hi> or <hi>passive;
active,</hi> to do, as fire to burn; <hi>passive,</hi> to suffer, or receive, as
wood hath a passive power to receive the ignifying nature of fire,
which gold hath not. This relict of Baptism doth both these,
both enable a man to demand and receive Confirmation; to
joyn with the Christian Congregation in devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions and prayers;
to demand and receive absolution, the Communion, with all
other things which a Christian man doth in his severall duties and
occasions. But we must here distinguish betwixt <hi>natural powers,</hi>
and <hi>moral;</hi> the first are faculties in man, by which he is enabled
by that internall principle, to act what the power directs him to,
and no man obtains any such, but by a reall change and alteration
in himself to some absolute quality, as a power to walk, to
speak, or the like, that he had not before. But in <hi>moral powers,</hi>
as the right to an Estate or to an Office, these may come to a
man without any such alteration: As the father dyes, the son is
immediately invested with the power of his fathers Estate, and
yet the son is the same in all absolute things, hath no such change
in himself. Again, a man is chose a Generall, a King, he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h
in himself no such change, no such alteration, but is the same he
was before in all absolute things. In <hi>moral powers</hi> we are not to
expect an alteration in the party who receives them, to any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
reality: so that although in a baptized person, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61847:108"/>
these mighty <hi>powers,</hi> we can discover no alteration, yet
these <hi>powers</hi> are in him, by the force of this <hi>moral form,</hi> which
enables him to act or receive such or such things.</p>
                  <p>Next let us consider that it is a <hi>spiritual power:</hi> that Attribute
is given it in regard of its object, and end, because the power
aims at spirituall blessings, and is conversant about spirituall
means, to obtain this end: for as it is called morall, because it
considers not naturall actions, but such as concern a mans man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
his doing well or ill in relation to God, and that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Community in which he lives; so it is spirituall, in respect of
the spirituall conversation it hath with God, and those men of
whose society it is.</p>
                  <p>And now we seeing the <hi>genus</hi> in this definition, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the <hi>difference, a power by which he is interessed with right:</hi>
here is apparent that which was implyed before, that it is not a
naturall but a morall power: naturall powers enable a man to
do, as the power to move, to speak; but the morall power
gives him not ability, but authority and right to move or speak
thus; or now he hath interest and right to do it, to receive and
do (this power is both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive,</hi> as before) what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to a member of Christs Church. This gives him interest in
no civill right, nor Office in the Church, but only a right as a
member, that is, such a right as by Christs Laws appertain to
him: If a sinner, in such a degree, he is shut out of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
if a penitent, he may require absolution, and by his being
baptized, he is made capable of these, which otherwise before,
and without Baptism, he was not.</p>

                  <p>THus this Definition being explained, there is a great Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what manner of thing, in what Predicament this relict
power is] For my part, without disparagement of my great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in Philosophy, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I think that these <hi>spiritual &amp; theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
powers</hi> need not be tugged into any of his <hi>Predicaments,</hi> nor
was he to be blamed as insufficient in his number, because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted only with naturall things, found out names for
them in his Ten; but being ignorant of spirituall, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
leave them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd such as studied them, to shift for their
room elsewhere: and we might therefore with more ease invent
another for them, than be forced with unjust violence to hale
them to these, which were only provided for naturall things.
But yet because those old names would better please a Reader, I
will keep my self to them.</p>
                  <p>And first, I opine that <hi>this relict is of a relative nature,</hi> in its
proper being, for it is that interest which a man hath as before in
Christ as his head, and the rest of the Church as his fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which is a relation, for <hi>pars &amp; totum, part and the whole
are relates,</hi> so are head and member, in such bodies as have
heads; and in this consists the nature of this <hi>relict,</hi> and therein
are seated all the <hi>interests</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> which a baptized man
hath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aquinas,</hi> with that great Army of learned men who follow
his colours, sight against this Conclusion vehemently, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Arguments seemingly powerfull, the nature of which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such matter as is not usuall in English Authors, it may
chance not be unpleasing to him who reads this, to study a little
that Christian Philosophy which will be opened in this discourse;
and I am confident, it will by drawing aside such curtains as are
interposed, give admittance to such light as will illustrate the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in hand to any easie sight: and therefore I undertake
them. The first Argument urged by <hi>Cabrera,</hi> (for I will take
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61847:109"/>
them where I find them strongest maintained) <hi>Cabrera in 3.
Quest. 63. Art. 2. Disp. 1. Sect. 3. Conclus.</hi> 3. thus argues,
<hi>There is no motion to a bare relation, (ad relationem per se,</hi> is his
phrase) for this he produceth <hi>Aristotle, 5. Phys. Text.</hi> 10. for
saith he, <hi>all change is to an absolute form, but there is a motion to
this Character,</hi> (as he and the whole School call it; I term it
the relict) for <hi>the Sacramentall motion is terminated in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
as is evident in him who should feignedly take this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he receives nothing but the meer Character, no grace,
nor any other supernaturall quality, but only this Character. I
may urge it further, because, as I have shewed, this relict may
remain in a man who is void of all grace, and full of all impiety,
and therefore is something in it self, which is the <hi>terminus,</hi> the
bound, the effect of that motion.]</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Motion is to Relation.</head>
                  <p>I Answer to this, that motion is to relation, and that relations
may be the effects of motions, that language which <hi>Scotus</hi>
and his followers use in the explication of this Conclusion, is not
amiss; that it is true, such relations which arise <hi>ab intrinseco,</hi>
from some inward principle, cannot be produced without a
change in the subject, or <hi>fundamentum,</hi> or the object to which it
is referred; but such relations which arise <hi>ab extrins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>co,</hi> from
abroad, are terms and proper effects of motions. His followers,
<hi>Franciscus de Pitigianis, Ruiz, Faber Faventinus, in Q. 4. Dist.
6. Quest.</hi> 10. amongst the later: as likewise the more ancient
touching upon it, explain this distinction thus, These relations
arise from within, out of the very nature of both the relates,
which putting both the relates in actuall being, that respect must
needs arise out of them, (and this indeed must shew such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to arise from an inward principle, because it results from their
being, like heat from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire, as soon as it is. For instance, a son
and a father are no sooner in the world both at the same time,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61847:109"/>
but there ariseth out of them that mutuall relation of fatherhood
and filiation; so likewise no sooner is one paper dyed black, but
there ariseth that mutuall similitude and likeness it hath with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paper which was black before: that relation comes from
abroad, which doth not naturally arise out of the being of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
but requires something else to give it a proper being.
They illustrate it thus; an agent and patient have relation one to
the other, but the agent, as fire, and the patient, as wood,
may both he in being, yet not have their relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
they may be at such a distance, as the fire cannot work
upon the wood; yea in a sit distance, and all things else dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
there may be some medium interposed, and the fire not be
agent, nor the wood patient, and without any new change in
either of them, but the removing the interposed body, they
shall have instantly the relation of agent and patient; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only of the interposed body, without any new absolute qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
introduced into either, the fire or the wood, shall cause that
relation: thus they; but see it clearer in those morall relations
which have a nearer affinity with this of my business in hand; a
man is chosen Mayor of a Town, Judge in a Circuit, he is the
same in all absolute things he was before, can do no physicall or
naturall act which he could not before, he was as wise before,
could before give sentence as well as after, but his sentence was
not definitive before this, only that relation which the power of
the Magistrate gave him of being a Judge or Mayor, enabled
him with, and this was extrinsecall, from abroad; for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Town or parties to be judged were before, but only
this outward investiture in his Office, (outward in respect of
both the relates) gave him this being. So it is with the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in hand; the baptized man had all the absolute qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he hath afterwards; he could receive the Communion,
he could pray with the Congregation, he could be absolved, the
same things he could do or suffer, but he had right to none, he
could not do or receive these blessings effectively before he was
baptized: he was before, Christ was before, the Church was
before, but his relations to neither were before, but this act of
Baptism introduced them. And thus relation we see may be the
term and effect of such motion, for mutation or change is what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hath <hi>novum,</hi> else a new thing is something which it was
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61847:110"/>
not before, now that which hath a new relation, is something
that it was not before: the Mayor is the Governor of his Town,
the Judge of his Circuit; so a baptized man, a Christian, which
he was not before. I think there needs no more be spoken to
the first Argument; for the place in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the <hi>Scotists</hi> say,
it is only to be understood of those relations which have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from an inward principle, not such as are from abroad, that
it is true of those which are in the predicament of relation, not of
all respects which are transcendent, or of which the six last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments
are constituted; for <hi>Suarez</hi> makes Angelicall motion
to be to the predicament of <hi>ubi,</hi> which is one of those respects
which constitute a Predicament of themselves, but are not in the
predicament of relation: And we may observe, that our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
of our body in our place to a new <hi>situs,</hi> is a motion to a
relation, which is another Predicament of the same nature.
But <hi>Cabrera,</hi> where before, saith, that <hi>Dominicus Soto</hi> despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
this Answer, in 4. <hi>Dist. 1. Quest. 4. Art.</hi> 2. You may read
it towards the later end of that Article; His Answer is, <hi>That
there is no such thing as a relation arising out of any outward cause,
for every relation ariseth immediately out of its foundation:</hi> The
instances of <hi>Scotus</hi> he seems to overthrow. First, That of fire,
(saith he) the foundation of the relation, to the patient the
wood, is the action of warming, not the heat; but let that warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
act to the wood have its being, presently the relation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults:
and for the action to <hi>Vbi,</hi> he denies <hi>Vbi</hi> to be a relation,
but the <hi>esse in loco,</hi> to be in a place, which is a reall thing. I
will not dispute these instances, although they are the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
given by the <hi>Scotists,</hi> and they do not observe this reply in
this place; but my instances of a Mayor or Judge can in no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be excepted against, for there is the Mayor absolutely the
same way endowed with all qualities and defects as before, who
is the foundation of this relation, and he living in the same Town,
conversing with the same men, and yet hath this new relation of
being Mayor, arising from the constitution of an outward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and that motion from an outward cause works no change in
him to any reall and absolute quality. But perhaps he will say,
that this Mayoralty is the foundation of that relation, and so the
relation immediately results out of it: Let him tell me then what
that Mayoralty is, but that relation he hath to that Society of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61847:110"/>
which he is Mayor; for certainly he can make it nothing else,
but that very Mayoralty must be that relation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I Come therefore to his second Argument, which is clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that before: for as he said, Motion could not be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in relation; so now he saith,</hi> Relation cannot be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of any reall action or passion: but this relict or Character of
Baptism is the principle of those receivings of those blessings, before
spoken of; therefore it cannot be a relation.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, His Major hath no foundation to build upon.
Look upon all <hi>moral relations,</hi> as I have before shewed, yea up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>moral powers</hi> in <hi>natural relations;</hi> as you may see, a Father is
no sooner a Father, but presently out of that Fatherhood ariseth
that <hi>moral power</hi> to have dominion over his Son, and that duty of
providing for him: so likewise from the <hi>relation of Mayoralty</hi>
ariseth that power of governing and ruling in the Corporation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So that although perhaps naturall <hi>relations</hi> are not <hi>principles</hi> of
naturall actions, nor do they give men naturall powers, as by
being a Father, a man neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps the
better; yet <hi>relations</hi> are principles of morall actions and passions,
and give their morall powers interests and duties, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
result out of those <hi>relations:</hi> and of this nature is this, they
are morall endowments, spiritually morall, as before explained,
to act or receive the blessings appertaining to such members.</p>

                     <hi>A Third reason of his is, That</hi> one relation cannot be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of another; <hi>this is by some confirmed,</hi> That if it
could be founded in another, there would be relation upon relation,
infinitely.</p>
                  <p>This is absolutely false likewise as well as the other Major. To
prove this, the instances of <hi>Scotus</hi> and his followers are such as
abide dispute; I will avoid that, and make it as clear as day:
Two sheets of paper have the same writings, or (if you will)
but black spots in them, these two sheets have a similitude or
likeness in them; then take two sheets of parchment, and let
them have the same writings or spots in them; there the first <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
is the foundation immediately of the second similitude, as
<hi>relations;</hi> yet clearer, <hi>Fatherhood</hi> in <hi>Thomas</hi> is a <hi>relation,</hi> so is
<hi>Fatherhood</hi> in <hi>Peter;</hi> from hence results a likeness betwixt these
two, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> which is founded only upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>relation</hi> of <hi>Fatherhood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is in vain for men to say that similitude is only in qualities;
for whether it be <hi>equality</hi> in <hi>quantities,</hi> or <hi>identity</hi> in <hi>substance,</hi>
or <hi>convenience</hi> in any other <hi>Predicament,</hi> a <hi>relation</hi> results from
one as well as the other. So then although this relict of Baptism
be a <hi>relation,</hi> yet it may found and support, be the <hi>subjectum quo,</hi>
the <hi>immediate subject,</hi> by reason of which other <hi>relations</hi> are in
the <hi>substance.</hi> Now that which was urged for confirmation,
that <hi>then relations might be multiplyed infinitely,</hi> is of no force,
for there is, as we see in the former instances, a fixation, that
there must be a bound beyond which it cannot go: nor is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of more force in <hi>relations,</hi> then because there is a <hi>cause of
a cause,</hi> therefore there should be infinite causes; for we know
there must be one fixed.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> where is its foundation, that must be either natural or
supernatural; natural it cannot be, because it is spiritual; and
supernatural it cannot be, because it self is the first spiritual thing
in man: now, every relation must have some absolute thing to found
it on.</hi> This Argument I do not find obsorved by any of the
School of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and therefore must say somewhat to it, which
to me seems not yet delivered in the School in this Conclusion.
I say therefore, that it is one thing to speak of the <hi>foundation
of a relation,</hi> another thing to speak of the <hi>terminus,</hi> or <hi>subject,</hi>
or <hi>correlate:</hi> as thus, the <hi>subject</hi> of a <hi>Fatherhood</hi> is the man who
is the Father, the <hi>correlate</hi> is his Son, the <hi>foundation</hi> is his power
of getting a Son, or his act, in that permanent being in which it
remains. So in two white sheets of paper, <hi>the relate or subject</hi> is
the white sheet, the <hi>correlate</hi> to which it is referred is the other
white sheet, the <hi>foundation</hi> is the whiteness. Thus it is in all these
<hi>relations</hi> which are <hi>natural,</hi> because their <hi>relations</hi> arise from
within, their <hi>foundation</hi> must be internall; but in morall <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
whose originall is from abroad, there the <hi>foundation</hi> of this
<hi>relation</hi> must be abroad: as thus, What is the <hi>foundation</hi> of this
mans <hi>Mayoralty,</hi> but either the <hi>Charter</hi> by which it is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or else the will of the Supream, or both, or whatsoever
from without gave him that being of that <hi>relation.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this case, I say, the <hi>foundation of this relation,</hi> this relict,
which is the <hi>membership of Christ,</hi> is the will of God, who hath
thus constituted a baptized man a member of his Church; and
this is a supernatural thing, and that which alone can endow a
man with this membership: this he doth by his sacred Word,
which hath confirmed this to us.</p>

first, out of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Councill, in that Decree of union,
which indeed might rather be called the Decree of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the
4th; but howsoever that Decree hath no more, but that these
three <hi>Sacraments, Baptism, Confirmation, and Orders, imprint
an indelible Character,</hi> which is a Sign, all which may be allowed
<hi>Ens Rationis.</hi> Secondly, out of the Councill of <hi>Trent, Sess. 7.
Cap. de Sacr. Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 9. which saith no more than the other, that
<hi>this Character is a spirituall indelible Sign,</hi> so that were I of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to their own principles, even in this
Age, (for he is excused from heresie by them, writing before
these Decrees, but his opinion is condemned by most now after
these Canons) yet I say, even now amongst themselves he might
be defended by these Canons, much better than they who hold it
to be a <hi>reall absolute quality;</hi> for if it be a <hi>Sign,</hi> a <hi>Sign</hi> is a <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
and that is but a shift to say this word <hi>Sign</hi> is put for an
explicatory <hi>term,</hi> not as the <hi>Genus,</hi> since in these two Councills
it enjoys the place of a <hi>Genus,</hi> as is evident in these Canons; and
then <hi>Signs</hi> may be <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> as most be which are not <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Signs,</hi> but by <hi>Institution,</hi> of which nature this is. The
chief reason that I find may be that of <hi>Pitigianus, in Theol. spec.
&amp; moral. Dist. 6. Quest. 10. Art. 1. That if the Characters of
these Sacraments should be</hi> Entia Rationis <hi>only, then the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the new Testament should no othewise impress its Character,
than the Priesthood of the old Law.</hi> To this I answer, That I
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61847:113"/>
know no need that it should: but yet <hi>Vasquez, Quest. 63. Art.
3. Disp. 134. Cap. 2. Num. 34. in</hi> 3. saith, That this <hi>Character
differs from the other, because that was delible, this not;</hi> but this
is weak, because <hi>delibility</hi> or <hi>indelibility</hi> are extrinsecall things to
the nature of a <hi>Character,</hi> and both what is <hi>delible</hi> and what
is <hi>indelible</hi> may have their beings upon <hi>reason,</hi> or else be
<hi>real.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cabrera, in 3 Quest. 63. Art. 2. Disp. 1. Sec.</hi> 2. urgeth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
as before against relation, so here against this, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
being <hi>Ens Rationis:</hi> first, <hi>a real action hath a
real term; but this Character doth terminate a real action,</hi>
therefore.</p>
                  <p>The Major is so extreamly false, that indeed there is no <hi>Ens
Rationis</hi> in the world which doth not terminate a <hi>real act:</hi> take
the most fictitious <hi>Chymaera</hi> that ever was, which is the most
purely the work of humane reason; yet even when I say it is the
work of reason, I make it the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>term</hi> of a <hi>real act,</hi> which
is <hi>mans reason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, (saith he)</hi> If a Character should be <hi>Relatio rationis,</hi>
then the effect of every Sacrament should be a Character, because
there are relations of reason in them all.</p>
                  <p>This hath no consequence at all; for although a <hi>Character</hi>
were a <hi>relation of reason,</hi> yet it doth not follow that every <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I conceive the Arguments opposed to <hi>Durand,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,

                  <head>SECT. II. The constitution of Man, and likeness to
God.</head>
                  <p>NOw to understand the truth of this Question; <hi>Paulo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora
Canamus,</hi> conceive, as it is described in the first of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> that God made all the world, and the things that are in
it; when he had done, he made man after his own image, as it
is described there; a little God to govern the world which he had
made, under God; and not so only, but this image did glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in the soul of man, not only that as God made the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
so he gave man the authority to give them their names,
but likewise that he gave his soul a power to make another world
as he had done this: so that as God hath made one world, so
man, in the power of his imagination, of his reasonable imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath made a thousand more; and can imagine that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power may, and hath made so many worlds, that this to that
number should be but as a mote to this. He can make a world
in the Moon; and as wise men do concerning this, so such men
can and have philosophized what men do and ought to do in that:
he can make nations of Pigmies, Silves, Nymphs, and philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize
what their natures are, and what their manners; yea some
have told what their religion and duty to God is: he can go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and take in pieces this world, and joyn a man, an horse,
and a bird together; and his busie fancie can bring forth births
monstrous, to all the effects of God in nature; yea you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these expressions wonderfull in the Prophets. Now as the
works of God which he made are such as we call <hi>reall things,</hi> both
those <hi>absolute entities,</hi> and those which are <hi>relations,</hi> for those
<hi>relations</hi> which God hath made by the hand of nature, (as
smoak and fire, father and son, and the like, are <hi>reall relations;</hi>
so those works which are wrought by mens reason alone, those
are <hi>Entia rationis,</hi> the things of reason, all <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> all men
in the Moon, all imagined things, which have no existence in the
world, out of mans head and intellect; these are things of mans
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61847:114"/>
making, and attain not that excellency of Gods works to be <hi>reall
things,</hi> but barely things of <hi>reason.</hi> Yet besides this, God hath
not only given man power to make these strange beings, existing
in mans own intellect, but likewise to mix them, and joyn them
with his own <hi>reall things.</hi> So we may see amongst men which
are Gods creatures, and reall things; men make by the power
of their intellect this man a master, that a servant: this humane
power gives the particular interests which severall men have in
these reall estates; for although the right of dominion which one
hath over another, or over any of the creatures, is confirmed
by God, and the duties belonging to those relations, the reall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
exacted by him, yet the particular way of interest is allowed
to humane institution. Thus have men power to adde to divine
works and beings, their relations, which so far as they are of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
making, are things of reason, nor reall; and these are the
works, <hi>Rationis ratiocinatae,</hi> which reason finds some foundation
in the things for, but not <hi>ratiocinantis</hi> only, which have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of mans soul which made them. Now then to apply
this to our purpose; this <hi>relict of Baptism</hi> is a <hi>relation of Gods
constituting</hi> barely, where man hath nothing to do, but meerly
as a <hi>morall instrument,</hi> to administer, of himself giving no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
making no constitution concerning it, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>Ens rationis;</hi> all such things as exist without humane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
without humane invention, are reall, such is this: did no
man in the world contribute any thing to it, but only that instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
application; did no man think upon it, yet God had a
near particular interest in that baptized person, and would exact
his proper duties from him, which were not in a man unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:
So then this being a work of Gods, must be a <hi>reall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
not only of <hi>reason.</hi>

why it is <hi>Relatio rationis:</hi> The first of which is,</p>
                  <p>As <hi>(saith he)</hi> money receives its value and price from humane
institution, so <hi>(saith he)</hi> do natural things receive the nature of
a Sacrament from divine institution: but money receives its price
and value from a relation of humane reason so appointing it;
therefore, <hi>(saith he)</hi> these things receive the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from a relation of divine reason so appointing it: therefore
<hi>again (saith he)</hi> since a Character is that by which in orders one
man is capable of giving the Sacraments, and another in Baptism
to receive them, it is nothing but a relation of reason by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
                  <p>I consent so far as he saith it is a <hi>relation,</hi> without any dispute;
but it is a <hi>relation of divine making</hi> and <hi>confirming,</hi> and therefore
not barely a <hi>relation of reason,</hi> which in its use of speaking is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the constitution of mans soul, but it is a <hi>real relation,</hi>
such as God makes; for if those are <hi>real relations</hi> which naturally
result out of the <hi>principles of nature,</hi> because that is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
much rather are those <hi>real</hi> which by the immediate hand
and power of God are ordained, as this: and therefore although
I think he hath better explained the nature of this <hi>Character</hi> than
others, yet he spake too diminishingly of such a most heavenly
and divine work, to call it a <hi>relation of reason;</hi> and therefore

which is the Greek, which is the most original language that
Book is delivered to us in. I must confess the sentence is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it is a noble work to clear an obscure piece of wisdome, and
free it from the incumbrances of Scholastick discourses; and I am
perswaded, as he was of himself, he did it, only he gives it too
poor a name, for by this way all the great effects of <hi>Baptism</hi> are
justified, of making us the <hi>Sons of God, members of his body,</hi>
the Church; and yet men need be troubled with none of these
nicityes which the School is perplexed with: as when a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made with men, and their Seal set to it, they will be
forced to make it good, though their will be wicked, by the
Justice of the Land; so God who is Justice it self, will make
good whatsoever promise he hath made, and set his Seal to.
We need not seek for new <hi>entities</hi> in the soul, whether <hi>powers</hi> or

I must oppose all in that, as well as the former. Some put

this life, where the soul of man and his body are united; not
with the soul in heaven or hell, as is imagined in generall by the
School, for which I see no Argument of strength objected:
That which is said, <hi>That if a man baptized, after his death with</hi>
Lazarus <hi>should be raised again, or a Priest who had received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
should that man be consecrated or baptized again?</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> answer,
no; for although there was a suspension of the personality of that
man, yet he is the same individuall person he was, and hath the
same <hi>relations</hi> he had: If he arise in the same flesh, he hath the
same <hi>fatherhood,</hi> and <hi>filiation</hi> to the same persons; he hath the
same <hi>similitudes</hi> and <hi>dissimilitudes,</hi> the same <hi>equalities</hi> and <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities;</hi>
and therefore likewise as in these, so in this, he is the
same. Thus the nature of this <hi>relict</hi> being explained, as I hope,
so far as is usefull to the understanding of any man, we see which
way to expound that place before touched, <hi>Gal. 3. 27. As many
as are baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</hi> What, have they
in the preterperfect Tense? have they renewed themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to righteousness and true holiness? have they cast off the
polluted raggs of their corrupted nature, and cloathed themselves
with the glorious robe of Christs righteousness? no, not in act,
but in obligation, like him who is admitted into any Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61847:116"/>
or Office of Government, he presently is a Governor,
and we may say, hath taken upon him, and put on the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that place, when perhaps he never did, nor perhaps
ever will do act of justice, yet he hath the bond and obligation
to do it immediately, he is responsible for his neglect; so is it
with men baptized; when they <hi>are baptized into Christ,</hi> they
have taken this duty upon them, and they are by a new bond,
which is the <hi>relict</hi> of this <hi>Baptism,</hi> made debtors to Christian
duties, whether they pay them or no.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V. My Definition reconciled with this Discourse.</head>
                  <p>THere is yet one Objection left which I think my self bound
to satisfie, which is, That I defined this <hi>relict of Baptism
by the Genus of a power;</hi> but in all my Discourse I have made it a
<hi>relation:</hi> for answer to this, I say, I defined it by that which
delivered the <hi>nature</hi> of it most clearly to our capacity, the essence
of powers being more easily discerned than that of relations.
But farther conceive, that these <hi>moral relations</hi> either are <hi>powers,</hi>
or the <hi>immediate foundations</hi> of them, as we may discern in those
which are instanced in before, as a King, a Judge, a Mayor,
and the like: These either are those <hi>powers,</hi> or have those <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
most naturally flowing out of them; about which if any will
contend, I am weary of Dispute: Let him correct the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and say, It is a <hi>relation</hi> by which a man hath a <hi>spiritual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and it will come all to the same effect.</p>
                  <p>I have done now with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> his third Argument, from

               <head>CHAP. XV. How there may be Pastors of Pastors.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Come therefore now to the satisfaction of his fourth and last
Argument in this cause, which is thus framed,</hi> pag. 75. <hi>of the
second Part.</hi> Chap. 2. If the essentials of a Pastor be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Eldership or Bishop meerly, then there will be Pastor of
Pastors, and that in propriety of speech. <hi>He no way illustrates
this, or proves it, but only thus: for (saith he)</hi> the Pastor
that is made by them hath reference to them, and dependance upon
them, as Pastors only, for it is that which is contended for in the
Question in hand, that it should be appropriate to their places to
make Officers.</p>
               <p>For Answer, first, to this last; If this were it which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, he should have proved what he contended for: See
his proof, how weak by a retortion; if this consequence were
true, <hi>That if the essentials of a Pastor were communicated by the
Elders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then there will be Pastors of Pastors,</hi> &amp;c. Then
the truth of this ariseth out of this, that because Elders give <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
their Office, therefore they should be their Pastors: then it
holds by the same Logick, that if the people give the <hi>Pastor</hi> his
essentials, then the people should be <hi>Pastors of their Pastors,</hi> then
the flock should be Shepherds of their Shepherds, which would
have served well in the Play of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and compleat the
Jest of that witty man, who said, that heretofore <hi>God led the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
like sheep by the hands of</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, but now they lead
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> like sheep by the hands of the people. And
indeed thus it happens with them in this Controversie, they give
the people power of <hi>ordination</hi> and <hi>correction</hi> of their <hi>Pastors,</hi> so
that the <hi>Corporation</hi> judges their <hi>Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Scholars</hi> whip their
<hi>Masters,</hi> the <hi>Sheep</hi> have power to expell their <hi>Shepherd,</hi> the
<hi>Children</hi> to punish their <hi>spiritual Parents;</hi> than which nothing
can be conceived more abhorring to reason. But then leaving
the examination of this rerortion, let us consider the Argument
it self; <hi>If Pastors should be made by Elders or Bishops, then Pastors
should be Pastors of Pastors:</hi> Doth he mean, that these <hi>inferiour
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61847:117"/>
Pastors</hi> should be sheep to the <hi>superiour?</hi> that follows not: see
an invincible instance; Suppose a <hi>superiour Pastor-Shepherd</hi>
should have power given him to constitute all the <hi>inferiour Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
or Officers,</hi> (which is the Polity agreeing in the analogy to
all States, and all great families which resemble little States) in
this case, it would not follow that the <hi>inferiour Pastors were sheep,
but under-Shepherds,</hi> which he governs, not as <hi>sheep,</hi> but as <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi>
somewhat inferiour to himself. Secondly, Let it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that the <hi>inferiour Pastors</hi> are governed like <hi>inferiours,</hi>
which are accountable to the <hi>superiour,</hi> this is so far from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any inconvenience with it, that it is most consenting to all the
Ecclesiastick and Politick Governments which are setled by
God in Church or State, and all those prudent Authorities
which our wise men, imitating God, have established in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
So that then this Argument falls to the ground;
and this being all that he hath urged in this case, he hath said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to prove, that the <hi>election of the people gives the essentials to
an Officer.</hi> So I have now ended his third Question, <hi>viz. What
Ordination is.</hi> Secondly, His first Question, <hi>Whether Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
precede Election.</hi> Thirdly, His second Question, <hi>Whether
Ordination gives all the essentials to an Officer.</hi> Now I come to
his fourth and last, <hi>Part. 2. pag.</hi> 74. To whom the right of
dispensing this Ordinance doth appertain.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. To whom the right of dispensing this Ordinance
doth appertain.</head>
               <p>IN the handling of this Question, he seemeth to me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
most wildly; yet he proposeth this method; 1. <hi>To
state the Question,</hi> then to <hi>confirm his Conclusion.</hi> In that which
he calleth stating the Question, he discourseth upon some Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
The first is, <hi>page 76. When the Churches are compleated
with all the Officers of Christ, the right or rite of Ordination</hi> (the
margent cannot tell whether it be right or rite) <hi>belongs to the
teaching Elders; the act appertains to the Presbyters of ruling and
teaching Elders, when an Officer is invested in his place; for of
these it is expresly spoken,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. This is all his proof,
of which place I have spoken, I think, abundantly, in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
the case of <hi>Episcopacy:</hi> but consider the Conclusion;
1. He <hi>supposeth a Church compleated with all its Officers;</hi> then
there is none lacking, then there can be none elected or ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, because in his Divinity <hi>Election is Ordination.</hi>
2. He sayes, that the <hi>right of Ordination belongs to the teaching
Elders.</hi> Mark; here a man would think were a learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
and an heedless Reader would be beguiled by such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>act:</hi> but, consider, that the <hi>right of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
is nothing but the <hi>Jus,</hi> the Authority to do it, for <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is an act;</hi> how can one have the right to act, and yet the
acting belong to others? That which follows is nothing but
great words against <hi>Bishops,</hi> which like froth vanisheth of it
self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His second Proposition is;</hi> Though the act of Ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Presbyters, yet the <hi>Jus &amp; Potestas Ordinandi</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
firstly upon the Church by Christ, and resides in her; it is
in them instrumentally, in her originally.</p>
               <p>The right of <hi>Ordination</hi> just now was in the <hi>teaching Elders,</hi>
but the <hi>Jus &amp; Potestas</hi> is now in the Church; the Church hath
the Latin names, and they the English; I, but the <hi>right</hi> is firstly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61847:118"/>
in the Church: mark, the <hi>Jus,</hi> the right to <hi>ordain,</hi> that is, to
<hi>act,</hi> and then the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lders</hi> do not <hi>ordain, but the Church;</hi> the
<hi>Elders,</hi> saith he, <hi>instrumentally,</hi> she <hi>originally;</hi> this is not well
said: The <hi>Elders</hi> cannot be the Churches <hi>instruments,</hi> but
Christs; they cannot be guided or directed by the Church, but
are the guides and directors of the Church. Nay, I will go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than these men, and say, the <hi>Elders</hi> are not <hi>physicall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of this <hi>Ordination,</hi> but only <hi>morall;</hi> it's Christ that works
all in all, and these only come in like <hi>morall instruments</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ to do this great work, which Christ blesseth; but,
to say, they are <hi>instruments</hi> of the Church, is a strange phrase:
they are the Churches <hi>Ministers, objectivè,</hi> busied about the
Church; but they are Gods <hi>Ministers,</hi> as I may so speak, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè,</hi>
subject only to his commands and directions. I should
have wished that he had endeavoured to confirm these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
either out of Scripture, reason, or antiquity; but I see
neither; neither do I think that the matter will afford either:
he indeed names three or four late Writers, which never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me to examine, but yet I could answer them if there were
need; but the Argument from them is of no force at all, and
that the very quotations are of no force, were the persons. See
his collection from them, <hi>page</hi> 77. which perhaps he means a
third Proposition, because he saith, Thirdly, <hi>In case the face
and form of all the Churches are generally corrupted,</hi> &amp;c. I need
adde no more, <hi>Posito quolibet sequitur quidlibet;</hi> suppose impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities,
and you may collect untruth enough. Christ hath
promised not to leave his Church destitute: it is true, there is no
promise to their particular Congregations, but to his Church in
generall; and therefore to dispute upon an impossible ground,
yeelds little or no strength to that Argument; and so I desist
from it.</p>
               <p>His second Argument begins in the end of that page, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in the next. It is thus urged:</p>
               <p>If the Church can do the greater, then she may do the less;
the acts appertaining to the same thing, and being of the same
kind.</p>
               <p>But the Church can do the greater, namely, give the essentials
to a Pastor, <hi>ut supra;</hi> Ergo,</p>
               <p>I put his words down <hi>verbatim;</hi> but now he should have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61847:118"/>
the less, which must be, or he speaks nothing; dispence
this Ordinance of Ordination, and then I would know what
that is, if not giving the essentials to this Officer: So here is <hi>idem
per idem,</hi> the Conclusion proved by it self, and therefore must
be denyed upon the same grounds which I spake of before; and
this is all he puts down for his second Argument.</p>
               <p>His third Argument, <hi>page</hi> 78. is thus framed:</p>
               <p>That which is not an act of power, but of order, the Church
can do: <hi>he proves this Proposition; for, (saith he)</hi> the reason
why it is conceived and concluded that it is beyond the power of the
people, is, because it is an act of supream jurisdiction:</p>
               <p>But this is an act of order, not of power.</p>
               <p>Suppose I should deny his Major; have the people power to
do any thing that is an act of order? Indeed, I know no Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
power they have, or any spirituall power of acting any
thing, that concerns more than their particular demeanour,
and all the rest is obedience.</p>
               <p>But then to his Minor: To dispence Ordination is an act of
power; for although the thing dispensed (as I have shewed)
is called an order, yet it is an act of power that gives it, as in a
Civil State, the precedency of place is meerly an order, but yet
it is an act of power in the supream Magistrate that gives it.
Now such is this; although we should conceive it meerly an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet it must be given by an act of power: but this besides
that notion of order, hath in it self great powers which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by it, of which I have treated somewhat in their distinct
notions: and this Argument is absolutely unvalid.</p>
               <p>He hath another Argument which follows, but it concerns
only the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> yet from thence he takes occasion to
asperse Bishops thus:</p>
               <p>It is as certain <hi>(saith he)</hi> that it cannot firstly belong to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
which by humane invention and consent is preferred before a
Presbyter in dignity, only, if they will hold themselves either to the
precedent, <hi>(he writes, but I think he means president)</hi> or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
whence they raise their pedigree, and it is from <hi>Hierom</hi> ad
<hi>Evagrium,</hi> Vnum ex se electum in altiori gradu colloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</p>
               <p>How many (to speak modestly) weaknesses may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this Discourse? First, That it is imputed and obtruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61847:119"/>
the defenders of Episcopacy, that they should consent that it
is an humane invention, than which nothing is more against their
Discourses. Secondly, That they found their opinion only
upon this place of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> which is as flat against apparent
reason, as the other, since this place is commonly objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; and although St. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath spoken enough
otherwhere, yet in this Epistle being pressed somewhat with the
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide of De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cons, who were lifted up above Presbyters, by the
sloath and vanity of many, he somewhat passionately defended
the cause of Presbyters, and here of all other places speaks the
least for Bishops, making the name be used reciprocally in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
But then lastly, he quotes the place false, and by the
change of a letter makes him speak what he meant not: to whom
it may be answered in this, as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> did to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
in the like case, <hi>Verbum caret litera Cardinalis fide;</hi> he saith,
<hi>Vnum ex se electum in altiori gradu colloc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locatum
Episcopum nominaverunt;</hi> in which sence there is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
difference: in the first, as if they had placed and given their
Bishop his authority which he had; in the other only, that they
called him <hi>Bishop,</hi> who was set over the other Presbyters; so
that it intimates, that the name grew distinct not from the first
instant of the Office. I am sure I have spoke of this place before,
and let us consider it in its fullest and most averse sence that it can
abide: consider, that just there in the heat and height of his
Disputation against Deacons, and upon that ground his extolling
of Presbyters, to which only Order he was exalted, he proves
that the difference betwixt Bishops and Presbyters, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
of them, was Apostolical, and from the Apostles deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to his age, from the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where to his time from St. <hi>Mark</hi> was a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Bishops above Presbyters; and it is a derogation from
the reverence due to the Apostles, to call their institutions meerly
humane inventions, in such things which concern Ecclesiasticall
Government, concerning which they had that great Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>As my Father sent me,</hi> &amp;c. and in this case it is most weak of
all other, since concerning Ordination, St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in this very
Epistle, immediately after these words, saith, <hi>Quid facit Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus
excepta Ordinatione, quod non faciat Presbyter?</hi> thus in
English, <hi>What doth a Bishop except Ordination, which a Presbyter
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61847:119"/>
cannot do?</hi> Here then a Presbyter cannot ordain; and yet to
shew the full sence of the words, understand that a Presbyter
may do any thing, (I upon a sudden can except nothing, not it
may be he when he wrote that Sentence) I say, he can do any
thing that a Bishop doth, except ordain; but the affairs of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
other Elders or judging them, he cannot do by an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
or to use <hi>Hookers</hi> language, by an Authority firstly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eated
in him, or given to him, but by a delegated; but no delegation
can serve the turn in Ordination, because it was given to the
Apostles by Christ, in those words, <hi>As my Father sent me, so
send I you,</hi> to give Authority to ordain; and they, and they
only who were so authorized by the Apostles, can do it. Thus
you see that place out of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> expounded; his Arguments
deduced from thence falls of its self:</p>
               <p>If Presbyters elected and gave first being to a Bishop, then were
they before him, and could not receive Ordination from him. At
primum ex concessis. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I set down his words, and all his words; where hath he
shewed that <hi>Presbyters</hi> elected their <hi>Bishop?</hi> which yet may be
true, and the consequence most weak: for after their Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Bishops,</hi> they may elect their <hi>Bishop,</hi> but not ordain him.
Elections may be, and are various, according to humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
assigning this or that Pastor to this or that particular
Congregation; sometimes the <hi>Parish,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Patron,</hi>
sometimes a <hi>Bishop;</hi> but the <hi>Ordination, and giving him power</hi> to
Officiate, must be only by the <hi>Bishops:</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> ordains and
makes a man a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> he
may by humane Laws and his own consent be tyed to Officiate
and execute that Pastoral duty in this particular place: nor can
any man shew me Authority from Scripture, or the times near
to the Scripture-Writers, where any man was instituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to do these spirituall duties, by any other Authority than
<hi>Episcopal.</hi> Nay I think since the Apostles Age, no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, or body of Men, did conceive Election to be of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
to do these duties, till now.</p>
               <p>Well then, all the premisses considered, which have a full
consent of Scripture, and the practice of all Ages to confirm
them, conceive with me, that it must be a bold and impudent
thing of such men, who dare Officiate in these divine duties,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61847:120"/>
without Authority granted from Christ, which he only gave to
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and they to their <hi>Successors, Bishops;</hi> and it is a
foolish rashness in those men, who adventure to receive the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of their eternall Salvation from such men, who have no
Atturnment from Christ to Seal them.</p>
               <p>If the Case were dubious, which to me seems as clear as such a
practick matter can be, I should speak more; but it being clear,
I need write no more in this Theam. I intended to have spoken
to Mr. <hi>Hobs;</hi> but lately there came to my hands a Book of learned
Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> entituled, <hi>A Letter of Resolution to six Queries;</hi>
in the fifth of which, which is about <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> you may

hath divers Arguments not inserted in my former Papers,
against this proposition: That it is a proper and peculiar act
of Episcopacy to ordain Priests and Bishops, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
in his second Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. Proposition 13. in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

In the top of the <hi>page</hi> before named he begins thus. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

Here we begin to differ; I say there neither is, nor ever was
a Christian Church without a Bishop: and I will now begin to
distinguish, there is the universal Church, and there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches. The particular Churches we may, yea must
conceive to be sometimes without Bishops, yea without Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,
as by the death of their Bishops or Presbiters, or by
such persecutions, as may so scatter them, that they dare
not shew themselves in their Churches. In such cases these
places must needes be without these Magistrates. And yet
those Christians who are by such means defrauded of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and blessed government, keeping their first faith continue
members of the Catholick Church, and of that universal
Church, which have and ever shall have Bishops as long as
the World stands, so that if that proposition be meant of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations; It is true they may be without a
Bishop: But if the universal, they shall never be by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61847:121"/>
of our Saviour, <hi>(I will be with you to the end of the World)</hi>
without a Bishop. And those particular Churches, which may
by such means be without Bishops, may be without Presbiters
likewise, upon the same occasions. This I think is clear, I shall
now examine his Arguments, which oppose this which I have
delivered.</p>

                     <head>His first Argument drawn from Scripture
answered.</head>
                     <p>HE saith, he will prove it before the Institution of Bishops
and after. First, before; I am perswaded he can shew
me no Church before the Institution, for their Episcopal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was given in its fulness to the Apostles in that language
of our Saviour, <hi>As my father send me so send I you,</hi> as I have
explained. All the Commission was given to them, and they
imparted all or part of it as they pleased; they were the first
and only Bishops, untill they setled Provincial Bishops; they
were of the whole world, as those latter of particular Diocesses;
he proves that there were Churches before Bishops out of
Scripture, but it is ciphered Scripture first, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. There
<hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Deacon</hi> (so he terms him) converted Souls to Christ,
where was no Bishop: And by his leave, if <hi>Philip</hi> were but a
<hi>Deacon,</hi> there was no Presbiter neither, and by the By, the
Independant <hi>Thomas Hooker</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> and his fellows
may take notice, that a <hi>Deacon</hi> may preach and baptize; for
so did <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Samaria</hi> in that verse. But Reader take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that although men may be converted by Presbiters, yea
Lay-men, any; and when they are converted and baptized, are
members of the Catholick Church, and parts of the mystical
body of Christ, and have no Bishop resident in that place; yet
without a Bishop it cannot be; for the providence of God over
the Church is such, as that there shall always be such an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
resident in the Church universal, whither men may
in convenient time, such as will be accepted of God, repair
for Church-discipline. The next place be vergeth is <hi>Acts 11.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61847:121"/>
                        </hi>
20, 21. But there is nothing observable to any such purpose,
but only that they who were scattered upon the persecution of
<hi>Stephen,</hi> converted many Souls to the true faith. His third place
is <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 20, 21, 22. He should have added the 23, without
the which all the former were imperfect to his purpose, and
in that verse are the words which he argues out of, that is,
<hi>they ordained Elders,</hi>

and no Presbyter, untill the Apostles ordained them, and the
Apostles <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ordained these Presbiters, not a

World, visited their Churches with letters and directions,
sometimes when they could not personally be present, untill
they setled Bishops amongst them. His next place urged is <hi>Acts</hi>
the 20. he leaves me to looke the verse, but affirmes that the
Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was governed first by Presbiters, only from
that <hi>Chap.</hi> afterward they had a Bishop, who was called, <hi>The
Angel of the Church of Ephesus,</hi> Apocalyps 2. That which hath
any colour for this in this <hi>Chap.</hi> must be deduced out of the
17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verse,</hi> where it is said: That <hi>from Miletum Paul sent to
Ephesus for the Elders of the Church,</hi> Therefore it seems the
Church was governed by <hi>Elders at that time;</hi> but let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consider whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not Episcopize over them,
conventing the Elders before him, and giving them that most
heavenly charge; And then consider that these men in the 28.

Bishop in the Original indeed, as I have shewed in this Treatise.
The words were not distinguished at the first, but they were
promiscuously used untill the great increase of Christianity,
when the name of Apostles began to weare away, and they had
more generally setled Churches and planted Bishops over the
other Presbiters in the chief Cities, and then these were called
Bishops; and indeed every Presbiter, who hath a charge of
Souls, is a little Bishop in the Superintendency of his parish,
though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for their Souls good; But a Bishop is higher, over them and

their flocks to take care that he doth his duty in these places of
Scripture. I see no manner of Argument to shew that a
Church may exist without a Bishop, for they had Apostles, and

that was in the first plantation of the Churches; I know no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

as he speakes, which would intimate a Sentorian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
of which, as they urge none, so I cannot imagine
what words in these Acts or Epistles should tend thereunto; but
then his last Clause I in part yeeld to, that the Apostles did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Bishops, and am confident they did it by divine Right,
which was given them by our Saviour, saying: <hi>As my Father
sent me, so send I you;</hi> but whether only as they say, <hi>ad sedanda

after Bishops were instituted, answered.</head>
               <p>HE proceeds with the second Number of his distinction, to
shew that not onely this was done before Bishops were
instituted, but after likewise the same was done; and he gives
this reason: for saith the Doctor, <hi>Non enim ad esse, sed ad
melius esse Ecclesiae necessaria est haec oeconomia,</hi> This discipline is
not necessary to the being, but well-being of the Church; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I grant it, 'tis true, no discipline is necessary to the being
of a Christian but Baptisme, by which we are made members
of that mystical body of Christ, of which he is the head; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Lawes, Civil or Ecclesiastical, are not necessary to our
being Men, or <hi>Englishmen</hi> of this Country; but to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
being in it, we may be Christians and members of Christs
Church, where is no Presbiter as well as no Bishop; As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Diocess and Kingdom conquered by a Pagan, as alass too
many have been, not a Bishop or a Priest left remaining,
Those noble Christians who remain without them have the
being of Christians, but not the well-being of Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
enjoying the blessed Sacrament which requires sacerdotal
administration, and likewise Church-discipline, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the well-being of a Church; but here we see the same

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61847:123"/>
                  <hi>Scots</hi> were governed by Priests and Monks until <hi>Anno Domini
(429.)</hi> from whence he collects, that they were two hundred
and thirty yens without Bishops, he might have urged other
late Writers likewise in it. But I answer to this, that the
Registers of that illiterate age were very ill preserved through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christendom, but worse in those parts amongst the <hi>Picts</hi>
and <hi>Scots,</hi> then almost any where, by reason that they were
miserably oppressed with the almost perpetual Warrs they had
with their Neighbours, <hi>Brittaines</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
and scarce any eminent man for learning, who recorded any
thing, was acted amongst them; and in that Gap of time in
which they place this lack of Bishops, their troubles were at the
height; for as there was all that space Warrs for dominion, so
there was persecution for destruction of Christianity, and the
<hi>Scots</hi> in general were banished that Country. The Christians
fled every where for safety to the adjacent Isles to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
from whence they came, to <hi>Normandy,</hi> to <hi>Denmarke,</hi> any
where for safety; which it may be, although unhappy to their
wordly content, yet advanced the propagation of the Gospel,
as it was in the Apostles time upon the persecution of St. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
Well then, I think in this unhappy season, they can find good
Record for neither Bishops nor presbiters, but every Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

shifting for himself, and especially those who were in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in Christian office, because they of all others were
sought after, and therefore were concerned to hide their heads;
besides this, it being the custome of Bishops to place themselves
in some eminent Cities, whereby they might be the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
and the better oversee their Diocesses: There were
few such in <hi>Scotland</hi> then, but these Bishops which were then
in the Kingdom were forced to inhabit many obscure places.
All which considered, it is not possible for any man to expect a
pedigree of their Bishops, as it hath been preserved in more
eminent Churches, and yet in the best of them there are
mighty difficulties to make them certain, but yet they may
know, that they might have Bishops in that time and Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ordained by them, although the Register's not apparent;
for it is evident out of such stories as we have, that King <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
the first Christian King we read of in our Nation, when
he setled Christianity here, he was to extirpate the former <hi>Pagan</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:61847:123"/>
Religion, used by the <hi>Druids</hi> in these Countreys. Now they
had here three <hi>Arch-flamins,</hi> besides divers other <hi>Flamins</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior,
according to their Method: so he setled Christianity, he
made three Arch-bishops, <hi>Yorke, London, Caerlyon;</hi> this

Mediterranean part of this Island of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> but <hi>York</hi> had
the Northern part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for his government,
and this lasted untill <hi>Anno (1470)</hi> or thereabouts, at which
time there was erected one Arch-bishop at St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> so that
there was a place, to which in case of necessity men might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
for Orders when they would, as we know by our late
sad experience in these last sad times; and no doubt but many
did where they knew were Bishops, as since the first planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christianity there was in <hi>Wales.</hi> But to come nearer to
this, <hi>Crathling</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Dioclesians</hi> time, which was in this
Interim he mentions, entertained all Christians who fled out of
these parts of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

plant in, and setled <hi>Amphibolus</hi> their Bishop there, and built
a Church, and endowed it nobly, who governed all the adjacent
Isles, and had a succession of Bishops after him; so that they
could never lack Bishops either to give orders to Priests, or
to order any thing that were amisse. Beside this, in this time
I read of <hi>Ninias,</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Candida Casa,</hi> and of
<hi>Regulas</hi> amongst the <hi>Picts;</hi> and I think it would be hard, if not
impossible, for <hi>John Major</hi> or any of his followers, to shew me
so many Presbiters men of Note as I have shewed Bishops.
It is true for a while after <hi>Maximus</hi> had extirpated the <hi>Scots;</hi>
upon the cruel, mercyless; malicious; and indeed foolish insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Picts,</hi> against the disposition and manners of a

<hi>Hollandsilde</hi> might well say that their Bishops and Priests were
forced to fly away, but that is a signe there they had Bishops
then; yet as soon as <hi>Fergusus</hi> that gallant person came with
his conquering Army thither, no doubt he brought all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with him as were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were Bishops within this time, prefixed by <hi>Major</hi> before the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61847:124"/>
extirpation of the <hi>Scots</hi> in the time, and after by the Bishop of
<hi>Man</hi> and his successors. As likewise those which that gallant
heroique King <hi>Fergusius</hi> did bring with him; and certainly
throughout the world where were Presbiters, there were
Bishops either in particular Diocesses or hard by, from whom
men might receive orders, or somewhere in Christendom
where they might hunt them out, if there were any number
of Christians which might provoke that industry, if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons, as heretofore have been, and may be cast away or
cast in a <hi>Pagan</hi> or impeopled Land, they may be without a
Presbiter, although that may be more easily purchased, yet
they may be without him, or having one he may die, and they
still continue in a Christian condition, Man or Men, and all the
defects of these Officers may be supplied with soliloquies, and
a holy conversation with godly Prayers; but the same, though
a greater misfortune, is theirs, who cannot have so much as a
Priest with them, who may be sufficient for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to govern Priests, and them likewise; so that in answer to
<hi>John Major, Hector Boethius, Bacanan,</hi> and all others of that
Crew, I answer, there was never any time (I mean any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time) in which the <hi>Scots</hi> lacked Bishops after there
was a considerable conversion of them to Christ. But they had
Bishops to repair to at <hi>York</hi> or at <hi>Man, Candida Casa,</hi> or
other where; and then because <hi>Major</hi> saith that they were
governed by Priests only and not Bishops, I think it will be a
mighty hard thing for him to shew any judicial Act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
performed by Presbiters, unless they were commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by some Bishop, and therefore all he said is only said,
and cannot be proved; I have done with this.</p>

runs thus: Although Deacons be a divine ordinance,
yet the <hi>Scots</hi> by reason of their poverty, are not able to
maintaine such an Officer, and there is the like reason for
Bishops in such places where the supream authority will not
allow them: so that necessity may excuse men, even where
the divine Laws requires any thing; I must confess that invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
necessity excuseth many Acts, but it will lie upon the
Souls of these Churches who live without Bishops to answer
at the last day to Allmighty God, and make it good before
him that their Omission is such; but the difference betwixt
Bishops and Deacons is exceeding great; I do not find any
one place so much as directing that Deacons should be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular Church; in many there is no need of them,
where a small congregation of twenty or a hundred may well
be os<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iciated in the meanest duty by a Presbiter onely; but
in Cathedral Churches, where are many little offices, for
which perhaps we cannot find Presbiters so fit, or that it is
not fit that we should take them from their greater imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to bestow their time upon those lesser duties, in such
cases there is a necessity for those lesser offices to be used; but
if they shall think their Deacons to be ordained for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
mentioned in the sixth of the <hi>Acts</hi> to minister to the
poor, I may say that such an imployment can hardly complain
of necessity by sacriledge, since that out of the collection
for the poor he may be allowed a stipend competent for such
an office; but then to consider that which he would have to
paralel a Bishop, where is any such a small congregation as I
have before specified, all things may well be regulated by a
Presbiter, and he alone supply all the duties belonging to
the Salvation of Souls. But if there should be many such
congregations, or that Presbiter who did govern there die
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61847:125"/>
in that Government, it is necessary for him or them to seek out
some Bishop to authorize him or them for this duty. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
of all this is, that Deacons are not instituted as necessary
for all lesser Congregations, that Bishops are authorized to give
Orders, to dispose of such affairs as are usefull or necessary to
the Government of little or great Congregations, but especially
in the latter, where are usually more, and more dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies.
That which follows in that <hi>page</hi> is onely a Discourse,
but no Proof, and so I passe to 161. <hi>page,</hi> where he labours
to prove that the Presbitery, as he calls it, or Company of
Presbiters gathered together, may give Orders thus.</p>

Army makes an Emperour, he doth not obscurely intimate
that they did ordain their Bishops. Thus <hi>Forbes,</hi> if instead of
Ordain he had said Elect, I should not have been offended; but
to take upon them the power to ordain was too much, unless
they had the Armies to maintain their Act by force, as they
did; The Souldiers upon the death of the Emperour proclaim and
cry up commonly their General to be the Emperour, and make it
good with their sword; but would Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> or <hi>Hierom</hi> think
that they did ordain or make him Emperour, or rather accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their power elect? it was often seen even in the age
about St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that two or three Armies in their several
places chose so many Emperours: And it is not impossible that
the Presbiters in <hi>Alexandria</hi> might have the Election of their
Bishop, as in most places, but the Consecration of him was by
others; and mark this place of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> the phrase he useth
is <hi>Presbiteri</hi> not <hi>Presbiterium,</hi> which he calls the antient Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
howsoever there is nothing in these words which can
instance a Consecration from Presbiters, no not in the <hi>Simile</hi> of

Christians, and durst assemble together for such purpose; and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61847:127"/>
indeed were men of such excellency that they accepted that
Bishoprick with a design to be Martyrs, which they were,
many, one after another; afterwards when it pleased God to
bless the Church with Christian Emperours, they proved Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-fathers
to their Bishops, and under them the Bishop grew
great; which being discerned, the Emperours considering what
a great stroak the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had in the management of all
affairs of the Empire, they put in for an Interest in their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and there was no Pope elected but by their approbation,
untill the Emperour granted his <hi>Conge de liere</hi> (as I may term it.)
Now at this time <hi>Italy</hi> was full of Souldiers. <hi>Narses</hi> that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant

think he is somewhat mistaken in the Story, when in the next
<hi>page</hi> he writes that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was but a Deacon, when <hi>Binius</hi> calls
him Arch-deacon; and again where he saith there, that he was
chosen by the Command of the Emperour <hi>Justinian,</hi> when it is
recorded by <hi>Platina</hi> that after the Election he sent to <hi>Justinian</hi>
at <hi>Constantinople</hi> to excuse the Consecration without his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which could not be had in those busles; but <hi>Narses</hi> was

must be the man, he lay under the scandall of being accessary to
his Predecessors death, upon this the generality of the Bishops
refuse to be present at his Consecration, onely two, and these
took a Presbiter to them, and ordained <hi>Pelagius</hi> in that Act, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
complying with the Canon so much as in them lay, than vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
it in Contempt. It is a sure Rule, <hi>Silent Leges inter Arma,</hi>
so they are not Gods Laws. Now it is evident that there was
the terrour of that Army upon them; for the story related both
by <hi>Platina</hi> and by <hi>Binius,</hi> and others, affirm, that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Nobles as well as the People and Clergy fled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Consciences would not allow them to be assistant.
And the terrour of the Army would not permit them to oppose;
that this ordination was not questioned was, because the Pope
purged himself of that Scandal afterwards, and so that which
made them desert him at his Consecration being removed, made
them wink at small faults when he was Pope. Thus the Story
being cleared for matter of fact, I will examine this Argument
logically; it must run thus:</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. The Argument discussed, and his Major dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</head>
                  <p>HIs argument termed must be thus: <hi>That which was acted
in the Consecration of a Pope, that is lawfull for us to do;
but a Presbiter did Consecrate Pope</hi> Pelagius, <hi>therefore he may
Consecrate a Bishop or a Presbiter with us:</hi> for the Major it must
run so; for there can be no difference of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> from
other Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> I deny the Major then, and I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it by the Predecessors of <hi>Pelagius, Vigillius:</hi> his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
cannot be lawfull, for he was intruded into the Papacy
by <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Belisarius</hi> his other Generall,
his Predecessors; <hi>Silverius</hi> being by violence forced from <hi>Rome,</hi>
cast into banishment, and so died in misery starved as <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
This <hi>Vigillius</hi> was put into his Chair, and yet for all that
<hi>Silverius</hi> being of a mighty invincible Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got a few Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
together, and excommunicated <hi>Vigillius;</hi> from which he
never released <hi>Vigillius; Silverius</hi> dies, <hi>Vigillius</hi> then renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his former Election, and by the interest of <hi>Bellisarius, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillius</hi>
was again Elected, being an Excommunicated Person,
and abominated for that and many other Crimes, as even <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>
confesseth, who was his Friend in his story as much as
he could. Now then Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> his Major failes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>residents, nor are
they Arguments for us to build upon: I but he will and doth say
this, If so, <hi>Pelagius</hi> would have been punished by his successor,
if it had beeen nought. I answer, that doth not follow; there
is not that Law of God or Man which hath not been violated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questioned:
I remember <hi>Binius</hi> writes of it, that it had never
been so before; <hi>Baronius</hi> onely tells the story, but passeth not
his Judgement upon it. They mention the Scandal he lay under,
it being that he was accessary to <hi>Vigillius</hi> his death. They men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
his purgation which he made, as doth <hi>Platina,</hi> and in that
it is evident, that they who were scandalized at his imagined
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61847:128"/>
offence, were satisfied with his purgation; and so we see that
block of offence being removed which made him unfit to be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and Consecrated Pope, they never questioned his Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
its self; but this is sufficient for satisfaction to his Major.
Now let us come to his Minor; And here we must examine
whether this Presbiter did consecrate the Pope or no; And first
we will undertake that Question, whether it be essentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the being of a Bishop that he should be Consecrated
by three Bishops?</p>

justly complaines, that <hi>Pauci ex nostra Schola,</hi> few of our
Schoolmen have handled this Question exactly, or delivered it
defined in their writings; I shall undertake him, and endeavour
now to shew a more clear truth than I have observed delivered
by others; for indeed, because some Canons of Councels seem to
make for it, and they have been swallowed without chewing,
and have not been ex mined, it hath passed undoubtedly by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
practise in all quietly setled Churches. But I much mistrust
that there is not an absolute necessity in persecuted and unsetled
Churches; after <hi>Vasques</hi> had produced Arguments against this
necessity, he puts his own determination fully, <hi>Mihi tamen

more probable of them, who say, first, that to the right ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Law, as the ordinary Ministers but by commission (he
means from the Pope) two may do it, or one; thus far he.
I will take it peicemeale; And first I say this Canon, that three
Bishops should Consecrate a Bishop hath no Collour to challeng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Divine Right; for that can have a lawful claim to a Divine
right, must either draw it from God himself prescribing it, or
else from such men who were immediately authorized by God, as
the Apostles; for if we will go further, we must make all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws Divine; for if the next to the Apostles should have
their Dictator termed Divine, from their authority, the same
reason will be for the next to them, and so to the last, and so
even the Prescriptions of the now living Bishops should be
Divine, than which nothing can be more abhorring to reason.
Well then, what I have said before, will serve likewise here,
that is, that what Divine Laws were established by the Apostles
we may find in the Acts and Epistles; now there is no such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
observable any where in them; The Commission given to
the Apostles, by which they and their Successors were and are
authorized to send others, was not given to them <hi>conjunctim,</hi> as
if they should act onely altogether, much less was there specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that three of them should joyne in it; but without doubt sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
every one had this power given, to punish, to forgive Sins, to
Baptize, give the Communion, Ordain; and we find upon this
foundation it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave Commission to particular
persons, to <hi>Titus,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the like; But I need not
trouble the Scriptures about it; I do not find the Patrons of
that opinion producing any; And therefore I wonder that <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
did term it a Divine Right, when he attempts no where to

the Great, as the other is called <hi>James</hi> the Less) that these three
Apostles did Consecrate the other <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by whom he saith himself <hi>Anacletus</hi> was made
Priest, told him, that it should always be a Law hereafter
that there should be three Bishops to Consecrate one; I do
wonder if this were so, how St. <hi>Peters</hi> pretended Successors
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61847:129"/>
should be bold to dispence with this Law of St. <hi>Peters;</hi> of which
we shall see more hereafter; but it is well known by learned
men how unlike these Epistles are to be these mens writings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom they are fathered: But I acknowledge the story so far
as it affirms the Consecration of St. <hi>James,</hi> for by better autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
then theirs it is justified, which is by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> lib. 1 cap. 1.

which this <hi>Anacletus</hi> seems to inforce; Nay <hi>Eusebius</hi>
doth not name this <hi>Anacletus</hi> in his Relation, which if there
had been any such Epistle extant in his time, no doubt but he
would have done as well as <hi>Clemens;</hi> but I grant the story; and
as <hi>Adam Tanner</hi> a learned Jesuit speaks, Tom. 4. <hi>Scholasticae
theologiae disputatione prima,</hi> Quest. 3. Dubio. 2. Numero 3. It
might be done <hi>ad quandem solemnitatem ordinis Episcopalis;</hi> I may
say <hi>Episcopatus ejus,</hi> than whom never man deserved more
honour in his Consecration, for he is esteemed the father of that
Epistle which goes under his name, then he was the Brother
(that is the nearest kinsman) of our blessed Saviour; then a man
so honoured for vertue, that he was called <hi>James</hi> the just, and so
esteemed by <hi>Josephus</hi> a Jew, who attributes the great Judgement
of God upon the Jews in the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to their
iniquity of stoning that just man; so that if ever there was a man
to be honoured with so glorious a Consecration, it was he.
But give me leave by the By to say, that from this I can add
one strong Scholastick reason to the excellent industry of
Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who in his Preface to St. <hi>James</hi>
the Apostle proves from antiquity that this Bishop of
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> was none of the Twelve, either the son of <hi>Zebedee</hi> or
<hi>Alpheus;</hi> I can add this, for if he had been any of them it is not
reasonable to think, that he had need of a new Consecration
to a Bishoprick, whom Christ himself had ordained an Apostle,
or our Saviour made him onely Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as many
affirm; let no man think that he could be Consecrated again by
these three; for Orders must not be given twice; and no man
can think that either our Saviours Ordination to make him an
Apostle, or Bishop, was insufficient; but let it be which you
will, it is not needfull to trouble the Reader with discussing
the truth of it, nor indeed in Actions so far remote, where are
such great Authorities of both sides. Is it possible to conclude
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61847:129"/>
any thing peremptorily? I therefore let it pass, and for the present
grant he was Consecrated by these three. But what can follow
but this, that so great a Person, of such an extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
was so honoured by these Apostles, who (as <hi>Clemens</hi>
saith) did not contend for the honour themselves, but pitched
upon him to be the first Bishop of that Sea, which without
doubt was then the most glorious Episcopal seat in the World;
but is there any rule given that every Bishop should have that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

his fourth Book <hi>de Ecclesia militante,</hi> which is, <hi>de notis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae</hi>
cap. 8. and from him the latter schoolmen with one consent.
But let a man consider whether this be not a violence to the Text,
when the name of Archbishop is not mentioned in these Canons,
nor in the Scripture; for if these Canons were of the Apostles
Constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they must be penned in the language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phrase,
bearing the same date with them, and so not to
vary from their sence; for although Archbishops are of great
necessity, and antiquity, where there are many Bishops to keep
them in peace and unity with Ecclesiastical discipline, so a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
over them; yet neither he, nor a Patriarch, have any
thing but jurisdiction, by Ecclesiastical authority, nothing of
Order by divine right more than a Bishop, and therefore no
more necessity of him than another Bishop, in the Consecrating
of a Bishop, but onely by the Canons of the Church, and therefore
it is a violence offered to that Canon by them who have a venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Some Canons of Councels examined.</head>
                  <p>THe next thing to be considered will be the fourth Canon
of the first Councel of <hi>Nice; Episcopum apparet maxime
quidem ab omnibus qui sint provincia constituit, si autem hoc sit
difficile, vel propter urgentem necessitatem, vel viae longitudinem,
tres omnino in eundem locum congregatos, absentibus quoque suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragium
ferentibus, scriptisque assentientibus tunc electionem fieri, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum
autem quae conficiunt confirmationem in una quaque provincia,
à metrapolitano fieri.</hi> The meaning of the Canon is, that a
Bishop ought to be constituted by all the Bishops of that Province,
if it be possible; but if that be difficult to get the Bishops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either by urgent occasions, or by reason of the length
of the Journey, yet three being together in the same place, and
the other which are absent, giving their suffrages in writing, then
he shall be chosen; This Councel was held <hi>Anno Christi (325.)</hi>
according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> when it is not material to our business;
There are divers opinions, <hi>majus &amp; minus, non variant speciem,</hi>
be it more or less; we see a Metropolitan, and they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
certainly. Let us now examine the Canon, which indeed
I cannot but wonder how it should be arrested to such a sence,
as if it did import a necessity that three Bishops should conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
every Bishop. To which purpose here <hi>Belsarman;</hi> who
was Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and surely had great reasons to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the great Councels, better than Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine, Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
or any other of these latter learned men; he saith in his
Notes upon the word <hi>(constituit)</hi> That the Councel here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
against Popular Elections, which indeed were very scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and oft bred tumults, as almost in all cases they do; the
Councel therefore orders the Election of a Bishop to the Bishops
of the whole Province, which if that cannot be had, to three
at the least of that Province, and the Arch-bishop is to confirm
the Election; But he referrs the Reader to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon
of the Councel at <hi>Carthage;</hi> the words of the Canon in him are
these.</p>

etiam vel a tribus eligatur; Aurelius Episcopus dixit, quod ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoc

ab iis qui nos Praecesserunt constituta sunt, debent a nobis observari,

loco fuerint primatis jussa eligent Episcopum: Et si quis in alique
propriae consessioni vel subscriptioni adversatus fuerit, ipse seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
honore privabit.</hi> I need not trouble the Reader with a
Translation, his notes will clear all; his observation here is, that the
word which is here rendred <hi>Eligi</hi> in Latin, is in the original Greek
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the first of which signifies Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by holding up the hands; the other ordination by imposition of
hands; so then according to his understanding of that word
(which is the usual sence in almost all Writers) these Canons are
understood of Election, not of ordination. But then observe
his reasons, which he delivers afterwards; you may find that it is
necessarily to be understood so in these Canons, both of <hi>Nice</hi>
and this of <hi>Carthage;</hi> the <hi>Nicene</hi> saith, that all the Bishops shall
send their Suffrages by writing; what can they ordain by Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
It is not possible but they may Elect. It is as clear here,
for saith <hi>Belsarman,</hi> in the end of this Canon it is shewed, in
which it is provided, that if any Bishop shall oppose his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
or subscription, he shall deprive himself of his honour,
which subscription is not to Ordination or Consecration, but to
Election; for indeed conceive if you can, how a man should
be ordained by Subscription; a man may Subscribe his consent
to an Election, and give his voice, which may in many cases
pass in an Election; a man may Subscribe that such a man shall
be ordained, which indeed is Election, but a man cannot be
ordained by Subscriptions: so that here you have the authority
of the learned Patriarch, which perswades much with me you
have the sence of the words, and his reason, which may have
the authority to perswade any reasonable man; and then I am
sure there is nothing in these Canons to inforce three Bishops
to the Consecration of a Bishop, but onely to the Election: and
here, as I cannot but wonder how these men should deduce the
necessity of three Bishops to the Consecration of a Bishop, so
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61847:131"/>
I do admire that none of them, neither <hi>Bellarmine, Binius,
Vasques, Hurtado, Occhogamia, Occandus,</hi> nor multitudes
of others, which have urged this Canon at the fourth of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Nice,</hi> have so much as taken any notice of <hi>Balsamans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of it, to return any but pretended satisfaction to it. The
rest of authorities which are produced I slight, as not worthy
the troubling the Reader with the naming of them; but I shall
meet with the Chief hereafter.</p>

that the Pope may dispence with the
triplicity of Bishops.</head>
                  <p>BUt now the second part of <hi>Vasques</hi> his Proposition, is, <hi>That
although it be by Divine right that three Bishops should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
a Bishop, yet the Pope may dispence with it, and allow two
or one to do it;</hi> as in the case of <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, when he came
into <hi>England,</hi> but afterwards the first Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the first, say they, granted him a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
to Consecrate Bishops alone, untill there were a good
number to joyn with him. How can the Pope dispence with
Divine Law? this is too much; but let us consider the Story,
as it is set down even by the Admirers of the Popes greatness;
<hi>Austin</hi> the Monk being made Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wrote
to the then Pope <hi>Gregory the first,</hi> a very learned man, and
one whose Works are full of devotion, and indeed by whom he
was sent first hither, to satisfie him in divers Questions of which he
doubted, how he should demean himself in his Government in
<hi>England;</hi> amongst which this was one, <hi>Peto si long inquitas it ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
long a interiavit, ut Episcopi facile non possunt convenire, an de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
sine aliorum Episcoporum presentia Episcopos ordinare.</hi> In
English thus; I require if the great length of a Journey should
interpose it self, that Bishops cannot meet easily together;
whether he ought without the presence of other Bishops, ordain
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61847:131"/>
Bishops himself. Mark, here the Question is put somewhat
after the language of the former examined Canon, upon the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Journey. I need not put down the Popes answer
<hi>verbatim,</hi> but it is to this effect; that the having no Bishops in
<hi>England</hi> but himself, might do it; but he should take care to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them near together, that hereafter there might be no excuse,
and when they were near, they should meet together, to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
that Spiritual Marriage of that Bishop; this is called a
Decretall Epistle: but consider, Reader, if there be a word
like as Decree in this or any other Answer in that Epistle, but
only an Advice upon Reason. Thus the Popes Decrees having
been made Laws, his Councels come to be Decrees; in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
there is not one word like a Decree, but onely an Advice to
him; nothing like a Commission, as <hi>Vasques,</hi> and divers others
phrase it, for then it should be <hi>mandamus,</hi> or <hi>concedimus potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
we Command or grant you power; nor of dispensation, as
Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others, for then it should be in that
language, we dispence with you, or <hi>non obstante,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Law to the contrary, but here is no such thing; but
sometimes he saith, <hi>fraternibus vestra,</hi> your brotherhood knows
this or that, and the like, and here shews him the reason why
he should come by more Bishops to assist him, (although I
think he was deceived in his supposals, for there were Bishops
in <hi>Brittain</hi> at that time; howsoever that reason was good to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
<hi>Austin</hi> at that time, and the like may be good for any
man in the like Condition; for this triplicity of Bishops to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate,
cannot be necessary to Consecration, according to any
Divine Constitution, but onely Ecclesiastical, which cannot be
understood to exact impossibilities, or else to make a particular
Church to lose all the benefit of Episcopall Government; But
then consider the language of all these men, and see how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
it is with their first principles, that there must be three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
by Divine right, to the Consecration of a Bishop; can
the Pope dispence with what is due by Divine authority? or can
he grant a Commission to act against Divine Laws? I hope they
will not say so, unless they will set themselves against all that
is called God, and make an earthly god above our Father which
is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaven; then let us consider how it was possible that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion could have been planted, unless the power essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61847:132"/>
had been in one Bishop to Consecrate: when <hi>Timothy, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and St. <hi>John,</hi> who you will, that went about with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Tongues into unknown Countreys, to plant Religion, and
God blessing their industry, the Churches increased, learned
Men were Converted, fit to make Bishops of. Can you think that
these Itinerants would suffer them, like <hi>Austin</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi>
to send to <hi>Rome</hi> for advice in such a matter, or much less for a
Commission, or dispensation, to use their Language? it is not
imaginable; nay when a Church is in persecution, (I know a
little what belongs to that) can they send to many Bishops in the
same Province, to send their votes in writing; or without that,
there can be no Consecration? It cannot be; I conclude thus,
although in a setled Church there is a great decency in practise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to that Rule of having three Bishops at a Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet in these Cases it is not necessary, and it may be valid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted by one alone, and no Commission or dispensation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>And now Reader, having walked through this intricacy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think my self nor the Reader satisfied, untill I have applied
another Question; which is, what is it which so enables a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
that we may say when that is done; this man is a
Bishop.</p>

constitution of a Bishop.</head>
                  <p>THe Question introduced. To understand which (that I
may write distinctly, take this for a <hi>Praecognitum,</hi> that
since the power was given to the Apostles in these words, <hi>As
my Father sent me, so send I you:</hi> Therefore when this power is
given by Apostles and Apostolicall men, then this dignity is
conferr'd upon Men, But again, because that it is necessary for
the Church of Christians, not onely that they have the power,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61847:132"/>
but that this power should be so administred, as that other men
who are to receive blessings from it, should be able to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
(for else how is it possible to repair to the wells head, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they can know where it is) that there is such a blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them; therefore this power must be given by some
such means as are visible, and that men may discern when it is
granted: for if it should be given by the Apostles, without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sign, onely with a vehitie, a kind of secret grant, it must
be most uncertain to other men, because each man may pretend
to it, and there is no confuting but by some outward sign, which
being proper to this Action, may be an infallible assurance that
then and not till then it is given: and here will be required a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and curious inquest; there are divers things pretended to,
which are not right, and they being severed, we may then
safely pitch upon what is the truth; to do which, let us first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

                     </gap>tion I am now handling, that is, that
they agree in the essentialls, that is, the Doctrine of all the three
Churches, and the difference is onely in Accidentalls; this saith
he, may be done, first, by saying our Saviour did so institute this
Sacrament, that the Consecration of Ministers should be by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
words and outward signs, by which it should sufficiently
appear to what part of Ministry; they were ordained but he
left it to the arbitrement of the Church, what these signs and
words must be, this he illustrates by the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi>
wherein <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssion 23. Canon</hi> 3. the Councell decrees the thing, that
holy ordination should be made with signs and words, but deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
not what; so that it excludes not the Graecian or African
Ordination. Again he illustrates this by Marriage most rightly,
(for they make Matrimony a Sacrament, as well as ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
there the word of God establisheth for men how they
should live in holy wedlock, but never determines what shall be
the manner, with what words or signs they shall be married, but
leaves that to the determination of every Church, yea Common-wealth;
thus you may perceive his Conclusion how strengthned.
I will set down my Judgements and reasons, and so pass on:
first then, that our Saviour did institute many holy offices in
themselves, you may say (even his Sacraments) so as there
may be divers Ceremonies, according to the prudence of divers
Churches, is app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rent; for let us consider Baptisme, the matter, as
it is positively set down in the Institution, is water, this must not
be altered; and that which is called the form, which is the
words by which this Baptisme is administred are in part set down;
it must be, <hi>In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost;</hi> but now whether it should be, <hi>I Baptize thee,</hi> as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Church; or, <hi>let the Servant of God be Baptized;</hi> or <hi>he is
Baptized,</hi> which are severally used in other Churches, is not
determined by our Saviour, and the words of either do fully
express the meaning of Baptisme; so that neither doth the Latine
Church re-baptize those who are Baptized by the Graeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, nor
the Graecians such as are Baptized by the Latines, although both are
bitter enough one against another; so that you may see, there may
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61847:133"/>
be variation in the administration of these duties in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
where there is a Communion in the Substance; and
truly for my part I think in such a man who lives in either of

to vary from that usage, which is in the Churches wherein he
lives; for although these things are indifferent in them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon the supplement of <hi>Thomas</hi> Art 5. in resp. ad 8<hi rend="sup">m</hi>., saith
that the essential Consecration of a Bishop consists in this uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61847:134"/>
and this to be it, he proves by a very strong Argument against
the Romanist: because in the whole frame of Ordination, the
Bishop Consecrated, is cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

named in the Pontifical, and that is the same with that of
the Councel of <hi>Carthage;</hi> to wit the putting the Book upon
the Head of the Consecrated Bishop, and the laying on of Hands,
and the Benediction; this certainly is most conform to that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but as I said before, as it is not reasonable
to think that these Canons should omit any essential thing by
Divine Apostolical institution; so it is reasonable to conceive
it may add something Ecclesiastical to that which is Divine, so
it be not destructive to the foundation, of which nature I shall
show there is somewhat in this Canon: For the Book which was
imposed on the head and shoulders of the Bishop to be Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
is the Book of the Gospel, or four Evangelists; Now
it is impossible that that Ceremony should be necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
what is necessary to any thing must agree, to all of that
kind which this cannot, because there were Bishops when this
Book was not written; yea when not one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ospels were
written, this therefore cannot be essential to the Consecration
of a Bishop, which must needs follow his Consecration; this
Argumenr is taken notice of by divers although not in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ase,
but in that which concerns a Deacon, where the Book of the
Gospels is delivered at his Ordination to the Deacon, and by
most of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is made the matter essential to that
Ordination as they call it, or as we, the outward sign of it, you
see this Argument which they are pinched with: Let us consider
how they shift from it, <hi>Vasques</hi> in his (238) <hi>Disp. Cap. 4. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
43. and <hi>Ochogamia</hi> in his Book of Sacraments in his title of
Orders <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. out of him affirmed that this Order of Deacons,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61847:135"/>
(as well as is evident of Bishops) was before the Gospels were
written, and they were then ordained without that Ceremony,
but <hi>by a Dispensation of Christ,</hi> that is <hi>Ochogamia</hi>'s Phrase; but <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
by a Commission</hi> of his, the Phrase doth not materially differ;
with these kind of shifts any thing may be affirmed, can they
shew any the least word in the New Testament intimating any
such probability, a dispensation must be upon a former Law,
there could be no Law made to ordain with giving Gospels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either all, or any of them were written, and it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that none of them were writ, when the first Bishops were
made, <hi>Gasper Hurtado</hi> goes therefore another way to work,
and although he grants that at first they were ordained only by
the imposition of Hands, yet he saith that it is probable that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Christ instituted, that when the Gospels were writ,
they should be delivered to the ordained: it is an easy thing to
say, it is probable but he should give a reason why we should
think it reasonable; I have reason to think that when the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
do abundantly deliver to us such things which are necessary
for us to know concerning the will of Christ, and there is no
such thing in the Gospels, and they would be of great ease to
the satisfaction of such men as expect to receive Divine blessings
from some men in holy Orders; It is necessary that they should
have some means chalked out to them, by which they might be
assured, that these are such hands by which they expected those
blessings are promised to be given them; but above all others,

is set down.</head>
                  <p>THus having removed the principal Rubbige which might
impede my structure. I come now to lay my foundation
concerning the Building, first then let us conceive that what is
essential must be Apostolical, and what is so, may probably
be thought to be essential, for although it is a most assented
Conclusion that the Sacraments which conveigh Grace, must
be of Divine Institution, of which Nature they make Orders;
(I contend not about words) and the Apostles were instituted
with full authority to act since, after his departure to the end
of the world: It is necessary therefore for us to think that such
things as are delivered by them are Divine, for although Canons
of Councels general or particular, are excellent Guides for the
establishing Peace and Unity in the Church, and so may require
obedience from their Subjects, yet because they are but men
without an annexed infallibility; without doubt they may vary
in their practice and Discipline, and their Dictates being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon occasions may be altered; and therefore cannot add
essentials to any thing, for the essences of things are always
certain and necessary. This is my Major: Now to search what
is Apostolical in this business, we must examine the Scriptures
where first we find our Saviour authorizing his Apostles, <hi>As my
Father sent me, so send I you</hi> to give power to others. We find
him using no Ceremony, but bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thing upon them gave them the
Holy Ghost, and truly that Breathing was most significative of
that blessing he bestowed upon them; but from thence we find
not the Apostles using that Ceremony, for they being enabled
with this plenarty of power to give others that blessing, they
only gave it, and for a sign that they did establish it laid their
hands upon them; so that as we conceive these two places 1 <hi>Tim.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61847:137"/>
1. 6. by the laying on of my hands</hi> or the 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. with the lay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
on of the hands of the Presbytery</hi> to be Ordination, so likewise
we shall find this Ceremony taken for the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Tim. 5. 22. Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> Now then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt if any outward Act must be essential to this Heavenly
work; this only being Apostolical must be esteemed most essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;
and there I think it most proper for men to conceive that
this is the only Ceremony essentially necessary (if any be) to
the performance of that duty, for the power originally being
given to the Apostles nakedly and absolutely without any qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or mode, in what manner they should use it to others; we are
to receive the manner at their acting it, for our best Rule and
guidance which is only in Scripture delivered to be imposition of
Hands: Thus much for that which the Doctors of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> called the material part in the essence of Consecration,
and we may truly term, the outward sign. Let us now examine
that which they call the form, and we may term the words which
express it; the words which our Saviour used <hi>John</hi> 20. 22. are,
<hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost;</hi> these words expresly are used in the
Roman Consecration and Ordination, but in the Graecian the
words are varied, but the sence reserved, not giving this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in the Imperative-mood, (which is much stood upon by
many Schoolmen and Casuists) but in a more humble stile, <hi>The
Grace of God Creates or Promotes thee to this Dignity of a Bishop,
or Priest, or Deacon,</hi> where we find the truth more largly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
though materially the same, for certainly the Grace of
God is that which impowers men with these authorities are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and men are only Instrumental, but that they are, and
therefore there is added how this is given by the suffrage of the
Bishops, which denotes them instrumental, for the African
Church you may discern in the Canon of <hi>Carthage</hi> before cited,
that the Consecration is expressed in a Language of such extent
as may be applied to them both, which is <hi>(uno fundente benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem)</hi>
one of them pouring out the benediction or blessing,
but implying strongly the sence, such as is proper for this work;
to Confirm which, all the present Bishops lay on their hands; and
this universally so consented unto as agreeing to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that although in the heat of disputation, I find men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
over peremptorily asserting their own opinions, yet I do not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61847:137"/>
find that either Church did refuse such as were Consecrated in
either, although in wayes and modes differing from their own,
so that I may justly say that the whole Catholick Church Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in this Conclusion, that when words importing the blessing
are Delivered by a Consecrating Bishop, and those words are
sealed by imposition of Hands, then these holy Orders are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
given; I shall then need to do little more in this Point
than to answer such objections, which are commonly made
against it, or I can apprehend proper to be opposed to it.</p>

Language is the same in the Ordination of Priests; as likewise the
Imposition of Hands; so that by this no man can know what
Order is given; in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is answered that the
design which they are about will shew it, whether to one or to
the other Order; and again the manner of the Imposition of
Hands, in the Consecration of a Bishop, divers Bishops Impose
Hands, in the Ordination of a Priest one Bishop only with some
Presbyters, in the Ordination of a Deacon the Bishop alone,
but in our Church that scruple is clearly taken away by a great
Prudence, where at the Ordination of a Priest, the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
words are, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost, for the office and work of a
Priest,</hi> and at the Consecration of a Bishop the words are, <hi>Receive
the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a Bishop in the Church of
God;</hi> where wee see that universal cause of all Spiritual blessings,
(I mean the Holy Ghost) applied to that particular duty, in
which at that time he works, and therefore the Consecration
is free from that Exception.</p>

Carthage, answered.</head>
                  <p>ANother Ojection may be, that the Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi>
before cited; mentions the laying on the Book by two
Bishops upon the head and shoulders of the Bishop to be Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
and therefore that is necessary; I answer that I much
reverence that Councel in which was St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and divers
other B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops famous for learning and piety in their Generations;
but yet as I have said before, this was never practiced any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
time, as sundry Doctors in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and again it is impossible to be essential because not Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
and that because the Holy Bible, and that highest part of
it the New Testament was not writ when Bishops and Priests were
Ordained, it is therefore worth our marking, that there is a
difference in the decrees of Councels concerning Doctrine and
Discipline, or Ceremonies of the Church in a point of Doctrine,
they shew in what sence they understand such and such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
but in the other they set down what is to be practiced
to preserve Orders and decency in those Churches where they
have to do; and indeed there can be no more required of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than in quiet and setled times, in which times only Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
can be Congregated, and in other times as things necessary
by Divine right must always be kept close unto, so what is only
humane may be spared. it is not possible for humane power to
add any thing of absolute necessity to Divine justice which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be altered; now of this Nature in this Ceremony of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as is most apparent. For first the Pontifical varyes extreamly
much in this very point from the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in adding to it that the Book must be open which is not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Carthage</hi> but by Changing those few Circumstances which
are particularized there, as first where it is said in <hi>Carthage</hi> that
two Bishops shall lay on the Gospel, the Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

it must be done by the Consecrator and the assisting Bishop. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
is peremptory out of <hi>Hostiensis</hi> that it must be done by
three in the third part of his sums <hi>Tit. 14. Cap. 16. Sect.</hi> 9. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of that Section, secondly where the Councel saith
that the Book shall be put upon the head and the neck of the
Consecrated Bishop. The Ponti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ical saith <hi>super scapulam &amp; cervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem</hi>
upon the shoulders and the neck, thirdly whereas the Councel
saith <hi>(uno fundente benedictionem)</hi> one pouring out the blessing;
they make them altogether to give it in these words, <hi>Receive
the Holy Ghost, Antonius</hi> where before is peremptory that three
must do it; thus you see how in the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> the Compiler of that Book is prefer'd before that ever to
to be honoured Councel consisting of above two hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
amongst which were many most eminent men and indeed
the Popes legates likewise, although they could only keep up his
pretensions to it, not prevail for his universal superiority, besides
this I observe in the <hi>Ceremoniale Romanum</hi> put out by Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
the tenth and licensed by him in the second <hi>Sect. litera Charta</hi>
(as the Printer calls it) or as we, <hi>fol.</hi> 11. the Ordinator and
the rest put the Book only upon the neck of the Elect Pope when
he is made Bishop; so that here in these Records of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> besides these other practices of Chaplaines or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eacons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned we find a great liberty taken in varying from the
Councel of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and amongst themselves the Councel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
the Book to be put upon the head and neck,
the Pontifical upon the shoulders and the neck, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
names only the neck which evidently makes it appear
that this Clause hath been looked upon only as an humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
subject to Change and alteration, but the other of
imposition of Hands, as Divine which no humane power could
abrogate or alter: Give me leave since I am in the canvasing of
the Canon to make one observation for the further illustration
of a Conclusion before treated of, that is the Phrase <hi>(uno fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente
benedictionem,)</hi> the blessing is given by one, when the
Pontifical makes it to be given at the same time by many, and
so divers Doctors in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which certainly may
be very confused one begining sooner and so ending, but to
avoid that, the Ceremonial before cited saith, that the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crator
with the rest of the Bishops saith, <hi>Accipe Spiritum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:61847:139"/>
receive the Holy Ghost, but he adds the Consecrator
<hi>alte,</hi> the rest <hi>submisse,</hi> he with a loud voice, the rest with a
soft; and now consider that one is called the Consecrator as
surely he must be, and the rest do but come into his assistance to
lay on their Hands in token of the assurance of it, and therefore
they speak lowly and humbly, he that is the Consecrator doth
Consecrate, the rest come in as assistants and to this purpose
they speak lowly and submissly, and to this purpose <hi>Vasques</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long discourse about this Question concludes <hi>Disp. 240.
Number</hi> 65. that it is enough that one speaks the words and
lays on his Hands likewise, where we may observe by him that
the Consecrators words are, that they call the form of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we may say conveigh the Consecrating virtue, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received in all Christian Churches but the other unconstant
amongst themselves. Another Argument may be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us of the Church of <hi>England</hi> who use a giving of the Bible
to the Bishop who is to be Ordained in our Consecration.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV. An Objection against our practice answered, and
the force of the Argument satisfied.</head>
                  <p>IT is true and it is according to the first Ceremony used in the
Pontisical; where it is said that the Consecrating Bishop
takes the Book from the shoulders of the Consecrated, and with
the other assisting Bishops, gives it shut to the Consecrated
with these words <hi>Accipe Evangelium</hi> receive the Gospel, we
use this, and with it a godly exhortation to the Bishop, but it is
after his Consecration, for that is perfected in the first Act, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Ghost for the office of a Bishop in the Churches of God
now committed unto thee by the imposition of our Hands. In the
name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost;</hi> this only is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
the Consecration, and if the Arch-bishop should be struck
dead immediately after the pronouncing these words; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Bishop should receive no other Consecration, we use
likewise an examination before the Consecration according to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61847:139"/>
first Canon in the fourth Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> although not punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the same yet virtually containing all substantial matter in it;
that reflected principally upon those Heresies which afflicted that
Church at that time, our examination as it included these, so
it particularizeth upon such as more neerly concerned the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of our own, but neither that proceeding, nor this subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exhortation are essentially necessary <hi>ad esse</hi> to the Being
of a Bishop, but conduce to the gravity and decency of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of so high a duty, as likewise for a memorial to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Bishop to put him in mind of the <hi>bene esse</hi> the well and good
execution of his Order, which is a most excellent office, and
being no where forbid but indeed in many places of the New
Testament taught, yea commanded, no man can think but that
at such a Holy time as his Consecration, it is seasonable to put
the Bishop to be Consecrated in mind of such performances
which the Holy Ghost requires of him; this is all I hope is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the satisfaction of that Argument; drawn from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> the first, who was Consecrated by
the imposition of Hands from two Bishops and one Presbyter,,

do that again which hath been done once, because there is no

                  <p>Secondly, that the Errors committed in elections and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
of Popes are no Presidents, because they have too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
much transgressed in that kind. Thirdly, that Consecration
in necessary occasions when more cannot be had, may be by
two or one only Bishop, and yet be essentially good. Fourthly
that nothing is essential but giving the proper blessing with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Hands: for the addition of one Presbyter to the two
Bishops is served only to fill a gap, and to comply with an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

this, that where there is a Bishop there this should be done,

and eye of the Bishop, but in other places where the Church is
governed by the common Councel of Presbyters, that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is valid and good which is made by the imposition of the
Hands of the Presbytery; Thus he, but I desire, and so do many
more, to know where that Church was ever in the Christian
world that gave simple Presbyters power to Ordain others; before
these latter times; the practice whereof I think nothing
can excuse in some Reformed Churches, but a meer necessity
in which Case the vote supplies the Act; but I will proceed no
further with this, all to the midst of the next <hi>Page</hi> is only Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,

                  <p>HE begins with St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>
Cap. 4. the words are truly cited by him which are <hi>apud
Aegyptum Presbyteri consignant si praesens non sit Episcopus,</hi> I will
not disturb this, before I observe his second Quotation, and
make one answer serve both which is <hi>Augustinus sive quicunque
sit author in quaestionibus ex utroque testamento mixtum</hi> Quest. 10.
<hi>In</hi> Alexandria <hi>inquit Presbyter Consecrat,</hi> the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is this, that in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and throughout <hi>Egypt</hi> in the
absence of a Bishop a Presbyter or Presbyters do Consecrate,
by these Fathers in the Citation of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> he ingeniously
saith, <hi>sive quicunque author est illius operis,</hi> whether he or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is Author of that work, indeed it is evident that it is not
his, and he might have said as much of St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> as is app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,
because these Comments are much suspected upon strong grounds,
but indeed are thought to be some Author of that age, and then
though an Heretique or Schismatique in a matter of Story which
concerns not that business for which he is branded, I see no reason
why that matter of fact may not be credited, I therefore must
allow that authority neither will I quarrel at that word in him
which is not <hi>Consecrat</hi> (as in the counterseit <hi>Augustine)</hi> but
<hi>Consignat</hi> which is of a largersence; but ye because that word
is often used for Consecration, I will allow that likewise, yea
I will add that, which some Schoolmen who incline to Doctor
<hi>Forbes</hi> his opinion have observed, which is that the word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrat</hi>
cannot here be taken for Consecrating the holy Eucharist
of the Consecrating the Lords Supper, for that was allowed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in any place, now this seems to intimate a peculiar custom in
<hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> for that, therefore know that other
things are in Ecclesiastical Story said to be Consecrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these of Bishops or the Elements of the Communion,
to wit, Holy houses, Churches, Virgins and Utensils but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61847:141"/>
some may object that this Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ration may be understood of
Bishops; I answer no, out of a famous Story recorded by <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi>
which is in his second Apologue, and a letter writ by
the <hi>Marcotici Praesbyteri &amp; Diaconi</hi> (as they stile themselves)
to <hi>Curiasus</hi> and <hi>Evagrius.</hi> It is there Registred that one <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luthus</hi>
counterfeiting himself to be a Bishop when he was none,
but only a Presbyter Ordained divers persons amongst others,
one <hi>Ischyras</hi> for which he was condemned by <hi>Hosius</hi> and other
Bishops in a general Councel, that he should leave off Episcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and be reduced into his former Order, and therefore saith
the letter, <hi>Ischyras</hi> could be no Priest, who was Ordained only
by him who was no Bishop: give me leave now to shew the
truth of this Story; it hath so great authority for it as <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
who was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Apology for himself writ
to his adversaries, both Lay and Ecclesiastical; if he had been
a man of less Sanctity, yet out of policy he durst not tell such an
errant Lie; granting this, I say, that if the other authorities were
authentique which they are not, that word Consecration must
be understood of other, Consecrations not of Bishops or Priests,
because in <hi>Alexandria</hi> this act was condemned. And so I think
that there is enough said to that Argument drawn from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Episcopi,</hi> as I may say without the Conscience of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
here he puts down three various Translations or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
I can add a fourth which is of another <hi>Isidore, Isidori Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
who put out the Councels by the advice of Fourscore Bishops
as he himself writes in his Epistle before them, but indeed hath
no remarkable difference from the rest, although it varyes from
them; Now saith Doctor <hi>Forbes,</hi> Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> in his first
Epistle to <hi>Purisper</hi> Bishop of the Prime Seat of <hi>Numidia</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orthodox Bishops, he condemns the <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> as an
irregular Order being in themselves but <hi>Praesbyteri,</hi> and taking
upon them Episcopal power. To go methodically in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of this Argument, I propose to my self three things,
1. The Consideration of the authority of the Canons made in this
Councel; next the examination of Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> his decree; and
last the Nature of those <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> or Country Bishops who are
therein mentioned. And first I apply my self to the Councel
which I am content to admit because the Canons thereof were
antiently received into the Code of the Universal Church, and
mentioned both in the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and the Councel in
<hi>Trullo,</hi> though <hi>Estius</hi> in <hi>Quartum Distinct. 25. Sect.</hi> 2. is bold
to reject the Canons of this Councel because there was an ill use
made thereof against two eminent Fathers of the Church St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
and St. <hi>John Chrysostome</hi> who suffered much trouble
and persecution upon the pretence of the IV. and XII. Canons
thereof from their Adversaries, and were sentenced by them
before they well heard. But in particular concerning the Canon
of this Councel about the power of the <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> it is well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

intricate and perplexed, as we shall now declare in the Chapter

in answer to this Argument of Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> drawn from the

they were prohibited as well by that Seat of <hi>Rome,</hi> as by all the
Bishops in the world, this he saith there, and we must take his
word for it only, for I find no such thing upon record before or
after, as will appear when I treat of the nature of them, but he
inveighs justly agaisnt the Laziness of Bishops, which saith, he
brought them into, like Nurces to suckle their children for them,
whilest they the Bishops might enjoy their ease and pleasure. To
conclude, the whole drift of that Epistle is to prove that these
Country Bishops are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Presbyters and therefore have no power
to Ordain Priests, and Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> saith clean contrary, that
although they were but Presbyters, yet by that accursed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Antioch</hi> they might Ordain Priests; The words of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<hi>Damasus</hi> mentions, although he do not name the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and truly these words seemed to me to be of great force,
<hi>quamquam impositionem Episcoporum perceperint,</hi> where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the Plural number, imposition of Hands of Bishops, many
in the Plural number, of which more hereafter: now if they did,
I know not what can hinder them by any Canon from a remote
power to Ordain, which may be acted by only leave from the
Bishop himself, but this is enough for the business of the decree
of <hi>Damasus,</hi> it seems he was angry with them, and disputes
against them, and condemns them, but as Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> well
observes this decree of his, was but little or not at all obey'd;
either because this was no true but a counterfeit Epistle, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these decrees of Popes <hi>extra Cathedram</hi> were not valid, I
know not, but do know this, that it was not observed, so here
we see a wicked Councel condemned by a Pope; and that Pope
neglected by all men afterwards; what he urgeth out of <hi>Isidore
Hispalensis</hi> is of no consideration; but only to mark that the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61847:143"/>
Popes decree was not observed in his time, for <hi>Isidore</hi> there
which is <hi>Lib. 2. de Ecclesiasticis officiis Cap.</hi> 6. sets down only
the bare words of the two Councels of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> and this of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> that of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> only compares the <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> to
the Disciples, this of <hi>Antioch</hi> will prove a most perplexed decree
in its self, and such which may probably be objected against
Doctor <hi>Forbes,</hi> as well as expounded for him, for that out of
<hi>Neocaesarea</hi> which compares the <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> to the seventy
Disciples, <hi>Damasus</hi> shews that they Ordained, but only the
Apostles, and <hi>Isidore</hi> hath not one word of discourse concerning
this office, as he uses to have concerning all others, but only
sets down the words of the Canons; so that it remains for all
him, just as it was, which is most intricate, <hi>Damasus</hi> seems
to conceive that the Records of this Canon did allow them with
leave of the Bishop to Ordain Deacons and Priests and that the
Laziness of Bishops connived at it, for which reason he condemns
them, not the fault only, but for the faults sake, the very office,
this office we find continued in <hi>Isidores</hi> time, after him in the
Church, and in late times as I shall shew, so that as the Pope
thought the Canon of that Councel not obliging, so the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world thought his decrees invalid, wherefore I might well
lay them both aside.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. This Canon Reviewed.</head>
                  <p>BUt I will examine the Canon to see if it have any necessary
construction that way. There are two principal things
which are disputeable in this Canon, first, whether these <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri-Episcopi</hi>
might give Orders to Presbyters with leave of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the City whereto they appertain; secondly, whether
any of them were Bishops by Episcopal Ordination, in both
which we may find the Canon so perplexed as it will be hard to
collect a clear conclusion of it.</p>
                  <p>For the first, it is urged by Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> that the words of
the Canon in all Editions, of which he quotes three, make for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61847:143"/>
him, the first is of <hi>Dionysius Exig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi> a grave Author and he
urgeth his words truly, <hi>Nec Praesbyterum nec Diaconum aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Ordinare praeter Civitatis Episcopum,</hi> speaking of <hi>Chori-Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi,</hi>
they should not Ordain a Priest or Deacon, <hi>praeter</hi> besides
the Bishop of the City, to whom he with his possession is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
Is not this rightly termed by <hi>Estius</hi> a perplexed Canon?
then next take the Edition of <hi>Gentianus Hervetus</hi> which reads it
<hi>absque Vrbis Episcopo,</hi> he must not Ordain these without the
Bishop of the City, this I take to be in his Edition of <hi>Balsamon,</hi>
for so it is there, and then why <hi>Balsaman</hi> who was Patriarch of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> although a good while after, should not be thought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itter to understand the practice of that Church, than those who
lived after him in other Churches, I apprehend not: His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Text is this <hi>Sine Vrbis Episcopo</hi> without the
Bishop of the City, is not to be understood without his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
(as we term it his <hi>Fiat)</hi> but saith he, his Ordination or
Consecration, for saith he, if the Bishop Command the <hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi>
to Ordain and he should do it, that Ordination were
void, so that by this learned Author this perplexed Canon must
be understood against Doctor <hi>Forbes,</hi> but he hath a third Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Isidore Hispalensis</hi> which reads it <hi>praeter conscientiam
Episcopi</hi> without the conscience of the Bishop, and here he
magnifies this Edition and calls it <hi>probatissima Versio</hi> the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
version; but he doth not set down by whom this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
besides himself, neither do I think he can, nor doth
shew any reason why it should be so approved, but his own
Authority; and let us see what he hath got by it, for certainly it
seems not to me to inforce his interpretation, which is that he
may Ordain these offices with the leave of the Bishop, for it
is not <hi>praeter consensum;</hi> but <hi>conscientiam;</hi> now conscience is
not the same with consent, consent is most proper to another
mans action, Conscience to his own, the great actions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
being to accuse or excuse a mans self, or to judg of a mans
own act, or whether they have been done according to right
science; but it meddles not with what concerns other men either
to judge, accuse, or excuse them, unless we are authorized
<hi>in foro publico,</hi> or <hi>privato</hi> in confession, and then it is an act of the
Confessors Conscience only out of this regard that he is bound in
duty to apply his knowledg to others; and therefore to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61847:144"/>
this Phrase better, let us conceive that <hi>Praeter</hi> or beside the
Conscience of the Bishop, is non-sence, but if he or any others
are delighted with this word Conscience in this Canon, I will
shew them a fourth reading where he may find it used most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and significantly, which is <hi>Cresperius</hi> his sum word <hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi>
where he quotes this Canon, and therein saith that a
<hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi> must not Ordain Priests or Deacons <hi>propter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiam
Episcopi</hi> for the conscience he hath of the Bishop of his
City, that is because his Conscience tells him that the Bishop
is only to Ordain such; thus I think that it is no way evident
from the Canon that these men did Ordain Priests or Deacons,
we come next to the second, whether any of these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi>
had Episcopal Ordination, and so might in a case of necessity
Ordain.</p>

himself in judgment, as bad or worse, yet these Pen-Combates
should in that resemble those with swords, where the first engagers
in the quarrel being high with animosities against each other
will give no Quarter, but after the experience of a continued

the fortune of the other to morrow, they manage the warr
more civilly in the future, so it should be with us now, when
the warrs have continued a long time: and experience hath

Quotations miss the right conceit of them: we should spare such
reproachful languages, and deal with one another even our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
more courteously; but let us see why he is so severe against
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> because saith he, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth oppose <hi>Damasus</hi>
and all antiquity, in saying that there are some <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi>
which had Episcopal Consecration, and some which had only
Presbyterial; to this I say, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may be mistaken and so
may <hi>Vasques</hi> the Jesuit who opposeth him in that conclusion; but
I doubt it doth not clearly appear out of antiquity, Which is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
Bellarmine <hi>de Clericis</hi> in his seventeenth <hi>Cap.</hi> conceives
that these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> which he and all writers make to be <hi>vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii
Episcoporum</hi> may be of two sorts, either such as are meer Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
or else such as are suffragans or titular Bishops; the first
sort are they which Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> condemns, and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to encroach upon the Episcopal office; the other he saith
which were suffragan Bishops or titular might do it with leave
from the Bishop of the City; the fault of this saying appears not
to me; for they being <hi>vicarii</hi> may be of either sort or both, and
I spoke it knowingly (as will appear presently in the next <hi>Cap.)</hi> if
they were such as are called <hi>suffragans</hi> (as is reasonable to think)
then they were Ordained Episcopally and might Ordain Priests,
yea Bishops, and did do it, nor doth any thing in <hi>Vasques</hi> or
Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> necessarily confute it, first for Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
he seems to be of opinion, that this Canon doth approve
of the Consecration of these <hi>Chori-Episcopi,</hi> and that they might
give the Order of Priesthood with leave from the chief Bishop,
to avoid that, that they who were presbyters might then do it, he
puts down this distinction, that some had but Presbyterian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
and some Episcopal and this he thinks this Canon implyes
when it saith speaking of the <hi>Chori-Episcopi, etiamsi manus impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitionem

in the Plural number, they had the imposition of Hands of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
not of one only, as Presbyters, and then again it is said,
<hi>&amp; ut Episcopi consecrati fuerunt</hi> and are Consecrated as Bishops,
which words saith Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi> were by the translator added,
and are not in the original Greek, it is probable Pope <hi>Damasus</hi>
who lived near that time, a thousand years and more nearer
than he, and is reported to be learned in the Greek as well as
Latin, should know the words of the Councel, as well as he
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61847:145"/>
or any other, yet he puts down these words, and they are in
both the Lections of <hi>Peter Crabb</hi> I will not trouble my self to
look further, but Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> writing against them, and
condemning them, would not have put down this Argument
against himself, if it had not been the Language used in that
Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what force his Arguments have I shall examine speedily,
but now let us consider the Argument which is only touched by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> if they were a sort of <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> which had the
imposition of Hands from divers Bishops, what reason can be
imagined why such should not Ordain Priests, <hi>Vasques</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this saith, that the imposition of the Hands of Bishops is
not to be understood of many Bishops laying on their Hands at
the same time upon the same man, but that several Bishops at
several times laid their Hands upon several <hi>Chori-Episcopi,</hi> but
to this may be urged that word <hi>(quamvis)</hi> as one, or <hi>etiamsi</hi> as
another Edition, why should the Canon say, although he be
Ordained by the imposition of Hands of Bishops, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
as a Bishop, this although would there signifie nothing
for he should not be by it distinguished from a Presbyter, but
because some were and some were not Ordained by Bishops,
it reacheth even those who were so Ordained, Doctor <hi>Forbes</hi>
is not content with this answer of <hi>Vasques</hi> but adds another
of his own at the bottom of <hi>Page</hi> 171. and throughout 172,
where before cited, the sence of which is that the imposition of
Hands here mentioned is not to be understood passively for the
imposition of Hands which they receive themselves, but active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that imposition of Hands which they had power of to give.
I think I have set it down as clearly as his words can be rendered,
for indeed his Language is as obscure as the Canon it self, but
this is most forced, nor indeed can a man conceive Canonically,
how a <hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi> could receive that active which he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
unless he had received it passively first, by the imposition
of Hands of divers Bishops, nor can a man well imagine in that
Language, <hi>&amp; ut Episcopi Ordinantur,</hi> what that <hi>(ut)</hi> should
mean if it did not come to explain the former Phrase of imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hands of divers Bishops; so that then for ought I see
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> exposition against both these adversaries is the most
clear and congruous to the Canon, let us now examine Pope
<hi>Damasus</hi>'s Arguments as they are scholastically urged by <hi>Vasques</hi>
and that is the marrow of all that is in this Epistle.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Damasus</hi> seems to me, eitheir with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to think there
were two sorts of <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> in the time of making the
Canon which may be perswaded, because although he begins
with this Argument from the Plural number before urged, yet
he never endeavours an answer to it; or else believing them all
but Presbyters, he thinks that his other Argument may invalid
this; and notwithstanding this, being deficient in other things
they are not Bishops by it. His first Argument is drawn from
the word <hi>(Chori)</hi> which signifies Countrey, they were but
country Bishops, when as all Bishops should be of a City: To
this I answer that although such Canons may be made for the
establishment of the government of Churches in a setled King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where are such Cities for the Decorum and honour of
the Episcopal Sea, yet it cannot be in unsetled States, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Gospel should be preached in the barbarous places of the
West-Indies, where are no such places to give Episcopacy that
honour, yet the Church may and ought to be planted and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
put into them to regulate their discipline o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> else things
will go backward faster than forward in the matters of Religion.
Again we may conceive if such Canons be insisted upon, that
they should be understood of prime and chief Bishops, not such
as are <hi>Vicarii Episcoporum</hi> that is vicars of the chief Bishops; Now
it may happen that there be a necessity of such vicars, and they
may be of great use to the Bishop of the City whose Diocess is
large, as will appear shortly, and these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> although
they may be impeded in the execution of their office by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
authority of the Bishop of the City, yet with his consent
are impowred to Ordain in these cases, which is most agreeing
to the letter of the Canon according to any Edition, either <hi>sine</hi>
or <hi>praeter</hi> or whatsoever it is. This is enough I think for the first
Argument of Pope <hi>Damasus.</hi>

Priesthood, Bishops and Presbyters, this he enlargeth and
proves from the Church under the Law, where were <hi>Aaron</hi> and
his Sons only in the Priesthood, as likewise from our Saviour
himself who had only Apostles and Disciples; so saith he, it should
be in the present Church, now it seems these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> are
neither, they esteem themselves greater than Presbyters and yet
are not Bishops, wherefore nothing in answer; what they
esteem themselves I know not, but we have good reason to think
some were Bishops and some only Presbyters, and they who
were Bishops might act these great offices of Ordaining Priests
and Deacons with leave of the Bishop of the Diocess, those who
were only Priests, could not; Thus <hi>Damasus</hi> his Arguments are
are of no force against that Canon of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and therefore
<hi>Vasques</hi> himself acknowledgeth in that 238. <hi>Disp. Cap.</hi> 7. That
<hi>Damasus</hi> did conceive that in the time of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
some <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> were Bishops, and he affirms that if they
had Episcopal Consecration, although they were but titular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and so had no place assigned at their Consecration where
they should officiate, yet they had that power granted them at
their Consecration, which might be reduced into act whensoever
a place was assigned them, and yet <hi>Damasus</hi> condemns them for
the future which was never obeyed.</p>

the <hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi> must be Ordained by the Bishop to whom he

I have said in a case of necessity, one Bishop hath been allowed
to Consecrate, and the power Apostolical was to them <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
to every one to Ordain, yet when Laws were substituted
by Ecclesiastique authority, for the well government of the
Church and severe punishments inflicted upon the violation of

concerning a double sort of <hi>Chori-Episcopi,</hi> some that were
made by the imposition of Hands of divers Bishops, and others
that were ordained by one only, which is all is required, and so
I will pass to my last proposal to shew what these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi>
were,</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. What the Chori-Episcopi were.</head>
                  <p>IT is a hard task which I do not find clearly delivered by any,
what I find shall be set down and leave the determination to
others; In general my conceipt of them is this, that as it happens
in other Parisnes where Presbyters have the charge, that where
they are large and require Chappels of ease, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sometimes gets a Deacon to officiate in a Chappel and do all
the lesser duties for him: Reads the Prayers and Lessons, yea
Baptize where he cannot be present to act it himself; yet if he have
a Chappel at which he cannot reside, (as it is too often in my
Diocess) he must have a compleat Presbyter to do that work;
so it was in those greater Parishes of Bishops (which we call Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesses,
but were heretofore called Parishes) when they are large
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61847:147"/>
and cannot well be super-intended by a Bishops care; he had <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri-Episcopi,</hi>
such as being Presbyters only might do his work,
of which they were capable by Commission: But yet if they were
very large; for which it would be troublesome for the Diocess
to receive the Episcopal duties which were beyond the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
authority, there it was necessary to have such <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi>
which were Bishops; And as that Country Parson may restrain
his Curate in the exercise of his authority, you shall not absolve
such and such faults, nor give the Communion at such and such
times without my particular leave, because I mean to be present
at those times, so may be the case of those <hi>Chori-Episcopi,</hi> who
were Bishops, they might Ordain those lesser Orders, as they
are called, Sub-deacons and Readers but not Priests or Deacons,
which indeed are Orders, but by leave from their superior Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
And this I think may fairly meet with the Council of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and all that I can find any where in antiquity spoken of
them; That this may appear more clearly, consider first,</p>
                  <p>That this office is by some made as antient as the Apostles times,
they say that <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> were <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> to St. <hi>Peter</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> so <hi>Platina</hi> with others, and there may appear some
reasons for it, because when St. <hi>Peter</hi> had pitched upon that place
for his Diocess (if he did so) and was necessarily to prosecute his
great Apostolical design about the world in other places; as well
as <hi>Rome;</hi> it was necessary that he should have some men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
worth to Episcopize for him in his absence, but then I find
not that they in his life time did Ordain any to these Orders (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
perhaps they might do it) until they came to be Bishops
themselves at <hi>Rome.</hi>

seventy which amounts to nothing; whether they were Bishops
appears not by that, but that they were assistants to the supreme
Bishops, as the seventy were to the Apostles: The n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xt, shall be
the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the two former are mentioned by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Forbes,</hi> but not this, this Council in the fifty seventh Canon
decrees this <hi>Quod non oporteat in villis &amp; pagis Episcopos consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui
sed visitatores, veruntamen jamdudum constituti nihil facient
praeter conscientiam Episcopi Civitatis,</hi> saith one Edition, <hi>sine
mente Episcopi,</hi> saith another; We may perceive in this Canon
two things, first, that it forbids these <hi>Chori-Episcopi</hi> or Country-Bishops,
secondly, that although it forbids them, yet it supposeth,
that of themselves they had authority to Episcopize, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
restrains the Execution of that authority to the leave from
the Bishop of the City, and therefore from that time they were
to be regulated by him.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I meet with in Order, is the Eighth Canon of
that great and glorious Council of <hi>Nice</hi> the first where I find that
upon the reconciliation of the <hi>Novations</hi> which called themselves
<hi>Catharei</hi> or <hi>Puri</hi> (as more holy than other men) when these came
into the Church and were received, if they had been Ordained
by the <hi>Novations</hi> as Bishops; before they were admitted
upon repentance into favour, they were admitted into the
same Order in which they were before, but if there were
an Orthodox Bishop in that Diocess, he might allow him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and name of a Bishop if he would, if not, he might allow
him the place of Presbyter or Country Bishop in his Diocess; but
to avoid a clashing of Competitors in the same City; he must
have no power there in the City, where I observe that <hi>Chori-Episcopus</hi>
may be such, as his Episcopal Consecration would
have been good in a vacant Bishoprick to entitle him to it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
if he was, where was a full Bishoprick he would be, but a
<hi>Chori-Episcopus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which follows next is that canvased Council of <hi>Antioch</hi>
which occasioned all this Discourse, and then comes in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of <hi>Damasus</hi> to which I have spoken, and I may add the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61847:148"/>
Epistle of St. <hi>Basil</hi> which is writ <hi>Chori-Episcopis,</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a sharp reproof of their negligence in giving Orders, and a
prohibition that there should not any from thenceforth be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without his examination, and that these unworthy persons
who had been brought into the list of the Clergy should be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
with much more tending to that purpose; where I observe
that not the defect of power, but their abuse of their powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
was it they were blamed for, that which <hi>Isidore Hispalensis</hi> or
<hi>Hrabarus Maurus</hi> delivers concerning it, is not more than was
in the former Councils; <hi>Balsamon</hi> saith, they were almost
worn out in his time, the <hi>Meldensian</hi> allows them to be, but
abridgeth their power, yet commands Bishops not to authorize
them by their own negligence or infirmities, so now although
Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> his decree could not prevail to extirpate them,
yet this Council thought fit to restrain their practice, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
was Eight hundred years after Christ and more, I will not
write how <hi>Vasques</hi> remembers some in his time but come close
to our own Age and Country; if these men were the same with
Suffragans, which I know no reason to deny, then no doubt but
they had Episcopal Ordination and did Consectate, not Priests
only, but Bishops also; To prove this let any man peruse that
excellent piece of <hi>Francis Mason de ministerio Anglicano</hi> he shall
find that in the dayes of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> and <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi>
and <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Suffragans of Bedford, Chichester,
Taunton,</hi> were Episcopally Consecrated and did joyn in the
Consecration of other Bishops. So now I have finished this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
out of this debate concerning the 10. Canon of <hi>Antioch</hi>
in which I have shewed that if the Council it self be admitted, yet
that Particular Canon to be most perplexed, but if it lean any
way it is against Doctor <hi>Forbes,</hi> since it is most reasonable to think
by that story which I have set down concerning them, that there
were at the least divers of the <hi>Chori-Episcopi,</hi> which had Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Consecration, although perhaps some, who had not; and
I think there is little of moment to be found in antiquity concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them which is not observed by me, there is an Epistle of
<hi>John,</hi> the third Pope of that name but it is rejected by <hi>Binius</hi> and
so slighted by me,</p>
                  <p>And yet me thinks some may ask my opinion of those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
where are no Bishops, first I dare censure no man, much less
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61847:148"/>
such large Congregations amongst which I know there are many
learned men, and no doubt, but full of Piety, I may be deceived
and so may they, <hi>humanum est errare</hi> but certainly in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
that I have with antiquity there seems to me no
ground for them there, nor in the Scripture; these few pieces
which this learned Gentleman had Collected are but old totered
Rags, which cannot abide to be stitched to this new Garment,
they have nothing to excuse themselves but necessities which
whether they have sufficient or no, to excuse them, let their
own Souls Judge, God will, I dare not.</p>
