            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He trade of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, is not onely that laudable practize wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the entercourſe of Nations is ſo worthily performed, but alſo (as I may terme it) the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes proſperitie, when therein ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rules ſhall be diligently obſerued. For, as in the eſtates of priuate perſons, wee may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1252:5"/>
accompt that man to proſper and growe rich, who being poſſeſſed of reuenues more or leſſe, doth accordingly proportion his expences; whereby he may yearelie aduance ſome maintenance for his poſteritie. So doth it come to paſſe in thoſe Kingdomes, which with great care and warineſſe doe euer vent out more of their home commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, then they import and vſe of forren wares; for ſo vndoubtedly the remainder muſt returne to them in treaſure. But where a contrarie courſe is taken, through wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe and riot; to ouer waſte both forren and domeſtike wares; there muſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of neceſſitie be exported, as the meanes to helpe to furniſh ſuch exceſſe, and ſo by the corruption of mens conditions and manners, manie rich countries are made exceeding poore, whileſt the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, too much affecting their owne enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doe lay the fault in ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, induſtry to increaſe, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie to maintaine, are the true watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a kingdomes treaſury; euen when, the force and feare of Princes prohibitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly retaine the ſame.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as it is moſt plaine, that proportion or quantitie, muſt euer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in the importing of forren wares; ſo muſt there alſo be a great reſpect of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and vſe; that ſo, the things moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1252:5"/>
be firſt preferred; ſuch as are foode, rayment, and munition for warre and trade; which great bleſſinges, when any countrie doth ſufficiently enioy; the next to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured are wares, fitting for health, and arts; the laſt, are thoſe, which ſerue for our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ornament.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch, as by the prouidence of almightie God, the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> is indowed with ſuch aboundance of rich commodities, that it hath long enioyed, not onely great plentie of the things before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but alſo, through a ſuperfluitie, hath beene much inriched with treaſure brought in from forren parts; which hath giuen life vnto ſo many worthy trades, amongſt which that vnto the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> by name; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port whereof, although it is already ſpread ſo famous through the world; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, heere at home, the clamorous complaints againſt the ſame, are growne ſo loude and generall; that (my ſelfe being one of the Society it hath much troubled my priuate meditations, to conceaue the means or true groundes of this confuſion. But at the laſt I reſolued my ſelfe, that the greateſt number of theſe exclaimers, are led away in ignorance; not hauing as yet, diſcerned the myſteries of ſuch waightie affaires; Some haue beene tranſported with enuie, as not participating in the ſaid Societie, or beeing

thereby hindred (as they conceiue) in ſome other trade; and others, wholy corrupted in their affections; who whileſt they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runne into theſe errors, doe alſo labour diligently to ſeduce others; that ſo, this good and glorie of the kingdome, might be ſubuerted by our ſelues, which by the pollicie and ſtrength of Strangers, cannot ſo eaſilie be abated; wherefore, it is now a fit time to meete with ſuch iniurious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by a true Narration of the paſſages in the ſaid <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; anſwering to thoſe ſeuerall obiections, which are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie made againſt the ſame; That ſo theſe miſunderſtandings and errours may be made knowne vnto the whole body of this Kingdome, which at this preſent time is moſt worthily repreſented in thoſe noble aſſemblies of the high Courts of <hi>Parliament</hi>; where I hope the worth of this rich Trade, ſhall be effectually inquired, and ſo in the end obtaine the credit of an honorable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 And Secondly, in the ſaid Trade, wee muſt conſider, that although the ſaid goodes be ſent out, and returned home in other wares from forren partes; yet ſtill, they are negotiated to the increaſe of the ſaid ſtocke, and for the imployment of the Subiects.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if there be a reſolution to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1252:17"/>
and end the buſineſſe: who doubteth, that the whole value,<note place="margin">

For in <hi>Italy, Turkey,</hi> and other places, where they are moſt vendible to profit, there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the money free to be exported at all times and by whomſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>And as it is moſt certen, that ſome other Merchandize, ſent out of this Kingdome were the meanes to bring in the 100000. l. in readie moneyes,<note place="margin">We haue no other meanes to procure Treaſure but by Trade and Merchandize.</note> which is here ſuppoſed to be ſent and imployed in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> (as aforeſaid) ſo likewiſe, there is the ſame power in theſe <hi>Indian</hi> wares, to procure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſommes of ready moneyes, to be brought into this kingdome: For let no man doubt, but that money doth attend Merchandize, for money is the prize of wares, and wares are the proper vſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; ſo that their Coherence is vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> ſend the vallue of 600000. l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yeerely in ready money into <hi>Turkey.</hi>
                     </note> And if the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> made any doubt of this, they would not ſo willingly permit the vallue of 600000. l. ſterling, or more in <hi>Spaniſh Rialls</hi> and <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> yearely to be carried out of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions into <hi>Turkey</hi>: whereof three quarter partes at leaſt are imployed, onely for the buying of <hi>Perſia</hi> Raw-ſilkes, which commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie doth preſently enable them with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die money from diuerſe other States to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Trade; whereby their wealth doth

much increaſe,<note place="margin">Trade maketh ſome States very rich which haue little other meanes.</note> and their people are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed. So to conclude this point, I will onely add, that the <hi>Eaſt-India Trade</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (although it be driuen in no amplier manner then is afore written) is a meanes to bring more treaſure into this Realme then al the other trades of this kingdome (as they are now mannaged) being put together.</p>
                  <p>For if the rule be true,<note place="margin">If the generall Trade of this kingdome doth export a greater value in wares then it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port yearely, then doth our treaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</note> that when the value of our commodyties exported doth ouer-ballance the worth of all thoſe forraigne wares which are imported and conſumed in this kingdome, then the remaynder of our ſtock which is ſent forth, muſt of neceſſitie returne to vs in Treaſure.

                  <p>Now, it is this length of life which Nature ſeekes, and States likewiſe endeauour to preſerue in worthy men; but none are accounted ſo worthy in this nature, ſaue onely they, who labour in their vocations and functions, both for the publique good, and for their priuate benefit.</p>

                  <p>How can this be, when it is moſt certaine, that <hi>England</hi> (beſides the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> fleets) had neuer yet more ſhipping then at this preſent? neither do any of them ſtay at home for want of Marriners, no, not at this time, when many hundred Saylers are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in extraordinary ſeruice, for his Maieſtie in a Royall fleete of ſhips, now at Sea: beſides thoſe great numbers of our beſt Marriners, which haue beene and dayly are waſted and taken priſoners by the <hi>Turkes</hi>; ſo where is this want, or what is our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery more then the want of true information in them that are ſo ill perſwaded of our company?</p>

                  <p>Neither indeed are theſe voyages ſo dangerous and mortall, as is reported; for how many of our ſhips, haue gone and come from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> without the loſſe of fiue men in a hundreth?<note place="margin">Our Marriners owne diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life is that which killeth many of them.</note> Others againe haue had worſe ſucceſſe in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the ſeaſons, the places and their conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were not ſo well knowne vnto vs; yet time hath taught vs many things, both for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, and ſpeedier performance of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretofore.

But (praiſed be God) to our comfort, we ſee the great increaſe of goodly Ships, daily built and imployed, by the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants with vent of more of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Cloath (by one third part at leaſt) then in times before the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> trade began.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I grant they haue; yet the Kingdome hath found it with more profit by another way; and they likewiſe are recompenced with a greater Trade, by the exporting from hence of the ſelfe-ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities into <hi>Italy, Turkey,</hi> and other places: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be leſſe profitable for this kingdome, to turne the Trade of Raw-Silkes from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and to bring them from the <hi>Perſian</hi> gulfe, with one third part leſſe money, then it doth now coſt in <hi>Turkey</hi>; Beſides, that by this meanes, the money procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our Engliſh Cloath, Tin, and other wares in Turkey (not finding commodities ſitting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne for England) would vndoubtedly be brought home in Gold, as it hath beene performed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when by ſuperfluitie of ſtocke ſent from hence in Spice, together with our Engliſh wares; the

                  <p>Thus doth it plainely appeare, that theſe reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Trades, haue and doe turne to the good of the Commonwealth; neither hath the affayres of the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> impaired or decayed any other Trade, Shipping or Marriners of this Realme; but hath mightily increaſed them all in it ſelfe.

                  <p>But vpon the ſight of this truth, perhaps it will be ſaid, That wee muſt reſort vnto the preſent times, (the Mint being idle now.)</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That likewiſe the Mint had little or no imployment for coynage of Siluer in former times,<note place="margin">There hath bin little or no Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer coyned in ſome yeares, when the Eaſt India Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſent out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall ſums of money.</note> when the ſaid Company did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port aboue fifteene or twenty thouſand pounds ſterling at the moſt <hi>per annum</hi>; no, nor yet in the yeares 1608. and 1612: when in the former they ſhipped out but 6000.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.—00. s.—00<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and in the latter, but 1250.<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.—00. s.—00.<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. ſterling.

For we haue not had the meanes by our owne plentie, not by the ſcarſitie of our neighbours, (for the ſpace of the laſt foureteene yeares together) to ſend out hundreds of Ships laden with Corne, as in times paſt which was returned home in Siluer;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1252:28"/>
but rather of late yeares (as is much to be feared) a great quantitie of our money hath beene carried out of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">Some cauſes and meanes which were wont to bring Siluer into the Realme, are ceaſed at this preſent time.</note> for that Corne which hath beene brought vs from the Eaſt Countries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to ſupply our wants.

                  <p>And yet before I make an end, although I cannot ſatisfie euery mans deſire, in ſuch meaſure as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: yet I thinke it not amiſſe to performe the ſame ſo farre as I am able by common practiſe, and my obſeruations in the Trade of Merchandize, which is my profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>And firſt therefore, all men doe know, that the riches or ſufficiencie of euery Kingdome, State, or Common-wealth, conſiſteth in the poſſeſſion of thoſe things, which are needfull for a ciuill life.</p>
                  <p>This ſufficiency is of two ſorts: the one is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and proceedeth of the Territorie it ſelfe:<note place="margin">The riches of a Kingdome is of two ſorts.</note>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1252:29"/>
the other is artificiall, and dependeth on the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>The Realme of <hi>England</hi> (praiſed be God) is happily poſſeſſed of them both: as firſt, hauing great plentie of naturall riches, both in the Sea for Fiſh, &amp; on the Land for Wooll, Cattle, Corne, Lead, Tin, Iron, and many other things for food, Rayment &amp; Munition; inſomuch, that vpon ſtrickt tearmes of need, this land may liue without the help of any other Nation.</p>
                  <p>But to liue well, to flouriſh and grow rich, we muſt finde meanes, by Trade to vent our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; therewith to furniſh and adorne vs with the Treaſure and thoſe neceſſarie wares, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Nations doe afford:<note place="margin">This kind of induſtry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome Countries which are poor in themſelues, to grow rich and ſtrong by other Nations, who haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes, and are leſſe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious.</note> and here induſtrie muſt begin to play his part, not onely to increaſe and guide the Trades abroad; but alſo to maintaine and multiply the Arts at home: for when either of theſe faile, or are not effected with ſuch skill as their myſterie ſhall require, then doth the Common-wealth abate &amp; growes poore; neither is this eaſily perceiued at firſt, vntill ſome euill accidents doe ſtirre vp our diligence to ſearch out the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſo they being remoued, the effects may ceaſe.

                  <p>That which I haue hitherto deliuered, hath beene altogether Negatiue, ſtill defending and prouing by arguments, that the <hi>Eaſt India Trade</hi> hath not hurt: this Common-wealth; And now changing my ſtile, I muſt affirme as faſt the true cauſes of thoſe euils which we ſeeke to chaſe away.</p>

                  <p>Now concerning all theſe, I might make a very large diſcourſe; but my purpoſe is only to explane the meaning of euery point in order, as briefely as I can.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for the breach of Entercourſe;<note place="margin">The Firſt Cauſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</note> by this I vnderſtand thoſe Nations, who haue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debaſed their Standard, or elſe ouer-valued the price of their Coynes from that equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which formerly they had with the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and Moneys of this Realme; And alſo doe tollerate, not onely their owne Moneys,<note place="margin">Proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> but alſo the Coyne of other Countries (and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this Kingdome) to bee currant with them at higher rates, then the prizes of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; by which courſes (being directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Entercourſe) there is a greater cauſe giuen of exportation of the Moneys of this Realme, then otherwiſe there would be.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1252:30"/>
being euer conuerſant in wicked actions, thinketh nothing vnlawfull, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth a certaine gaine; and how to remedie this euill practiſe I finde it not eaſie. For the debaſing of the Coyne, or raiſing the price thereof in this Realme, would much impoueriſh the eſtates of particular men, and yet in the concluſion, would proue a buſineſſe without end: for who doth not conceiue that which would follow beyond the Seas vpon any ſuch alteration here with vs? ſo that ſtill the euill will remaine, vntill we find ſome other remedie.</p>

the examples too frequent in many of our owne Merchants, who not onely by the perils of the Seas and ſuch like misfortunes, loſe their goods, but alſo euen through want of knowledge, wiſely to direct their affaires, doe ouerthrow their whole eſtates: neither may we properly call this their loſſe, but rather the kingdomes loſſe in them.

So then to conclude this poynt, we ought not to auoid the importation of forraine wares, but rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to bridle our owne affections to the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſuming of the ſame: for otherwiſe, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade in particular is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes greatly to encreaſe the ſtocke of mony which we ſend thither yearely,<note place="margin">The particular Trade to the Eaſt Indies wil bring great ſtore of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into this Realme, if the generall Trade of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe not hinder and conſume it</note> by returning home fiue times the value thereof in rich commodities, all which (in ſhort time) may bee conuerted into Treaſure, as is plainly ſhewd already in Page 25. Yet notwithſtanding, if theſe <hi>Indian</hi> wares thus brought home, cannot be ſpared to ſerue for that purpoſe of Treaſure; but muſt be ſent forth together with our owne natiue commodities: and yet all little enough to prouide our exceſſe and extraordinary conſume of forraine wares: then is it likewiſe as certaine that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1252:32"/>
the generall Trade of this Kingdome doth hinder and diuert the comming in of the ſaid Treaſure, by ouer-ballancing the value of our wares exported; with the importation and immoderate conſume of forraine Commodities.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, foraſmuch as the number of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Realme, are thought to be greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of late time (both in themſelues and ſtrangers) whereby neceſſarily the Commodities of this Kingdome, and alſo forraine wares, are the more conſumed and waſted, a double meanes to abate the Common-wealth;) it therefore concerneth vs all in generall, and euery man in his particular, to ſtirre vp our minds, and diligence, to helpe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Commodities of this Realme by induſtrie, and increaſe of Arts; ſeeing that the materials can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee wanting to make ſuch Stuffes, and other things as are daily brought vnto vs from forraine parts, to the great aduantage of Strangers, and to our no leſſe dammage. Neither ſhould we neglect the riches which our Seas affoord, whileſt other Nations by their labour doe procure themſelues great Treaſure from the ſame.<note place="margin">The Dutch in particular, are ſaid to reape ſuch infinite wealth yearely by this fiſhing Trade, that without more certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof I dare not ſet downe the ſum, it ſeemeth ſo vncredible.</note> And as the diligent performance of theſe things, would plentifully maintaine the poore, and much increaſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtocke of this Kingdome: ſo likewiſe for the better furtherance thereof, wee ought religiouſly to auoid our common exceſſes of food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is growne to ſuch a height in moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of people (aboue their abilitie) that it is now beyond all example of former ages. Neither is it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1252:33"/>
needfull for me, to ſet downe the particulars of theſe abuſes; for they are too well knowne: and I am confident, that the wiſedome of our Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth endeuour to ſee them as well amended, to the glorie of God, the honour of the King, and the good of the Common-wealth. <hi>Amen.</hi>
