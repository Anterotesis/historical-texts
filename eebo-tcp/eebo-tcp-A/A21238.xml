         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not long since in the Countrie of <hi>Cambia</hi> which is situate neere the mouth of the riche Riuer <hi>Indus,</hi> a mightie Duke bare dominion called <hi>Occanon:</hi> who had heire to his estate but one onely Daughter named <hi>Caudina:</hi>

In smal proces of time the seecret fires of their fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies discouered by the smoake of their desires, bewrayed this matter vnto her father long time before they woulde. The Duke dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling what he sawe, but determined to disapoynt that he most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliked, neither made challenge to the Knighte, nor charged his Daughter for any loue was betwixt them, but deuised a way as he thought more sure, (but as it proued moste sorrowfull) to set these louers asunder by the worke of an inchantresse most cunning in her kind: he caused <hi>Contarenus,</hi> to be conueyed vp and carried in the ayre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cost of <hi>Cambia</hi> to the very bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the <hi>Occean</hi> sea: whiche cost <hi>Occanon</hi> twentye thousande Crownes (a deere price for repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:) but it is no nouelty for Princes to make their wils verie costly, and sometime to pay deere for their own displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <hi>Contarenus</hi> thus strangely deuided from his ioye and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed aboue measure was charged by the inchantresse to weare this punishment with patience, which necessitie did put on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny would put off: and ere seuen yeeres came about, she truely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured him, he should haue for his reward the height of his desire: but first he should fight with the hardiest knight, and see the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest Lady of the world.

And to this Idoll he seemed to offer all hys loue and seruice, leauing no manner of obseruaunce vndone, that to loue appertayned: As wearing her colours on his backe, her pictures in his bosome, keeping her company aboue all others, and continuing most at her commandement: which espyed by this Lady (that indeed was liked no more) for whatsoeuer man may thinke might become or content though she cared not for his choyse, yet he shewed scorne of

Which <hi>Loricus</hi> perceiuing, he fel by &amp; by to consider, that the want of his worth made his seruice vnaccepted, and no impossibility in her will to receiue one too serue her, that merited the honour of such fauour. Therefore hee left his owne countrey, and betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe altogether to trauel, and to armes, desiring with most indeuour but to deserue that reputation as this great and noble mistris woulde but thinke him worthy to be hers, though she would neuer bee none of his; so thinking no toyle too tough, nor no attempt too hard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to renown, he wandred through the world till he came by pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes to Sibillas grate, where he met with <hi>Caudina.</hi> Where these two louers hauing occasion to vnfold al their fortunes: the Lady see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to know the end of her trauel, and the knight aduise for the ease of his hope, they both receiued this answeare of <hi>Sibilla:</hi> That as they were nowe coupled by this fortune, so they should neuer depart fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, till they had found out a place, where men were most stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most fayre, the countrey most fertile, the people most wealthy, the gouernment most iust, and the Princes most worthy: so shoulde the Lady see that would content her, so shoulde the knight heare that might comfort him. Now most deere and best deseruing Lady, it falles to my purpose, and your praise, to say somewhat of my selfe. Olde though you see me here, &amp; wrinckled and cast into a corner, yet once haue I been otherwise: A knight knowne and accounted of, with the best of the world: and liuing in court of most fame amongst a swarm of knights and Ladies of great woorth and vertue, where beauty bade the basse &amp; desire sought the gole. It chaunced me to loue a Lady, to be beloued of Loue himselfe, if he could but haue seene her: but as she was such as did excell, so was she of woonderfull condition, wythout disdaine to be desired, but most dainty to bee dealt with: for touch her, &amp; she wil turne to 20. diuers shapes, yet to none but to content, as me thought, that thought stil to touch her, was a heauen: &amp; so it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by my hold that was so loth to let her go. Till (alas) it liked her at last to put on the shape of a Tigris so terrible to behold, as I durst hold her no longer, and being so escaped, I could neuer more sette eie on her. Madam, thus began my paine, but you heare not yet my punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

beeing shifted from the sighte of that I sought aboue the world, and then little delighting to looke on any thing els, I tooke by &amp; by a Pilgrimage to <hi>Paphos</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> trusting to heare of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris there, where <hi>Venus</hi> was most honoured.

Thy folly &amp; presumption (quoth <hi>Venus</hi> Chaplen as I gesse) from my youth vp quoth I, haue I euer been an honourer of vertue, a delighter in learning, and a seruaunt of Loue.

Books and beauty make no match, and it is an whole man or no man, that this Goddesse wil haue to serue her, and therwithal taking me by the shoulders, he thrust me out of the Temple. So with sighes and sorrow I sate down in the porch, making intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Apollo</hi> (the peculiar God I honored) to haue compassion on my estate: Now faithfull prayers beyng hard ere they be ended: <hi>Mercury</hi> comes vnto me, and bid me be of good comfort, the goddesses be alfound to haue this fault: <hi>Diana</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Pallas</hi> with <hi>Arachne: Iuno</hi> with <hi>Tirecias,</hi> were angry aboue measure: so is <hi>Venus</hi> now with thee, the cause with the remedy shall be told thee at <hi>Delphos,</hi> whither straight I must carry thee. Which he had no sooner spoken, but by &amp; by I was set in the temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> Where first demanding my fault, the Oracle made answere: Thy feare and not thy faith: and what quoth I, may be my remedy?

Ma. had in sight the house, which indeede was a place by art so reared from the ground, as neuer before, nor hereafter, shal I see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. First it was inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed the number of 200. paces round with lat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise, the place of the princes entrance bedect with Iuy &amp; spanges of gold plate, the glimering wherof was such, that men of great iudgement might haue held themselues at stay. The ground fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence reared litle &amp; litle to the altitude of forty foot or more, the path in mounting couered with fresh turues, with such art, that a great many made question of his skil, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Layer. The way was railed with lattice, beset with sweet flowres &amp; Iuy, as before: aboue in the house was a Table made in order of a halfe moon or more, couered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> green turues (&amp; so replenished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sorts of dainty, &amp; those diuers dishes belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to banquet, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders might wel haue though,</hi> Iupit. <hi>had hoped the connuing, &amp; trusted the pleasing by banquet of his faire</hi> Europa.) <hi>At one ende therof somwhat dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, was placed another table (but round) with a chayre costly made of Crymson veluet, imbrodred with branches &amp; pictures of wild beasts &amp; trees, as it had beene a peece of woorke made in the desartes.

downe her branches to couer the house, whiche was done wyth such art, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praise of the beholders comming wold haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the woorker for his trauel: although hee was not so satisfied for his skil, by more then 40. pounds. A number of fine Pictures with posies of the Noble or men of great credite, was in like sort hanging there, where with many were in loue, and aboue the rest the French Embassadour, whiche was present at these sightes, made great suite to haue some of them. The whiche posies, with some perfect note of their pictures, I would haue presented vnto you: but because the Allegories are hard to be vnderstood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some knowledge of the inuentors, I haue chosen my tyme rather when my selfe shall be present, &amp; more the sooner, because I woulde leaue nothing vnfulfilled of my firste determination.

                  <l>Yet say, I wil abide hers to command,</l>
                  <l>where so aduentures hard shal carry me,</l>
                  <l>Not leauing loue by Sea nor yet by land,</l>
                  <l>though that I loue, I neuer hap to see.</l>
                  <l>Oh careful heart opprest with such desires,</l>
                  <l>as lacks the ioyes that lyking aye requires.</l>
