         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that myne eye was neuer pulde from the Wethercocke, and
longing like a Woman for your returne, I neuer sawe gale of

I am, tell them that I was once a Barbour in Rome (as some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
and euerie chayre in my shop, was a tongue ful of newes.
Whatsoeuer was done in England, Fraunce, Germanie, Spaine,
Italie, and other Countries, was brought to me. The high and
secrete matters of Lordes, Ladies, Kings, Emperours, Princes,
Popes, &amp; Monarchs of the world, did ring euerie day as shrill
as a Bason about my doores. In memory whereof, as <hi>Mercurie</hi>
turnd <hi>Battus</hi> to a stone for bewraying his theft, it is thought
that one Pope or other, mistrusting the slipprines of my tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
blest me into a stone to stoppe my mouth. Others affirme, that
the Cittie of Rome, to requite mee with honour when I dyed,
erected me a little monument of stone, with a bodie, heade, and
hands thicke and short, answerable to my stature, and set it vp
in the open streete, where I assure you I haue stoode manie
yeeres in the rayne, my face is so tand with the Sunne, and my
hyde so hardened with the wether, that I neither blush when I
byte any man, nor feele it when any man byteth me.</p>

               <p>Beeing
once somwhat busie with Signor <hi>Iacomo,</hi> about a pretie wench
kept at Frescata for the Pope his Fathers tooth. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the
thirteenth, <hi>terque quaterque,</hi> shooke his white head at me with
such a terrible looke, that I was a feard hee would haue smytte
my head into Tyber with a Thunderbolt. Neuerthelesse, the
olde man beeing of a mylde disposition, and very mercifull, I
receiued a pardon for that fault. At the last, hearing the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb facs="tcp:14591:3"/>
of the English Seminarie merrie, as they returned from
thier Vineyarde, and full of fine tauntings when they talked of
the Sectes and opinions spronge vp in England, I stole out of
Rome by night, to make tryall my selfe of the trueth of theyr
reports. When I came to England, for the good will I carried
to my olde occupation, I entred at London into <hi>Sprignols</hi> shop,
where the first newes I heard among two or three Gentlemen,
as they were a trimming, was, of a <hi>Martinist</hi> a Broker, the
next doore by, which with a face of Religion, hauing gotten
other mens goods into his hands, was but newe run away, and
left his wife to the charitie of the Parrish. With this ridings, I
grew verie inquisitiue to know what <hi>Martin</hi> was? A knaue
quoth one; a theefe quoth another; he teacheth the Courte a
Religion to robbe the Church. And some of the Cittie that
fauour him, apt Schollers to take such an easie lesson, begin to
practise theyr cunning vpon their neighbors. Hauing gotten
this thred by the end, I neuer left winding til I came to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that made the bottom. I frequented the Churches of the
Pruritane Preachers, that leape into the Pulpit with a Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fork,
to teach men, before they haue either learning, iudgment,
or wit inough to teach boyes.</p>

down all the vpstart Religions in this Land. The Anabaptists,
the Family of Loue; the seuen capital haeresies for which som
haue beene executed of late yeeres in Suffolke; the diuersities
of Puritans and <hi>Martinists,</hi> with a number more which you
shall heare of when that Booke is Printed. A lamentable spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
it will be, to see so many faces in one hoode. But GOD
knoweth, (before whom I stand) I desire not to cast it out as a
block in the waies of men, for any to stumble at, or to stand at
defiance with all Religion; but as a Sea-marke to discouer the
quicksands of newe Religions.</p>
               <p>I haue heard that <hi>Bernardin Ochin,</hi> a man of great learning,
whom I knewe in Rome to be the first founder of the order of
the Capuchines, being once tucht with the finger of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
began to detest the superstitions of the Church of Rome,
and fled to Geneua. The same man had a desire also to visite
England, and during the time of his remaining heere, he found
so many blind Sects and Religions within the land, that he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
backe like a dogge to his owne vomit, and in some sorte
he fell into the biace of the Church of Rome againe. Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
man, that beeing once lightned, looked backe to that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian
Aetna, that spues vp sinoake and sulpher into the world,
to put out the eyes of men; Vnhappie England, that by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
of opinions in Religion, sette so many handes to his
shoulders to thrust him downe, that was so ready with a turne,
<pb facs="tcp:14591:4"/>
to ouerturne. Howe these newe pampred factions at this day,
haue shaken the harts of many of her Maiesties louing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and made them Chamaelion like, capable of any faith saue
the right, I leaue it to them that looke into it.</p>

               <p>Thats a bragge <hi>Marforius,</hi> yet if there be anie
such, I shall find them in the end, and against the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will picke out a time to pepper them. Though they
were as high as the maste, as sure as the tackling, as profitable
as the fraught, and as necessarie as the sayles, when the shippe
is in danger, ouerboorde withall. What meaning soeuer some
men haue in it, I am assured, that it can neither stand with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
nor with Religion, to nourish anie faction in ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
much lesse in matters belonging to the Church. <hi>Quid

What auaileth it, (saith one) for men to be shrowded vnder
one rooffe, if they be not of one hart? One secret faction in a
Realme dooth more hurte, then any generall plague or open
warre. The pestilence and the sword are two heauie scourges
in Gods hand, that deuoure many thousands of men in a little
time, yet they reach no further then the bodie, but a faction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
more, and sweepes away both bodie and soule together.
Though the Iewes at the siege of Ierusalem, were pressed by
their enemies without the walles,<note place="margin">One of these fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the zealous refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note> and punished with such a
mortalitie within, that the carkases of the dead did dunge the
ground, yet they neuer went to the wall, till they grewe to be
factious, &amp; fell to taking one another by the throate. Giue me
leaue a little <hi>Marforius,</hi> to shift my sayles, and come towardes
Italie. They that were wise prophecied long before of the state
of Rome, that it should neuer decay but by diuision Which
came to passe. For when the factions of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far</hi>
and <hi>Pompey, Anthonie</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> brake foorth, the flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Cittie beganne to cast her lease. The great Empire of
great <hi>Alexander,</hi> like a flame of fire in a heape of flaxe, when
it was at the highest, did shed it selfe suddainlie in the ayre, and
<pb facs="tcp:14591:5"/>
came to nothing by the dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of those that succeeded him.
The proude neck of the Graecians, for all their wisedom, was
after the like manner brought vnder the Persians and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians.
If we rolle our eyes at one side into the bosome of our
neighbour Fraunce, wee shall perceiue, that although it were
many times inuaded in the skyrts of the Countrey, by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
yet it remained inuincible, till <hi>Caesar</hi> toke holde of the
discords within the Realme. My head is full of water, and my
cheekes be wette, when I thinke vpon Constantinople, whose
particular iarres, layde her gates open to the Turke, vnder
whose captiuitie she groneth to this day.</p>
               <p>A faction in a Kingdome may wel be compared to a spark
of fire,<note place="margin">Note</note> it catcheth hold at the first in some obscure corner, in a
Shoppe, in a Stable, or in a ricke of Strawe, where it lyeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
a little time, but by little and little it gathers strength, till
it reare it selfe vp to great houses, Pallaces, &amp; Princes Courts,
and at last it rageth and ouerruns whole Citties &amp; Countries,
without quenching, before they be vtterly ouerthrowne. In the
time of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperor, about the credite and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of two colours, Blewe and Greene, there grew in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople
two mightie factions, which made such a head the
one against the other, that in one day it cost many thousandes
of men their liues, and the Emperor himselfe was brought in
great hazard, both of his Empire and his owne person. Vpon
as light an occasion in the Dukedome of Florence, for the
two colours of Blacke and White, verie pestilent quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
there, and the factions of the <hi>Bianchi</hi> and the <hi>Neri,</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
forth like a lightning out of the Clowdes, scourde &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
the Country where they went. These were but litle sparks
in the rushes,<note place="margin">Note gentle Martin.</note> that euery man treadeth on, and very trifles at
the first, yet you see how foule a Cockatrice may be hatcht of
so small an egge. If I shoulde rip vp the stomacks of some in
England, when wee consider the brawles, the Garboyles, the
tragicall exclamations for Church apparrell, may wee not say
that England is falne into that fantasticall faction of Florence
for Black &amp; White? Wher had this brable his first beginning,
<pb facs="tcp:14591:5"/>
but in some obscure corner, in the tippe of the tongue of some
blind Parlor-preacher in the land, in shoppes, in stalles, in the
Tynkers budget, the Taylors sheares, and the Sheepheardes
Tarboxe? I doubt not <hi>Marforius,</hi> but it will wither where it
sprang, and ende at where it began, in shame, and ignoraunce.
Thou knowest that the surest proppe of all Princes, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
true Religion, and to keepe it inuiolable when it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
for this is the well tempered Morter that buildeth vp
all estates. <hi>He that honors me,</hi> (saith God) <hi>I will honor him.</hi> But
this chopping &amp; changing of the Religion of the land (which
was acquited of accusations in the time of the famous K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde</hi>
the fixt, and now aduaunced by the happy raigne of the
Queenes most excellent Maiesty, &amp; approued by the wisedom
both spiritual &amp; temporal, of the whole Realme, &amp; confirmed
by a generall consent in the high Court of Parliament) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els,
but to picke out the Morter by little and little, that
at the next pushe, <hi>Martin</hi> and his companions, might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the state, and make the Emperiall crowne of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
kisse the ground.</p>
               <p>Where there is a diuision fostred, there can be no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
of the present state,<note place="margin">MATH. 12.</note> GOD himselfe hath taught it vs.
<hi>Martins</hi> cheefe practise, in the Prouinces of Englande where I
haue wandred, is, to perswade the simple, that her Maiestie
layeth such a logge vppon their consciences, as they ought not
beare, whereuppon they presume to make a shrewde scruple
of their obedience, and begin to bounde like a Colt that would
cast his ryder. Hath God powred so many blessings, vpon the
Church of Englande, by the very often, and very miraculous
preseruations of her sacred Maiesties royall person, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
giuen testimonies out of Heauen to the Religion of the
Lande, and dares <hi>Martin</hi> attempt to make a doubt bothe of it,
and her? Credit me <hi>Marforius,</hi> this bursting the sinew of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
obedience to their naturall Prince, cannot be doone, but
for a mischiuous intent, what visor soeuer they sette vppon it.
I would faine knowe what should be the reason, that so manie
hundreds of thousands in this Realme, haue hetherto humbled
<pb facs="tcp:14591:6"/>
themselues at the feete of one person? can it be because shee is
mightier then all they, she beeing but one, &amp; they many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
she a woman and they men? Is it any terror, thinke you,
of the big bodied Holberders that guarde her Maiestie? No
<hi>Marforius,</hi> if there were not some wonderful matter that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde
them also, euen they might be giuen ouer to a reprobate
sence, to bende euery man the point of his Holberd at her. If
we search it till the worlds ende, we shall find no other cause of
this sweet harmonie of peoples harts, that remaine faithful and
flexible to the shaking of her princelie finger, but onely this,
the Religion of the Lande. When <hi>Martin</hi> shall be suffered to
displace GOD, that now dwelles in the bosome of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
louing people, and buz slaunders of Religion into theyr
eares, whereby they may conceiue, that her highnesse by the
maintenaunce of the Gospell, hath shutte vp their saluation in
close prison, and that it mooues God in his wrath to drawe the
Sworde against her and the Realme, (as <hi>Martin</hi> himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth)
what other consequent may we looke for, but that
euery Pruritane transported with the heate and the ignorance
of his zeale, wyll be as readie as a Papist, to lift vp his hande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, which mischiefe I beseech God to returne into their
bowels. How odious and how dangerous innouations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
are, Secretarie <hi>Machiauell,</hi> a politick not much affected to
any Religion, discloseth by the example of Fryer <hi>Sauanaroll.</hi>
He was a man like <hi>Martin,</hi> sprong vp in such a time as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
when Spayne, Fraunce, Rome, Arragon, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
entred a league to make warre altogether vppon the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.
<hi>Sauanarola</hi> boasted of Reuelations, and secret conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
held betweene the holy Ghost and him; <hi>Martin</hi> brags hee
is a speciall man, raysed vp on a suddaine by the spirit of God
for the good of England, as if GOD had beene a stranger to
vs all this while. <hi>Sauanarola</hi> made a bragging proffer, which
he neuer performed, that he would passe through the fire, for
the confirmation of his doctrine; <hi>Martin</hi> hath vaunted he wil
seale his opinions with his hart blood, but you may see by the
starting holes hee seeketh, that hee neuer meant to keepe hys
<pb facs="tcp:14591:6"/>
promise. <hi>Sauanarola</hi> brought himselfe &amp; his followers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
at last; and so will <hi>Martin.</hi> I muse howe any state man
can abide to heare of innouasions in Religion where the truth
is preached? There is but one God, which cannot be deuided,
if he could, hee were not GOD. All his graces tende to a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together of Gods people in a vnitie of Faith,<note place="margin">1. COR. 2. 12.</note> not to a
scattering into diuers Faythes, wherein the principall grace of
a <hi>Martinist</hi> consisteth. Looke vnto the Heathen, the accusers
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> made choise of this accusation aboue all others, as a
matter very worthy of death in him: that he was a fellow that
sought to sette a newe stampe of his own vpon theyr Religion.
One of the first Lawes that <hi>Romulus</hi> layd, as a ribbe of yron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his gouernment, was, <hi>Deos peregrinos ne colunfo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a patterne if you wyll, from priuate Families. What
a pittifull thing is it to see, two Religions in one house? where
the Father and the Sonne, the Husband &amp; the Wife, the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Seruaunt, are of diuers faythes, the ioynts of that
house begin to gape, and the fall of that house is to be feared.
The diuersitie of opinions in so high a degree as is Religion,
cannot choose but diminish the loue and respect, that the one
of them should carrie vnto the other. The Sonne will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of his dutie to his Father, whom hee takes to be a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
the Father will make but slender reckoning of the Son,
that beleeues not as hee beleeues. The Wife will giue little
reuerence to that Husbande, whom she imagineth to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
The Husband wil be rough and rigorous to such a Wife
as obeyes not him; The Seruaunt wyll neuer giue due honour
to his Maister, when hee iudgeth him to be the bondslaue of
the deuill; The Maister will as hardlie protect that Seruaunt,
whose hart he perceiues not to bee with him.</p>
               <p>As then the gouernment of Common-weales, was first
drawne from the gouernment of priuate houses, so that
which is the ruine of priuate houses, growes in time to be the
ruine of Common-weales. I haue taken a little paine to visite
diuers of the Courtes, Benches, Sessions, that are helde in this
Lande in her Maiesties name, by vertue of her authoritie, but
<pb facs="tcp:14591:7"/>
I neuer saw so bolde, so-open, so-barbarous contempt of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie,
in any other part of the whole worlde, as I haue seene
heere. Such canuaces made, such stales set, such traynes layde,
such platformes drawne by the factious, to bring theyr Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
into contempt, and yet they prooue so ridiculous in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
steppe they tread, that I am ready to stand on my nose whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I trace them out.</p>
               <p>I was once in Antwerpe, when great sute was made to the
Masters of the English house, (by a Gentleman then emploied
in the Queenes affaires) for the entertaining a Preacher amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
them, both to teach &amp; to minister the Sacraments there vnto
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The request was soone graunted, &amp; <hi>Trauars,</hi> a fellow that
delighteth in obliquitie, was the man that was brought thither,
when he came, he had neither taken the Orders of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
nor any lycence to preach, according to the gouernment
of the Church of Englande, but ran into a corner among the
French to receiue it there. At last, one of the Ministers of
those Churches, came with him to the companie, and made a
sollemne protestation before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, that he founde Mast <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uars</hi>
a fitte man for the deuiding of the word, and deliuerie of
the Sacraments. <hi>Hac oratione finita.</hi> Sweete Maister <hi>Trauars,
quem oneris causa nomino,</hi> for I beare him on my backe till my
tale be ended, at the first iumpe read a Statute made in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(for Church gouernment) to the naturall Subiects of the
Queene of Englande, and tolde them he woulde followe that.
I would gladly be resolued in this place, whether <hi>Trauars</hi> dyd
not begin very pretilie to play the Pope, in taking vppon him
to discharge her Maiesties Subiects of the allegiance they owe
to theyr naturall Prince, and in stealing away from the crowne
of England, as many english harts as would harken to him, to
translate them at his pleasure to a forraine power? As he layde
his foundation in dissention when hee began to be a builder in
Gods house, so hath his worke vnto this day prospered, the
whole frame I perceiue is fallen vppon him. They that were
discreete, ventured couragiously to sette a leauer at him, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gaue ouer till he was remooued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14591:7"/>The Chronicles of Englande, and the daylie enclosures of
Commons in the Land, teach vs sufficiently, howe inclinable
the simpler sort of the people are to rowtes, ryots, commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
insurrections, and plaine rebellions when they grow brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
or any new toy taketh them in the head: they neede no
<hi>Trauars</hi> nor <hi>Martin</hi> to encrease their giddines. It should seeme
that the graund Prior of Fraunce, (a man now dead) had gotten
some taste of theyr disposition, when in a Sonet that hee made
for his own pleasure, to paint out the natures of all Nations, he
toucht the pryde, the wantonnes, the mutabilitie, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies
of the Spaniard, the Italian, the French, and the Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and to the shame of this Nation, hee giues the Englishe a
dash ouer the face with a blacke coale, and sayth: <hi>Traistre An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloi</hi>
the English man is a Traytor. This is the grounde, the
Popes and the King of Spayne, these many yeeres haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

wysh the whole Realme to iudge vprightly, who deserues best
to be bolstred and vpheld in these dangerous times, either they
that haue religiously &amp; constantly preached obedience to her

it were good (saith a godly father) for such people, to tell

be a day of account, when GOD, (by whose finger the worde
was written) shall reuenge the forcible entries they haue made
into his possessions, &amp; punish euery forrow they haue plowed
vpon his backe. They are the very Spawnes of the fish <hi>Saepia,</hi>
where the streame is cleere, and the Scriptures euidentlie dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer

censures and opinions, than to the censures and opinions of
better men, so many good Scriptures had neuer been wrested,
so many flowers in Gods Garden had neuer been defaced. Had
he been ready to suffer wrong without wringing of reuenge
out of Gods hand, he would neuer haue thundred &amp; lightned
at so many rare men, whose learning and vertue is a pricke in
his eye, and a strong watch that intercepts euery passage vnto
his Hierarchie. Let him swell while he burst, with the worde
in his mouth, so long as hee breaketh the rule of Charitie, and
cares not whom he strike, so the edge of his tuske may haue a
lighting place, wee may easily see what is within him. <hi>Infaelix
lolium &amp; steriles dominantae auenae.</hi> Scripture is often in the typ
of his tongue, but Cockle is the graine wee reape with him. It
is the propertie of <hi>Martin</hi> &amp; his followers, to measure Gods
mouth, by theyr owne mouth, as you shal see in the May-game
that I haue promised you: for there you shall haue a number
of strange Notes vpon the Text, some of them gathered from
<hi>William Dike</hi> at S. Albanes, in his clarklie Paraphrases vppon
S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> some haue beene brought me from other
places, &amp; some I gathered my selfe, in an assemblie of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood
at Ashford in Kent. I went thether with a Student of
Cambridge to a sollemne exercise, and comming in the habite
of Schollers, we pressed somewhat boldly into their companie
to dine with them, assuring our selues to finde some new ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
at theyr Table. When the Dinner was doone, one of them
read a Chapter, euery man keeping his place still; The roome
was full of Artificers, men and women, that sate rounde about
vppon stooles and benches to harken to it. The Chapter was,
the 1. Cor. 3. which being read. The reader began first to vtter
his conceit vpon the Text, in short Notes, then it came to his
next neighbours course, and so in order Glosses went a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Expositions ranne a pace through the Table, till they
came to me, whom they desired to open my mouth among the
rest, I vtterly refused to vndertake the taske, notwithstanding,
I was so wonderfully vrged, that I coulde not any way shift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
off, and somewhat I spake among them. When I came to the
<pb facs="tcp:14591:11"/>
ende of my cariere, my companion was requested to pricke it
for company with his freendes. I needed no Minstrill to make
me merrie, my hart tickled of it selfe, when it came to his turn,
because I knew him to be a Gentleman well studied in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,
but he had not yet medled with Diuinitie. He chose the
thirteenth verse of the Chapter to discourse vpon. Where the
Apostle saith, Euery mans worke shall be tryed by fire. But to
see how brauely hee trotted ouer all the Meterors bredde in the
highest Region of the ayre, to see how louingly hee made the
sence of the Apostle, and <hi>Ouids</hi> fiction of <hi>Phaetons</hi> firing of
the world to kiss before they parted, and then howe souldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
hee made an ende of his manage with a double rest, was
sport enough for vs to beguile the way, as we trauailed backe
againe from thence to Canterburie.</p>
               <p>I haue brought many a propper note out of that meeting,
for euery mans spirit at the Table, had two bowts with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
before hee left him, and one whilst another spake, had a
breathing time giuen him to whisper with the holy Ghost, to
know what shold be put into his head to vtter, against it came
about to his course againe.</p>

One cause I finde to be meere ignoraunce.<note place="margin">CANT. 6. 9.</note> GODS Church
is compared to an Armie, well ordered and sette in good aray.
In an Armie you haue manie Commaunders, Corporals, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giants,
Leiutenants, Captains, and Coronels, yet not all of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
authoritie, but all vnder the direction of one Generall,
for the better leading in and out of the whole forces: and in
Gods Church, as it hath grown great, companies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming daily
in vnto it out of euery tongue, and Tribe, and Countrey, and
Nation, so all Ecclesiasticall and Christian Histories, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
teache vs, that there hath beene a diuersitie of learned
and skilfull leaders, some higher, some lower then others in
theyr places, and all vnder the controlment of one Generall,
Christ himselfe, for the greater terror of Haereticks &amp; enemies
of the Church, and for the grace, the beautie, and order of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Cornette and Ensigne in the same, which is a thing glorious
in Gods eye, because he is the GOD of order. But the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinists</hi>
(sillie wretches) ignorant and vnlearned men, vnfitte for
any eminent charge in the Church themselues, seeke to drawe
euery place in this Campe royall to an equalitie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.
A preposterous humor noted in the Ecclesiasticall Histories,
diuers that were sette beside the Cushion when Bishoprickes
were a dealing, sought to make Bishops equall with euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.
In this daungerous attempt, I finde the three plagues
that GOD threatneth for peoples sinnes, to be powred out at
this day vpon the Church of England. First. <hi>The Sworde is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the right eye, and the right hand:</hi> what soeuer is right in the
Church of England, is wounded by the <hi>Martinists,</hi> a crooked
generation, that loues to swym side-long with the Crabbe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly.
<hi>Like people, like Priest</hi> begins now to be verified: the
Preachers of the faction, (like Puppets in a motion) begin to
snappe and to turne, and to speake, what, and when, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the people will, at whose tables they are fed like Geese
in the Capitol, to gaggle at euery man that is against them.
<pb facs="tcp:14591:12"/>
Thirdly. <hi>Beautie</hi> and <hi>Bandes:</hi> the two staues that God vses like
a Sheepheard to guide his people, are knapt in sunder. <hi>Beautie</hi>
is burst; for our order is turned into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion: <hi>Bandes</hi> are burst
also, for our vnitie is fallen into dissention. The maine poste
whereuppon the Bucklers, the Armour, the imaginarie Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes
of the faction, is hanged vppe for the simple to gaze and
wonder at, is onely this, <hi>The Church of England hath committed
fornication with the Church of Rome, and tript out her foote like a
strumpet, to euer deuise of mans braine that hath passed by her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heerein I see the Churches case, is <hi>Susannaes</hi> case, this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of incontinencie is framed against her, by such as haue
sought to be incontinent with her themselues. Had <hi>Susanna</hi>
prostituted her body to the Elders, her credit had neuer beene
called into Question by her accusers: had the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
giuen vppe the keyes of her Coffers, to bawdes, boggers,
and Banckroupts, the reuerend Elders of <hi>Martinisme,</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
put vppe any Billes of endightment against her the last
Parliament. But as the storie saith, that <hi>Daniell</hi> was raysed by
GOD to acquite her, and conuince euery scatterer of false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
I thinke before I end, Signor <hi>Pasquill</hi> of Englande, wyll
prooue the man, that must sette a gagge in the mouth of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
the great, and cut vp an Anatomie of all his knauerie. Me
thought <hi>Vetus Comaedia</hi> beganne to pricke him at London in
the right vaine, when shee brought foorth <hi>Diuinitie</hi> wyth a
scratcht face, holding of her hart as if she were sicke, because
<hi>Martin</hi> would haue forced her, but myssing of his purpose, he
left the print of his nayles vppon her cheekes, and poysoned
her with a vomit which he ministred vnto her, to make her cast
vppe her dignities and promotions.</p>
               <p>Thys indeede is the marke that <hi>Martin</hi> shootes at, whereby
you may see that one cause of <hi>Martinisme,</hi> is a collop that dropt
out of <hi>Mydas</hi> nose, a desire of Gold. This is the roote of all the
mischife, by this many men are fast lockt in the deuils snares,
many soules are thrust through with many sorrowes. Thys bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ground master <hi>Martin</hi> hath made his choise of, when he
castes his accounts, and surueighes howe little witte and howe
<pb facs="tcp:14591:12"/>
little might hee hath to goe thorough with his building, like a
furious beast wrapt in the cordes where hee cannot stirre, after
many a vayne plunge which he giues to breake away, when he
sees his labour lost, transported with a rage, he roares and he
somes, and sets himselfe downe in the Scorners Chayre.</p>
               <p>Though Babies and fooles stagger, and stande amazed to
beholde their newe pranckes, yet almost the meanest in Gods
Schoole knowes, it is no strange thing, that the Church sholde
be vexed with such enemies. In the time of holy <hi>Dauid</hi> the
King, the Church was assaulted by a kinde of people, whose
mouthes were as Quiuors, and theyr tongues as Shafts, that did
shoote very secretly at the best men. Vnto this kinde of people,
holy men of God haue giuen sundry tytles, and thereby, as it
were, clapt many Brandes vppon theyr backes, to make them
knowne to be rotten Sheepe of the deuils foulde. They are
termed to be <hi>Bulles of Bashan, Foxes, Serpents, Vipers, Woolues,
Spyders, Theeues, Firie-ouens, False-ioyes,</hi> &amp; a great many names
more of like honor, they haue wonne in the fielde, and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the prize in euery age.</p>
               <p>A yeere would scarce suffer me to discouer them all at large.
Yet that I may touch at euery Coast which I haue descried,
they are called <hi>Bulles,</hi> because they dosse out theyr hornes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the truth; <hi>Foxes,</hi> because theyr conspiracies, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies,
theyr vnchaste and disordered life, shewes them to be
tied together by the tayles like <hi>Sampsons</hi> Foxes, but their heads
be loose, they shake off theyr obedience to their natural Prince.
<hi>Serpents,</hi> because they glide vpon theyr bellies, <hi>No sin</hi> among
some of them, <hi>from the nauell downward. Vipers,</hi> to giue light
and estimation vnto themselues, they teare open the bowels
of theyr owne Damme, and liue by the death of her that bred
them. <hi>Woolues,</hi> In outwarde appearaunce, they are like to the
dogge, and make a shewe to the world they would keepe the
Sheepe, but all theyr desire is to kill the Sheepe. <hi>Spyders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sucke out theyr mallice from very good hearbes, and
spynne with great studie an vnprofitable webbe, good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to catch Flyes. <hi>Theeues,</hi> they breake in by night into
<pb facs="tcp:14591:13"/>
Gods house, and would spoyle though it were with the bloode
of the Saints. <hi>Firic-ouens,</hi> they haue a scorching breathe, and
when they are drawn, they deliuer a batch for the deuils tooth.
And to wind vp their vertues in a word or two, they are <hi>False-ioyes,</hi>
their substance is brittle, and their Bookes be Glasse, giue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but a filop, they run to a powder. What grounde they haue
gotten by their practises among the witlesse, I neede not tell
you, seeing <hi>Martin Senior</hi> is so forward to tell you himselfe, that
he hath a hundred thousand in the Lande, readie to lift vppe a
new Presbitery with priuate hands. Though I know that he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
loudlie, yet it were not amisse <hi>Magna componere paruis,</hi> and
to looke to his fingers, that he be not as readie when hee spyes
his time, to lift vp a newe Prince.</p>
               <p>After GOD had once brought his Church out of Egipt,
by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> there wanted neither Iebusite, nor enemy
a long time to flye in her face, and to hinder her passage to the
Land of promise; And since God led his Church in this Land
out of the bondage of Rome, by the conduct of her excellent
Maiestie, there neuer yet wanted Papist, Atheist, Brownist,
Barowist, Martinist, Anabaptist, nor Familie of Loue to bid
them battaile, that their course to Gods Kingdome might be
stopt. But in all their attempts it fareth with them, as it dooth
with the Wrastler within the Lystes, he winnes now and than,
not because he is strong or impossible to be ouer-come, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the match that he deales withall is weake; <hi>Martin</hi> hath
made some head, in some parts of her Maiesties Dominions,
not because his worshippe is inuincible, but because hee hath
closde with the clowted shoe, and got a little credite by mens
infirmites.</p>

as men doe the croppe vppon the grounde. Curses I haue read
and heard of many that haue followed their humors, that haue
affected any pillage of the Church. When <hi>Symon</hi> the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
(vppon a particular grudge hee bare to <hi>Onias</hi> the high
Priest)<note place="margin">2. MAC. 3.</note> had enformed <hi>Seleucus</hi> the King of Asia, of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Treasure, the King sent <hi>Heliodorus</hi> his Treasurer, to seaze
it to the Crowne:<note place="margin">Martins Visor.</note> 
                  <hi>Heliodorus</hi> came like a Foxe, to visit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the disorders of C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elosyria and Phaenice. When the high
Priest perceiued, that reformation was his errande, but golde
he sought, the graue countenance of <hi>Onias</hi> was striken down,
and the people beholding their Father heauie, ranne some to
the Temple, some to the Cittie-gates, some stood in their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
looking out, some gadded vppe and downe the streetes,
like <hi>Bacchus</hi> Froes, franticke for the time, and all ioyntly lifted
vp their hands, their eyes, and their voice to heauen, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Church Treasure. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> was no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Treasurie to take the spoyle, but there appeared to
him a terrible man in Complet Armour of Gold, mounted on
a barbed Horse, which ranne fiercelie at the Kings Treasurer,
and trampled him vnder foote. Therewithall appeared also,
two men of excellent strength and beautie, whipping and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with so many stripes, that hee was carried out of the
place speechlesse, and without any hope of life at all.</p>
               <p>But because <hi>Martin</hi> will say the Bookes of the Machabees
are Apocrypha, and <hi>Sprignols</hi> man told me (as he trimd me the
other day) that there is a new Barbar in London, about to shaue
the Bible, wherin he finds somwhat that he would haue cleane
discarded, I will deale with such Scriptures, as preuent them of
all euasions. How dangerous it is to gelde the Church goods,
the end of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> shal witnes for me,<note place="margin">ACTS. 5.</note> for though
their death was the punishment of their sinne in lying, yet I
trust <hi>Martin</hi> will graunt me, that they were drawn to that sin
by the corde of Sacriledge. And if a greedie desire of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
that from the Church which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues had giuen, was
of force to open such a windowe to the deuill, that they were
presently giuen ouer as a pray to the iawes of hell, to lye and
<pb facs="tcp:14591:14"/>
dissemble with the holie Ghost, howe many foule sinnes, and
howe many greeuous plagues are to be feared in this Lande,
which alreadie hang at the ende of the lyne of <hi>Martinisme,</hi> and
would speedilie be puld vpon our heads, if we should but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to take that from the Church, which we neuer gaue? It
may be, Mast <hi>Martin</hi> will flappe mee in the mouth with his
politique reason, that it is good for the Realme, to maintaine
their warres by the Church reuenewes, because forraine inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are dailie looked for. But to meete with his wisedome at
the halfe sword, I remember that Aegipt in the time of <hi>Ioseph</hi>
the Patriarche,<note place="margin">GENE. 47. 22. 26.</note> felt so extreame a famine, that the fift parte of
the Lande was sold to releeue the Lande, yet the Patriarche in
all this care he had, both of the Countrey and the King, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the one, &amp; enrich the Coffers of the other, neuer attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any sale of the lande of the Priestes, nor once diminished
the same. If the holie Patriarche in so great extreamitie, neuer
venturde to alienate the possessions of Idolatrous Priestes,
though it were to the releefe of a whole Kingdome, with what
face dares anie politique in the world, curtoll the maintenance
of the Church of God, and vntile the houses that by religious
Princes haue beene consecrated to Gods seruice?</p>
               <p>Let vs see the good that ensueth of their deuices, &amp; let Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
be warned by the praesidents of other Nations. <hi>Celce</hi> the
Constable of <hi>Gertrund</hi> King of Burgonie, hauing vnder the
authoritie of the king his Maister, enriched himselfe with the
goods of the Church, was one day in the Church at his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and as he hearde the Prophet read, that proclaimes a woe
vnto them that ioyne house to house, and land to land, he gaue
a shrike suddainlie in the congregation, and cried out, this is
spoken to me, this curse is vpon me, and vppon my posterite
and afterward died miserablie. In Fraunce, <hi>Lewes</hi> the sixt, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the great, was once a protector of the priuiledges of
the Church, for perceiuing that the Conte <hi>de Clerimont,</hi> the
Lord <hi>de Roussi,</hi> the Lord <hi>de Meugn,</hi> the Lorde <hi>de Beuuieu,</hi> and
others, had rifled the Bishopricks and Churches within the
Realme, he caried Armes in the defence of the Church against
<pb facs="tcp:14591:14"/>
them, and compelled them to restore their robberies to the
Church againe. The same King <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

extreame necessitie in his age, beganne at the last, to pull the
Church himselfe. But S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> (one of the Lampes of the
Church of GOD in those dayes) sollicited the King with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Letters, exhorting him fatherlie to giue ouer that course:
at the last, perceiuing that neither entreatie, nor reproofe was
able to withdraw him, he began to darte out the thunderbolts
of the Church, and to threaten him, that hee shoulde shortlie
feele the iudgment of God vpon him, which suddailie came to
passe, for by the suddaine death of the young Prince his eldest
Sonne, the staffe of his age was broken.</p>

Pasquill is not so blind, but he sees Martin to be a man, that goes two manner

him of while the world stands, though they swell at him with enuie like a nest
