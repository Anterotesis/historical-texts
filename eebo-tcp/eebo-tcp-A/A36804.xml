            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat all Rebellions did ever begin with the fairest
Pretences for Reforming of somewhat amiss in
the Government, is a Truth so clear, that there
needs no manifestation thereof from Examples.
Nor were they ever observed to have greater
success, than when the Colours for <hi>Religion</hi> did openly appear in
the Van of their armed Forces; most men being desirous to have
it really thought (how bad and vile soever their practises are)
that zeal to God's glory, is no small part of their aim. Which
guilded bait hath been usually held forth to allure the Vulgar, by
those, whose ends and designs were nothing else, than to get into
power, and so to possess themselves of the Estates and Fortunes of
their more opulent Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Should I look far backwards for discovery of the first source and
fountain, whence that viperous brood, which not long since hath so
miserably infested these Kingdoms, did spring, of whose unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
practises the ensuing Narrative doth specially take notice;
I must ascend to the times of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> (the one the
supreme Magistrate, the other the chief Priest): <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
and <hi>Abiran,</hi> then rising up, and taking upon themselves an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
equal with those chosen servants of God; and saying that
<hi>all the Congregation was Holy.</hi> In like manner afterward when
<hi>Absolom</hi> the rebellious son of <hi>David</hi> rose up against his father,
there was a demure face of Godliness put on, of a solemn vow to be
performed to God at <hi>Hebron;</hi> and large promises of reformation of
all abuses in Government were made by the unnatural usurper.</p>
            <p>This sort of practice continued in the Iewish Church till the time
of the Gospel, as is conspicuous enough from the words of our blessed
Saviour, where he speaks of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> that <hi>they
did outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within were
full of Hypocrisy and Guile; devouring Widows houses; and
for a pretence making long Prayers:</hi> Our Lord in the <hi>xith</hi> and
<hi>xvith</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> making likewise a farther Description of
them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> also in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> plainly foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us, that <hi>such should again spring up in the last times
Men</hi> (saith he) <hi>who shall be Lovers of themselves, covetous,
boasters, proud</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Traiterous, heady, high-minded</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:48510:4"/>
               <hi>having a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that the offspring of these, did more or less infest the
world throughout all after-times, would be no difficult thing to
manifest, were it here necessary or convenient; In the time of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
persecution of Christianity, rose up <hi>Novatian</hi> the father of
the Cathari or Puritans; to whom may be added <hi>Donatus</hi> and his
followers, who confin'd Godliness to themselves; and religion to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
their country. After the settlement of the Church in Christian
Emperors, appear'd <hi>Aerius</hi> the first inventor of Presbytery; which
tho it seem'd a long time dead, has been of late raked out of its
ashes, and made to trouble and set on fire the Western Church.</p>
            <p>As to the usual practises of the men of this sect, there is nothing
more clear, than that <hi>Religion,</hi> nay the Reformation thereof to its
purity, hath bin the thing which they have ever cryed up: and
that meekness, sanctity and the power of Godliness, are the Cloaks
in which they have alway at first shew'd themselves; by which
plausible devices, they have captivated thousands. But it
is no less evident, that having by this means got power into
their hands; destruction of civil Government, Rapine, Spoil,
and the greatest mischeifs imaginable, have bin the woful effects
of those their Specious pretences; whereby they have really veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that expression of our Saviour; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they were of their
father the Devil, and the Works of him they should do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come nearer my present business.</p>
            <p>That the Actions of our late times, chiefly from the year 1637
till 1660, can be easily forgotten; or that there is any need of
reviving the memory of them to this present Age, 'tis not to be
imagin'd. Nevertheless, for their sakes, who are ignorant of the
means and preparations made in order to those grand Exploits,
then done: and that Posterity may have a short view thereof, I
have adventured upon the publishing of this Discourse which
was long since compiled. Wherein I first deduce our late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in <hi>England,</hi> and other his Majesties Realms, from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of those persons; who, about an hundred and fifty years
before, under the same Hypocritical pretences, did greivously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<hi>Germany.</hi> And, having finished that Narrative as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
and fully as I may; afterwards manifest, that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb facs="tcp:48510:4"/>
project of our chief Contrivers here, was <hi>to reduce the
King to Necessities;</hi> and thereby to expose him to the use of such
extraordinary ways of Supply, as might most conduce to the raising
of discontent amongst all his good Subjects. Which they did,
by engaging first his father in a war for the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and their
failing to assist him, notwithstanding their most solemn promises.</p>
            <p>As also by <hi>planting Schismatical Lectures</hi> in most corporate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Towns,
and populous places throughout the Realm; so to poison
the people with Antimonarchical principles.</p>
            <p>In the next place I shall take notice of the rise and progress of the
late troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were the Prologue to these of ours.</p>
            <p>Then of the <hi>Scottish Invasion,</hi> which occasioned the unhappy <hi>long
Parliament,</hi> and likewise of some proceedings in that Parliament,
before the predominant party therein did put themselves in Arms.</p>
            <p>After this I shall point at the dissolution of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
power, and growth of the <hi>Independent,</hi> whereupon ensued the nefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first: and after that, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions,
as made way for the happy Restoration of our present So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
King <hi>Charles</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>Which being done, I shall make some observations upon their
first fair and smooth pretences, set forth in several <hi>Declarations</hi>
and <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> by which the too credulous people were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
deluded, and drawn from their due Allegiance.</p>
            <p>And lastly give some brief Account of those Actings by the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Barons here, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which had
most resemblance with the practises of these our pretended Reformers.
As also shew how exact a parallel these great Masters in mischief
have held with those of the <hi>Holy League</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> whose Rebellion
terminated, in some sort as ours did, in the Murther of their King.</p>
            <p>What falleth within my own cognisance, I deliver with
mine own words: what is beyond my knowledge, in the words of
my Authors; most of which I have quoted; the rest being taken
from the common <hi>Mercuries,</hi> and other public-licensed Narratives
of the chiefest occurrences in those times.</p>
            <p>If the Reader think it disproportionat that so particular an
account is given of the counsels and proceedings leading to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
but one more brief of the transactions in it: He may be
pleas'd to know that the Author being not a military man, was
<pb facs="tcp:48510:5"/>
more enabled to relate what past in counsel than in the field. The
Diary part until the year 1646, was compos'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in
the time of the late troubles, before that Garrison of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
was rendred up to General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> as the Original copy will
apparently shew; which hath bin seen and read by several persons
of great honour and credit, many years since, who are yet living,
and upon occasion, if need be, will assert the same. Which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
was a good while since, with little variation transcrib'd for
the Press; and has now for many months been out of the Author's
hands, and far distant from him, in order to the publishing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
so that he has wanted opportunity to review, piece by piece what
he had written; or correct the errors which in so long a work must
needs escape; for which the Readers candor is desir'd.</p>
            <p>If the Reflections on what is past, are sometimes severe, let it be
imputed to the just indignation conceiv'd against those men, who
under specious pretences mask'd the most black designs; and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
of those proceedings which embroil'd the nation in a civil
war; perfidious in its rise, bloody in its prosecution, fatal in its
end, and which to this day proves mischievous in its consequents.</p>
            <p>When the subjects of this miserable Kingdom had murder'd the
defender both of us and of our faith; and driven away his children,
Princes and Nobles, into strange lands; bidding them, as <hi>David</hi> speaks
on a like occasion, <hi>go serve other Gods;</hi> the divine vengeance gave
us the natural product of this sin of ours, several of our Princes and
great men, returning back corrupted in their principles, and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the religion, wherewith they long converst. And in like
manner, when men had for a long time falsely cried out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to bring in Popery, thereby the more easily to destroy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion by Law establish'd; the same divine justice has
permitted the whole Protestant Religion, to be now under the greatest
danger imaginable, by the real plots, and execrable machinations
of Papists among us at this day; who, both in this and our sister
Kingdoms, by Combinations among themselves, and by fomenting
divisions among us, have gone very far towards the ruine of our
Church, and subversion of the State; and say of both, <hi>there there,
so would we have it; down with them, down with them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the ground.</hi> But that alpowerful God, who by miracle
so lately restored unto us our Religion and our Laws, will as we hope
and earnestly pray, preserve them still against the joint attemts of
Popery on the one hand, and Fanaticism on the other; and make
his <hi>Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</hi> In which prayer all true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants;
and, what is commensurat thereto, all loyal Subjects, will
joyn their suffrage and say, Amen.</p>

in themselves to discern the truth, because they wanted
learning to search into Antiquities; nor knowledg to
trace those of that Church in the paths by which they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48510:6"/>
had deviated from the Doctrine of Christ and his holy
Apostles; and so (by reason thereof) ran from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
to another. Thus sleighting the authority of
the learned and pious Reformers, who shew'd the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, such a liberty to the private
Spirit, was at that time by them allow'd, as at last, when
the giddy multitude became in that sort deluded by
those their false Teachers, every Brain-sick person stampt
the Seal of God's Spirit upon his own false and erroneous
conceits.</p>
               <p>Which false Teachers, among other their Artifices
to captivate the Vulgar, and to beget a disaffection in
them to that reverend Ecclesiastical Discipline which was
then establish'd, have cunningly suggested to them, that
all the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in forreign parts, do utterly
dislike thereof, as too much favouring of the <hi>Romish</hi>
polutions. And by this subtle insinuation, tho most
notoriously false,<note n="*" place="margin">See a view of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and public Worship of God in the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea; by Dr. Durell. impr. Lond. 1662.</note> have so far prevail'd upon their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
that they do not only refuse to communicate
with us in our Divine Offices; but in that, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else their own vain fancies do prompt them, are
become disobedient and refractory to the superior
powers which God hath ordain'd.</p>
               <p>They who would know more of these things, may
repair unto the Relations of such learned men, as have
written of our <hi>Reformation,</hi> and make their own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
thereon; as also upon what I shall further say
in this Historical Work, whereunto I refer them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> from an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<note n="*" place="margin">Guy de Bres contre Perreur des A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists. p. 5.</note>
of good credit.</p>
               <p>They had always in their mouths (says he) those
great things, <hi>Charity, Faith,</hi> the <hi>true Fear of God,</hi> the <hi>Cross,</hi>
the <hi>Mortification of the Flesh.</hi> All their exhortations were
to set light of the things in this world; to account Riches
and Honours vanity.</p>
               <p>They were solicitous of men of Fasts,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 118, 119, 120.</note> and to often
meditations on Heavenly things. Wherever they found
men, in Diet, Attire, Furniture of House, or any other
way observers of Civility and decent Order; such they
reported as being carnally and earthly minded.</p>
               <p>They so much affected to cross the ordinary custom
in every thing,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 177.</note> that when other men used to put on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48510:6"/>
better attire, they would be sure openly to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
abroad in worse.</p>
               <p>The ordinary names of the days of the week, they
thought it a kind of prophaneness to use; and therefore
accustomed themselves, to make no other distinction than
by numbers.</p>
               <p>From this they proceeded unto public Reformation;
first Ecclesiastical, and then Civil. Touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
they boldly vouched, that themselves only had the
Truth, which thing, upon peril of their lives, they would
at all times defend; and that since the Apostles lived, the
same was never before in all points sincerely taught.
Wherefore, that things might be brought again to that
integrity which Jesus Christ by his word requireth, they
began to controll the Ministers of the Gospel, for attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so much force and virtue unto the Scriptures of God
read; whereas the Truth (said they) was, that when the
word is said to engender faith in the Heart, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the soul of man, or to work any such spiritual divine
effect, these speeches are not thereunto appliable, as it is
read and preached; but as it is engrafted in us by the
power of the Holy Ghost, opening the eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and so revealing the Mysteries of God.</p>
               <p>No marvel was it,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 27.</note> to see them every day broach some
new thing, not heard of before; for they interpreted that
restless levity, to be their growing to spiritual perfection,
and their proceeding from faith to faith.</p>
               <p>But the differences amongst them,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 65, &amp; 66.</note> growing by this
means in a manner infinite, there was scarcely found any
one of them, the forge of whose Brain was not possest
with some special Mystery. Whereupon, although their
mutual contentions were most fiercely prosecuted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, yet when they came to defend the
Cause, common to them all, against the adversaries of
their faction, they had ways to lick one another whole;
the founder in his own perswasion, excusing the <hi>Dear
Brethren,</hi> who were not so far enlightned.</p>
               <p>Their own Ministers they highly magnifyed,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 71.</note> as men
whose Vocation was from God:<note place="margin">Ib. p. 124.</note> but their manner was
to term others <hi>Disdainful Scribes and Pharisees;</hi> to account
their calling a humane Creature, and to detain the people,
as much as might be from hearing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48510:7"/>The custom of using Godfathers and Godmothers at
Christenings,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 748.</note> they scorn'd: and hated conformity to the
Church,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 122.</note> in observing those solemn Festivals which others
did; in as much as Antichrist (they said) was the first
Inventor of them.</p>
               <p>The pretended end of their civil Reformation was,
that Christ might have dominion over all; that no other
might reign over Christian men but He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and for this cause,
they laboured with all their might in overturning the
Seats of Magistracy.</p>
               <p>Certain it is,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 40.</note> that these men at first, were only pityed
in their error;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 6.</note> the great Humility, Zeal, and Devotion,
which appeared to be in them, being in all mens opinion,
a pledge of their harmless meaning. Whereupon <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
made request unto <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> that
within his dominion they might be favourably dealt with
and spared; for that (their error excepted) they seemed
otherwise right good men. By means of which toleration,
they gathered strength, much more than was fafe for
the State of the Commonwealth, wherein they lived. For
they had their secret meetings in Corners, and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in the night, the people flocking unto them by
thousands.</p>
               <p>Nor were the means,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 420.</note> whereby they both allured and
retained so great multitudes ineffectual; <hi>viz.</hi> First, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
shew of Zeal towards God. Secondly, an hatred of
Sin, and a singular love of Integrity. Lastly, a cunning
sleight which they had to stroak and smooth up the
minds of their followers; as well by appropriating unto
them all the favourable titles, the good words, and the
gracious promises in Scripture; as by casting the contrary
always on the heads of such as were severed from that
retinue.</p>
               <p>And in all these things,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 27.</note> being fully perswaded, that
what they did, it was in obedience to the will of God,
and that all men should do the like; there remain'd after
speculation, practise, whereby the whole frame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
(if it were possible) might be squared.</p>
               <p>But seeing that this could not be done without mighty
opposition and resistance against it:<note place="margin">Ib. p. 6.</note> therefore to strengthen
themselves, they secretly entred into <hi>a League of Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
concluding, that as <hi>Israel</hi> was deliver'd out of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48510:7"/>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> of the worlds servile thraldome, to sin and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.
As <hi>Israel</hi> was to root out the Idolatrous nations,
and to plant instead of them, a people which feared God.
So the same Lords good will and pleasure was now, that
these new <hi>Israelites,</hi> should under the conduct of other
<hi>Ioshuas, Sampsons</hi> and <hi>Gedeons,</hi> perform a work no less
miraculous, in casting out violently the wicked from the
Earth, and establishing the kingdom of Christ with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Liberty.</p>
               <p>But these men in whose mouthes at the first sounded
nothing but mortification of the flesh, were come at the
length, to think they might lawfully have their six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
wives apiece. They who at the first, thought judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and justice it self to be merciless cruelty; accounted
at the length, their own hands sanctifyed with being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
in Christian bloud. They who at first were wont
to beat down all Dominion, and to urge against poor
Constables, Kings of Nations; had at the length, both
Consuls and Kings of their own erection amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Finally, they who could not brook at first, that
any man should seek, no not by law the recovery of his
goods injuriously taken, or withheld from him; were
grown at the last to think they could not offer unto God
more acceptable sacrifice, then by turning their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
clean out of House and Home; and by enriching
themselves with all kind of spoil and pillage.</p>
               <p>For a further Character of them,<note place="margin">An. 1525. Sleidans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. lib. 5. f. 55. a. b.</note> 
                  <hi>Sleidan</hi> tells us; that
<hi>Muncer,</hi> by his new Doctrine, touching goods to be in
common,<note place="margin">Ib. f. 56. b.</note> incited the Boores of <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Turingen,</hi>
to undertake the <hi>Holy-war</hi> (as he call'd it) against their
Princes; telling them, that he was commanded of God
to destroy all wicked Princes, and substitute new ones in
their places; and that they were call'd indeed Princes, but
were Tyrants. Moreover, that they would not restore
unto the people their liberty; nor permit them to have
the true Religion and service of God: exhorting them
rather to dye then to allow their wickedness, and suffer
the Doctrine of the Gospel to be taken from them; and
therefore to play the men, and gratify God, in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such unprofitable people.</p>
               <p>Likewise,<note place="margin">Ib. 59. b.</note> that this their great zeal towards God, and
outward humility, got them in the beginning many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48510:8"/>
for their demands were, first, that they might
choose them such Ministers, as should preach Gods word
sincerely, without any mixture of mens traditions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that thenceforth they would pay no Tythes, but
of Corn only; and the same to be distributed by the
discretion of good men; partly to the Ministers of the
Church; partly upon the poor; and partly upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
affairs. Thirdly, that they had till that time, been
unworthily kept in Bonds, considering how they were
all made free in the bloud of Christ. Fourthly, that they
refused not to have a Magistrate, knowing that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
of God, and would obey him in all honest things;
but could not abide to be any longer bound, unless it
were shewed reasonable by the testimony of Scripture.
Fifthly,<note place="margin">Ib. f. 63. a.</note> that in all their Letters, which they wrote to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
and allure others to their fellowship; they made
their boast that they took up arms by Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and for a certain love and zeal to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
to the intent the Doctrine of the Gospel might
be set forth, augmented, and maintained. And sixthly,
that Truth, Equity, and honest living might reign and
flourish: as also, that they might so provide for them and
theirs, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>henceforth they should not be oppressed with
any violence.</p>
               <p>And that when they had thus, at few words, declared
the cause of their enterprize, they would then command
their Neighbours to arm, and come unto them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
and help them: If not, then would they threaten
to come upon them, with all their force. But, having
gotten the power and Arms into their hands, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
divers horrid outrages;<note place="margin">Ib. f. 64. b. &amp; 65. a.</note> insomuch as <hi>Luther</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
all men, that they would come to destroy them
as wicked Theeves and parricides, in like case as they
would come to quench a common fire; having most
shamefully broken their faith to their Princes; taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods by force, and cloak all this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wickedness, with the cover of Christianity: which
(saith he) is the vilest and unworthiest thing that can be
imagined.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Suevia</hi> and <hi>Franconia</hi> about forty thousand Pesants
took Arms; rob'd a great part of the Nobility, plunder'd
many Towns and Castles, <hi>Muncer</hi> being their chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48510:8"/>
so that the Princes of the Empire, <hi>Albert</hi> Count of
<hi>Mansfeild, Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and his Cousen <hi>George,
Philip</hi> the Lantgrave of <hi>Hesse,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
were necessitated to raise what power they could;
and having offered them pardon upon submission, and
delivering up their principal Leaders,<note place="margin">Sleidans Com. f. 57.</note> which was refused;
marcht against them. But <hi>Muncer</hi> preparing for Battel,
encouraged his followers; crying out to them to take
their weapons, and fight stoutly against their Enemies,
singing * a Song,<note place="margin">Thus did the Rebels here in England at the last Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery 27. Oct. 1644.</note> whereby they call'd for help of the
Holy Ghost. The success of which Battel was, that the
Rebels at the first onset, were soon put in disorder, and
above five thousand slain on the place: and that <hi>Muncer</hi>
fled and hid himself: but being found and brought to the
Princes, was (with his fellow <hi>Phifer</hi>) beheaded at <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And about the year 1535,<note place="margin">An. 1535.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> (a Taylor
by trade, and of this Tribe) preaching the Doctrine of
<hi>Rebaptization,</hi> so much infected the inferior sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by the means of private Conventicles, that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
grew numerous, and exercised violence against
those that were not of their Sect. At last robbing their
adversaries, and gathering together in great Troops, they
possest themselves of the strongest part of the City of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
declaring, that all such as were not rebaptized, ought
to be accounted Pagans and Infidels, and to be killed. His
Companions were <hi>Rosman</hi> and <hi>Cnipperdoling,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together to that City great numbers of the base
sort of people: and seeing their strength, chose new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
of their own Sect,<note place="margin">Sleidan ut su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra lib. 1. f. 131. b.</note> making <hi>Cnipperdoling</hi> the chief;
who taught that the People might put down their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
And albeit that the Apostles had no command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to usurp any jurisdiction: yet such as were their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Church, ought to take upon them the right
of the Sword, and by force to establish a new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Hereupon they spoil'd the Suburbs, and burnt
the Churches; so that the Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> (who was
Lord of the City, and forced out) beseiged them; the
neighbour Princes giving assistance: which seige conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
long, the famine grew to be such, as that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiged
miserably perished in great numbers: and at length
the beseigers forcing their entrance by assault, slew many,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48510:9"/>
took the Ring-leaders; and having put them to death,
hang'd their Bodies in several Cages of Iron on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Towers of that City. Thus far <hi>Sleidan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not unworthy observation, that divers of these <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Phanatiques, to the end they might at that time be
the better known to those of their own Sect, did cut their
hair round, as <hi>Petrus Crinitus</hi> (an Author of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit)

called <hi>Roundheads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning these men, the testimony likewise of Mr.

all Princes and Monarchs should submit their Scepters, and

               </p>
               <p>This Discipline ought to be set up,<note place="margin">Exhort. to Engl. p. 91, 92.</note> and all Princes
ought to submit themselves under the yoke of it. Yea
what Prince, King, or Emperor shall disanul the same, he
is to be reputed God's Enemy; and to be held unworthy
to reign above the people.</p>
               <p>This Discipline is no small part of the Gospel:<note place="margin">T. Cartw. lib. 1. p. 6. &amp; 48.</note> it is the

               <p>Which dangerous positions being thus maintained by
this sort of men, occasioned Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (an eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of those times) thus to express;</p>
               <p>There is in <hi>England (saith he)</hi> a Schismatical,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Company, that would seem to cry out for Discipline. Their
whole talk is of it; and yet, they neither know it, nor will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by it. They are full of pride, thinking themselves to be
full when they are empty; to have all knowledg, when they
are ignorant, and had need to be catechised. The poison of aspes
is under their Lips. They refuse not to speak evil of the blessed
servants of God.</p>
               <p>And, as the <hi>German</hi> Sectaries, upon the Principles before
mention'd, did act in those parts: so did the <hi>Scots</hi> upon
those Documents they had received,<note place="margin">Knox app. 28. 30.</note> chiesly from Iohn
Knox; who told his Countrymen in print, that <hi>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Commonalty ought to reform Religion: and in that
case might remove from Honours, and punish such as God
hath commanded, of what estate, condition, or honour what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon,<note place="margin">A. D. 1557.</note> taking an Oath of confederacy and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
under hands, to some agreement for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
much strength was added thereunto by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious,
hoping thereby to swallow up the Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.
Next,<note place="margin">A. D. 1558.</note> without the authority of Sovereignty, or
knowledg of it, those Confederates prescribed orders for
Reformation of Religion,<note place="margin">Knox Hist. p. 217, 218.</note> to be observed and practised
throughout the whole Kingdom. Then preach'd against
the Queen-Regent and Parliament; and wrote to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Clergy, <hi>that except they did desist from dealing
against them,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 275, &amp; 276.</note> they would with all force and power, execute just
vengeance and punishment upon them; likewise begin the same
war, which God commanded Israel to execute against the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48510:11"/>
And lastly,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 372. 378.</note> arriving at the highest pitch of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
they deposed their Queen.</p>
               <p>By that which hath been said, it is no less apparent, what
those <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, did also
aim at, had their Power been answerable to their Wills.
Whereof she was not ignorant, as may appear by her
Speech at the dissolving that Parliament <hi>an.</hi> 1585 (the
27<hi>th.</hi> of her reign) wherein, taking notice of them, she
pronounc'd them <hi>dangerous to Kingly rule;<note place="margin">Stow's Annal. Holingsh. Chr. p. 1396.</note> every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own censure, making a doom of the validity, and
privity of his Princes Government, with a common veil and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of God's word.</hi> Whereunto I shall add what Serjeant
<hi>Puckering,</hi> being Speaker of the House of Commons in
the Parliament held the next ensuing year (<hi>viz. 28. Eliz.</hi>)
did by that Queen's direction then express.</p>
               <p>And specially you are commanded by her Majesty, (<hi>saith
he</hi>) to take heed, that none ear be given, or time afforded to
the wearysome solicitations of those that commonly be called <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
wherewithall the late Parliaments have been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
importuned. Which sort of men, whilst (in the giddiness
of their Spirits) they labour and strive to advance a new El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership;
they do nothing else but disturb the good people of the
Church and Common-wealth; which is as well grounded, for the
body of Religion it self, and as well guided for the Discipline, as
any Realm that professeth the Truth. And the same thing is
already made good to the World, by many the Writings of Godly
and Learned men; neither answered, nor answerable, by any of
these new fangled Resiners. And as the present case standeth,
it may be doubted, whether they, or the <hi>Jesuits</hi> do offer more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or be more speedily to be repressed. For albeit the <hi>Jesuits</hi>
do impoyson the hearts of her Majesty's Subjects, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Conscience, to withdraw them from the obedience due
to her Majesty; yet do they the same but closely, and only in
privy corners. But these men do both publish in their printed
Books, and teach in all their Conventicles sundry opinions; not
only dangerous to the well setled Estate, and policy of this Realm,
by putting a pyke, between the Clergy and the Laity, but also
much derogatory to her sacred Majesty and her Crown, as well
by the diminution of her antient and lawful Revenues, and by
denying her Highnesses Prerogative and Supremacy, as by offering
peril to her Majesty's safety in her own Kingdom. In all which
things, howsoever in many other points, they pretend to be at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48510:12"/>
war with the <hi>Popish-Jesuits;</hi> yet by this Separation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the unity of their fellow-Subjects, and by abasing
the sacred Authority and Majesty of their Prince, they do but
joyn and concur with the <hi>Jusuits,</hi> in opening the door, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the way to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Invasion, that is threatned against
the Realm. <hi>And shall conclude, with what is most judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
observed by the worthy Author<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Isaac Walton.</note> of the History
of the sometime Famous and Reverend</hi> Hooker's <hi>life.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>So
that these very men, saith he (speaking of the Puritans
in that Queen's time) that began with tender and meek</hi>
Petitions, <hi>proceeded to</hi> Admonitions; <hi>then to satyrical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances:
<hi>and at last, having numbred who was not,
and who was for their</hi> Cause, <hi>they got a supposed certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of so great a party, that they durst threaten, first the</hi>
Bishops; <hi>then the</hi> Queen <hi>and</hi> Parliament. <hi>To all which
they were secretly encouraged by the Earl of</hi> Leicester,
<hi>then in great favour with her Majesty, and the reputed
Cherisher and Patron-General of these pretenders to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of conscience; his design being, by their means,
to bring such an odium upon the Bishops as to prooure
an alienation of their Lands, and a large portion of them
for himself. Which avaritious desire had so blinded
his reason, that his ambition and greedy hopes, had
almost put him into a present possession of</hi> Lambeth-<hi>House.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That Queen therefore had not only a vigilant Eye upon
them,<note place="margin">Copping and Thacker hang'd at St. Edmunsbury; an. 1583, for publishing Pamphlets written by Browne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Book of Common-Prayer.</note> but a strict hand, as these seditious Pamphleters;
<hi>Vdall, Barrow, Greenwood, Studley, Billots, Bowdler, Copping,
Thacker, Penri,</hi> and others deservedly felt.</p>
               <p>But, upon the coming in of King <hi>Iames,</hi> they began to
raise unto themselves better hopes of countenance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
being so confident of his Indulgence, that within
few weeks after his entrance here, they took the boldness
to present him with a Petition against the Government

here setled) did with great prudence by his Royal Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
appoint an Assembly of divers select Divines, such
as could best represent the desires of these dissenting men,<note place="margin">A. D. 1603. Conference at Hampton Court.</note>
as others, to meet at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> upon the twelfth
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> following; where Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sparkes</hi>

of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chaderton</hi> of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
appear'd on their behalfs, and freely hearing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
could be objected by the <hi>weak Brethren</hi> (as they
were then modesty stiled) he clearly discern'd that all the
Exceptions which they made, were no other than frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
scruples of indiscreet men, and so convinced every
one of them thereupon, that they went away amply sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed;
promising thenceforth, not only full obedience to
the Government and Liturgy; but Dr. <hi>Sparkes</hi> wrote a
Book to perswade all others thereunto.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, notwithstanding this, the <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
work'd on still in the Hearts of other busy-headed
<hi>Disciplinarians:</hi> many of which, though they received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
from the Bishops, Subscribed, took Oaths, and
outwardly seemed to conform, stuck not, underhand, to
use all the arts and devices of cunning Impostors, to bring
the people by degrees into an utter dislike of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Government, the better to sit them for some des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Rebellion, whensoever there should be any fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
To which end their practise was, in their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating,
ever to omit some portions of the Liturgy, and to
read the remainder with but little reverence all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might by degrees, beget an opinion in their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
that the service of God did consist meerly in the
<hi>Sermon,</hi> and those long-winded prayers immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
and following it, which be expresly opposite to a
special Canon<note n="*" place="margin">Canon 55.</note> establish'd by Act of Parliament in 1. <hi>Iac.</hi>
Which Prayers, (if they be worthy of that name) they
are not asham'd to say, are uttered by the immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Gods Holy Spirit; though therein, they have
oftimes, not only taken the liberty to deprave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
in Church and State, by divers sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
but made such a seeming shew of Zeal therein, by
altering their Countenances, and changing their Voices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an affected tone; using therein many absurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
expressions; that one<note n="*" place="margin">Colonel John Frye, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> of their own Fraternity,
after he became farther reformed by an Independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
could not forbear, but cryed out against them, in
a certain Book, intituled <hi>The Clergy in their Colours,</hi> printed
at <hi>London an. 1651. pag. 33. l.</hi> 17. in these words; <hi>I cannot
let pass one observation; and that is the strange posture these
men put themselves into, when they begin their Prayers, before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48510:13"/>
their Sermons. Whether the Fools and Knaves in Stage-plays
took their pattern from these men, or these from them, I cannot
determine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What wrye Mouths, Squint Eyes, and Screw'd
faces do they make? <hi>And pag. 41. l.</hi> 3. Again, how like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Conjurers do they mumble cut the beginning of their
Prayers, that the people may not bear them: and when arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
they have raised their voices, what a pulling do they
make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which afforded them no little advantage, was
that horrid <hi>Gun-powder Plot,</hi> which happened in the third
year of King <hi>Iames;</hi> being hatch'd by those fiery-spirited
men of the Romish-perswasion, whom the bloudy-minded
Jesuits had influenc'd for that most wicked practise. For, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, to terrify the people with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> their
Sermons were little less than Declamations against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
aiming thereby to represent them formidable and
odious; insinuating to the world, that all the fear of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was from those of that Religion; whilst they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the mean time, did insensibly poyson the people
with such other unfound Doctrines, as became at length
the fountain of this late unparallel'd Rebellion, which
terminated in the execrable Murther of our late gracious
King: and would have put a Period to this famous and long
flourishing Monarchy, had not almighty God of his great
mercy miraculously prevented it.</p>
               <p>But how far the Principles of these Holy Reformers
do differ, from the most rigid of the Romish profession,
against whom they have so long and loudly clamoured,
these ensuing observations will briefly manifest.</p>

him therewith, craving his advice as to his reception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Howbeit, before King <hi>Iames</hi> his answer could come
to his hand (which was utterly dissuasory) he had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 12.</note> their choice. Whereof King <hi>Iames</hi> hearing, in no

               <p>That this unhappy business prov'd most destructive
to the Count Palatine,<note place="margin">An. 1620. 18. Jac.</note> will immediately appear. For the
Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> became so highly irritated thereat;
that he soon after publish'd a <hi>Proscription</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 14.</note> against him;
proclaim'd him guilty of High Treason; and declared his
resolution to prosecute him as a public Enemy of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
and accordingly,<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 15. E.</note> sent Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous

growing displeased, they desired the Lords to joyn

taking much exception thereupon, judging it deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his Prerogative (it being in his sole power, to
call, and adjourn,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 36.</note> and dissolve Parliaments;) they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
for satisfaction of his Majesty, publish'd a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
wherein they signified unto him; that, <hi>in case his

Palatinate, <hi>upon signification of his pleasure in Parliament,
they should be ready to the utmost of their powers, both with

               </p>
               <p>Certain it is,<note place="margin">Ib. 52. E.</note> that the Parliament made little hast, in
the offering of that, for which they were chiefly called
together; <hi>viz.</hi> the giving to the King considerable aid, for
relief of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in so much as the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> then
took occasion to put the Peers in mind thereof; and that
it was to that end they were summon'd thither; reporting
the present distress of that Country and danger thereto
by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> as also, that the Army of Count
<hi>Mansfeild,</hi> which came in for defence thereof, if not

a Commission for their Adjournment till the eighth

<hi>Protestation,</hi> wherein they declared for sundry Priviledges:
of which his Majesty in a Speech<note n="*" place="margin">Dec. 30.</note> at the Council-Table
upon the thirtieth of that month took notice, that <hi>it was
unduly gained, late at night, when not a third part of the
House was present; and penned in such ambiguous and general
words, as might serve for future times to invade most of the

               </p>
               <p>And, discerning that some Parliament men, who had
a great influence upon the House, rather hinder'd that
good progress, which he expected they would have
made, towards the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
the giving of money in order thereto; did by
unanimous consent of his whole Council, dissolve that
Parliament by Proclamation,<note place="margin">Parliament dissolved 6. Jan. Ib. p. 56.</note> upon the sixth of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
following.</p>
               <p>And seeing his hopes of raising moneys by Parliament
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48510:16"/>
to be thus frustrate, they first endeavoured the restitution
of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by all good means of Treaty, both

welfare of his Children and Posterity; and assurance of his
antient Allies and Confederates.</p>
               <p>Whereunto the King replyed;<note place="margin">Ib. 129. D.</note> that he should be loath
without necessity to imbroil himself in war. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting
to them his wants, for the support of a war,
desired their advice: offering, that,<note place="margin">Ib. 131. A.</note> 
                  <hi>in case he took a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

by their own Deputies, should have the disposal of the
moneys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the Parliament tendred three Subsidies and
three Fifteens,<note place="margin">Ib. 135. C.</note> to break off both the Treaties; <hi>viz.</hi> that
of the match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that concerning the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,<note place="margin">

desiring his Majesty that he would be confidently assured
they would never fail in a Parliamentary-way, to assist him in
so royal a design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the King esteeming that too little,<note place="margin">Ib. 137. A.</note> demanded five
Subsidies, and two Fifteeens for every Subsidy, towards
the support of that war; and one Subsidy and two Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teens
yearly till his debts were pay'd. Nevertheless told
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48510:17"/>
them, that he would be content to quit that demand for
his own debts, in case they gave six Subsidies and twelve
Fifteens for the war:<note place="margin">Ib. 138. B.</note> declaring his resolution to dissolve
the Treaties (whereupon Bonefires were made in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. 139. A.</note>
and the Bells rang for joy.) And farther told them, that
he did assure himself, they would make good what they
had said; and, that what they had advised him unto, they
would assist him in, with their Wisdom and Council, as
also with Forces, if need required.</p>

at <hi>Westminster</hi> within two days following. Where,
in his Speech to both Houses, he put them in mind, how
they had engaged his Father in the war, for the <hi>Palatinate;</hi>
earnestly pressing their speedy assistance. And the Lord
Keeper added,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 175. C. &amp; 176. C.</note> that the principal cause of calling that
Parliament (besides the beholding his Subjects faces) was
to mind them of the great Engagement for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> imposed on his Majesty by the
King his Father, and by themselves, who thereupon brake
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48510:17"/>
off the two Treaties with <hi>Spain:</hi> as also to let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that the Subsidies granted by the preceding
Parliament, with much more of the King's own Revenue,
were already spent in the following Treaties and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
upon the Armies sent into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and
in repairing of the Forts, with the Fortifying of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
all which did meet in one center, the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Account was ready.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Houses presenting the King with two
Subsidies,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 178. A.</note> the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (then one of the Secretaries
of State) signified his Majesties gracious acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
yet told them, that the necessity of the present affairs,
were not therein satisfied, and therefore required their
farther Councils; Reminding them, that the late King
was provoked beyond his nature, to undertake a war for
recovery of his Childrens antient Patrimony; the charges
whereof did appear by computation to amount unto
seven hundred thousand Pounds a year; <hi>viz.</hi> in supporting
the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> in preventing the Emperour's design of
concluding with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> for utter exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Palsgrave;</hi> and levying an Army under Count
<hi>Mansfeild.</hi> Farther representing to them, that the Kings
of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had
levyed another. That <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a war of diversion; and, that to uphold the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
the charges of <hi>Mansfeild's</hi> and <hi>Denmark's</hi> Army
must yet continue.</p>
               <p>But the Plague increasing sore in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 178. E</note> occasion'd
some delay in their Proceedings, by an Adjournment to
<hi>Oxford:</hi> at which place they met the first of <hi>August</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Where, on the fourth of that month, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in a speech to both Houses did again put them in
mind,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 181. A.</note> 
                  <hi>of their engaging his Father in that war, for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>upon promise of their assistance in a
Parliamentary-way; and that they themselves then appointed
a Council of war, and Treasurers.</hi> He also acquainted them
with the expence of the three Subsidies, and three Fifteens
then given. And further expressed, that he had thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled
them upon the death of his royal Father, to
receive their farther advice and aid for proceeding in
that, <hi>wherein by their Councils</hi> his Father was engaged; as
also that they had granted unto him two Subsidies, then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48510:18"/>
ungathered, which were far short of setting forth the
Navy at that time preparing.</p>
               <p>And the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> and Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 182. A.</note> did then
more particularly declare unto the House of Commons,
the state of Affairs, as they at that time stood; manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that much more then the two Subsidies, already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
though not paid, had been disbursed. Moreover,
that the Fleet was then at Sea, hastening to their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz,
the Army at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> expecting their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders;
his Majesties Honour, Religion, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

of his Enemies intentions to infest his dominions in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the <hi>English</hi> Coasts; and of their increase of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in all parts: as also, that the present charge of his

to them the late Kings debts;</p>

               <p>For his Wardrobe 40000<hi>l.</hi> All which did then lye
upon his Majesty.</p>
               <p>And that his then Majesty was indebted to the City of
<hi>London 20000l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he had laid out upon his Navy 20000<hi>l.</hi>

               <p>For Count <hi>Mansfeild 20000l.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And that the pay of the Navy, during the time intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that present Expedition, with the setting forth
thereof, would amount to 300000<hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Commons,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 183. F.</note> instead of that calm and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Consideration of the present Exigencies, which his
Majesty expected, fell into very high debates; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that the Treasure was misimploy'd; that evil
Councils guided the King's designs; that his Necessities
grew by improvidence; that they had need to petition
the King for a straight hand and better Council to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
his affairs: and that, though a former Parliament
did engage the King in a war; yet (if things were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by contrary designs, and the Treasure misimploy'd)
that Parliament was not bound by another Parliament
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48510:18"/>
to be carried blindfold in designs not guided by second
Councils; Adding, that it was not usual to grant Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
upon Subsidies, in one Parliament, and no grievance
redressed.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which objections,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 194. B.</note> it was earnestly
pressed by some Members of the House, that two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies
and two Fifteens might be given; his Majesties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and the Necessity of Affairs requiring it; as it then
appeared out of Considerations, which had been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represented. But these motives little avail'd; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of hearkening thereto, the Commons then publish'd
a plausible <hi>Declaration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. E.</note> wherein they <hi>solemnly protested
and vowed, before God and the world, with one Heart and
Voice, that they were all resolv'd, and did thereby declare,
that they would ever continue most loyal and obedient Subjects
to their most gracious Sovereign Lord King</hi> Charles: <hi>and that
they would be ready, in convenient time, and in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary-way,
freely and dutifully to do their utmost endeavours,
to discover and reform the Abuses and Grievances of the Realm
and State; and, in like sort to afford all necessary Supply to
his most excellent Majesty upon his present, and all other his
just Occasions and Designs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King therefore plainly perceiving,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 195. A.</note> that the House
did not incline to any Supply: and that in their debates
they reflected upon some great persons near unto him,
dissolved that Parliament upon the twelfth of <hi>August.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Parliament dissolved. Ib. E.</note>
Which done, he resolved that the Fleet should speedily
put to Sea; and entred forthwith into a League with the
United Provinces against the Emperour and King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> for restoring of the Liberties of <hi>Germany.</hi> But
being in great and present Want of moneys,<note place="margin">Moneys bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Seal.</note> he issued
out Letters, under his Privy-Seal, for borrowing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
those Necessities;<note place="margin">The second Parliament of King Charles the First. 6. Februarii.</note> and summon'd another Parliament
to meet upon the sixth of <hi>February</hi> ensuing, which was
four days after his solemn Coronation.</p>
               <p>Soon after the sitting of which Parliament, the Earl
of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> at a Conference of both Houses, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
how the affairs of Christendome stood, before the
breach of the Treaties with <hi>Spain;</hi> and how at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
as also the condition of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the King of <hi>Denmark's</hi> engagement in the quarrel,
with the forwardness of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and contract with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48510:19"/>
the <hi>Hollander;</hi> and that the Fruits of all these would be
lost, unless a speedy Supply were resolved on.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 218. E.</note> the Commons still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd
the giving of any Supply; which occasion'd the
King, by a Letter to the Speaker, to press them again
thereunto, and to remind them of their promises: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
assuring them, that he would willingly apply fit and
seasonable remedies, to such just Grievances as they should
present unto him, in a dutiful and mannerly way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
throwing an ill odour upon the present Government,
or upon the Government of his Father.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 220. A.</note> Unto which
Letter, they made a specious general answer; intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they really intended him Supply: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voted three Subsidies, and three Fifteens, but gave them
not.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, His Majesty, by the mouth of the
Lord Keeper, took notice to the House of Commons,
of a seditious expression, made by Mr. <hi>Clement Coke,</hi> one
of their members; as also of Dr. <hi>Turner's</hi> unparliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
carriage in reference to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi>
likewise of suffering his Council of State to be censured
and traduced in their House, by persons whose Years and
Education could not judge of things: that forreign busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had been entertain'd in the House, to the hindrance
and disadvantage of his Majesties Negotiations: yea that
upon the first day of his Inauguration, they suffered
his Council, Governours, and Servants, to be parallel'd
with the times of most Exception: that their Committees
had also presumed to examine the Letters of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of State; nay his Majesties own Letters; and sent
a general Warrant to his Signet Office, commanding his
Officers there, not only to produce and shew the Records,
but their Books, and private Notes, which they made for
his Majesties service. Next he told them, that they had
been made acquainted with the greatness of his Majesties
affairs, both at home and abroad, with the strong prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Enemy: with the Importance of uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Allies; strengthening, and securing, both <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> besides the encountring and annoying the
Enemy, by a powerful Fleet at Sea, and the charge of all.
And, that this being calculated unto them, they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
unto his Majesty, by the mouth of their Speaker,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48510:19"/>
their carefulness to support the Cause, wherein he and
his Allies were justly engaged. Then he reminded
them of their unanimous consent, and real intention,
formerly express'd to supply him in such a measure,
as should make him safe at home and fear'd abroad;
and, that in the dispatch thereof, they would use such
diligence, as his pressing and present Occasions did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
And he observ'd, that in two days only of
twelve, that business was thought of; and not begun,
till by a Message his Majesty did put them in mind
of it, whilst their Inquisition, against his direction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
day by day. And, for the Supply intended, he
told them, the measure thereof was so little; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of making him safe at home, and feared abroad, it
would both expose him to danger and disesteem; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that without better help, his Allies must presently
disband, and leave him alone to bear the fury of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
and powerful enemy; besides the manner of it,
which was dishonourable and full of distrust; <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Bill was not to come into the House, till their
Grievances were both preferr'd and answer'd.</p>
               <p>And his Majesty himself then farther added,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 229. A.</note> he must
put them in mind, that in the time of his blessed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they did by their Councel and Perswasion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
both with his Father and himself, to break off the
Treaties before-mention'd; and told them, that <hi>now
they had all things according to their wishes, and that he
was so far engaged, they thought there was no retreat; now
they began to set the Dice on him;</hi> saying moreover, that
<hi>it was not a Parliamentary-way; nor a way to deal with
their King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 230. B.</note> by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Command, farther affirm'd; that <hi>if his Majesty
should accept of a less sum then would suffice, it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Expectations, disappoint his Allies, and consume
the Treasure of the Kingdom: whereas, if they would give
largely now, the business being at the</hi> Crisis, <hi>it would come
so seasonably, as that it might give a turn to the affairs of
Christendom:</hi> wishing them therefore to enlarge it, but
left the augmentation to themselves. And, to the end
the load might not lye on the poorest; told them, his
Majesty did likewise wish, that they who were the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48510:20"/>
and councellors of this war, would take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the burthen to themselves.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless all this moved them very little;<note place="margin">An. 1625.</note> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the King, by a Letter to the Speaker of the
House of Commons (dated upon the ninth of <hi>Iune</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 Junii.</note>
following) hoping to quicken them the better, did
put them in mind, how often and earnestly he had
press'd them for speeding that Aid, which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his great and weighty affairs; telling them, the
time they themselves had prefix'd, was so far spent
(<hi>viz.</hi> the last day of that month) that unless it were
presently concluded, it would neither bring him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
nor credit. And, that if it were farther deferr'd,
it would be of little use; he being daily advertised from
all parts, of the great preparations by the Enemy really
to assail him: and moreover, that he held it necessary
by those his Letters, to give them his last and final ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition;
as also to let them know, that he should
account all further Delays and Excuses, to be express
Denials: and therefore did will and require them, to
bring in their <hi>Subsidy-Bill,</hi> to be pass'd without delay,
or condition. Adding, that, if by their denial or delay,
any thing of ill consequence should fall out, either at
home or abroad; he should take God to witness, that
he had done his part to prevent it, by calling his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
together, to advise with them; and opening to
them the weight of his occasions; as also by requiring
their timely help and assistance in those Actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he stood engaged by their Councel.</p>
               <p>But, instead of any satisfactory return unto this his
Royal Letter,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 402. B.</note> wherein he had earnestly prest unto them,
the speedy and necessary consideration of his present Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies;
they made what haste they could, to perfect
a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> and
concerning <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> taken by the King,
since the death of his Father, without consent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Which was no sooner finished, but they had
intimation, that the King would dissolve the Parliament;
whereupon they forthwith order'd, that every Member
of their House should have a Copy of that <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 403. D.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48510:20"/>The Parliament being therefore dissolv'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
upon the fifteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The second Parliament of K. Charles I. dissolved. 15. Junii.</note> his Majesty did
presently set forth a <hi>Declaration,</hi> manifesting the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he had for dissolving thereof; as also of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Parliament: whereby he did clearly publish to
the world, how he became engaged in a war with a
potent Enemy, upon his Father's death; and that he
was enforc'd thereto, for the necessary defence of
himself and his Dominions; as also for the support of
his Friends and Allies; recovering the patrimony of his
Sister, and her Children, and maintenance of the true
Religion. Moreover, that <hi>he was invited thereto, and
encouraged therein, by the advice of both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and by their large Promises and Protestations to
his Father, to give him full and reall assistance in those
Enterprizes, which were of so great importance to this Realm;
and to the general peace and safety of all his Friends and
Allies:</hi> but, that instead of making performance of
those their undertakings, he found them so slow and
full of delays and diversions, that no fruit came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And farther added; that <hi>tho he had by his Letters,
bearing date the ninth of Iune, press'd them earnestly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
with a clear and gracious manifest of his resolutions,
they never so much as admitted one Reading to the Bill of
Subsidies; but instead thereof prepared and voted a</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance,
<hi>which they intended to prefer unto him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
(tho palliated with glosing terms) as well many
dishonourable Aspersions upon himself, and upon the memory
of his deceased Father, as dilatory Excuses for their not
proceeding with the Subsidies. Adding thereto also colour'd
conditions, crossing thereby his direction.</hi> All which his
Majesty plainly understanding; and esteeming the
same to be a denial of the promised Supply: finding
likewise withall, that no admonition could move, nor
reasons or presumptions prevail, the time being so far
spent, as that they had put an impossibility upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to perform their Promises; upon mature advice,
he dissolv'd the Parliament, as hath been already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>Being therefore thus exposed to extreme Necessities,<note place="margin">An. 1626. 2 Car. 1. Ib. p. 419. B. C A Loan of money requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the K.</note>

send them home. But that King, not looking on this
Example, and knowing upon what ill terms our King
stood, both at home and abroad; first seized on all the
Merchants Ships which lay in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
and then brake out into open war; so that the King
was constrain'd to make use of those Forces against

against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to comply with the desire
of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who humbly sued for his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

being encountred with great Tempests, was
forc'd to return, without doing any thing farther, then
shewing his Majesties good will, and readiness to assist

as in the Annals of that time may at large be seen;

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48510:22"/>
to the King by the House of Commons in the former Session.</hi>
But I proceed, notwithstanding this fair shew of an
hopeful accordance;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 651. C.</note> there were not a few turbulent-spirited
men, both in the Parliament and elsewhere,
who sought all advantages for breaking thereof; divers
Merchants refusing to pay <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> in

Whereupon his Majesty first sent for those Merchants
to the Council-Table; and after, by a Speech to both
Houses, told them he expected they should pass the Bill
for it. But instead of complying therein, the Commons
publisht a <hi>Declaration</hi> concerning <hi>Religion;</hi> alledging, that
they must prefer it before all other business. Whereupon
the King, whose urgent <hi>Necessities,</hi> for want of the
Supply expected, pressed hard upon them;<note place="margin">An. 1628.</note> issuing out
a special Commission<note n="*" place="margin">Febr.</note>, for taking of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and
<hi>Poundage.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 670. F.</note> Against which the Commons not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
but some of their Members behaved themselves
therein so disobediently and seditiously, to the contempt
of his Regal authority;<note place="margin">Short view of the life of K. Charles p. 53.</note> that fearing they should be
dissolved before they had vented their own passions
in that particular, they lockt the doors of the House
of Commons, kept the Key, and held the Speaker by
strong hand in his Chair, till they had thunder'd out
their Anathema's; not only against such as should dare
to levy it, but against those who should willingly pay
it. The News whereof, being thereupon brought forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to the King, he did, upon the second of <hi>March,</hi>

added, that <hi>he did thus declare the manifold causes

to dissolve that Parliament; that all the world might see,
how much they had forgotten their former engagements, at the

               <p>And for the better support of these <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> they
purchased<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 211. 212.</note> in divers Impropriate Tithes; constituting

(all of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party) under colour of <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's Portion out of Lay hands</hi> (as the Phrase then
was.) By which subtile Practise, they gained many large
sums in order thereto, from sundry well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
especially such as lay on their Death-beds; who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48510:23"/>
being thus incited to this seeming glorious work, saw
nothing at all of the main design, which was under-hand
driven on by the Grand Contrivers. Besides this, they
likewise cunningly wrought, that such as were of their
Party, might by one means or other be made Heads of
some Houses in the Universities; as they did in <hi>Emanuel
Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Catherine Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge; New-Inne,</hi> and
<hi>Magdalen Hall</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And for an essay of those whom
under colour of Preaching the Gospel, in sundry parts
of the Realm, they determin'd to make instrumental for
carrying on the work, they set up a Morning-Lecture
at St. <hi>Antholines</hi>-Church in <hi>London;</hi> where (as Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for that purpose) they first made tryal of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
which place was the grand Nursery, whence most
of the Seditious Preachers were after sent abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>England,</hi> to poyson the People with their Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
Principles. These being the men, who first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to infuse into their Auditors a disaffection to the
<hi>Church Discipline</hi> establish'd by Law, pretending it to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Popery: and after a breach made therein, then
to cry out against miscarriages in Government. So that
having in a short time wean'd the People from kneeling
at Prayers, and bearing part in the publick Service of God
by their mutual <hi>Responses,</hi> as the <hi>Liturgy</hi> directs; they
then cryed down those reverend Set-forms of Devotion,
which were enjoyned by the Law: and by degrees using
them to long-winded <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayers, of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested
composure (which they call'd Praying by the
Spirit (at length insinuated to them, that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> by
Law establish'd was no other than the Mass translated
into <hi>English,</hi> and a thing utterly nauseous to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
by which means multitudes deserted the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers of the Church in divers places, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents
continued regular, and forbore to come there,
until the Psalm preceding the Sermon began. So that in
the end, the decent and pious Order, in serving God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws, not only became by little and little
wholly antiquated; but such of the Clergy, as making
any conscience of their Subscriptions, and Oaths of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
obedience, observed the Rule; were frequently
scandaliz'd with Innovation in Religion, and inclination
to Popery; few regarding any thing but the Sermons,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48510:24"/>
and those tedious <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayers of the Preacher in
order thereto:<note place="margin">Ib. p. 311, 312.</note> placing all Religion in being present at
those wild and frothy Exercises, though they slept when
they came there, or little regarded what was said.</p>
               <p>In which Prayers (if I may so call them) it was no
wonder to hear them,<note place="margin">The absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and ill effects of them.</note> cunningly to insinuate that, which
might put the people into a jealousy of the King, and
the inferior Magistrate; by praying against this or that
miscarriage; of which, by their subtile expressions they
would have their auditory believe them to be guilty, in
point of Government, or personal demeanour. Nor were
those their Sermons, for the most part, other than vain and
frivolous declamations against Popery, wherewith they
affrighted the more ignorant sort of people; as if that
were the only thing which would endanger their souls,
enslave their consciences, and utterly ruine them in their
temporal estates. By which sleight, in drawing their
thoughts from what was really the grand danger, they
led them blindfold into those mists of error and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
wherein they became afterwards miserably shakled,
and were made Slaves to those Grand Contrivers; who, at
length, by these devices, got the full power of the Sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands; verifying therein that Prophetical expression
of the venerable and judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> in that excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his Books of Ecclesiastical Policy; <hi>viz. after the
Puritans have first resolved, that attempts for Discipline are
lawful; it will follow in the next place to be disputed, what may
be attempted against Superiors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In further order to which malevolent design for the
utter extirpation of Monarchy, being not ignorant in
what high esteem the memory of the same Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
was with all pious and learned men, for those five Books
of <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> made public in his life time: and
having heard that there were three more written by him
upon the same subject; which under colour of a desire
to search after his death, for some Writings in his Study,
were by certain Clergy-men who stood disaffected to the
Discipline of the Church, unhappily lurch'd away: they
did at length gain those very Books into their hands; and
not long after the beginning of this late unparallel'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
for the better accomplishing their long studyed
ends, most shamefully corrupted them in sundry places,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48510:24"/>
omitting divers passages which were unsutable to their
purposes; and instead thereof inserting what they thought
might give countenance to their present evil practises: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which was this, <hi>in terminis,</hi> that, <hi>though the King
were singulis major, yet he was universis minor;</hi> and having
so done, caus'd them to be publish'd in Print. By which
fallacy, divers well meaning people were miserably cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
and drawn to their Party. And, at length were
not ashamed, in that Treaty which they had with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to vouch the authority of this
venerable man, in derogation of his Supremacy, and to
place the Soveraign power in the People; that great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonarchist,
<hi>William</hi> late Vicount <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Sele,</hi> being
the person who boldly urged it. Whereunto the good
King answered; that <hi>though those three Books, were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be Mr.</hi> Hookers; <hi>yet he would admit them so to be,
and consent to what his Lordship endeavoured to prove out of
them, in case he would assent to the judgment of Mr.</hi> Hooker,
<hi>declared in the other five Books, which were unquestionably
His.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to these their indirect dealings, in thus corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the works of that excellent man; (whose memory for
his profound learning, singular piety, and most exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
life will be ever precious to succeeding ages) and
his necessary vindication therein; I shall, for more full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to my Reader, refer him to that seasonable
Historical discourse, lately compiled and published, with
great judgment and integrity, by that much deserving
person Mr. <hi>Isaac Walton,</hi> containing a perfect Narrative
of the life and death of this right worthy person.</p>
               <p>Of which I hold it necessary, that special notice
should be taken; by reason that since the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
of our present Soveraign K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. Dr.
<hi>Gawden,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> upon the reprinting
those five genuine Books of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> together with
the other pretended three; taking upon him to
write a Preface to the whole; and therein to give an
account of Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> life; hath not only, with great
confidence, used divers Arguments to satisfie the world,
that those three Books were penn'd by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
those poysonous assertions against the
Regal power, which are to be found therein) but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48510:25"/>
much misreported him, in the Narrative of his life; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
him to have been a single man, with many
other gross mistakes; as whoso compares it with Mr.
<hi>Walton's</hi> History of him, may easily see.</p>
               <p>Moreover, well knowing, that the City of <hi>London,</hi>
in respect of its Riches and Populousness, must be the
principal stage for this Tragic-Action; there was no
small care taken for fitting all places of Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
especially the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> with such active men
as might advance this blessed work. Wherein, having
made a fair and succesful progress; but discerning, that
the Sword must at length be made use of; they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to frequent the <hi>Artillery-yard,</hi> and to be diligent
Practisers of military Discipline:<note place="margin">Their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> in which they grew in
a short time so great Proficients, that most of the cheif Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in that School, were men of that stamp, and got
into their hands the best and choicest Arms.</p>
               <p>And, that they might make the more secure progress
in this their long studyed design; they laid the Scene at
first in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Subjects of that Realm being most
tainted with <hi>Presbytery:</hi> so that in case this their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
should speed there, they might the more boldly
adventure upon the like here.</p>
               <p>The first thing therefore,<note place="margin">His Majesties Declaration printed at London, An. 1639. p. 6.</note> that was made use of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Master-piece in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was an exception (or
rather cavil) by divers eminent persons in that Kingdom,
at his Majesties Revocation of such things, as had been
passed away in prejudice of that Crown (especially by
some of his Progenitors in their minorities) though not
without example. This, being advised by those, that were
then his Majesties Privy-Councellers and Officers of State
in that Realm (whose late Actions have sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
what effect they desired it should produce). did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
occasion much repining by divers principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<note place="margin">Ib. p. 7.</note> who thereupon infused into his Subjects a distaste of
his Government. And, though the King was pleased to
wave his interest therein; and to remit as well the Equity,
as rigour of the Laws in that point, the Male-contents
would not be satisfyed, but still endeavoured to work a
disaffection in the people thereto.</p>
               <p>And whereas his Majesty out of his pious care of the
Clergy,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 9.</note> who had been much opprest by the Laity, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48510:25"/>
pay'd Tythes, being pleased to grant out Commissions in
their behalf; had so good issue therein, as that both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were abundantly satisfyed; the maintenance of the
Clergy being thereby improv'd, and the Laity freed from
a dangerous dependance upon Subjects: yet the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Lay-Patrons, fretting privately for being rob'd,
as they conceiv'd, of the dependance of the Clergy and
Laity, bent their envy against the Bishops, under pretence
that they were the principal causers thereof.</p>
               <p>To quiet therefore these discontents, in the year 1633,<note place="margin">An. 1633.</note>
his Majesty made a progress into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was there
crowned (having not been personally there, till then, since
the death of his Royal Father) at which time he also held
a Parliament in that Realm; wherein great suggestions
were made of fears, that dangerous Innovations in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
would be attempted, as also instead of acceptance
of an Act for Ratification of all other Acts, concerning
the Religion professed and established, it was dissented to
by divers of the after-chiefest <hi>Covenanters.</hi> And, no sooner
was he returned back into <hi>England,</hi> but that infinite Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
were disperst abroad, to impoyson the People with
his Majesties proceedings at that Parliament. Of which
Libellers (amongst others) the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> was found
guilty by his Peers; and accordingly should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
sentence of death for it: nevertheless, through his
Majesties goodness, was not only pardoned, but enlarg'd,
and afterwards became an eminent <hi>Covenanter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Insolency of the <hi>Scots</hi> did not a little animate
and encourage the Puritan-faction here,<note place="margin">An. 1634.</note> who loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against the <hi>Discipline of the Church,</hi> as it then by
Law stood establish'd: and to beget a greater contempt
thereof in the generality of the people, represented it
to be superstitious, and like to usher in Popery: dispersing
many scandalous, seditious, and libellous Pamphlets to
that purpose: infusing likewise into them strange appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
that their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> were in no little
danger: and the better to give colour to their pretended
fears of these approaching Evils, they took ready hold of
this following occasion.</p>
               <p>The Soveraignty of the Brittish-Seas, by antient right
justly appertaining to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> having not
only been invaded by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but their bold usupation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48510:26"/>
therein openly justifyed by certain public Writings; the
King, with the advice of his Council-learned, did, about
the same time, issue out certain Writs, directed as well
to all the Inland Counties,<note place="margin">The Inland parts charg'd with Ships for defence of the Realm.</note> as to the respective Port-Towns,
according to the example of his Royal Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
to set out a certain number of Ships, furnish'd
with Mariners, Amunition, Victual, and all other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
for defence of the Realm. By which means he did
not only assert and recover that dominion on the Sea,
which really belong'd to this Kingdom, but much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Trade and Commerce, whereby the generality
of his Subjects were not a little enrich'd.</p>
               <p>But this just and rational practise, some of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
Members of his former Parliaments, and others
of that stamp, under pretence of standing up for the
<hi>Rights and Properties of the Subjects,</hi> did stubbornly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
though his Majesty had the clear and unanimous
opinion of all the grave and learned Judges of his Courts
in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> under their hands, to justify those
his Proceedings: Nevertheless, waving any arbitrary
power, he freely gave leave, that the Case should be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
debated in the Exchequer-Chamber. Which
being publikly done after divers solid Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
no less then ten of those twelve Judges fully declared
their opinion for the Legality thereof; Sr. <hi>George Crook,</hi>
and Sr. <hi>Richard Hulton</hi> only dissenting, though they had
formerly subscribed thereto.</p>
               <p>This as to the <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> and what (as hath been
before observed) of the great noise made every where
touching the fear of Popery, was it whereof not only

Which pious motion, being then and there well approved
of, a <hi>Liturgy</hi> was accordingly framed, and in all points
properly fitted for that Kirk;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 17.</note> and after his return into

after a review thereof, finding it in substance, the same
with the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> which his Majesty in point of

these great Pretenders to Godliness; whereby, in case they
did prosper, they might swallow up the Possessions of the

Crown and Church, with the Estates of all his Majesties

King having married a Popish Queen, did resolve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Romish Religion first into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
into the rest of his dominions; and to that end,
first to settle this <hi>Liturgy</hi> there, it being privately whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
that it was the very Mass translated into their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
Which so far incensed the vulgar; that upon

upon the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> the same year (1637) they made

but attributed it to the Rogues and base multitude,
except the zealous Kirkmen, who cryed it up in their
Pulpits, and magnifyed them for the most heroical Sparks,
that ever God inspired, and raised up, in this last age
of the world; and for their happy Mouths and Hands;
which God was pleas'd to honour that day, with the

their <hi>celestial Covenant</hi> (as they call'd it) <hi>that their

               </p>
               <p>After this (about the end of Harvest) began a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
conflux of the Nobility, Gentry, Ministers,
and others at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> from all parts of the Kingdom:
howbeit, as yet the principal persons in authority there,
seemed to stand right enough in their loyalty (so that
his Majesty the less feared the ensuing mischeifs) the
more to prevent any suspition thereof,<note place="margin">17. Oct. 1637.</note> set forth three
<hi>Proclamations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that nothing should be treated of at the Council-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <hi>The Second,</hi> for removing the Session (<hi>or Term</hi>) from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough</hi>
to <hi>Lithgow,</hi> for fear of present danger. <hi>The
third,</hi> for burning a seditious Book, dispersed in derogation of
the Ecclesiastical Government in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But these <hi>Proclamations</hi> were for little else then shew;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 35. 18. Oct.</note>
the Tumults increasing; so that the next day, the Bishop
of <hi>Galoway,</hi> and the Lord chief Justice of that Kingdom,
were assaulted by the multitude, and the Lords beset in
the Council-house; the people, in their clamorous noises,
crying, <hi>God defend all those,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 37.</note> who will defend God's cause;
and God confound the Service-book, and all the maintainers
thereof.</hi> And so great were their outrages, that they
pull'd down the Lord Treasurer; took his Hat, Cloak,
and White-Staff from him; and set upon the Provost,
as he was entring his own House.</p>
               <p>These with the like were the beginnings to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
glorious work of <hi>Reformation</hi> (as they call'd it)
which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God even to a miracle had so graciously
prospered in their Hands.</hi> In which last Tumults none
were more forward than two of those, who were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bayliffs of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and had subscribed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd

               </p>
               <p>Subsequent to which Tumults,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 41.</note> two Petitions were
presented to the Lord Chancellour and Council against

Women, Children and Servants of <hi>Edenborough;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
by the Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses:
suggestions being made to the people of the King's
inclination to Popery.</p>
               <p>Of which stirs in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 47.</note> the King having adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
he sent over the Earl of <hi>Roxborough</hi> (Lord
Privy-Seal) into that Kingdom. Whereupon a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">19. Febr. 1638.</note>
was set forth there, by his Majesties appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for dispersing of the dangerous multitudes got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at Sterlyn. But against this <hi>Proclamation</hi> the Earl
of <hi>Hume,</hi> and Lord <hi>Lindsey,</hi> with many others of all
ranks, made a <hi>Protestation;</hi> which <hi>Protestation</hi> they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
at <hi>Lithgow,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> forcing
the Heraulds that proclaim'd the same, to stay and hear
the <hi>Protestation</hi> against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48510:28"/>So that, 'tis observable, that the first Tumult was by
the name of <hi>Rascals</hi> and Scum of the people.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 40.</note> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
by the <hi>best sort of Citizens:</hi> and the third by the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which <hi>Protestation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tables of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice erected.</note> they erected public Tables
of Advice and Council, for ordering the affairs of that
Kingdom, in contempt of his Majesties authority;
entring into a formal Combination, which they call'd
<hi>a Covenant</hi> against all that should oppose them.<note place="margin">The first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by the Scots.</note> Which
<hi>Covenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Cant,</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Galsgow,</hi> told
the people, he was sent to them with, by a Commission
from Christ, to bid them Subscribe; it being Christ's
contract; and that he himself came, as a wooer to them,
for the Bridegroom; and call'd upon them to come to
be hand-fasted, by subscribing that contract. Adding,
that he would not depart the Town, till he got all the
names of those who should refuse to subscribe that
Contract, of whom he promised to complain to his
Master.</p>
               <p>The King therefore hearing of the increase of those
troubles,<note place="margin">His Majesties Declaration. Ib. p. 40.</note> sent over the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<note n="*" place="margin">Dated at Windsor 20 May 1638. The Marq. of Hamilton sent into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there.</note> for composure of them. Who, on the sixth
of <hi>Iune</hi> following arrived at <hi>Dalkeith;</hi> where the Lords
of his Majesties Council of that Kingdom, were then
assembled for safety (as 'twas pretended) in regard of
the combustions at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> which daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>But the cheif of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> grew daily more
violent in their courses; increased the meetings of their
Tables; subdivided them into several Committees;
augmented their Provisions of Armes; and infusing
fears and jealousies into the people, by seditious Sermons;
caused <hi>Edenborough</hi>-Castle to be girt with strong Guards;
hindred all persons to go to the Marquess, to treat or
speak with him in the business for which he was sent;
giving out, that there was a <hi>Plot</hi> to blow them up with
Gunpowder, if they should go to Dalkeith; and received
in two Ships-lading with Armes and Amunition at that
time.</p>
               <p>Whereupon,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 85. 86.</note> at the request of the Citizens of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
the Marquess took his journey from <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to
<hi>Haly-Rood-House.</hi> But, before he got thither, the <hi>Covenanters</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48510:28"/>
meeting him on the way, with multitudes that made
great Exclamations against Popery and Bishops; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the Church, and then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
justifying their <hi>Covenant,</hi> as being more availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and usefull to them (as they said) than all the Laws
and Acts of Parliament, which had been enacted in that
Kingdom since the time of <hi>Fergus,</hi> the first King thereof.
The Peoples fury also growing more hot than ever,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 88.</note> new
Guards were clap'd upon the Castle of <hi>Edenborough;</hi> the
Pulpits rung of Libellous Sermons and Prayers: yea so
insolent they were, that they sent a Prohibition against
reading the English-Service in the King's peculiar Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
where the Marquess (his Majesties Commissioner)
and the Council were to be.</p>
               <p>Which Tumults (as 'twas said) occasioning the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
to go back to <hi>Dalkeith;</hi> the <hi>Covenanters</hi> sent Letters
to every one of his Majesties Council, requiring their
Subscription to the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And, understanding, that
the Marquess did resolve to publish a <hi>Declaration</hi> of his
Majesties forwardness, to maintain the Religion profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that Kingdom, and his aversness to Popery; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him, as he tendred the King's honour, his own
safety, and peace of the Publick from doing it.</p>
               <p>But not withstanding these arguments,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 96. 28. Junii.</note> the Marquess
did cause his Majesties <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be publish'd by
Heraulds, at the Market-Cross in <hi>Edenborough;</hi> declaring
his resolution to maintain the true Protestant-Christian-Religion.
And for farther clearing of scruples, assured
them; that he would neither then, nor thenceforth press
the practise of the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Service-Book,</hi> otherwise
than in such a fair and legal way, as should satisfy his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Subjects, that he neither intended Innovation in
Religion, or Laws; warning all his good people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of disobedience.</p>
               <p>But all this no whit sufficed them; for in open affront
thereto, they caused multitudes of people to fill the streets
(especially near the Cross) in an hostile equipage; with
Pistols and Swords out of their Belts; giving out, that
if this <hi>Proclamation</hi> were hearkned unto, it would bring
undoubted ruine to their Religion, Laws, and Liberties:
and upon a Scaffold (erected for that purpose) they
mounted, with a Rebellious <hi>Protestation,</hi> in defence of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48510:29"/>
their <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they published openly: concluding
that if his Majesty would not allow their proceedings,
they themselves would call a <hi>General Assembly;</hi> justifying
all their doings to be most necessary, and an orderly
means, agreeable to the Laws and practise of that Church
and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Marquess returning into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 110. &amp; 111.</note> to
acquaint the King with what had passed; resolving to be
back again before the Fifth of <hi>August</hi> with new instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
they in his absence inform'd the People, that he
was well satisfied with their <hi>Covenant.</hi> Against which
calumny, upon his return, he publish'd a <hi>Manifesto</hi> in
Print. And having direction from his Majesty to indict
an <hi>Assembly;</hi> sent to divers of the principal <hi>Covenanters,</hi>
concerning some Propositions to be resolv'd upon before
the meeting thereof. But this Message was receiv'd with
so much choler and contempt; that they blazed it abroad
for a proposition, tending to the utter ruine of the
Laws and Liberties of that Church and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Which much startling the Marquess, he told them
of his resolution to go back into <hi>England,</hi> and that he
could not concur with them: but that he had power
to grant them a new <hi>Assembly;</hi> which he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be free, if they should bring in every man to
have a voice, whom they had a mind to. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
went again into <hi>England.</hi> Where having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the King with what had hapned, he returned.
Howbeit, before he came back, the <hi>Covenanters</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to promise) had elected Commissioners for the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which his Return,<note place="margin">22 Sept.</note> he delivered to his Majesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Haly-Rood-House,</hi> Letters concerning the <hi>Confession
of faith</hi> of the date at <hi>Edenborough <hi>Ian.</hi>
                  </hi> 28. 1580; and signed
by King <hi>Iames.</hi> But the <hi>Covenanters</hi> hereupon gave out to
the people, that the News brought by the Marquess,
did tend to the utter subversion of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties:</hi>
also that there was a new <hi>Covenant</hi> to be set on
foot by the King, to destroy theirs; and that if now
they resisted not, all was lost that they had already done.
Nevertheless the Marquess caused his Majesties <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Confession of Faith (ut supra)</hi> to be publish'd at
the Market-Cross in <hi>Edenborough:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 137.</note> and at the same time,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48510:29"/>
not only a <hi>Proclamation</hi> for indicting a <hi>General Assembly</hi>
at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the one and twentieth of <hi>November</hi> ensuing;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 147.</note>
but an Act of the Lords of the Council, requiring all
his Majesties Subjects, to subscribe the said <hi>Confession of
Faith,</hi> and Band annexed. Which <hi>Declaration</hi> contain'd
a grant for redress of all the particular Grievances, desired
in their <hi>Supplications, Remonstrances, Protestations, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
&amp;c. and besides all this, their own <hi>Confession of
Faith</hi> (the ground, as they pretended of their <hi>Covenant)</hi>
renewed and established.</p>
               <p>But the principal <hi>Covenanters</hi> having possess'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with a prejudicate opinion of this gratious <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(before they heard it) as destructive to the <hi>Laws</hi> and
<hi>Liberties</hi> of that Church and Kingdom;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 156.</note> erected a large
Scaffold near the Cross, where the same was to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
at which divers Earls, Lords, Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
with their Swords in their Hands, and Hats on
their Heads, stood jeering and laughing, during the time
of the same <hi>Declaration:</hi> and it being ended, with Insolent
and Rebellious behaviour, assisted one <hi>Archibald Iohnston,</hi>
in the publishing a most wicked and treasonable <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
wherein they invoked God's holy name, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to many notorious falshoods; attributing Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to their Rebellious <hi>Covenant:</hi> affirming, that <hi>it was
approved from Heaven with rare and undeniable instances.</hi>
And the next Sunday after, all the Pulpits rang with bitter
invectives and Declamations against his Majesties <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;</hi>
branding it with the depth and policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, this <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> so
sent by his Majesty was very well received in all places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such whereunto the <hi>Covenanters</hi> from their Tables had
prepared their Emissaries to disswade the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it; witness the Letter sent to the Marquess, dated
24 <hi>Sept.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">24 Sept.</note> from the Provost, Bayliffs, and Council of <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
and the Ministers there. And the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasgow</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus indicted, they cunningly contrived,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 188, &amp; 189.</note> that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 195.</note>
should be elected of the most rigidand fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
spirits that were; the Principal <hi>Covenanters</hi> perswading
the People, that the King intended no performance of
what he promised in his last <hi>Proclamation;</hi> no not the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>
it self; but to gain time until he were ready for

their ruine: sending likewise for all their party, to flock

                  <hi>Edenborough,</hi> as if then there had been greater danger
than ever;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 197.</note> increasing also their Guards about the Castle;
their Preachers publishing in the Pulpits; that <hi>whosoever
subscribed his Majesties Confession and Covenant, were perjur'd
Villains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover they caused a most false,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 208.</note> odious, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Libel, to be drawn up against the Archbishops and
Bishops; and exhibiting it to the Presbytery of <hi>Edenborough,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 210.</note>
procured it to be publicly read in the Pulpits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

               <p>And soon after this,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 229. &amp; 230.</note> they indicted an <hi>Assembly,</hi> by their

following. But upon knowledg that the Lord Marquess
(his Majesties Commissioner) was resolv'd to hold the
<hi>Assembly</hi> at the time and place appointed by the King's
<hi>Proclamation,</hi> they altered their purpose, and sent out Papers
for a General meeting at <hi>Edenborough</hi> upon the twelfth
of <hi>November;</hi> and to stay there, till they were to go to
<hi>Glasgow</hi> on Saturday the seventeenth of that month.</p>
               <p>Which meeting (according to the King's <hi>Proclamation)</hi>
being very great; after his Majesties Commission read,
the Marquess exhorted them to a peaceable and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
carriage; giving some touch of the disorders that
had passed. Whereunto answer being made by a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(a Lay Elder) that <hi>they had given his Grace satisfaction
for all their proceedings,</hi> they went on to the choice of a
Moderator, without the approbation and consent of his
Majesties Commissioner; appointing for that purpose
Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson</hi> (the most rigid <hi>Covenanter)</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48510:30"/>
whom, when the Marquess protested, such was
their heady and exorbitant carriage; that, by the hands
of Doctor <hi>Hamilton,</hi> they presented to the Marquess a
a <hi>Declinator</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> against his proceedings, in
the name of the Bishops. Nay so formidable they soon
after grew, as that the University of <hi>Aberdene,</hi>

been threatned with the loss of their lives, for writing

                  <note place="margin">28. Oct.</note> And on the eight and twentieth

which were read at the instance of his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner:
but the Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> hindred the reading of

undue, so were their <hi>Actions</hi> in the <hi>Assembly;</hi> all being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by faction, and clancular contrivances,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 281, 282, 283.</note> as appeared
by their own Private Papers of Instructions (some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were discovered by the Marquess) neither was any
freedom of debate therein, but what tended to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of their evil designs.</p>
               <p>The Marquess therefore shewing a dislike to those their
sinister dealings,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 287. 27 Nov.</note> departed from the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
Whereupon the <hi>Covenanters</hi> protested against all that
he had said and done there, as his Majesties Commissioner.
And at the same instant the Lord <hi>Areskyn,</hi> and three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mean persons, came and beg'd to be admitted into
their blessed <hi>Covenant.</hi> Which offer (though of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
contrived) was made so good use of by the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
that he desired it might be admired as God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and Sealing of their proceedings. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to the question whether they should adhere to
their <hi>Protestation,</hi> and continue the <hi>Assembly,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the King's Commissioners departure, it was
voted (by most) affirmatively. Secondly, whether the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48510:31"/>
Assembly, though dissolv'd by his Majesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
was competent judge against the Bishops, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would go on in their Tryal; it passed also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively,

               </p>
               <p>And now,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 290. 29. Nov.</note> no sooner was the Marquess thus departed,

the <hi>Assembly;</hi> but that Mr. <hi>Archibald Iohnston</hi> (the

against it.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 294. Ib. p. 317.</note> After which all things were transacted by
some few pack'd Committees of the most fierce <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi>
which sate till the thirtieth of <hi>December</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Which Committees, amongst other of their Acts
declared six general <hi>Assemblies</hi> to be Null and void,
whereof two were then in force by several Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and divers Acts of the other four, confirm'd
by Parliament. They condemned likewise, all the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian Tenets</hi>
(as they call'd them) without defining
what those <hi>Tenets</hi> were. They also deprived all the <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Realm;<note place="margin">Episcopal Government abolish'd in Scotland. Ib. p. 319.</note> excommunicating
many of them, without examining any one witness to
prove, no nor offering to produce any to testify ought
against them. And next declared <hi>Episcopal Government</hi>
to be inconsistent with the Laws of that Church and
Kingdom; abolishing it for ever, though it then stood
confirm'd by many Acts both of Parliament and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
They also depriv'd divers Ministers for <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi>
without ever questioning them for what Tenets or
opinions they held.</p>
               <p>Moreover, towards the end of their <hi>Assembly,</hi> they
divided themselves into several Committees; which after
their rising, should see all their Acts put in execution.
And, at the conclusion of all, the <hi>Moderator</hi> gave God
thanks for their good success, congratulating the Nobility
for their great pains; giving thanks also to the Earl of
<hi>Argyle</hi> for his Presence and Council. Which Earl, in a
long Speech, then excused his late declaring himself; yet
protesting, that he was always set that way, though he
delay'd to profess it, so long as he found his close car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
might advantage their Cause, but now he must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
adjoyn himself to their Society, or prove a <hi>Knave,</hi>
as he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48510:31"/>Hereupon the Marquess (his Majesties Commissioner)
resolving to ask the King's leave to return for <hi>England,</hi>
came first to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> where he found strong
Guards put upon the Castle, and the people much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
by false Reports; <hi>viz.</hi> that his Majesty had made
good nothing at all, which was contained in his <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
at <hi>Edenborough</hi> upon the two and twentieth of
<hi>September</hi> last;<note place="margin">Ib. p. 366.</note> whereupon he caused a Proclamation
<note n="*" place="margin">18 Dec.</note> to be published in his Majesties name, at the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross
there, containing the sum of his whole proceedings
at <hi>Glasgow.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 375.</note> Which being encountered with a blustering
and undutiful <hi>Protestation,</hi> in the name of the general
Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and published at the
same time and place, he return'd into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Faction proceeded to levy Soldiers,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 402.</note> impose
Taxes; and requiring obedience to their Acts, menac'd the
Refusers; raised divers Fortifications in that Kingdom;
block'd up his Majesties Castles and Forts; and took the
Castle of <hi>Edenborough;</hi> procuring their Preachers sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
to teach the People, that there was a Necessity of
bearing Arms against his Majesty under pain of Perjury
and Damnation; and caused such an infamous Ballad
to be sung up and down against the Bishops; as that, in
hatred of them, the people called a Dog with black
and white spots, a Bishop as he went in the Streets.</p>
               <p>Moreover they procured divers Libels to be scattered
in <hi>England,</hi> for justification of their rebellious courses,
and defamation of Ecclesiastical Government; inciting
his Majesties Subjects in this Realm, to attemt the like
Rebellion here: refusing to admit such to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
who had not subscribed their <hi>Covenant;</hi> and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Non-subscribers were Atheists.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 404.</note> Nay one
of them, in his Sermon exhorted the people never to
give over, till they had the King in their power, and then
he should see what good Subjects they were. Others
preach'd, that the <hi>Service-Book</hi> was fram'd at <hi>fome.</hi> These
and many other groundless scandals and falshoods, to
amuse the People, they published in their Pulpits (which
they call'd the <hi>Chairs of truth.)</hi> And to hasten on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Insurrection, endeavoured to perswade them, that
his Majesty intended an Invasion of that Kingdom, and
to make it a Province; as also to despoil them of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48510:32"/>
Laws and Liberties, and to give them new Laws, as if
they were a conquer'd Nation. And having thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the People and fitted themselves with all Provisions
for war,<note place="margin">The Scots put themselves in Arms.</note> they put themselves in Armes, and march'd to
the Frontiers of <hi>England,</hi> pretending they came as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners.</p>
               <p>The King therefore discerning the danger,<note place="margin">The King raised an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whereof he made the Earl of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del General. 27 Martii, 1639.</note> raised a
gallant Army, whereof he made <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi>
his General; and on the seven and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> set forwards towards <hi>Scotland;</hi> having with him the
flower of his English-Nobility and Gentry, whose cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
then to serve him was very great. Yet was the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> at that time his Lieutenant-General, and
the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> General of the Horse (so much was
his Majesty then mistaken in their affections to him, who
did afterwards sufficiently discover themselves) And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
with his Army,<note n="*" place="margin">28 Maii, at the Birks.</note> encamp'd four miles West from
<hi>Barwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What correspondence was then held, betwixt the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and divers of the great ones, then in his Majesties Camp
(considering also who were of his Bed-chamber) may
easily be guest by the consequences. Certain it is, that
divers of them grew cool in the business: so that, after
the <hi>Scots</hi> had,<note place="margin">The King's Declaration, since the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification in the Camp near Barwick. p. 3. &amp; 4.</note> by a formal Petition expressed; <hi>that they
falling down at his Majesties feet, did most humbly suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him, to appoint some of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to hear
by some of them, their humble desires:</hi> his Majesty assented
thereunto; and after several meetings thereupon, and
their demands presented in writing, professed; <hi>that it was
their greif that his Majesty had been provoked to wrath against
them, his most humble and loving Subjects: and that it
should be their delight, upon his gracious assurance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> to give example to
all others, of all civil and temporal obedience, which could be
required of loyal Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which his Majesty answered, that if their desires
were only the enjoying of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi>
according to the Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws of his
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> he did not only agree to the
same, but should always protect them to the utmost of
his power; they yielding him in the mean time, such ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and temporal obedience, as could be justly required
of loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48510:32"/>Upon this Petition therefore,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 17.</note> Articles of <hi>Pacification</hi>
were concluded<note n="*" place="margin">17 Junii. Articles of Pacification with the Scots.</note> on at <hi>Barwick;</hi> whereby his Majesty
was contented not only to confirm whatsoever his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
had promised in his name; but that all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
matters, should be determined by the <hi>Assemblies</hi>
of the Kirk. Likewise matters Civil by the Parliament,
and other inferior Judicatories establish'd by Law.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that for setling the distractions of that
Kingdom, he was willing to grant a free general <hi>Assembly,</hi>
to be kept at <hi>Edenborough</hi> the sixth of <hi>August</hi> ensuing;
and after that a Parliament the twentieth of <hi>August;</hi> for
ratifying what should be concluded in the Assembly;
being graciously pleased to declare, that <hi>upon disbanding
of their Forces, dissolving all their pretended Tables; restoring
his Forts, Castles, and Amunition &amp;c. To his good Subjects
their Liberties, Lands, Goods</hi> &amp;c. <hi>detained since the late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
general Assembly; he would recall his Fleet; retire his
Land-forces; and make restitution to them of their Ships, and
Goods arrested</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which Agreement was entertained by them, with so
much outward acceptance; that by the Subscriptions of
the chiefest of them, it was promised, <hi>they would ever, in
all things carry themselves like humble, loyal, and obedient
Subjects.</hi> But, instead of performance of their parts, at
the very publishing<note n="*" place="margin">20 Junii</note> the Articles in their Camp, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
was made, dishonourable to his Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to the further encouraging of the People in
their disobedient and mutinous ways. And at the same
time, they delivered into the hands of some of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nobility, and spread among others, a scandalous
Paper, intituled, <hi>Some conditions of his Majesties Treaty with
his Subjects of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
                  </hi> wherein were contained such
untruths and seditious positions, and so contrary to what
was concluded in the Articles of Pacification; that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they pretended a desire of peace, yet they intended
nothing less; and instead of disbanding their Forces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
forty eight hours, after publication of those Articles;
they kept great parts of them together, and held in pay
almost all their Officers; continuing their unlawful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and conventicles, to the great vexation and trouble
of all such his Majesties good Subjects, as did not adhere
to their rebellious <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Act of the pretended
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48510:33"/>
                  <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasgow</hi> keeping up all their Fortifications.
Yea such was the fury of the People (animated by that
<hi>Protestation,</hi> with divers scandalous Papers, and seditious
Sermons) that they deterred his Majesties good Subjects,
from going to their dwellings; threatning them with
loss of their lives, if they repaired to their own Houses;
labouring also to pervert them in the choice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
for the general <hi>Assembly</hi> appointed; by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
their voices, in making them swear to, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the approbation of the same <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Glasgow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 17.</note>
and Acts thereof; deterring others from repairing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
So that, by these new disorders, the peace and
quiet of his Subjects, was greatly disturbed (great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
being offer'd to the Earl of <hi>Kinnowl,</hi> his Majesties
high Treasurer; as also to Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> Justice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general,
and other his Majesties Councellors and good
Subjects) so that the King sorbore to come to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;</hi>
such of his Loyal Subjects as attended his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and adhered to him, being branded by them with
the vile aspersion of <hi>Traitors to God and their Country,</hi> and
threatned to be proceeded against with censures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
And lastly, shaking off all respect due to sacred
Majesty, protested, that <hi>all members of the Colleges of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Leiges, were not to attend the Session; and that all
Acts, Decrees, and Sentences therein past against any of them,
should be null,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 19.</note> void and ineffectual;</hi> contrary to the King's
express Warrant for the down-sitting thereof, and the
heavy damage of his good Subjects, who were thereby
frustrated of Justice.</p>
               <p>And having laid these insolent and seditious founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for a Parliament,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 20</note> it could not be expected, but
that the structure must be full of confusion (as indeed
it proved) their Actions, and demands favouring of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but undutifulness and disloyalty: for they stuck
not to deny to his Majesty the most essential, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Prerogatives of his Crown; striving by all means
to change and alter the constitutions of the Parliament,
and frame of Government. Likewise to restrain his
power in point of coinage, custody of Castles, grants
of Honour, and Commissions-Justiciary, or Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
               <p>And his Majesty by his Commission,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Julii.</note> having allow'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48510:33"/>
them the liberty of convening and meeting, until a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
day, for distributing of their pretended charges, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
such as should willingly condescend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
they did not only, without Warrant, continue
their Conventicles and Tables, since that Commission
expired,<note n="*" place="margin">20 Julii.</note> contrary to the positive Laws of that Kingdom,
the Act of Pacification, and their own acknowledgment
in petitioning for the aforesaid Commission; but urged,
that <hi>all those his good Subjects, who adhered to him in defence
of his Royal authority, against their rebellious commotions,
should be made equal</hi> (if not more liable) <hi>to the defraying
of their pretended charges.</hi> Which might imply his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
countenance and justification of all their Rebellions
and Treasons.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King therefore discerning their persistance in such

evidently appear unto him, that their aim was not now for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which Prorogation, they continued

<note n="*" place="margin">Earl of Dumferme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn.</note> over into this Kingdom, to make <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of their

acquainting him with those Insolencies; also by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

                  <hi>protested against
this Act of</hi> Prorogation; <hi>and declared,</hi> that the same was
contrary to the Constitutions and practise of all precedent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
contrary to the liberties of that Kingdom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Articles of the late Pacification; and that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48510:34"/>
it was ineffectual and of no force to hinder their proceedings;
professing, that it was never their intention to deny his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
any part of that civil and temporal obedience, which is
due to all Kings from their Subjects, and from them to their

by his late Majesty (of blessed memory) as a proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and most nearly

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48510:34"/>
from those Sparks the ensuing flames arose; which from
and after that time continued burning, for the space of
many years, until they had overspread, and much wasted
the cheif parts of this great Isle: to make the Bishops of
both Kingdoms odious, there are not a few, who either
out of malice to their sacred function, or ignorance as
to matter of fact, have imputed the original of all this
mischeif unto them, as the first Authors or procurers of
that Book, which they would have believed to be the
first rise thereof.</p>
               <p>To the end therefore, that those reverend persons
(soon after ruin'd, and since dead) may be fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
from being primarily instrumental therein (though
had they so been, no person of upright judgment could
justly have blamed them from endeavouring an unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in the service of God in both Kingdoms.) I shall
desire my Reader to cast his eye upon that faithful <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The King's Declaration printed at Lond. 1639.</note> written by the command of our late Soveraign
King <hi>Charles</hi> the first (and corrected throughout with
his own hand, as many yet living can testify;) whereby
he will clearly discern; that <hi>the then Lords of the Privy-Council
of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  </hi> were the men, who advised the King
to commend a <hi>Service-Book,</hi> to be received and used in
all the Churches of that Realm, of which there was
no little want, every man being left to his own giddy
fancy.</p>
               <p>Now, whether this advice of those Lords was not
with purpose to trepan his Majesty to do that; which
(as they resolv'd to order the business) should occasion
a tumultuous Insurrection by the rabble, whence their
grand Design of raising a general flame of war might
ensue, let the Reader judge,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 8.</note> when he looks back upon
their discontents upon his Majesties Revocation of such
things as had been passed away, in prejudice of that
Crown, especially by some of his Progenitors in their
minorities (though not without advice of those who were
then his Privy-Councellors in that Realm) as hath been
already observed. And withall consider what combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were driven on divers years before, betwixt the
most considerable persons of the Puritan-party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Grand-Contrivers there; Mr. <hi>Knightley's</hi>
house in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> being the chief place, where
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48510:35"/>
that restless faction had their frequent meetings: <q>whence
<note n="*" place="margin">Sir Henry Vane junior.</note> a Gentleman<note n="*" place="margin">Preface to the Memoires of the lives of James and William D. of Hamilton. Impr. Lond. 1677.</note> of quality was sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a great Parliament-man here:) who residing
there for some time before the troubles broke out,
represented to those which had the chief Interest there,
that the business of the <hi>Ship-money</hi> and <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
with divers other things, whereof there was much
noise made afterwards, had so irritated the greatest part
of the English Nation; that if they made sure work
at home, they needed not to fear any thing from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover how earnestly and eagerly, after that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
at <hi>Edenborough</hi> was so raised, all sorts of people
took advantage thereof; the Kirkmen laying about them
in their Pulpits, so that the Citizens, Gentry and Nobles
speedily put themselves in Armes; entring into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Confederacy, called <hi>the Covenant.</hi> And lastly,
that when his Majesty most gratiously offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
the <hi>Service-Book</hi> (which was the great business at
which they seem'd to take offence) they were no whit
lenified. It will be visible enough to any person of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who doth not wilfully shut his Eyes, that the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Rebellion, was of a much elder date than
that <hi>Service-Book.</hi>

Parliament here. But, no sooner were
Writs out for that purpose, than that the
Schismatical Party used all possible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to strengthen their side, by choosing of their own
faction, for Knights and Burgesses. And to accomplish
the same, spared for no pains in packing of Voices, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48510:35"/>
making parties (wherein their Seditious Pulpit-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir'd
themselves to purpose:)<note place="margin">1640.</note> such being then their fury,
that those meetings for Elections appeared more like
riotous tumults, than orderly conventions: nevertheless,
the Nation was not then so generally tainted, but that
many good men were chosen.</p>
               <p>Which Parliament<note place="margin">An. 1640. 13 Apr. The Short Parliament call'd.</note> began at <hi>Westminster</hi> upon the
thirteenth day of <hi>April;</hi> wherein his Majesty declared to
both Houses the indignities receiv'd from his <hi>Scotish</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and to suppress their Rebellion, proposed a Supply
of twelve Subsidies; in lieu whereof he was content to
forbear <hi>Ship-money,</hi> than which nothing seem'd so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
               <p>Had not that Parliament been broke by the subtile
artifices of the Grand-Contrivers in the immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
no doubt but all those miseries, which were
thereby soon after brought upon this Realm, might have
been easily prevented: and that the breach thereof was
wrought by them, is plain enough. For Sir <hi>Henry Vane
Senior,</hi> a member of the House of Commons at that
time (and one of his Majesties principal Secretaries of
State) having by the King's appointment, moved for a
Supply of twelve Subsidies; yet with power to stoop to
eight: when he saw an inclination in the House tending
thereto (first by a Proposal of four, then five, nay six
were mention'd, and the motion not dislik'd) told them
peremptorily; that <hi>it was in vain for them to think of less
than twelve, in regard he knew, under that number would not
be accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, having by that sinister dealing kept such distance
betwixt his Majesty and his good Subjects, was by some
other of the faction so seconded, with a hideous repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of their Grievances, together with dangerous
Innovations in Religion, and fears of introducing Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition;
besides certain motions as did (not without cause)
put strange apprehensions in the Queen of peril to her
person (or at least some others very near unto her) that
his Majesty was constrain'd to dissolve that Parliament.<note place="margin">The Short Parliament dissolved. 5 Maii.</note>
And taking consideration of the <hi>Scots</hi> rebellious Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
which every day increased, proposed the business of
money to his Privy-Council, who contributed a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
sum to his aid; his domestic-Servants and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48510:36"/>
making good addition thereto. The Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> speedily hasting into
that Kingdom; where he call'd a Parliament, raised an
Army of eight thousand men, with money to maintain
them, and within the space of six weeks return'd into
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the meeting of these Members of Parliament
from all parts of the Realm (being many of them men
of turbulent Spirits, and principles totally Antimonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical)
gave opportunity for those contrivances which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
were put in Action, there is nothing more sure.
For in the first place, they took care to infuse <hi>Fears</hi> and
<hi>Iealousies</hi> into the people every where, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was then design'd to be <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and Popery like
to be introduced: to promote which Scandals many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Preachers took no small pains in their Pulpits;
especially in and about <hi>London.</hi> Whereupon several tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
meetings were made in divers parts of the Suburbs;
and a Paper set up in the night, at the old Exchange, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating
the Apprentices to sack <hi>Lambeth <hi>House.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 Maii.</note> Which

<note n="*" place="margin">11 Maii.</note> with above five hundred of the rascal multitude,
and an attemt made thereon, though without success;
some of them being taken and imprisoned in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here they rested not; for within a few nights after,
they broke open the <hi>White-Lion,</hi> and <hi>King's-bench</hi> Prisons,
and let out their fellows.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> also,<note place="margin">11 Julii. Ad. 38.</note> having made such preparations for a
second Rebellion, continued likewise their Parliament,
according to the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> (as their phrase was)
having enacted a Band, to be subscribed by all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first of <hi>September,</hi> to maintain it to be a free and
lawful Parliament: whereupon they form'd another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
and knowing certainly what store of well-wishers
they had in this Kingdom: as also how easy the work
was like to be made, through the subtile contrivances of
the factious party here, from whom they were sufficiently
instructed and animated by private Invitations and large
promises; invaded this Realm, passing<note n="*" place="margin">17. Aug. The first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of the Scots.</note> the <hi>Twede</hi> at

               </p>
               <p>But the King being slow to believe what they designed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48510:36"/>
was not so forward as to encounter them upon the
Borders; his Army (which he rais'd that Summer) lying,
at that time about <hi>New-Castle,</hi> of which the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
was made General; who (alledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be then ill in health) staid in <hi>London.</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
therefore having certain advertisement, that the
<hi>Scots</hi> were ready to enter <hi>Northumberland,</hi> intended to
have made the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> General; who declin'd
it, out of an honoured respect to the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland:</hi>
but, being much pressed, in regard of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion, desired to serve, as Lieutenant general
under him, and had his Commission<note n="*" place="margin">18 Aug.</note> accordingly.</p>
               <p>On Thursday the twentieth of <hi>Aug.</hi> the King set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
from <hi>London,</hi> towards the North, and on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (having in that
short time fitted himself for his journey) posted from
<hi>London</hi> by Coaches; and arriving at <hi>York</hi> the Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after (though then much troubled with the Stone)
rode to Topcliffe on Fryday.<note n="*" place="margin">28 Aug.</note>
               </p>
               <p>At that time the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> was General of the
Horse, and at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> with the Army. Where, by
reason of the General's and Lieutenant-General's absence
he had the cheif command thereof: but made such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
resistance, that the Scots forc'd their passage over
the River of <hi>Tine</hi> at <hi>Newburne,</hi> that very Friday, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Newcastle</hi> without opposition; himself then retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Army towards <hi>York,</hi> and in some confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>And now that the Scots had thus possess'd themselves of
<hi>Newcastle,</hi> they began to strengthen that place, and bring
all those Northern-parts under contribution. Which
strange passages made most men amazed; scarce any
man knowing whom to trust or speak freely to. Much
labour (indeed) there was, to make the people believe,
that all this did work for their good, and that the <hi>Scots</hi>
were their surest friends; <hi>this</hi> being the certain way
to have a Parliament, and <hi>that</hi> the undoubted cure of
all things amiss, both in Church and State. And (truly)
such a burthen was <hi>Ship-money</hi> then esteem'd to be, and
some few other extraordinary Impositions (so wanton
were many grown, being surfeited with that plenty
which long peace had produc'd) that the <hi>Scots</hi> then
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48510:37"/>
had, not a few well-wishers in all parts of this Realm,
their piety and goodness being so cried up by the whole
<hi>Puritan</hi>-party.</p>
               <p>His Majesty therefore in this difficult Labyrinth, took
resolution to summon a meeting of the Peers at <hi>York</hi>
(a course which had anciently been used;<note place="margin">A grand Council of the Peers at York. 24 Sept.</note> especially
when exigencies were so great, that the Convention of
a Parliament could not be staid for); and at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this grand Council, represented to them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
danger of this Invasion; with desire of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
touching the maintenance of his Army, as not
safe to be disbanded, whilst the <hi>Scotish</hi>-Forces were
on foot: as also what course was fittest to be taken
to get them out. Whereupon, without long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
a Treaty was determin'd on, and for that end
sixteen of the Lords then present, were assign'd on the
King's part, to meet with Eleven of the <hi>Scots;</hi> with
power to compose and conclude all differences.</p>
               <p>Whereunto the <hi>Scots</hi> assented; upon condition, that
the King should first revoke his <hi>Proclamation,</hi> whereby
he had declared them Traitors.

desiring, that care might be speedily taken for

went slowly on with what his Majesty had proposed to
them: for the busy-party (who were the great Actors in
the ensuing Tragedy) then fell to contrivance about the
accomplishment of their long desired work. To which
purpose the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Rippon</hi> was soon after remov'd to
<hi>Westminster;</hi> to the end, that there they might have the

the first step they made, was the entertaining<note n="*" place="margin">9 Nov.</note> 
                  <hi>Petitions of
Grievances</hi> from all parts of the Realm; which made such
a noise, as if the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> had suffered under
the greatest slavery and oppression, that had ever been
heard of: and (being devised and framed by themselves)
were receiv'd with such great acceptance, as that the

<note n="*" place="margin">11 Febr.</note> Justice <hi>Berkley</hi> of High Treason, for his activeness in the
business of <hi>Ship-money.</hi> And to try how safely they
might adventure to strike at the establish'd Government

                  <hi>Pryn, Burton,</hi> and
<hi>Bastwick</hi> in triumph to <hi>London</hi> (who had been censured
in the Star-Chamber, for Libels against the Hierarchy)
countenancing a Petition, exhibited<note n="*" place="margin">11 Dec.</note> to them by Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Penington,</hi> against <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Church-Discipline.</hi>
Yet, that there might be no doubt of their zeal, and

his Majesty to desire leave that they might advance and
settle his Revenue; offering<note n="*" place="margin">16 Dec.</note> to make him the richest
King in Christendom.</p>
               <p>And having thus gain'd a strong confidence with the
people, what blessed Patriots they were like to be; that
they might also seem as zealous for God's cause, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
a Remonstrance<note n="*" place="margin">29 Jan.</note> (in the name of both Houses)
to his Majesty, grounded upon divers Petitions (which
they had subtilly procured from all parts of the Realm)
of the increase of Popery. Also, that the danger thereof
might the more amaze the world, they then began
to open their Cabinet of <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies;</hi> four
of the House of Commons imparting to the Lords, a
a discovery<note n="*" place="margin">10 Febr.</note> of an horrid design by many thousands of
Papists, in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, because of the great complaint of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in Religion, increase of Popery, and growth of
Superstition, they appointed<note n="*" place="margin">11 Febr.</note> Commissioners for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
Rails from about all <hi>Communion-Tables</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48510:39"/>Likewise,<note place="margin">1641.</note> to the end that the Bishops might the better
attend their Spiritual functions, they voted,<note n="*" place="margin">10. Martii.</note> that none
of them should have voice in Parliament, nor meddle in
temporal affairs. And to assure the <hi>Scots,</hi> whose Army
they, as yet, thought not fit to part with, till their work
was brought to more maturity, they gave<note n="*" place="margin">2. Febr.</note> them three
hundred thousand pounds, towards a supply of their
losses and Necessities. Which signal favour got them
the stile of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and thanks from the <hi>Scotish</hi>-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners;
who seem'd so tender of our good, that they
desired<note n="*" place="margin">16. Martii.</note> the Treaty might be accelerated, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
eased of the burthen of the two Armies, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home.</p>
               <p>The next thing wherewith they went in hand,<note place="margin">Tryal of the E. of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> was the
Trial of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> (for 'twas resolv'd he must
be cut off, being a person of such integrity to the King,
and known abilities.) To which purpose, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<hi>Westminster</hi> Hall with Scaffolds, they began<note n="*" place="margin">22. Martii.</note> his
trial upon the two and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> where they
charg'd<note n="*" place="margin">23. Martii. An. 1641.</note> him with subverting the Fundamental Laws of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> with threatning<note n="*" place="margin">3. Apr.</note> to root the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Nation out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> with procuring<note n="*" place="margin">5. Apr.</note> his

<note n="*" place="margin">7. Apr.</note> 
                  <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the King's Army to the <hi>Scots</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, after many days labour to prove him guilty of
Treason, by the Law; and failing thereof, they brought
<note n="*" place="margin">19. Apr.</note> in a special Bill, to attaint him; wherein they took
care to insert a special Clause, <hi>that it should not be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
President;</hi> thereby to secure themselves from a return of
that Injustice upon any of them, which they acted on him.
Which Bill was twice read and voted in one day. What
course they took with those that concur'd not with them
in passing thereof, and other their practises, I shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention when I come to their apparent violation of
the <hi>Privileges of Parliament.</hi> How multitudes, out of
the City, were brought down to the Parliament-House,
to cry for Justice: Also with what difficulty his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
passed that Bill (though importun'd by the Earl's
own Letter, out of hope his death might have satisfied
those blood-thirsty men) I spare to mention; but on the
twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> they cut<note n="*" place="margin">12. Maii</note> off his Head on Tower
Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48510:39"/>Which strange and unjust way of proceeding, driven
on by those who stood least affected to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Discipline</hi> of our Church, caused many to fear that which
afterwards came to pass. Left therefore the People
(whom under the most specious pretences they were to
captivate) should have the least suspicion of hazard to
the Service of God, as it stood here establish'd; they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
insinuated to the world, that by means of a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
Party the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> was in no small dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and therefore as zealous Champions for the same,
framed a formal <hi>Protestation</hi> for its sure defence, as it then
stood establish'd in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Discipline;</hi> which for farther satisfaction they
caused to be solemnly taken<note n="*" place="margin">3 Maii</note> by every Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and not only so, but by a special Order made
it public by the Press, and sent it to several Counties of
this Realm.</p>
               <p>But their grand work being to get the <hi>Militia</hi> into
their power, by which means whatever else they had a
mind to, might be accomplish'd, as an Introduction
thereunto,<note place="margin">Pretended Plots and Conspiracies.</note> divers strange <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies</hi> were talk'd
of. Which Plots, not only stood them in stead, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
and put fears into the people, (who by a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
faith, did then believe that all they acted was for
their good) but to countenance those many unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demands they made from his <hi>Majesty;</hi> so that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the shadow of them, they might go through with
any thing. And therefore it will not be amiss to view
by what degrees they themselves, with these devices,
proceeded towards the obtaining those their desired
ends.</p>
               <p>The first of these that they broach'd, was a conspiracy
<note n="*" place="margin">5 Maii.</note> by divers in the House of Commons, to bring in a
<hi>French</hi> Army; unto which the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>English</hi> should
be joyned. Whereupon a vote was passed,<note n="*" place="margin">7 Maii.</note> that new
Fortifications should be rais'd at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> and the
<hi>Cinqueports;</hi> and order taken, that one Lord, and two
of the Commons <hi>(viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Kymbolton,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter
Earle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton)</hi> should be forthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
thither.</p>
               <p>About the same time also they sent<note n="*" place="margin">10 Maii.</note> some of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to <hi>Lambeth-<hi>House,</hi>
                  </hi> to search for Amunition and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48510:40"/>
Arms; as also about the Parliament-House, for fear
of any Plot. Which pretended fear was much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by a Letter directed to the Lady <hi>Shelley</hi> (and
produced<note n="*" place="margin">12 Maii.</note> by Mr. <hi>Pym)</hi> discovering a design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy—</p>
               <p>Then was there a Report<note n="*" place="margin">13 Maii.</note> in the House of what a
Jesuit should say of some great design against this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
As also of a Letter from <hi>Calais</hi> of many French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
coming for <hi>England:</hi> and of another<note n="*" place="margin">14 Maii.</note> Jesuits speech
of firing the Parliament-House. Again of <hi>French</hi> intended
<note n="*" place="margin">17 Maii.</note> to land here. And, within a short space after, Mr.
<hi>Nathaniel Fienes</hi> made report<note n="*" place="margin">17 Junii.</note> to the Houses; that a
Plot to seize the Tower was newly discovered; as also to
send over the Irish Army; and for delivery of <hi>Portsmouth</hi>
to the French and Papists; for assistance wherein the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were to raise a thousand Horse. And shortly after
Mr. <hi>Henry Percie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iermyn,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Sucklyn,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Davenant</hi> were voted<note n="*" place="margin">24 Julii.</note> guilty of another Plot, <hi>to bring
up the Army, and force the Parliament:</hi> which wrought
to purpose, by putting terrible <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> into
the People.</p>
               <p>And to make up all, a Letter<note n="*" place="margin">16 Aug.</note> from the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was read, of new practises against the State. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
at a conference of both Houses, a select Committee
was appointed to advise of putting the Kingdom into a
<hi>Posture of Defence.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Posture of Defence.</note> Which being done, the next artifice
they used was to perpetuate the Parliament; to the end
that the name of that might the more plausibly carry
them through in this grand work. To effect this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they pretended that the great Sums of Money,
which the Scots were to have, could not suddenly be
rais'd; and that being to be borrow'd for their present
riddance, Lenders would hardly be found, unless they
saw a certain way to secure their moneys, which the
danger of dissolving this Parliament would hazard.<note place="margin">Bill for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating the Parliament.</note>
Whereupon they brought<note n="*" place="margin">7 Maii.</note> in a Bill to prevent the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing
or dissolving there of without the consent of
both Houses. And to carry on the people with all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of their future happiness, and freedom from
oppression, by Courts of Arbitrary Jurisdiction, they
voted<note n="*" place="margin">9 Junii.</note> and sent up certain Bills, for suppressing the
Courts of <hi>High Commission,</hi> and <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48510:40"/>
the <hi>Council Table:</hi> as also for bounding the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests;
preventing vexatious proceedings concerning
Knighthood, and regulating the Clerk of the Market;
besides that of Tonnage and Poundage.</p>
               <p>All which his Majesty out of his abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
expecting that these unparallel'd Acts of grace,
would have oblig'd them in a stronger bond of dutiful
Allegiance, was pleased to pass, before his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland.</hi> And, as a witness to the candor of his
intentions, admitted<note n="*" place="margin">Lord Say sworn Master of the Wards 17 Maii.</note> divers Lords, then most popular;
but since great Actors in this woful Tragedy, to be of
his Privy-Council, conferring on three of them great
Offices of Honour, Trust,<note place="margin">Earl of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester made Deputy of Ireland</note> and Benefit.</p>
               <p>And now, supposing that he had given them as great
a measure of content, as their hearts could desire; he
took his journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> on the tenth of <hi>August,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19 Maii Earl of Essex made Lord Chamberlain 29 Julii.</note>
there to establish the peace of that Realm, in setling
whatsoever should be thought meet for the happiness
thereof.<note place="margin">Oliver St. John made Sollicitor General. The King went into Scotland.</note> About which time the Armies were disbanded,
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Aug.</note> that had been so long delay'd, though the continuance
of them was no less charge than 80000 <hi>l.</hi> a month;
their work before being not brought forward enough:
Some of the leading-members<note n="*" place="margin">Will. Strode.</note>, in plain terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring;
that <hi>yet they could not spare them, the sons of</hi>
Zerviah <hi>being too strong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no sooner was the King gone, than that the
turbulent Spirits in the House of Commons set to
work, in framing a bitter <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the general
Grievances of the Kingdom, to make his Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
seem odious to his Subjects; which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<note n="*" place="margin">12 Aug.</note> to be brought into the House. Whereupon
grew great debates and disputes, which lasted from three
of the clock afternoon, the whole night following, and
till ten of the Clock on the morrow. But, at length,
many, who disliked and opposed it; partly by reason of
their age, of infirmity of Body, being wearied out,
and departing; others through sloth or timorousness
leaving the House, it was voted by some few voices;
divers of the factious party being fetcht out of their
Beds to assist.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Remonstrance</hi> being a compendium of all the
mistakes and misfortunes,<note place="margin">The grand. Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance.</note> that had hapned since the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48510:41"/>
beginning of his Majesties reign to that hour; objected
to him the Actions of some, and the Thoughts of others;
reproacht him with such things of which he never
knew, and reviled him to his people; complained also
of the House of Peers, and ascribed all the Acts of
Grace already passed in that Parliament, to their own
wisdom in procuring; with intimation of their despair
in setling the distractions of the Kingdom, by reason
of the power of a <hi>malignant-party,</hi> and want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
by the House of Peers, wherein so many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and malignant Lords then sat.</p>
               <p>This being done, their next work was to get the
whole command of the <hi>Militia;</hi> which being had,
nothing afterwards could be difficult to them. For
the better effecting thereof, they therefore had again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to those shadows of Conspiracies and Plots, which
had stood them in good stead before. The first<note n="*" place="margin">19 Oct.</note> of
them being a new pretended Treason by the Earl of
<hi>Craford</hi> and others, against the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
then in Scotland, and other Peers of that Realm; this
being signified by Letters from their Committee in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
dated 14 <hi>Oct.</hi> Whereupon, that the like here
might be prevented, orders were directed to the Sheriffs
of <hi>London, Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> for setling strong
Guards of armed-men in places of moment.</p>
               <p>Likewise the whole Trayned-Band of <hi>Westminster</hi> was
brought into the Palace-Yard, on the morrow; and there
attended all that day; giving this reason for that order;
<hi>viz. Because the mischeivous designs and conspiracies lately
discovered in <hi>Scotland,</hi> against some principal and great men
there, by some of the Popish-faction, gives just occasion to suspect,
that they may maintain correspondency here, and practise the
like in this Realm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the same Trayn-Band of <hi>Westminster</hi>
was brought<note n="*" place="margin">20 Oct.</note> into the Palace-Yard on the morrow, and
attended all that day until the Houses rose. And the
next day following Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> made a large Speech,<note n="*" place="margin">31 Oct. Alderman Penington and others, made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Preaching Ministers. 19 Dec. A. 1640.</note> at

                  </note> given out in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to extirpate their Religion and
Nation: as also, that Orders were
made by the Houses of Parliament
in <hi>England,</hi> incroaching upon their
priviledges of Parliament in <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and that their Committee, after nine
months attendance on his Majesty
(who was graciously pleased to hear
their grievances) being referr'd to
the Houses of Parliament here (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his departure from <hi>London</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Scotland 10 Aug.</hi> 1641) was constrain'd to return
without any redress, through the prevalency of some
leading Members; who before had (all they could) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted
to his Majesty the proceedings and Actions
of the Parliament in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was therefore not a little fear'd by some, that
those provocations were purposely exercised to exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the <hi>Irish</hi> to take up Arms; that so, under colour
of suppressing them as Rebels, they might be utterly
destroyed and eradicated. Nor was it without suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
by others, considering how eagerly that Act for
confiscation of their Lands was prosecuted by those
Members at <hi>Westminiter</hi> at the very beginning of that
Insurrection: Also how his Majesties going over in

in probability might have quencht that flame.) More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48510:42"/>
how they ingrossed that war into their own hands,
thereby to have the power to employ any forces raised
or levied for it, to assist in pursuance of their design
upon this Kingdom, as they should see cause, as was
evident<note n="*" place="margin">See his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Answer to the two Papers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, printed with the full and perfect Narrative of the Treaty at Uxbridge. p. 212.</note> by those under the command of the Lord
<hi>Wharton</hi> and others, which were in the Battel of <hi>Kineton</hi>

to any peace or cessation with them, though never so
necessary, as appears by those earnest and bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements<note n="*" place="margin">See the full Relation of the Treaty at Uxbridge. p. 133. &amp; 136.</note> used by their Commissioners in the Treaty
at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> for the prosecution of that war.</p>
               <p>It is likewise farther to be noted, that these high
provocations, met with a concurrent opportunity of
those eight thousand disbanded <hi>Irish,</hi> not permitted to be
transported into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other parts, though desired by
that King's Ambassador, and assented to by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;)
who, being out of employment, were ready for
any desperate enterprize: As also with the want of a
Lieutenant in that Kingdom, by reason that the Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> was so cut off, who had kept them in such
exact obedience.</p>
               <p>And lastly, what an Example they had from their
Neighbours the Scots, who sped so well by their own
Insurrection; that they, not only obtained their full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
even to the introducing a new Religion, and new
moulding the whole form of their Government, both
in Church and State: but when they rebelliously inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>England</hi> with an Army, were treated as good
Subjects, had three hundred thousand Pounds given them,
with an Act of Pacification and Oblivion to boot.</p>

their Counsail and assistance for the extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

there nor the King's importunity here could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to levy one man towards the suppression of
those Rebels, till the King had disclaimed his power of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48510:43"/>
pressing Souldiers by an Act of Parliament, and thereby
laid himself open to such acts of violence as were then
hammering against him. Which having done, they

the Northern parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> delivering up into
their hands the strong Town and Port of <hi>Carick-Fergus,</hi>
one of the chief Keys of that Kingdom; and afterwards
sent a small Body of English to preserve the South.
Which English Forces, having done notable service
there against the Rebels, were kept so short, both in
respect of pay and other necessaries, by the Houses of
Parliament (who had made use of the money rais'd for
the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> to maintain a war against their
King) that they were forced to come to a <hi>Cessation,</hi> and

the House. Against the passing and publishing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
many worthy Gentlemen freely express'd their minds:
Nevertheless, after long dispute and much ado, the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
party prevailed; partly by tyring out some (for they
sate up all night) and partly by promises or threats to
others; insomuch as it was carried by Eleven voices. So
that, though there was the greatest shew of gladness by
the Citizens of this his Majesties arrival; as that solemn
reception<note n="*" place="margin">25 Nov. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Scotland.</note> of him by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen on
Horsback, did import, who feasted him with the Queen
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48510:44"/>
and Prince at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> the Companies all standing
in their Liveries, to congratulate his safe coming home,
as he rode through the streets; yet had he little joy
thereof: for instead of that happy progress which he
expected that the Parliament had made in the great
affairs of the Kingdom, during his absence; he found
the people not a little disturb'd with strange appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions;
and Guards set upon the Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which so astonish'd him, that he forthwith sent
<note n="*" place="margin">26 Nov.</note> to the Lords, desiring, that for the prevention of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
jealousies and fears, the Train'd-Bands might be
discharged.</p>
               <p>But no sooner did those Citizens take notice of that
Message, then that great numbers of them, in person,
offer'd<note n="*" place="margin">27 Nov.</note> to attend the House of Parliament in their
Arms. Nay so forward thenceforth were they upon
all occasions to act their parts, for hast'ning that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
confusion, which soon after ensued; that on<note n="*" place="margin">29 Nov.</note> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following, a multitude of them made a hubbub
in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> crying, <hi>Down with Antichrist and the
Bishops;</hi> adding, that <hi>if they could not then be heard, they
would have a greater number next day to back them.</hi> And
so they had;<note place="margin">30 Nov. 1 Dec.</note> many of them coming tumultuously to
the doors of the Parliament House, crying <hi>No Bishops,</hi>
and calling them <hi>the limbs of Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, on the same day, to accompany so good a
work, they presented to the King by the hands of the
Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> their <hi>grand Remonstrance</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Exact. Coll. p. 22.</note> of the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Kingdom (which had been ordered to
be brought into the House the twelfth of <hi>August</hi> past)
thereby to blast all those gracious condescentions which
they had obtained from him before. Whereunto his
Majesty soon after made a full and clear Answer; and
publish'd his Royal <hi>Declaration</hi> thereupon, for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of all his good Subjects, to the end they might
not be deluded by those undutiful, false, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
aspersions cast upon his Government by that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Libel.</p>
               <p>And soon after, for the better prevention of any
more such dangerous tumults and uproars, at or near
the Houses of Parliament, he directed his special Writ,
according to the Statute, unto the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48510:44"/>
to place a Guard at <hi>Westminster.</hi> But the House of
Commons deeming this Guard, thus legally placed by
the King, no way conducing to their Design, presently
voted it to be a breach of their priviledges, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of an high nature; and thereupon, not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that the said Watch should be discharg'd; but
that the Justices of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> for their obedience to
his Majesties commands herein, should be question'd;
whereupon Justice <hi>Long</hi> was committed<note n="*" place="margin">11 Dec.</note> to the
Tower.</p>
               <p>That there was a most factious party in the City of
<hi>London,</hi> which were great Instruments in raising the
ensuing Rebellion, is plain enough. Nor is it less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that they acted their parts therein, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> by outing all the <hi>Common-Council,</hi>
which were men of worth, and bringing men
of desperate fortunes in their rooms. Wherein they
had such furtherance, by the help of the multitude (who
aim'd at their own advantage by any change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that they then introduced <hi>Fowkes—, Ryley</hi>
the Boddies-maker, <hi>Perkins</hi> the Lord <hi>Say</hi>'s Taylor, <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington</hi>
the Cutler, <hi>Mills</hi> the Brick-layer, and divers
other such mean fellows; instead of Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Clarke,</hi> Sir <hi>George Bynion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roger Gardner,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other worthy Citizens, whose loyalty, they well
knew, could not be corrupted. These being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
agents in all the Tumults; which stood them in
much stead for accomplishing of their chiefest aims.
And therefore plain it was to be seen what design they
had, when they urged the passing of the Bill for not
<hi>Adjourning</hi> or <hi>Dissolving</hi> of that Parliament without
their own consents, having such a party in the City
to back them upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>Having thus dissolv'd the Guard, so appointed
by his Majesty, there came<note n="*" place="margin">15 Dec.</note> another Tumult of
the Citizens to <hi>Westminster.</hi> Whereupon some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House of Commons, making complaint of
the danger, whereunto they were subject by those rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
people; and how that already they had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
and evil intreated by them, at the very door of
the House; desired, that some course might be taken,
for restraining and punishing them for the same. But
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48510:45"/>
instead thereof, divers spoke in justification of them,
and commended their affections; saying, <hi>they must not
discourage their friends, this being a time to make use of
them all.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> added<note n="*" place="margin">Exact. Coll. p. 532.</note>, <hi>God forbid, that
the House of Commons should proceed in any sort to
dishearten the people, for obtaining their just desires in such
a way.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">19 Dec.</note> And accordingly, there was a paper delivered by
some or other, to the Minister that preach'd at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi>
the Sunday following; desiring, that Prayer
might be made to God to assist the Apprentices with
strength to root out Superstition, and to extirpate the
Innovations of the Bishops and Clergy.</p>
               <p>After which matters were every day carried with a
more high hand than before; the Tumultuous people
having as apparent countenance from the House, as
before they had private encouragement. Insomuch as
the Lord Mayor of London came<note n="*" place="margin">26 Dec.</note> to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and
acquainted the King, that he discerned, if Sir <hi>Thomas
Lunsford,</hi> whom he had newly made Lieutenant of the
Tower, were not removed, the Apprentices would rise
and pull him out. So that his Majesty to prevent such
an insurrection, took the Keys from Sir <hi>Thomas Luns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and constituted Sir <hi>Thomas Byron</hi> in his room; with
whom the factious Spirits were as ill satisfied, tho they
knew not well what to object against him; till at last
Lieutenant <hi>Hooker,</hi> the <hi>Aquavitae-man,</hi> and <hi>Nicholson</hi> the
Chandler, complained in the Common-Council; that
since Sir <hi>Iohn Byron</hi> came to be Lieutenant of the Tower,
the Mint (to the great prejudice and dishonour of the
Kingdom) stood still.</p>
               <p>Yea, so insolent were these tumultuous people grown;
that upon the Kings <hi>Proclamation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">27 Dec.</note>, grounded upon a
Penal Law, to dissipate them; in contempt thereof they
came<note n="*" place="margin">28 Dec.</note> early the next morning in greater numbers than
ever, divers of them being arm'd with Swords and
Halberts; and towards the evening assaulted the great
Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> threatning to pull it down: So
that the Bishops thenceforth thought it not safe for
themselves to come any more to the House. The News
whereof so pleased those unruly people; that on the
morrow they came again<note n="*" place="margin">29 Dec.</note>, crying <hi>No Bishops,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
another <hi>Proclamation</hi> issued out by the King
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48510:45"/>
to restrain them. And in their return making a stand
before <hi>Whitehall,</hi> said<note n="*" place="margin">Exact. Coll. p. 533.</note>, that <hi>they would have no more
Porter's Lodge there, but would speak with the King when
they pleased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which rebellious uproar caused his Majesty forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to place a Guard, for his own safety, at the Court-gates.
But the main cry of danger was by the House
of Commons, as if they themselves had been the only
men in peril of their lives; and therefore to make the
greater shew of their own fears, they order'd<note n="*" place="margin">31 Dec.</note>, that
Halberts should be brought into their House, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Members; and then they made a noise of
new discoveries of farther dangerous conspiracies; one
by a Letter<note n="*" place="margin">31 Dec.</note> from <hi>France,</hi> intimating great intelligence
held betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and no small likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of dreadful plots in agitation against this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Also of another Letter, at the same time, found
in a Jesuit's Study, of great troubles which should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
this Realm. And, the more to amuse the people,
they adjourn'd to sit in a Committee at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> to
draw up a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the many dangers this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had undergone, within the space of three years.
Where being met, another Letter (pretended to be
brought from <hi>Italy</hi>) was read, discovering divers Plots
by the Papists here. Whereupon they consider'd about
drawing up of another <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jan.</note>, laying open the
peril of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet; the coming over of the <hi>Queen-Mother;</hi>
the <hi>Pope's Nuncio;</hi> as also several other Plots
in agitation by the Jesuits and a Romish-party.</p>
               <p>Which subtil practices being set on foot by some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons of both Houses, through whose influence,
chiefly, others were guided; caused his Majesty out of
a desire to prevent the ensuing calamities, which he
clearly foresaw, must by these means inevitably follow,
to demand<note place="margin">4 Jan. See the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles against them. Exact. Coll. p. 34.</note> the persons of the Lord <hi>Kymbolton,</hi> and five

and <hi>William Strode</hi> Esquiers, and to charge them with
High Treason; who having private notice thereof, kept
out of the way.</p>
               <p>But of this action they made such an advantage (tho
no person then came within the doors of the House,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48510:46"/>
except the King himself, and the Count Palatine, his
Nephew) having so sure a party in the City to assist
them; that some of the House of Commons took the
boldness, the same day to come and discharge his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

themselves, and to sit in a grand Committee at
<hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Where infusing fears into the
people, that the King had a design of actual violence
upon the City, the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> refused to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
his Majesties Proclamation for apprehending those
persons.</p>
               <p>And to make farther experiment of the City's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to afford them their best assistance, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
they caused a false Alarm<note n="*" place="margin">8 Jan.</note>, that the King, with
fifteen hundred Horse, was coming in the night to
surprize <hi>London.</hi> Which report wrought so effectually,
that no less than forty thousand of the inhabitants put
themselves in Arms, at an instant; the women also
providing scalding water to throw upon the Cavaliers,
bringing out Forms, Stools, and empty Tubs into the

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48510:46"/>And what intention some of them had to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King, had he then been at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> may
easily be guessed, by their rude and desperate entrance
thereinto then made; had not he (upon private adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
of their purpose) removed to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
the precedent Evening.</p>
               <p>Unto which Insurrection, to give the fairer counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
they had by their Emissaries sent into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Buckingham, Hartford,</hi> and <hi>Kent;</hi> whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
no small numbers; which came the same day
to the Houses of Parliament with petitions ready fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
on the behalf of the Lord <hi>Kymbolton,</hi> and the
five Members. At which time they produced two
Letters, pretended to come from a <hi>Romish</hi> hand, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
much mischief design'd against the Houses and
City.</p>
               <p>And that these Countrymen might upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home, put their neighbours into strange appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of danger; there was at that time<note n="*" place="margin">12 Jan.</note> a report
made in the House, that the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Lunsford,</hi> were about <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> with three
or four hnndred Horse. Whereupon order was given,
that the Sheriffs of <hi>Surrey, Berkshire,</hi> and <hi>Hantshire</hi> should
raise the <hi>Posse Comitatus</hi> of those Counties, to stand upon
their Guard, and apprehend them; as also, that <hi>Skippon,</hi>
Serjeant-Major of the City Trained-Bands, should forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
have the command of certain Guards for to be
set upon the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing more certain, then that this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
concerning the Lord <hi>Kymbolton</hi> and the five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(as 'twas managed) much promoted their grand
design. For having by their many pretended plots,
and other devices, prepared the people with strange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of fears; and finding that they had won
the Country, as well as the City, to an implicite belief
of their being such blessed Patriots as never had been

design against the King and Parliament; and that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

               <p>
                  <hi>The King therefore, standing not a little amazed at
these many and great distractions, which threatned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
mischief to the whole Realm; tho he had, by
a Message<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 49.</note> to both Houses, of the twelfth of Ianuary,
for full satisfaction to all that might doubt, that his
accusation of those Members was not agreeable to the
priviledges of Parliament; nevertheless intimated, that</hi>
he would for the present wave his proceedings against them;
and that when the minds of men were more composed, he
would go on in an unquestionable way: assuring his parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that upon all occasions he would be as careful of their
Priviledges, as of his Life and Crown. <hi>And by another
Message</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>two days after, farther assur'd them, that</hi> in
case any doubt of his breach of their Priviledges did remain;
he would be willing to clear it, and assure those, by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
way, that his Parliament should advise him to do.
<hi>Likewise, in farther manifestation of his earnest and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
desires, for preventing those calamities which
he then saw approaching, by reason of these distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he did by a gracious Message</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 54.</note>, <hi>of the twentieth
of the same month, propose to both Houses, that</hi> they
would with all speed, fall into a serious consideration of those
particulars which they themselves should hold necessary, as
well for the upholding, and maintaining his just Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and setling his Revenue; as for the present and future
establishment of their priviledges, the free and quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their estates and fortunes, the liberties of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
the security of the true Religion then professed in the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and the setling of Ceremonies, in such
a manner as might take away all just offences. Which when
they should have disgested, and composed into one intire Body;
that so himself and they might be able to make the more clear
judgment of them; it should then appear, by what he would
do, how far he had been from intending, or designing any of
those things, which the too great fears and jealousies of some
persons did seem to apprehend; and how ready he would be to
equal and exceed the greatest Examples of the most indulgent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48510:47"/>
Princes in their acts of Grace, and favour to their People.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all which, upon that very twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> having received Letters from Sir <hi>Iohn
Hotham;</hi> signifying<note n="*" place="margin">20 Jan.</note>, that he had raised Soldiers by
their Order, for the keeping of <hi>Hull,</hi> but was refused
entrance thereinto by the Mayor; they forthwith sent
another Order to command his reception, though the
Earl of <hi>Newcastle</hi> had required admittance thither, to
take charge of that place, and the Magazine there, by
his Majesties authority. Nay, so diligent were they
now to lose no time; that they procured the <hi>Essex</hi>-men
to deliver a Petition to them; setting forth their
<hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies;</hi> with desire, that <hi>the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

                  </hi> against Bishops, <hi>and</hi>
for liberty of Conscience; desiring that Church-discipline
might be established according to the word of God, and their
Town better fortified.</p>
               <p>And well knowing how fair a countenance these Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
(thus framed by themselves) carried, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their designs; they caused more, from<note n="*" place="margin">24 Jan.</note> 
                  <hi>Devon. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersetshire,

not put into</hi> a posture of Defence; <hi>the Lieutenant

it being the same day voted, that the <hi>Cinque-Ports</hi>
should be secured; and the Tower of <hi>London</hi>
put into such hands as the Parliament might confide in;
the very next day<note n="*" place="margin">26 Jan.</note>, they brought down the <hi>Apprentices</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And being now resolv'd (as by their votes, and the

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48510:48"/>
totally into their own power; to the end they might
the more plausibly effect their design therein; they
exhibited to his Majesty a Petition<note n="*" place="margin">26 Jan.</note>; desiring, <hi>that the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with the other principal Forts, and whole
<hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, might be put into the hands of
such persons, as should be by them recommended;</hi> suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withall; <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>without this sure ground of safety and
confidence, which he should hereby raise unto them, they
could not be enabled to discharge their duties, in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of those important things, proposed to them by him
in his Message of the 20th of Ianuary: Nor be so freed
from fears and jealousies, as with chearfulness to proceed,
laying a sure foundation of Honour, Greatness, and Glory to
him and his Royal Posterity; and of Happiness and prosperity to
his Subjects, throughout all his Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief colour and pretence, given out to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for this <hi>Posture of Defence,</hi> being this, <q>that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the power thereof, in their own hands, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the good Laws enacted; there was no expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that they would be made fruitless to them,
by the prevalency of evil Counsellors, and a malignant
Party.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto his Majesty answered<note place="margin">28 Jan. Exact Coll. p. 60.</note>; that, <q>though
the nomination of those, to whom the custody of the
Forts, and Castles were to be committed, was an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
flower of his Crown: yet, that he would leave
them to the Justice of his Parliament, if through mis-information,
he had conferr'd such trust upon any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving
person. And that when any particular course,
for ordering the <hi>Militia</hi> should be digested by his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and proposed to him; he would return such
an answer as should be agreeable to his honour, and
the safety of his people: conjuring them not to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with Jealousies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this indeed they replyed<note n="*" place="margin">29. Jan.</note>, that <q>they acknowledged
it as a principal and inseparable flower of his Crown,
to dispose the command of the Forts and Castles of the
Kingdom: and that, by Law, the <hi>Militia</hi> was subject
to no command but his authority, and what is lawfully
derived from him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, within two days following, a Petition being
brought<note n="*" place="margin">31 Jan.</note> into the House from <hi>Suffolk,</hi> calling upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48510:48"/>
them <hi>to put the kingdom into a <hi>Posture:</hi>
                  </hi> and another from
many thousands of poor Tradesmen in <hi>London</hi> (as they
stiled it) urging the like; alledging a <hi>great decay of Trade,
whereby they wanted Bread; and that they believed not any
cause thereof to be in the House of Commons, but by reason
of the Bishops and Popish Lords, voting in the House of Peers:</hi>
it was earnestly moved at a Conference (by Mr. <hi>Hollies)
that the Lords would no longer delay, but now joyn with them,
to petition his Majesty that the Kingdom might be put into
a Posture.</hi> By which device, the Lords, who refused to joyn
with them in their Petition of the six and twentieth of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> were now so brought about that they did<note place="margin">2 Febr.</note> it.</p>
               <p>And to the end they might not want more popular
countenance for their grand work, which was now in
such forwardness; they got more Petitions from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts, <hi>for putting the Kingdom into a Posture.</hi> One from
<note n="*" place="margin">4 Febr.</note> the women about <hi>London;</hi> another from<note n="*" place="margin">5 Febr.</note> 
                  <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonshire;</hi>
a third from<note n="*" place="margin">7 Febr.</note> 
                  <hi>Kent,</hi> which was brought by
five or six thousand, that rode through the City in ranks
to the Parliament-House. Whereby they gave the
Lords thanks for concurring with the Commons in the
Bill against the Bishop's votes, and putting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into a <hi>Posture of Defence;</hi> desiring them to go on
with the Commons in a thorough Reformation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and to remove evil Councellors. The like had
they from the Counties<note n="*" place="margin">9 &amp; 10 Febr.</note> of <hi>York, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, having laid such a foundation,<note place="margin">The King went from Windsor to Hampton-Court. 9. Feb. 10 Febr.</note> by ensnaring
the people with their own Petitions; they made an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to enable some of the Aldermen and Common-Council
of <hi>London,</hi> with Serjeant Major <hi>Skippon,</hi> to
regulate the Militia of the City;<note place="margin">Thence to Grenewich. 11 Febr. from Grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</note> voting new Lords-Lieutenants
throughout the several Counties of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Wales.</hi> And to blow up the people into a perfect
Rebellion, they appointed<note n="*" place="margin">12 Febr.</note> weekly Lectures to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
set up; which was accordingly perform'd by
the most seditious and turbulent Spirits, that could be
found: procuring more Petitions, by multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from sundry parts;<note place="margin">12 Febr. The King went from Roches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> setting forth great grievances:
and desiring that the factious party (for so they
call'd the most loyal of the Nobility) might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
the House of Peers. Also, that the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48510:49"/>
of God might be no longer prophaned; and that
they might be better furnished with Arms to oppose
forreign power. Such also came from<note n="*" place="margin">12 Febr.</note>

Warwickshire,</hi> and <hi>Sussex</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">16 Febr.</note>; the Sheriff of that County,
and at least fifteen hundred on Horseback, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him therewith.</p>
               <p>And least the pretended great dangers (for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof all this stir was made) should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
a Letter from<note n="*" place="margin">21 Febr.</note> 
                  <hi>Lancashire</hi> was produced; discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
dangerous Plots by the Papists in that County;
<hi>viz.</hi> the finding of ten Barrels of powder, to make Balls
of Wild-fire, wherewith to burn divers chief Towns in
this Realm. Whereupon another Petition was dispatcht
<note n="*" place="margin">22 Febr.</note> to his Majesty (then at <hi>Dover</hi>) for ordering the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</hi>
Whereby <q>they desired<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 81.</note> such a speedy Answer,
as might raise in them a confidence (to use their own
words) that they should not be exposed to the practises
of those,<note place="margin">23 Febr. The Queen with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess Mary, her daughter, imbarked for Holland at Dover.</note> whose endeavours were to kindle that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion
in <hi>England,</hi> which they had in so great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
effected in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and which nothing could do
(as they said) but the granting that Petition.</q> Which
Petition, together with an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">25 Febr. the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</note> of both Houses,
setting forth, <q>a most dangerous and desperate design
upon the House of Commons; and many discoveries,
importing fears of rebellious Insurrections by Papists,
and other ill affected persons in this Kingdom,</q> they
then exhibited.</p>
               <p>Whose answer<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 88. 26 Febr. From Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury the King came to Grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</note> thereunto being; that, <q>for the City
of <hi>London,</hi> and other Corporations, which by any
antient Charters, had power of ordering the Militia, he
conceiv'd it unfit to alter their government:<note place="margin">28 Febr. Thence to Theobalds.</note> but, that

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 90.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon they forthwith voted<note n="*" place="margin">28 Febr. Exact Coll. p. 95.</note> this Answer <q>to
be a flat denial; and that his Majesties advisers thereto
were Enemies to the State, and mischeivous Projectors
against the defence of the Kingdom.</q> Also, that <q>this
denial was of such dangerous consequence, that it would
hazard the peace and safety of all his Kingdoms, unless
some speedy remedy were applyed by the Parliament.</q>
And immediately dispatch'd another Petition<note n="*" place="margin">1 Martii. Exact Coll. p. 92.</note> to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
(then at <hi>Theobalds</hi>) wherein <q>they protested, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48510:49"/>
if he did not speedily pass his assent to the satisfaction
of their desires, they should be inforced, by authority
of both Houses, to dispose thereof; and that they did
accordingly so resolve to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Farther voting<note n="*" place="margin">2 Martii. Exact Coll. p. 96.</note>, <q>that the Kingdom should be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
put into a <hi>Posture of defence,</hi> by Authority of both
Houses; that the Navy should be speedily rigg'd: and
a Declaration<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 97.</note> of their just Fears and Jealousies speedily
drawn up, with the grounds of their former votes, for
putting the Kingdom into a <hi>Posture,</hi> by authority of

               </p>
               <p>And to carry out all this, under colour of the Peoples
desires, New Petitions were brought from several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;

               <p>After this, within few days, they sent a Petition<note n="*" place="margin">23 Martii. Exact Coll. p. 123.</note> to
<hi>York</hi> (which was there presented to his Majesty by the
Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> and others) wherein they
alledged, <q>that his Majesties denial to their petition for
disposing the <hi>Militia,</hi> was a great hinderance to their
other proceedings; and justified the Tumults at
<hi>Westminster</hi> by taxing his Majesty with denial of such
a Guard to them, as they might confide in; asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Government, for many continued Acts of
violation of Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And to keep the people still awake, by allarming
them with new dangers, they caused Letters to be
read<note n="*" place="margin">18 Martii. 19 Martii. The King went from Doncaster to York.</note> in the House (which were said to come from
<hi>Amsterdam;</hi>) intimating intelligence from <hi>Denmark,</hi>
of a great Army, ready prepared there, to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
for <hi>England,</hi> and to land at <hi>Hull</hi> upon some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enterprize.</p>
               <p>The like Letter pretended to come from <hi>Newmarket,</hi>
then produced, and another from <hi>France.</hi> Whereupon,
having receiv'd a Petition from the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Common-Council of <hi>London,</hi> in which great
Thanks was given to the House, for ordering the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
of the City, as they had done; with their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
therein signified to obey the same: As also<note n="*" place="margin">21 Martii.</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> desiring that those places
might be strongly guarded and fortified, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
put into a <hi>Posture;</hi> they ordered, that every of
his Majesties Forts, and Castles, should be presently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with an Hundred men of the Trained Bands, next
adjoining to them; and ten pieces of Ordinance to
each place. Also, that no Forces should be admitted
into <hi>Hull,</hi> without the consent of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
and that<note n="*" place="margin">22 Martii.</note> Instructions should be sent thither
for the farther fortifying of that place.</p>
               <p>Likewise, upon another pretended discovery, made
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48510:50"/>
by one Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the Speaker of the House
of Commons; that they were advertised by Letters from
<hi>France,</hi> of an Army preparing there, to come for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Lords sent a message<note n="*" place="margin">25 Martii.</note> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
to let them know, that they had designed the
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Vice-Admiral of the Fleet. Whereupon
both Houses joyn'd in a Message<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 129.</note> to the King, to inform
him of the grounds and reasons of their sending out
that Earl as Vice-Admiral, without his Majesties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>The King therefore discerning, that they had got the
Royal Navy into their hands, thought it high time to
make sure of his Magazine, which had been laid up at
<hi>Hull,</hi> about two years before (part for the service of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the rest for the security of the North) and
accordingly rode from <hi>York</hi> thither, for the disposal
thereof: But, when he came to the Gates of that Town,
Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> (a member of the House of Commons,
being a confiding man, with the factious party there;
and by their contrivance, got privately thither with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)
refused<note n="*" place="margin">The King denied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Hull. 23 Apr.</note>, him entrance; affirming, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he had the authority of Parliament to bear him out.
For which insolent act he was declared traiterous by his
Majesty, and by a special Message<note n="*" place="margin">24 Apr. Exact Coll. p. 152.</note>, so signifyed to both
Houses; with demand of Justice against him, according
to the Laws. But, instead thereof, they forthwith not
only publish'd a bold <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">28 Apr. Exact Coll. p. 160. &amp; 162.</note>, with Votes and order
of assistance, in the name of both Houses of Parliament,
justifying <hi>Hotham</hi> therein: but sent down the Earl of
<hi>Stanford,</hi> and Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham,</hi> with four of the
House of Commons, as a Committee to assist Sir. <hi>Iohn
Hotham</hi> there; voting, that his Majesties declaring Sir
<hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> Traitor, was an high breach of the Privilege
of Parliament, against the Liberty of the Subject, and
Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>And now, that by their feigned Fears and Jealousies,

Next, <q>that whensoever the King maketh war upon

him by his people, contrary to his Oath, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(as some of those Members have since acknowledged;)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48510:53"/>
the drift and design of those Pulpiteers, therein, being the
alteration of Church-government, and inriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the lands and possessions of the Bishops and
their Cathedrals, as is very well known. Whose Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious

               <p>But to return to the <hi>Propositions,</hi> for bringing in of
Horse, Money, and Plate. Of this, so soon as the King
had notice, he dispatch'd a Letter<note n="*" place="margin">14 Junii. Exact Coll. p. 350.</note> to the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Sheriffs of <hi>London:</hi> intimating to them;
<q>that, if they should give, or lend any money; or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
or raise any Horse or Arms, under pretence of
a Guard for both Houses, grounded upon those scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
votes; by which they had presumed to declare
his intention to levy war against his Parliament; he
should look upon it, as the raising of force against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to be done in malice, and contempt of his
authority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this came too late: for the <hi>Londoners</hi> were so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in their compliance with these <hi>Propositions;</hi> that the
very same day they brought in great sums of Money;
for which, by a special Order,<note n="*" place="margin">11 Junii.</note> they had public Thanks
returned. Which sums, if we may credit one<note n="*" place="margin">Martin's Eccho. p. 17.</note> of their
own Party, did (with their Plate, Rings <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in <hi>London,</hi>
Middlesex, and <hi>Essex,</hi> amount to above Eleven millions
of pounds; besides vast sums from the rest of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and otherwise. So that all the effect his Majesties
Letter produced, was only an Order,<note n="*" place="margin">15 Junii.</note> in the name of
both Houses, that the Deputy-Lieutenants, throughout
the Kingdom, should tender Propositions to the several
Counties, for raising of Horse, for the service of the King
and Parliament: and soon after that, a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">21 Junii. Exact Coll. p. 375.</note> of
both Houses was issued out, whereby they justifyed their
raising of Forces; alleadging the same <q>to be for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Protestant Religion; the King's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Person, in his Royal dignity; the free course
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48510:53"/>
of Justice; the Laws of the Land, priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> forbidding any Officers whatsoever,</q> to
spread that Paper (for so they stiled his Majesties Letter)
justifying their Votes, <q>that the King intended to levy
war against his Parliament: intimating; that, neither
his Majesties commands nor threats could withdraw
or deter such as were well affected to the public, from
contributing Money, Horse and Plate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And so indeed it proved; for (as they had deluded
the people) large proportions were daily brough in;
the County of <hi>Essex</hi> contributing twenty seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds, and upwards, and eight hundred Horse;
<hi>Hertfordshire</hi> eight thousand pounds, and three hundred
Horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as appears by the calculation thereof, made

to ten pounds a year; and to enslave them beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
And lest those, who were thus seduced by
these their subtil illusions, should receive any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from his Majesties gracious <hi>Declarations,</hi> whereby the
uprightness of his Actions, and candor of his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might appear; they sent out Orders<note n="*" place="margin">4 Julii. Exact Coll. p. 449.</note>, strictly to
prohibit the publishing of them; promising Protection
from the Parliament, to those who should refuse so to
do.</p>
               <p>Moreover, because the King, out of his great sense
of those imminent dangers, which daily more and more
threatned his safety, desired a Subscription<note n="*" place="margin">22 Junii.</note> of those
Lords, and other loyal persons, then attending him at
<hi>York,</hi> for levying Horse in his own defence; as also for
safeguard of the two Houses of Parliament, and the
Protestant Religion; they order'd,<note n="*" place="margin">5 Julii.</note> 
                  <q>that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds of the money which had been brought
in upon the Propositions, unto <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> should be
forthwith laid out to buy Horses;<note place="margin">Order for the raising of an Army by the Parliament.</note> and that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot should be speedily raised in <hi>London,</hi> and
the parts adjacent, to be employ'd according to the
direction of the Parliament. As also,<note n="*" place="margin">7 Julii.</note> that Arms
should be taken out of the Tower, for their present
occasions, to be disposed of, by authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Likewise, that the ten thousand men, so raised,
should be forthwith listed under Officers, trained, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into pay, and march into any part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by direction and authority of Parliament. And
of this Army, thus speedily to be raised, they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note n="*" place="margin">12 Julii. Exact Coll. p. 457.</note>
that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> should be General, with
whom they voted, <hi>that they would live and dye.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, to the end that this great affair might yet
carry a specious shew to the world, they set forth two
more <hi>Declarations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 458.</note> in the name of both Houses. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they pretended <q>their whole endeavour to be for
his Majesties Honour and Safety, the regaining the
ancient Laws, Rights, and Liberties of the Kingdom,
so much invaded; setling the Protestant Religion in
peace and purity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Taxing<note place="margin">Ib p. 461.</note> the King with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of a change in Religion and Government;
as also with breach of his solemn Protestations and
Imprecations; and that he had already begun a war
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48510:54"/>
against them, being seduced by Jesuitical Counsel,
and Cavaliers, who had designed all to slavery and
confusion; which gave them occasion thus to raise
Forces, for defence of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And having given authority to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
to command his Majesties Navy at Sea; they made an
Order<note n="*" place="margin">15 Julii.</note> for him, to take provisions for the same out
of the Kings stores at <hi>Chatham,</hi> notwithstanding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
command to the contrary. Likewise for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
increase of their Army, they made Orders<note n="*" place="margin">19 Julii. Exact Coll. p. 476.</note> 
                  <q>for
encouragement of Voluntiers, within this Kingdom
and dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> to exercise and discipline them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in a military manner; which promises of the
Authority of both Houses, for their indemnity: As
also, that<note n="*" place="margin">23 Julii.</note> the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> should go on, to make
all speedy preparation, for the raising of Forces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Commission; appointing<note n="*" place="margin">25 Julii.</note> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
out of the Common-Council of <hi>London,</hi> to assist
him in raising Voluntiers, within that City and the
Liberties thereof. And lastly, that a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">25 Julii.</note> should
be published, to satisfy the people, concerning their
proceedings herein: as also to stir them up, to afford
all speedy aid towards the raising of Forces,</q> upon the
Propositions, for the intent aforesaid, and for removing
the evil Counsellers from his Majesty.</p>
               <p>How forward and active the <hi>Londoners</hi> were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
this Rebellion, can hardly be imagined; people
of all sorts pouring out their Treasure, as if it had been
for the most advantageous purchase in the world; throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with their Plate and Rings; and not sparing their
very Thimbles and Bodkins. Neither were they back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the adventure of their lives; five thousand of
them listing themselves under the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the next
day<note n="*" place="margin">26 Julii.</note> in <hi>Moor-Feilds.</hi> Which, with the other Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
then in readiness, amounted to near ten thousand
men, being forthwith committed<note n="*" place="margin">1 Aug.</note> to Officers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
into Regiments, were ordered to be daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
and to have constant pay.</p>
               <p>But all these Forces and preparations, were raised and
made for the King's safety, and preservation, as 'twas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
though at the same time, certain Provisions of
Wheat and Wine, for his Majesties own Table, passing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48510:55"/>
by water towards <hi>York,</hi> were seized by Sir <hi>Iohn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham;</hi>
and that seizure approved of by the Houses at
<hi>Westminister,</hi> with encouragement<note n="*" place="margin">29 Julii.</note> to do the, like upon
occasion.</p>
               <p>And, as they took all care to hinder the King's good
Subjects, from the sight of his <hi>Declarations,</hi> and <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi>
lest they should continue stedfast in their old o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to his Majesty and the Laws (as is evident from
their imprisoning the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> as also
of the Mayors of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and St. <hi>Albans,</hi> for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of them, according to their duties) so were they
not slack in spreading and divulging their own; as is
apparent from their frequent dispersing them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though they had often vented the like before: yet
now again to remind the people of what was in hand,
they set forth another bitter Declaration;<note n="*" place="margin">3 Aug. Exact Coll. p. 491.</note> whereby
they taxed the King with a design to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both in Church and State; and that the time for
effecting thereof was then come to ripeness, as did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the preparation of Arms, made by his Majesty
(as they alleadged) Scandalizing him, with giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>that they were necessitated to take up Arms, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of all these, which must otherwise perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King therefore observing; that in pursuance of
their <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> they had thus form'd a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Army; and that they had already beseig'd the Town
of <hi>Porstmouth,</hi> did set forth a <hi>Proclamation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">9 Aug. Exact Coll. p. 503.</note> declaring
the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and all his adherents, Traitors; with
pardon to such as should return to their obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
six days. But this gracious offer was so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd,
that so soon as it came to their notice, they
publish'd a <hi>Declaration,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">13 Aug. Exact Coll. p. 508.</note> in the name of both Houses of
Parliament; containing many shameful invectives against
his Majesty, declaring all such to be Traitors, that were
Contrivers or Countenancers of this last <hi>Proclamation</hi> of
<hi>August</hi> the ninth. And, that if his Majesty would disband
his Forces, abandon those wicked Counsellers, and hearken
to the wholsome advice of his great Council, they would
endeavour to make him and his posterity, as great and
rich as any Prince, that ever sway'd the Scepter.</p>

               <p>But, the more to incense the people, they issued out

                  <note n="*" place="margin">20 Aug.</note> in the name of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

the foundation of an arbitrary and tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
and, that notwithstanding all his Vows and

Protestations, to govern by Law, which had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
throughout the Kingdom, to blind and deceive
the people (as they alleaged) the most mischievous
principles of Tyranny, had been exercised, that ever
were invented: with promise to all well affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</q>

as had withdrawn themselves to <hi>York</hi> to serve
his Majesty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King therefore, seriously weighing the perillous
condition, in which himself and the whole Realm were
thus miserably plunged, through the rage and malice of
these desperate men: that he might leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attemted,
for preventing of those great calamities, which
he clearly saw approaching;<note place="margin">The King's Message for Peace,</note> after he had thus erected

tend to an happy conclusion of them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this gracious offer, was receiv'd by them, with so
much scorn and insolence (they then having a powerful
Army on foot, with plenty of Money, and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations;
and his Majesty destitute of all these) that
the substance of their Answer was,<note n="*" place="margin">Exact Coll. p. 584.</note> 
                  <q>that if his Majesty
would (forsake all his Loyal Subjects, then with him,
and) return to his Parliament, he should find such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of their fidelities and duty; as might assure
him, that his safety, Honour and Greatness, was only
to be found in their affections. And immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
a <hi>Declaration,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 585.</note> setting forth; that the Arms, which
they had taken up <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should not be laid down, until his
Majesty should withdraw his protection from such as
had been voted, by both Houses, to be Delinquents;
or that should be so voted; and should leave them to
the justice of the Parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Things being brought to this height, it will not be
improper now to take notice how the <hi>Scots</hi> did behave
themselves towards the King in this unhappy Juncture,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48510:56"/>
whose gracious condescensions to them, had been such
as hardly any age can parallel. Wherein, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that they could not but discern what breaches
had been made, upon his Majesty, and his just Rights, by
those here, who sat at <hi>Westminister,</hi> and call'd themselves
the Parliament; as also to what degree of strength and
power they were grown, with the artifices whereby they
attain'd thereto. Moreover, that though, by a Petition
exhibited to the Lords of his Majesties Privy-Council
of that Realm, upon the last of <hi>May an.</hi> 1642, they had
intimated <hi>a desire to shun any just occasion, that might give
offence to their gracious Soveraign</hi> (as they then call'd him)
<hi>or of Iealousy to their Brethen of <hi>England;</hi>
                  </hi> and so, seemed
to stand only as Spectators:<note place="margin">The Scots send a form of their Kirk-Government to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</note> yet, when they heard, that
their Friends in <hi>England</hi> had put themselves in Arms, and
were so powerful in strength every way, and his Majesty
so weak; they then, not only shew'd themselves more
open; but sent<note n="*" place="margin">4 Aug.</note> a Form of their <hi>Kirk-Government</hi> to the
Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as a Pattern for Reformation;
with desire from the Assembly of that Kirk, that the same
might be establish'd here: and a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">26 Aug. Exact Coll. p. 598.</note> 
                  <q>of their
affections to the Reformation in Kirk and State. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they signified their expectation, that England would
now bestir themselves, and extirpate the Prelatical Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
that the remainder of the work might be the
more easy; offering their assistance for furthering thereof.</q>
Of which more anon.</p>
               <p>That there was nothing wanting in his Majesty that
could be expected from a most pious and gracious Prince,
for prevention of those miseries, which this turbulent
Generation afterwards brought upon these Realms, doth
sufficiently appear by his sundry pathetick Messages to
them, formerly sent. Nevertheless to acquit himself
farther to God and the world; by another Message<note n="*" place="margin">Another Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from the King.</note> of
<hi>Sept.</hi> the eleventh he manifested to them <q>what endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
he had used by his many offers,<note n="*" place="margin">11 Sept.</note> but could not
obtain any Treaty: And therefore now declared; that,
being thus left to his necessary defence; relying only on
the Providence of God, the justness of his Cause, and
the affections of his good people; he should yet piously
remember the blood that was to be spilt in this Quarrel,
and chearfully embrace a Treaty, when ever they should
desire it.</q>

                  <hi>But to this was returned, a most scornful and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Answer;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">16 Sept.</note> 
                  <hi>taxing him,</hi> with committing <hi>(by his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)</hi>
oppressions, rapines, and murthers upon his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
saying, that they had offered him all Security, Honour,
Service, Obedience, Support <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and sought nothing, but that
their <hi>Religion, Liberty,</hi> Peace of the Kingdom, and Safety of the
Parliament might be secured from the open violence, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
practises of a wicked party, who had long plotted their
destruction: <hi>upbraiding him,</hi> that Irish Traitors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
were admitted to his presence, grace, and favour: <hi>and
telling him,</hi> that if he would return to his Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his forces, they would secure his royal Person, Crown, and
Dignity.</p>
               <p>Being thus driven to these great Extremities (which
was either to submit to their mercy, and forsake all those
his loyal Subjects, who had faithfully adhered to him;
or to expose his royal Person, with that small part of
an Army he then had, to the uncertain chance of war:)
and hearing that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (the Rebell's General)
was gone out of <hi>London,</hi> in great State, upon the tenth
of <hi>September</hi> (the cheif part of his Army being advanced
to <hi>Northampton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">King march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham 13 Sept.</note> before) he march'd from <hi>Notingham,</hi>
towards <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> upon the thirteenth of that month,
with what forces he then had; and at the Head of them,
near <hi>Wellington,</hi> made a solemn <hi>Protestation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">19 Sept. Exact Coll. p. 614. The King's Protestation at the head of his Army.</note> 
                  <hi>to defend

to govern by the known Laws of the Land; that the Liberty

should fail in these particulars.</hi> Which pious intentions
of his, thus declared, were of no small advantage to him
at that time, his Army increasing daily, beyond expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>The Rebels therefore hearing which way the King mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t their course speedily towards him, making
their Head-quarter, in and about <hi>Worcester,</hi> from the
four and twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> till the nineteenth of
<hi>October</hi> following. Near to which place (upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach)
some few Troops of his Majesties, under the
command of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> most happily defeated<note n="*" place="margin">23 Sept.</note> a far
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48510:57"/>
greater number of the Rebel's principal Cavalry; Colonel
<hi>Sandys,</hi> Major <hi>Douglas,</hi> and other Commanders (with
divers other) being there<note n="*" place="margin">At Powick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild near Worcester.</note> slain, six Cornets of Horse
taken, and all this, with the loss but of one man. Which
being the first notable encounter, that his Majesties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had with them, and so successful, did not a little amaze
most of the Rebels party. Lest therefore the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
being divulged, should dishearten their friends in
<hi>London,</hi> and other remote parts; they, not only caused
divers printed Papers to be spread about, bragging of it
for a special victory: but, that it might gain the more
credit, ordain'd a public Thanksgiving<note n="*" place="margin">27 Sept.</note> in <hi>London,</hi> for
the same. And to hinder his Majesty from the assistance
of his good Subjects, under one pretence or other (though
they had cryed out against his raising an Army, by the
help of <hi>Papists</hi> to destroy the Protestant Religion) they
were not ashamed to make a public Order,<note n="*" place="margin">6 Oct.</note> 
                  <hi>that, if any
Papist would bring in considerable sums to them, upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, it should be accepted of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As, by these subtile devices, they had rais'd the flames
of Rebellion to this height; and deprived the King of
all visible means here, for the quenching thereof: so did
they use their utmost endeavours, to prevent any help,
that might be obtained for him, from forreign parts; as
appears by their negotiation with the States of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces;</hi> wherein they imploy'd one <hi>Walter Strickland,</hi>
with a special <hi>Declaration</hi> to them; <q>complaining of
the <hi>Prince of Aurange,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exact Coli. p. 635.</note> for countenancing the <hi>Lord
Digby,</hi> in his making warlike Provisions in those parts,
for the King's use: and in favour of that Lord, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked Counsellers, and Incendiaries; to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
experienced Officers and Souldiers, to resort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Kingdom, in aid of his Majesty against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</q>
Scandalizing the King also, <q>that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
were corrupted by a Jesuitical faction; and that he
had drawn his sword for the destruction of his people:</q>
desiring therefore, <q>that his Majesty might have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Supplies from thence: and, withall, insinuating,
how near a relation there was, betwixt that model, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they aimed to cast this Government, and the

<hi>which were brought up by a Committee, to be
sent into <hi>Holland,</hi> for this Mr.</hi> Strickland, <hi>upon the 29th
of</hi> February an. 1643; <hi>by which he was to</hi> represent to the
States of those Provinces, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
did only strive for Reformation of that Religion and State they
live in: <hi>and therefore</hi> desired those States, that they would
now afford them their Brotherly assistance, as they had formerly
assisted them. As also, that they would enlarge their union to
other Princes, and lend them some money upon the <hi>public
faith</hi> of both Kingdoms; and the rather because they made
<hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> the pattern of their endeavours.</p>
               <p>Neither could they be silent at home; but the more
to stir up the people, inculcated<note n="*" place="margin">15 Oct. Exact Coll. p. 638.</note> to them; <q>that the
King had raised an Army, by the help of Papists; the
corrupt part of the Clergy; the Delinquent Nobility
and Gentry, and some notable Traitors beyond-Sea:
that they had liberty to rob and spoil all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
as also to exact Money and Plate from Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by threatning Fire and Sword to the refusers:
that he had hired a Scotchman, to murther Sir <hi>Iohn
Hotham:</hi> that, by violent oppressions he had exhausted
the parts about <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and that the Cavaliers
were hungry for the wealth of <hi>London,</hi> and the fruitful
Counties adjacent: that, if he should prevail, there
was no expectation, but that all would be exposed to
the malice and rapine of his ravenous Souldiers, and
all honest and religious mens throats cut.</q> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the means of curing and preventing these
dangers, must be by Loan, and contribution to the
Earl of <hi>Essex's</hi> Army, <q>which was not inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to the King's; besides better armed, full pay'd <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but above all, well encouraged and instructed in the
Cause, by the labour of many Godly, and painful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
and therefore, that all Trained Bands, Voluntiers
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all places, should assist the Lord General, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Whereunto they added these ensuing Votes; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That such persons, as should not contribute to the
charge of the Common-wealth, in this time of Necessity,
should be held sit to be secured and disarmed.</p>
               <p>2. That the Fines, Rents <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Arch-Bishops, Bishops,

taken up Arms against the Parliament, or had been active
in the Commission of Array, should be sequestred for
the use and service of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>3. That the King's revenues should be brought into
the several Courts, and other places, where they ought
to be paid in; and not issued out until farther order was
taken by both Houses of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And to sum up all, they set forth another<note n="*" place="margin">22 Oct. Exact Coll. p. 663.</note> 
                  <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Protestation;</hi> wherein they did, <q>in the presence
of Almighty God, protest and declare to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the whole World; that no private passion,
or respect, nor evil intention to his Majesties person;
no design to the prejudice of his just Honour, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
had engaged them to raise Forces and take up
Arms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they had professed their Loyalty by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Remonstrances;</hi> that they had passed by ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Slanders <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that, for the avoiding of blood,
they had directed the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> by himself or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to cause an humble Petition, to be delivered to
his Majesty to return in peace to his Parliament; that
his Majesty had refused to yield safe conduct for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
thereof; that he was engaged to the Popish-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for suppression and extirpation of the true Religion,
and exposing the wealth of this Kingdom to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and spoil'd by Cavaliers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oaths, Protestations, and Execrations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The first mention of the Covenant in England.</note>
that they resolved to enter a solemn Oath and
Covenant, to defend this Cause, with the hazard of
their lives, against the King's Army. And that they
expected help from the Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> herein.</q> His
Majesty therefore, having in a very short time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
expectation, raised an indifferent Army (though
his wants of many accomodations were very great)
finding no means of Peace or Safety, but by the hazard
of Battel, which the Rebels eagerly sought; casting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly upon the Almighty's providence and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
began<note n="*" place="margin">12 Oct. The King march'd from Shrewsbury,</note> his march from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> upon the

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48510:59"/>So that, on Sunday the xxiijth of <hi>October,</hi> being in
view of the King's forces, they put their Army in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
near Kineton,<note place="margin">Battel of <hi>Kineton</hi> 23 Oct. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Edge-Hill Battel.</note> in <hi>Warwickshire;</hi> and bid his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
Battel, by a signal thereof given with their great
Ordinance, wherewith they made five shot at his
Army, before any fire was given on the other part.
But then began a sharp encounter, which continued
near three hours. Wherein God so preserv'd his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that, instead of being utterly destroy'd by these vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Rebels, who reckoned all their own; their invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army (as they esteem'd it) was so bruis'd and shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that instead of farther pursuing the King, it retreated
eight miles backwards, where the Souldiers secur'd
themselves many days, by the advantage of the River
Avon, under the protection of the Town and Castle of
<hi>Warwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which Battel, I purposely omit the Description.
Nor shall I herein make any farther mention of the course
of this war (it being a work fit to be handled by it self,
by some more able pen) than in a breif Chronologick
way, to point at the times of the most memorable Battels
and Seiges: as also to the Towns, Castles, and other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Places, first possess'd, or afterwards forcibly gained
by either party. But instead thereof shall observe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
providence of Almighty God: whereby, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these matchless Conspirators, who had, by so
many subtile artifices, arrived to that strength and power;
and made seizure of his Majesties, Forts, Ports, Navy,
Magazine, and Revenue: (insomuch as the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> in
a publick meeting at <hi>Oxford,</hi> of the Gentry and others,
thither summon'd by him, in <hi>September</hi> preceding; told
them, upon his Honour, <hi>that the King had neither Money,
Power, nor Credit;)</hi> his Subjects every where, being also
not a little tainted with the most Antimonarchical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that by their seditious Preachers, or otherwise,
could possibly be infused into them. Yet, that in the space
of two months, he could be enabled to meet them in
open Battel; having no Amunition, but what came to
him from Forreign parts, through many perillous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
the Ports being block'd up by his own Royal Navy,
then under their command: nor having Arms or Moneys,
but what he obtained by extraordinary difficulties. From
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48510:59"/>
this day forward, purposing to make some brief Remarks
upon the ensuing practises of these monstrous men, in
carrying on that barbarous war, to the great devastation
and spoil of this late flourishing Kingdom: And to shew
how opposite all their Actions were to those plausible
pretences, whereby they did at first most subtilly delude
and ensnare a multitude of well-meaning people; <hi>viz.
Religion, Laws, Liberty, and property of the Subject;</hi> as also

might not be disheartened, they always
took care; not only to suppress any bad
tidings, but to puff up the people with
strange imaginations of Victories and
Conquests, by producing of forged Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
counterfeit Messengers, and the like; as was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by their commitment<note n="*" place="margin">25 Oct.</note> of sundry persons to prison,
which came from <hi>Kineton</hi>-Battel, and reported the very
truth of the King's success there; <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Wilson,</hi>
Lieutenant <hi>Witney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Banks;</hi> who were all sent
to the <hi>Gate-honse,</hi> to receive punishment by Martial-Law.
As also,<note n="*" place="margin">29 Oct.</note> one Mr. <hi>Iohn Wentworth</hi> of Lincolns-Inne,
and<note n="*" place="margin">1 Nov.</note> Sir <hi>William Fielding</hi> Knight; giving<note n="*" place="margin">25 Oct.</note> twenty pounds
to one man, by order of the House, who came, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that most that were kill'd in the Battel, were of
the King's side: and that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> commanded
him to tell his friends; that he, with his own hands, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away the King's Standard.</p>
               <p>But to undecieve the world, as to the number on both
sides slain, (which were then confidently given out to be
five thousand) most certain it is, that upon strict enquiry
from the adjacent Inhabitants, who buried the Bodies,
and took particular notice of the distinct numbers put
into each Grave, it appears that there were not one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
complete there interred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48510:60"/>As the remaining part of the Parliament-Army, after
this Battel, finding not themselves in a condition to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the King again without new Recruits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made a fair retreat no less than eight miles backward,
(as hath been observed:) so did some of them before the
fight, standing doubtful of the success, forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
themselves therein; amongst which the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was one (if some of the most
eminent persons of his own party, who were in the fight,
bely him not) who, being Captain of a Troop of Horse
in the General's Regiment, came not into the Field, but
got up into a Steeple within view of the Battel; and there,
discerning by a Prospective-glass the two Wings of
their Horse to be utterly routed, made such hast to
be gone, that instead of descending the Stairs by which
he came up, he swing'd down by a Bell-rope, and ran
away with his Troop.</p>
               <p>The King, soon after, holding a soft march towards
<hi>Oxford, Banbury</hi>-Castle then garrisoned by the late Earl
of <hi>Peterborough's</hi> Regiment of Foot; and <hi>Broughton</hi>-house
(the cheif Seat of that great Rebel the Lord <hi>Sa</hi>) yielded
<note n="*" place="margin">27 Oct.</note> upon Summons as he passed. But the Rebels, that they
might not seem to receive a foil in this first great Action,
the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were summon'd<note n="*" place="margin">27 Oct.</note> to <hi>Guild-Hall;</hi>
where the Earls of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Say</hi> and
<hi>Wharton,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> made large Speeches to hearten
them; telling their great Victory at <hi>Kineton</hi> Battel. But
the conclusion was, to crown their work (as their phrase
was) by farther and speedy Supplies of Men, Money, and
all other assistance. To which shadow of their victory, to
give the better gloss, a public Order<note n="*" place="margin">3 Nov.</note> was made, that
a gratulatory Present of five hundred pounds, should be
sent from the Houses, to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> for his good
service already done in the war. And lest any of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
people should return to their obedience, upon his
Majesties gracious <hi>Proclamation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">24 Oct. Exact Coll. p. 673.</note> of pardon; they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that<note n="*" place="margin">1 Nov.</note> those <hi>Proclamations</hi> should not be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But, though all these Rebellious forces were hitherto
rais'd by voluntary contributions, and free offers of many
to engage themselves personally in this blessed <hi>Cause;</hi> most
of the common sort, being really satisfied, that they should
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48510:60"/>
only go and fetch up the King to his Parliament, out of
the hands of his Evil Counsellers, and a few inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Cavaliers (for by that name they call'd all the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists)
and then return triumphantly, without fighting:
this unexpected brush at <hi>Kineton-field,</hi> could not silence
those, who had lost their Husbands, Children, and Friends:
Seeing therefore their farther Voluntary assistances came
in but slowly; the Houses at <hi>Westminster</hi> made an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note n="*" place="margin">10 Nov.</note>
that all Horses, within the City of <hi>London</hi> and the
Suburbs, and five miles adjacent, should be speedily prest
for the service of their Army: as also, that all Horses in
the Tower, should be seized on; and no Coaches suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be kept there, except one for the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>And, to puff up their General with such vain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
as might hearten him to persist in that his high
imployment (in regard he was then somewhat popular)
they form'd a specious <hi>Declaration,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">11 Nov. Exact Coll. p. 743.</note> which they ordered
to remain upon Record, in the Books of both Houses
of Parliament, as a mark of Honour to the name and
Family of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> for the good service he
had done to the Common-wealth, in the office of
General, by the hazard of his life in the battel of <hi>Kine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, for a firmer union of their forces, they made
an Order, in the name of both Houses; that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>York, Lincoln, Notingham, Derby, Stafford, Chester,
Lancaster, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,</hi> and
<hi>Duresme,</hi> with the Town and County of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> should
associate themselves, by raising Horse and Foot, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and subdue the Popish and malignant Party: and
that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> should command in chief, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
those Counties.</p>
               <p>But his Majesty coming safe to <hi>Oxford,</hi> after a short
stay there, march'd towards <hi>London;</hi> the noise whereof
caused the Members at <hi>Westminster</hi> to bestir themselves
for preventing his Majesties coming thither: whereupon
all the power they could raise was sent out, to give him
astop; the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> with part of his Army to <hi>Kingston</hi>
upon Thames, and the Lord <hi>Brooke's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden's</hi>
Regiments to <hi>Brainford:</hi> where the Royalists fell so sharply
on them, that they took five hundred Prisoners, and sunk
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48510:61"/>
some of their Ordinance, intending to march forward
on the next<note n="*" place="margin">12 Nov.</note> day. But, having advertisement that <hi>Essex</hi>
had drawn his Forces from <hi>Kingston,</hi> and joining with
the <hi>London</hi>-Auxiliaries, lay in his way at <hi>Turnham <hi>Greene,</hi>
                  </hi>
he chose rather to make a safe retreat, than hazard his
Army by a second Battel; and so by <hi>Reading</hi> came back
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he took up his Winter-Quarters, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it his cheif Garrison.</p>
               <p>The flame of war beginning thus to spread, each part
strove to possess themselves of what strong Towns and
Castles they could; as also to fortify such other places as
might enable them to have command over the parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
The gaining whereof, and other Acts of Hostility on
each part in places remote, as also the most considerable
transactions of the Members at <hi>Westminster</hi> (who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
themselves <hi>the Parliament,</hi> sate there with strong
Guards, to carry on this Grand Rebellion) being not
possibly capable of a perfect Narrative in punctual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of time: to avoid confusion therefore, I have thought
it most proper to place what is most remarkable, on the
military part, at the end of each years; beginning with
this of 1642: in which the war did commence.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore. The Rebels by this time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the King to get ground; partly by the increase
of his Forces in sundry Counties; and partly by undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many well-meaning people, who had been seasoned
by divers Lecturing-Preachers and other corrupt Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with disloyal principles; and now doubting the issue
without farther help;<note place="margin">The Scots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to their assistance.</note> sent<note n="*" place="margin">18 Nov.</note> a <hi>Declaration,</hi> and Invitation
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> for their assistance; granting Letters<note n="*" place="margin">26 Nov.</note> of Mart
to all Merchants; that would set forth Ships, to guard
the Seas; and to take all Shipping bringing Arms, or
other aid from forreign parts to assist the King; and to
detain the same, as their lawful prize.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as <hi>London,</hi> and the Counties adjacent,
gave example to all other parts of the Realm, in the first
raising of this grand Rebellion; so were they the first
over whom their great Masters exercised their power.
Nor were the deluded people elsewhere, (who had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
given the Reines into these men's hands for a few
fair words) long spared: for upon the xxixth of <hi>November</hi>
there issued out an Order<note n="*" place="margin">29 Nov. Exact Coll. p. 763.</note> from both Houses, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48510:61"/>
Committees should be named, throughout all Counties,
to take care for provisions of Victual, for the Army
raised by the Parliament; as also for seizing on Dragoon-Horses,
and draught-Horses; and for borrowing of
Money or Plate, to supply the Army upon the <hi>public
Faith.</hi> Which Committees had thereby power, to send
for and take such Provisions, Money, Plate, and Horse,
as the owners did then neglect to bring in.</p>
               <p>And having formerly order'd<note n="*" place="margin">26 Nov.</note>, that the King's and
Queen's Revenue, coming into the Exchequer should
be detained, and employ'd for the public service; they
seized<note n="*" place="margin">29 Nov.</note> on thirteen hundred Quarters of Corn, which
then were in the King's Stores. Also, for explanation
of their former Ordinance, touching the contribution
of Horse, Money, and Plate, upon the Propositions,
they order'd that the Refusers should be distrain'd;
and in default of Distresses to be found, their persons
to be imprison'd, and their Families no longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> or the Counties adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this, likewise they framed more Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<note n="*" place="margin">3 Dec.</note> of Association for divers other Counties;
constituting<note n="*" place="margin">14 Jan.</note> Commanders in chief of new forces to be
levyed within those Associations, beginning with <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Bedford, Rutland, Northampton, Leicester, Derby, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi>
and <hi>Huntington;</hi> appointing the Lord <hi>Grey of Groby</hi>
(son to the Earl of <hi>Stanford)</hi> Serjeant Major General
there; planting Garrisons in every Castle and great Town
throughout all those parts.</p>
               <p>The like Association<note n="*" place="margin">10 Dec. 22 Dec.</note> for the Shires of <hi>Cambridge,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Hartford, Essex,</hi> part of the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi>
and City of <hi>Norwich; William</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Warke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made Commander in Chief, throughout all those
Counties.</p>
               <p>And to put the people in hope, that this charge and
trouble should not last long; they gave out, that his
majesties Forces were utterly broken and shatter'd; and
read Letters<note n="*" place="margin">7 Dec.</note> in the House, from their General, that <hi>he
would pursue the King with all vehemency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this also, they made an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">15 Dec. Exact Coll p. 674.</note>, for
taxing all <hi>Malignants,</hi> and such as had not contributed
upon the <hi>Propositions,</hi> for Money, Horse, and Plate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48510:62"/>
to their abilities, that they should pay the Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fifth
part of their Estates. Under which name of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,</hi>
they brought in all that were worth any thing,
if within their reach. But, in this Ordinance, it is to
be observed<note n="*" place="margin">They bind heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and greivous to be born, and lay them on mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. Matth. 23. v. 4.</note>, that the Assessors were not to tax any
Member of either House.</p>
               <p>Neither could their oppressions at home suffice; but
they countenanc'd the seizing of a Ship, call'd <hi>Santa
Clara,</hi> out of the Port of <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> in the King
of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, laden with Plate, Cochinele, and
other Merchandise of great value; and by order<note n="*" place="margin">27 Dec.</note> of
the House of Commons, set up Bills upon the Exchange
for sale thereof. And that no part of the Realm might
be free from their oppressions, they constituted<note n="*" place="margin">4 Jan. Exact Coll. p. 816.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees
in the Counties of <hi>Warwick, Stafford,</hi> and City
of <hi>Coventry,</hi> for associating of those Counties, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Garrisons there: authorizing them to suppress
and disarm Enemies, and persons ill affected: also for
raising Horse, Money, Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And soon after that,
set forth a new <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">7 Jan. Exact Coll. p. 825.</note>, in the name of both Houses
of Parliament; shewing the necessity of a present Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of Money, and Plate, for a farther supply of
the Army. Suggesting, that his Majesties Popish-Army
would proceed with Fire and Sword, to root out their
true Religion, and all that professed it; if there were not
a good provision of Treasure to maintain and support
the Army rais'd by the Parliament.</p>
               <p>To which new Contributions, (for the better drawing
on of others) they themselves also subscrib'd. And after
ordered<note n="*" place="margin">23 Jan.</note>, that such Citizens, as had refused to pay the
twentieth part, should be removed to several Prisons; <hi>viz.
<hi>Yarmouth, Colchester, Norwich</hi> &amp;c.</hi> giving authority<note n="*" place="margin">3 Febr. 8 Febr.</note>,

to break open Chests, Trunks <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to sieze Money,
Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for satisfaction of their Taxes. And at the same
time appointed a Committee, for sequestring the lands
and estates of all such persons as had assisted the King,
in his just defence and preservation, according to their
duty and allegiance; calling it a maintaining a war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament.</p>
               <p>But all this being as yet not enough, they passed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48510:62"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">20 Febr.</note> to incite the City of <hi>London</hi> to a free contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
towards the sum of sixty thousand pounds, for
the service of the Army; the Houses declaring; <hi>that they
were in good hopes it would be the last money they should have
occasion to desire of the City in that kind.</hi> And therefore,
that they might be as good as their words, and not come
often to them in a borrowing way, they passed another
Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">23 Febr.</note> for imposing a Tax for the maintenance of
their Army throughout the whole Kingdom, of Thirty
three thousand, three hundred forty eight pounds a week,
whereof ten thousand pounds weekly was assessed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the City of <hi>London,</hi> besides <hi>Westminster</hi> and the
Suburbs.</p>
               <p>And to the end that the well affected, who had gone
forth in their Army rais'd for the defence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Subjects of
England (for those are the words of the Preamble) should
be the better encouraged to continue in their service,
they passed another Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">9 Martii.</note> for assessing of all the

with the Widows, and Fatherless children of such

               <p>On the Rebels part I am also to observe, that besides
the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> their <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> they had divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Royal Navy, given up into their hands by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernon</hi>

places I have mention'd, wherein the Royalists had first

               </p>
               <p>Not much of Action in the Field, or otherwise, can be
expected until the ensuing Spring of the year; so that
all I find of note, was only that at <hi>Liskard</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">19 Jan.</note> near <hi>Bodmin</hi>
in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> routed a strong Party
of the Rebels in those parts, and took above twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Likewise that attempt upon <hi>Litchfield</hi>-close in <hi>Stafford-<hi>shire,</hi>
                  </hi>
made by <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> wherein he lost his
life; the manner whereof is not a little remarkable,
which (in short) was thus. This Lord being strangely
tainted with fanatic Principles, by the influence of one of
his near Relations and some Schismatical Preachers
(though in his own nature a very civil and well homour'd
man) became thereby so great a zealot against the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Discipline of the Church, that no less than the
utter extirpation of Episcopacy, and abolishing all decent
Order in the service of God would satisfy him. To
which end he became the leader of all the power he
could raise for the destruction of the Cathedral of that
Diocess of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield.</hi> In order whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
when he had march'd within half a mile of <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
he drew up his Army; and there devoutly pray'd a
blessing upon his intended work: withall, earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that God would by some special Token manifest
unto them his approbation of that their design: which
being done, he went on, and planted his great Guns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the South-East Gate of the Close, himself stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48510:64"/>
in a Window of a little House near thereto,<note place="margin">1643.</note> to direct
the Gunners in their purposed Battery: but it so hapned,
that there being two persons placed in the Battlements of
the chiefest Steeple, to make shot, with long fouling Guns at
the Cannoniers: upon a sudden accident which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Souldiers to give a shout, this Lord, coming to
the door (compleatly harnessed with Plate-Armour cap
a pe) was suddenly shot into one of his Eyes; but the
strength of the Bullet so much abated by the glance
thereof on a piece of timber, which supported a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiss
over the Door, that it only lodg'd in his Brains,
Whereupon he suddenly fell down dead. Nor is it less
notable, that this accident fell out upon the second day
of <hi>March,</hi> which is the Festival<note n="*" place="margin">2 Martii.</note> of that sometime fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bishop St. <hi>Chad,</hi> to whose memory <hi>Offa</hi> King of
the <hi>Mercians</hi> first erected this stately Church and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
dedicated it.</p>
               <p>The next thing whereof I shall take notice, is; that on
the nineteenth day of the same month of <hi>March,</hi> was
that feirce Skirmish<note n="*" place="margin">19 Martii.</note> at <hi>Hopton</hi>-Heath, in the same
County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> where the right loyal and valiant
<hi>Spenser</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> encountring Sir <hi>William
Brereton</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Gell,</hi> though he had the better of
the day (being unhappily fallen from his Horse amongst
Coney-Burrows) was barbarously murthered.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S to this year's Actions, considering that
money is the Sinews of war, the first
thing of note, in order to the gaining
thereof, which the Members at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
did, was the sequestring<note n="*" place="margin">31 Martii.</note> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents</hi>
(i. e. the Royalists) estates.<note place="margin">Scobell's Coll. cap. 4. p. 37.</note> And
finding the poor Country-people very weary of the war,
and apt to run away; having also had so much experience
of the Cities forwardness in all things tending to their
service: to the intent, that upon any sudden occasion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48510:64"/>
they might draw out considerable numbers thence, they
passed<note n="*" place="margin">12 Apr.</note> an Ordinance, that the Committee for the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbs, should raise new Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Voluntiers, for the better security thereof. So
likewise for the better support of two other of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;
<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haselrig,</hi>
they passed an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">25 Apr.</note> for engaging the <hi>Public Faith</hi>
to such as should lend either Horse,<note place="margin">Scobell's Coll. p. 40.</note> Men, or Money unto
them in that service.</p>
               <p>But by this time the private Discontents and repinings,
which these large Exactions caused, beginning to make
the great Masters in this Tragic Scene to doubt a revolt
in the people (considering how frequently the King, by
sundry gracious <hi>Proclamations</hi> of pardon, and all other
good means had woed them:) To carry on the work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more smoothly, they were constrained, after the
example of their Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> to make an <hi>Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
by a solemn Oath, for continuing their assistance
therein. And in this, as the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> (who in all
other occasions had been their principal Instruments) did
readily tender their service by Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay;</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the House, that they would lend the fourty
thousand pounds demanded (for now they were borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again) provided, that the <hi>Holy League</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Holy League and Covenant proposed by the London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and <hi>Covenant</hi>
before spoken of, might be made and imposed upon the
whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And rather than their <hi>Blessed Cause</hi> (as they call'd it)
should suffer, it was moved<note n="*" place="margin">4 Maii.</note> by the Sub-Committee at
<hi>Sadler's Hall</hi> in <hi>Breadstreet;</hi> that all persons, who were
willing to promote their own Safety, should <hi>spare one meal
weekly,</hi> towards the provision of Horse and Arms, for
the new rais'd Auxiliaries about <hi>London.</hi> Also because
they found some slackness in the people, to bring in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon the <hi>Propositions,</hi> they appointed<note n="*" place="margin">7 Maii.</note> Committees
in the several Counties to tax such for their <hi>fifth and
twentieth part,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 41.</note> as had not contributed or lent accordingly:
and passed another Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">10 Maii.</note> for taking Horses for
the service of the Parliament.<note place="margin">Scob. Coll. ut supra.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is not unworthy of note, that this thrifty contrivance
for <hi>sparing one meal a week,</hi> was the usher to that then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Imposition, called <hi>Excise,</hi> never before heard
of by many thousands in this Kingdom: which the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48510:65"/>
trivers at <hi>Westminster</hi> durst not shew the people, till
they were sufficiently tamed under the yoke of other
Exactions; knowing full well how displeasing it would
be to them. Nay so fearful were they themselves, after
they had form'd their first Army, lest the people should
apprehend any suspicion thereof (which might then have
endangered a Revolt) that, when it was but whispered
by some, what they foresaw would happen; they made
an Order<note n="*" place="margin">8 Oct. an. 1642.</note> in their House of Commons, <hi>for punishing
such Malignant persons, as had cast aspersions upon that House,
that they intended to assess any man's Pewter, and lay Excise
upon that and other Commodities.</hi> But now, that they saw
the people, by degrees, so patiently submit to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
burdens; they began to debate<note n="*" place="margin">25 Maii.</note>, in their House of
Commons, how fit and necessary it would be for them
to impose <hi>Excise,</hi> upon Wine, Beer, Tobacco, and such
petty Commodities. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> by his Letter
to<note n="*" place="margin">30 Maii.</note> Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> signifyed; that <hi>they had proceeded
in the Excise to many particulars, and intended to go on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but that it would be necessary to use the people to it, by
little and little.</hi> And because this Ordinance, before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
for taking Horses, for the service of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should not pinch upon their friends; they passed
another<note n="*" place="margin">29 Maii.</note> by which they appointed certain persons to
levy such Horses,<note place="margin">Scobell's Coll. p. 41.</note> for the service of the Parliament; but
with special direction, that the Horses taken from the
well affected, should be valued, and repaiment secured
upon the <hi>Public faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus laid such a sure foundation for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of more Forces, they then sent out a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">30 Maii.</note> to their Lord Lieutenants and Deputy-Lieutenants of
<hi>Kent, Canterbury,</hi> and the <hi>Cinqueports;</hi> that they should
associate and raise an Army of a thousand Foot-Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and one or more Troops of Horse; and to appoint
a Major General, and give Battel to any Forces, not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by authority of both Houses.</p>
               <p>But the Oath, formerly mentioned by Sir <hi>Henry Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may,</hi>
being by this time framed, was now thought fit to
be set on foot, as of high concernment to oblige all those
that were well affected, and for the better discovery of
other well-wishers to the <hi>Cause:</hi> a work therefore of this
high consequence, being not fit to be brought into the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48510:65"/>
world naked; they had a Committee, who made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<note n="*" place="margin">6 Junii.</note> of a treacherous Conspiracy, discovered upon the
last day of <hi>May</hi> (being the Fast-day) <hi>viz.</hi> of a pretended
<hi>design to destroy the Parliament, and well affected party of the
Kingdom; to subject Religion, Laws, and Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
to establish Popery, and to set up an arbitrary Government:</hi>
for prevention whereof, both Houses and the whole
Realm should enter into a <hi>solemn Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Holy League and Covenant framed.</note> never to
lay down Arms, so long as the Popish-party (for so they
called the King's forces) were on foot; and Papists and
Delinquents protected from the Justice of the Parliament;
but to assist the Forces, rais'd by authority of the two
Houses of Parliament, against the Forces rais'd by the
King.</p>
               <p>Which solemn <hi>Oath and Covenant,</hi> thus drawn up, was
then taken<note n="*" place="margin">And taken by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses 15 Junii.</note> by both Houses; and within ten days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
throughout all the Parishes of <hi>London.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the poor Country-people might, throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
be all caught upon one day; they passed an Order
<note n="*" place="margin">17 Junii.</note> of both Houses, that a <hi>Public Thanksgiving</hi> should be
made throughout the whole Kingdom, on Thursday the
thirteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> following, for the discovery of the

               <p>Also to secure the Pulpit-men the more cordially to
them, and to make them the more active, in stirring up
the people, upon all occasions; they made an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">12 Junii.</note>,
for calling an <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 42.</note> in order to the setting
up of the <hi>Presbyterian Government.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ordinance for calling an Assembly of Divines.</note> Which <hi>Assembly</hi> was
to consist of ten of the House of Lords, and twenty of
the House of Commons, whose names are therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd;
and the rest Ministers, all of the <hi>Presbyterian
gang,</hi> excepting three or four (whom, though for the
more credit of that Convention they nominated, there
was little reason to expect any of their company.) The
Preamble of which Ordinance runs thus—<hi>Whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the infinite blessings of Almighty God upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
none is or can be more dear unto us, then the purity of
our <hi>Religion.</hi> And for that, as yet, many things remain in
the <hi>Liturgy, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church,
which do necessarily require a farther and more perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
than as yet hath been attained. And whereas it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48510:66"/>
hath been <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>resolved,</hi> by the Lords and Commons
assembled in Parliament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Episcopal Government abolished.</note> 
                  <hi>that the present Church-government
by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, their Chancellours, Commissaries,
Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-Deacons, and other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Officers, depending upon the Hierarchy, is justly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and burthensome to the Kingdom; a great impediment to
<hi>Reformation,</hi> and growth of <hi>Religion,</hi> and very prejudicial
to the State and Government of this Kingdom; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are resolved, that the same shall be taken away; and
that such a Government shall be setled in the Church, as may
be most agreeable to God's holy word, and most apt to procure
and preserve the peace of the Church at home, and neerer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other reformed
Churches abroad</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be it ordained</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Twas no marvail indeed, that they at <hi>Westminster</hi>
bestir'd themselves so hard: for by this time the success
of his Majesties Armies was such; that he had (by God's
blessing) regained the greatest part of the North and
West parts of this Realm; and did daily so increase in
strength; that, to uphold their <hi>Cause,</hi> they bethought
themselves of calling in their <hi>Brethren the Scots</hi> for aid.
Wherefore, having prepared a <hi>Declaration</hi>

that some of their Members (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lork <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi>

that they should have allowance<note n="*" place="margin">15 Julii.</note> for the charge
of such forces,<note place="margin">Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners sent into Scotland, to invite the Brethren to their aid.</note> as they should send; and that the debts
they already owed them should be paid out of the lands
of the Papists and Prelatical party, in <hi>Northumberland,
Cumberland,</hi> and Bishoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi> Which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
did accordingly set forwards<note n="*" place="margin">21 Julii.</note> upon the xxith
of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But about this time, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (their General)
made complaint to them by Letters<note n="*" place="margin">10 Julii.</note>, for want of Horse,
Arms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and proposed to them a Treaty for peace.
Whereunto answer was soon made, by the resolution
<note n="*" place="margin">11 Julii.</note> of their House of Commons (who debated the same)
that, by their late <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> they had bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
never to lay down Arms, so long as the Papists
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48510:66"/>
(for so they call'd the King's forces) which were then in
Arms against them, should have protection from the Justice
of the Parliament; sending him word, that they would
recruit his Troops according to his desire. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
their Western General (Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>) whose
heartiness to the <hi>Cause,</hi> suted so well with theirs, they
ordered<note n="*" place="margin">12 Julii.</note> five thousand pounds to be sent down to him,
and given as a Largess to his Souldiers, the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them in that service.</p>
               <p>But the certain charge of their Rebellious Armies did
so vastly increase, as was truly foretold by Mr. <hi>Green</hi>
(Chairman to their Committee for the Navy, upon the
sixth of <hi>December</hi> before) <hi>viz.</hi> that the maintenance of
the Lord General's Army, would, for the ensuing year,
amount to above a million of Money; that of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
having been two hundred and forty thousand pounds
for the year passed; and that without delay, they must
of necessity, settle a round and constant Tax for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereof: they therefore passed an Ordinance<note place="margin">Ordinance for Excise.</note> for
<hi>Excise,</hi> or new Impost; upon Wine, Beer, Ale, Cider,
Perry, Raisins, Figs, Currans, Sugar, Spices, wrought and
raw Silks, Furrs, Hats, Laces, Lether, Linnen of all sorts,
Thread, Wier <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for sweetning its relish with the
people, gave it out, that part of its income should pay
Debts, for which the <hi>Public faith</hi> was engaged.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to raise men as well as money (their
Western-Army, being then destroy'd<note n="*" place="margin">13 Julii.</note> at <hi>Round-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down</hi>)
the Citizens had a meeting at <hi>Grocer's Hall,</hi>
where they made new Subscriptions<note n="*" place="margin">20 Julii.</note>, to set up Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Waller</hi> again. For the better furthering whereof,
there were new Petitions<note n="*" place="margin">20 Julii.</note> framed, from <hi>London, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
and <hi>Southwark,</hi> and presented to the House of
Commons; <hi>that all the Kingdom might rise, as one man,
against the Common Enemy: and that the Parliament would
give power to a Committee, to list so many of the Petitioners,
as were willing to go out in their own persons: as also to take
the Subscriptions of others, for the raising a considerable Body
of Horse and Foot: and that the like course might be taken
throughout the Kingdom by a confiding Committee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In pursuance whereof, both Houses made an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<note n="*" place="margin">24 Julii.</note>, for raising seven thousand Horse in <hi>London,
Middlesex,</hi> and the Counties adjacent, to be commanded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48510:67"/>
by the Lord <hi>Kymbolton</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>)
and of Eleven hundred Horse, in the Counties of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Buckingham, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Hertford;</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Sir <hi>Iohn Norwich:</hi> In <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred, by Sir <hi>Miles Hobart:</hi> in <hi>Surrey, Sussex,
Southampton</hi> and <hi>Berkshire</hi> fourteen hundred, by Colonel
<hi>Richard Norton.</hi> And all these, thus to be rais'd, to resist
the Insolencies of the King's Army.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that though the Committee, which
were sent to bring in the <hi>Scots,</hi> went but lately thither;
yet the Brethren there, having had former advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how great a necessity here was of them; to the
end their Friends should not faint, hasted over a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">27 Julii.</note> hither: whereby they signified; <q>that whereas
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> had a long time suffered by
the Popish, and malignant Counsels about his Majesty;
and that the miseries in <hi>England,</hi> were but preparations
to theirs; they therefore did resolve to assist the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q> And high time it was: for their
forces in most parts going by the worst, it put them
upon new contrivances every day. So that Sir <hi>William
Waller</hi> was fain to come<note n="*" place="margin">1 Aug.</note> again to the House, and take
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> a second time, to encourage some, that
had not taken it before.</p>
               <p>And though the Committee, which met at Merchant-Taylor's-Hall,
for raising the people of the land as one
man, did give direction<note n="*" place="margin">3 Aug.</note> to the Aldermen, and their
Deputies in every Ward; with the Ministers, Common-Council-men
and others, to promote the work, <hi>as being
the last Refuge of the people</hi> (for so they express'd) <hi>and no
vain bait or allurement:</hi> yet saw they so little fruit of this
great endeavour, that they were constrain'd to effect that
by their power, which they could not do by perswasion:
and therefore ordered<note n="*" place="margin">4 Aug.</note> the raising of two thousand men
in <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridgshire,</hi> every man to have
a months pay in his pocket. And for a speedy supply
of more, they passed<note n="*" place="margin">10 Aug.</note> two Ordinances; One, that the
Committee for the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> with the Deputy-Lieutenant's
and Committees of Parliament, in every
County throughout the Kingdom, should have power
to raise, levy, and impress such numbers of Souldiers,
as should be appointed by both Houses of Parliament.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48510:67"/>
The other<note n="*" place="margin">16 Aug.</note> for pressing no less than twenty thousand
men, with so many Gunners, Trumpets, and Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as should be thought fit, for the six associated Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridg, Hertford,</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi>
with the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> and Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> to be
rais'd within the said Counties, for the service of the
Kingdom and Parliament.</p>
               <p>And, notwithstanding all this, being in a declining
condition, by reason that their moneys were spent,
their men wore out, and no small discontents amongst
themselves; in order to some recruit, they made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
<note n="*" place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 49. 19 Aug.</note> of their old <hi>Ordinance, for Sequestration of
Delinquents,</hi> with certain enlargements; wherein is
set forth who were to be reputed <hi>Delinquents,</hi> over
and besides such as were described in the former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
with power to examine upon Oath, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
as also Rewards to Discoverers. And likewise
passed another<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 52. 25 Aug.</note> Ordinance (relating to a former) <hi>for
the speedy raising of a body of Horse,</hi> for the Preservation,
Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom, to resist the Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and outrages, committed by the Souldiers of the
King's Army (those being the words thereof.) By which
they farther ordained, that Tenants should pay the Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
out of their Landlords estates, and defalk them out
of their Rents. But that which they then chiefly look'd
on, being the assistance of the <hi>Scots,</hi> whereon they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
depended, as their last refuge: to keep up the
hearts of their then drooping party, they made it their
business therefore to cry up loudly, the aid of these
their <hi>dear Brethren.</hi> For which respect, it will not (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
be impertinent, to make here a short digression in
shewing by what means they were dealt with, in order to
this their <hi>second Invasion.</hi>

to the <hi>Brethren</hi> of an advantagious

resenting so beneficial an offer, did set

                  <note n="*" place="margin">24 Aug.</note>, whereby, pretending the <hi>King's
Person,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges of Parliament</hi> to be
in no small danger; for preservation of these, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that all persons, in that Realm, of what sort, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> against the Papists
and Prelatical party (as they therein express'd) they passed
an Act<note n="*" place="margin">26 Aug.</note> in their convention of Estates, for putting that
Kingdom into a <hi>Posture of Defence;</hi> naming therein the
principal Colonels and Officers, for that purpose. To
accomplish likewise their cheif design of enjoying the
Church-Lands,<note place="margin">A new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant framed in Scotland.</note> they fram'd a new Oath, called <hi>the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant.</hi> Which was forthwith sent
over into <hi>England,</hi> and read<note n="*" place="margin">26 Aug.</note> in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at <hi>Westminster;</hi> thence to be transmitted to the
<hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> for their approbation; and being by
them approved, was remitted<note n="*" place="margin">31 Aug.</note> to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>And, that the grand Contrivers at <hi>Westminster</hi> might
the more ingratiate themselves with those their Brethren
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they passed an <hi>Ordinance, for demolishing all
Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry</hi> (as they intituled
it.) In which was particularized the removal of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Tables,
from the East end of the Chancels in
every Church; as also for taking away the Rails which
defended them; levying the Chancels, where the East
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48510:68"/>
part was higher, with removing of Tapers, Candlesticks
and Basins.</p>
               <p>For the speedy raising of more Moneys, they likewise pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
another Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">4 Sept.</note>, for fourteen thousand pounds,
to furnish one or more Magazines of Arms and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and for raising of Horse <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which sum was to
be levied within the Hamlets of the Tower, City of
<hi>Westminster,</hi> Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and other places
of <hi>Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> within the lines of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, it was only pretended, that those new Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Voluntiers, rais'd by the Ordinance of <hi>April</hi>
the xiith, for the better security of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
should not go out of the Lines of Communication. But,
as Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> in his Epistle to Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> concerning
<hi>Excise,</hi> wrote; <hi>that they must be used to it by little and little:</hi>
so now, they began to shew them what they must trust
to; and passed another Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">6 Sept.</note>, to enable the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
for the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to command forth,
one or more Regiments, of the Trained-Bands, or Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries,
within the Liberties of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi>
to go forth under the command of Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> and
upon occasion to be assistant to the Lord General.</p>
               <p>And herein I cannot but observe an excellent expression
made to the House of Commons by Mr. <hi>Oliver St. Iohn</hi>
(sometime his Majesties Sollicitor General, but then a
dear Member and special Contriver in this great work)
in answer to Mr. <hi>Iohn Pym:</hi> (who seemed to stand strict,
for observing the Ordinance of <hi>April</hi> the xiith) alleaged,
that though those men, by that Ordinance raised only for
the defence of the City, were not to go out of the line of
Communication: yet now that they were rais'd, they
(meaning the Parliament) might dispose of them whether
they pleased, without asking their consents.</p>
               <p>And, whereas the first Ordinance for <hi>Excise,</hi> was but only
for maintenance of the Army, and paiment of Debts due
by the Common-wealth; they passed another<note n="*" place="margin">11 Sept.</note>; wherein
was a consideration added,<note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>for securing of Trade,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
the enlargement thereof, upon such Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as had not been formerly tax'd; besides an alteration
of the rates. Which Commodities were <hi>Strong-waters, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal-Drugs,

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48510:69"/>

               </p>
               <p>Having also thus taught the new Auxiliaries the force
of an Ordinance of Parliament, they passed another<note n="*" place="margin">13 Sept.</note>,
for the pressing of five thousand men, in the Cities of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the Counties adjacent, to
go under the command of Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to hasten on the march of their Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi>
to their aid and assistance; the Members of the House of
Commons, with great formality, and no less seeming
devotion, entred<note n="*" place="margin">25 Sept.</note> into that unhappy Combination,<note place="margin">The solemn League and Covenant (fram'd in Scotland) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Members at Westminster. Archbishop Laud's life. p. 510.</note> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>solemn League and Covenant</hi> (so fram'd in <hi>Scotland</hi>)
in St. <hi>Margarets</hi>-Church at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Which, under
the specious veil of Reformation, was that fatal Engine,
whereby not only the Hierarchy in the Church, was by
them soon after destroyed; and the patrimony thereof,
with the Lands and Revenues of the Crown, swallow'd
up by those pretenders to Godliness; but the sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King, most inhumanly murthered<note n="*" place="margin">See the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of the Army in order to the King's Trial, dated at St. Albans 16 Nov. 1648.</note>; and this
ancient and long flourishing Monarchy, so far as 'twas in
their power, wholly subverted and destroy'd, as to the
whole world, is most notorious.</p>
               <p>In the Preamble whereunto, they had the confidence
to say, that this their <hi>League and Covenant, was according
to the commendable practise of these Kingdoms, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of God's people in other Nations:</hi> Whereas, there is
not only no mention of any such things by our Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers;
nor in the History of any other Realm, that I
have ever seen, excepting that of the <hi>Holy League</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
(whereof I shall take farther notice, ere I finish this work:)
but Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> (one of their mighty Champions for
the <hi>Cause,</hi> and an especial assertor of this <hi>Covenant</hi>) hath
expresly affirmed<note n="*" place="margin">Covenant with Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. p. 12.</note> in print: that <hi>it is such an Oath, as for
matter, persons, and other circumstances, the like hath not been
in any age, or Oath we read of in sacred or humane stories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is also observable; that whereas in the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they farther affirm; that <hi>they did it to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Religion</hi> (which must needs be intended,
the known Religion, publickly profess'd, and by Law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
in the Church of <hi>England) from ruine and destruction:</hi>
they immediatly <q>vow to reform Religion, here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
according to the pattern of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and to extirpate Episcopacy, and all Ecclesiastical Offices
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48510:69"/>
depending thereon:</q> Notwithstanding they knew full
well; First, that the King was by his Coronation Oath,
sworn to maintain and defend the Bishops and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under their charge: Secondly, that all the Clergy of
<hi>England,</hi> had testified their approbation of Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by personal Subscriptions thereto: and thirdly,
that, by a <hi>solemn Protestation,</hi> made and framed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in that very Parliament; and recommended by
them, to be taken by all the people of <hi>England,</hi> they had
oblig'd themselves; <q>neither for hope nor fear, or other
respect, to relinquish the true Protestant Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But all this Pageantry, in their thus taking of that <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant,</hi> could not allay the loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the people, occasion'd by the great pressures,
and daily exactions, under which they miserably groaned:
the Members therefore were constrain'd to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to another way, for the easing them; at least in
shew: and this was by an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">21</note>, for selling the
King's, Queen's, and Princes revenues,<note place="margin">Sept. Scob. Coll. p. 54.</note> and the arrearages
thereof: as also to another<note n="*" place="margin">2 Oct.</note>, for felling and cutting
down Woods within sixty miles of <hi>London,</hi> in all Forests,
Chases, and Parks, belonging to the King or Queen; or
any Arch-bishop, Bishop, Dean, and Chapter <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Papist,
Delinquent, Malignant <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be disposed of for supply
of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which seeming favour, was for no other purpose, than
that they might afterwards, bring the greater load upon
them, as they did ere long. For within few days, upon
a jugling Report<note n="*" place="margin">5 Oct.</note> made to the House, of a Pope's Bull
(translated into English, with a Declaration upon) it which
was pretended to be newly sent into <hi>England,</hi> for the more
effectual prosecuting of the Catholic war here; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the House of Commons, and of the Assembly
of Divines,<note n="*" place="margin">6 Oct.</note> came to a Common-Hall in <hi>London,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with the Citizens, for the speedy raising of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand pounds for the advance of the Scottish
Army; to be lent for that service, and repay'd when
moneys were procured from forreign parts, upon the
<hi>public faith</hi> of both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>And to obtain more men, as well as money, there is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out another Order<note n="*" place="margin">7 Oct.</note>; that the Committee for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48510:70"/>
Militia or <hi>London,</hi> should have power to appoint six
Regiments of their Trained-Bands, and one of their
Auxiliaries: as also one Regiment of Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
to march out with their Commanders, and joyn
with the Earl of <hi>Essex's</hi> Forces. Likewise an Ordinance
for the pressing of five thousand Souldiers more, to be
sent to the Islands of <hi>Ieresey,</hi> and <hi>Garnsey,</hi> under the
command of the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> those Trained-Bands
being appointed to meet<note n="*" place="margin">18 Oct.</note> in St. <hi>Iames</hi> Fields; and from
thence to march unto such place, as the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> or
his Officers should appoint, and in default thereof, their
Shops to be shut up; themselves depriv'd of Trade, and
liable to expulsion out of the lines of Communication.
And about the same time, they passed another Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<note n="*" place="margin">9 Oct.</note>, for assessing the Twenty fifth part, upon all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament,<note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 57.</note> who then were, either in the King's
Army, or otherwise absent; their estates to be let, in case
of not paiment.</p>
               <p>And having lately sped so well, upon credit of the
<hi>public faith,</hi> they adventured again upon the same secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
recommending<note n="*" place="margin">18 Oct.</note> to the Counties of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,
Essex,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the aid of
the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> in Men, Money, Plate, Horse, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition;
passing an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for repaiment of what
should be lent for the speedy bringing in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to
their assistance; and securing it in the mean time by the
before-mention'd <hi>public faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the reputation of the <hi>public faith,</hi> was now grown
so low, that moneys came not in, either quick enough,
or in such large sums as were expected (it being left ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
to the Creditors what they would lend:) another
Ordinance therefore was passed, for raising the full sum
of sixty six thousand, six hundred, sixty six pounds, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
shillings, four pence, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi>
and <hi>Westminster,</hi> with the Counties of <hi>Hertford, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd,
Middlesex, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Kent, Surrey, Sussex,
Cambridg,</hi> Isle of <hi>Ely, Huntington, Northampton</hi> and <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Cities of <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for
the better enabling their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to assist
in the Common-cause of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>

               <p>Which Ordinance had such a succesful effect, that it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated

on foot, betwixt the Commissioners, sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Articles of the Treaty at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough for bringing in the Scots Army.</note>
for aid from their Brethren of that Kingdom; insomuch,
as upon the xxixth of <hi>November,</hi> the Articles were there
signed<note n="*" place="margin">29 Nov.</note>; whereby (<hi>inter alia</hi>) in the first place it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that the <hi>Covenant</hi> represented to the Convention
of Estates, and general Assembly of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
sent to both Houses of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
(for by that name, those members, then sitting at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
stiled themselves) should be sworn and subscribed
by both Kingdoms, as a most near Tie and Conjunction
between them, for their mutual defence against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and Prelatical faction, and their adherents in both
Kingdoms; and for pursuance of the ends, expressed in
that <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next, that an Army to that purpose should be
forthwith levyed, consisting of eighteen thousand foot,
two thousand Horse, and one thousand Dragoons effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
with a sutable Train of Artillery, to be ready at
some general Rendezvouz, near the Borders of <hi>England,</hi>
to march into <hi>England</hi> for the purposes aforesaid, with
all convenient speed; the same Foot and Horse to be
well and compleatly armed and provided of Victuals, and
pay for fourty days. In contemplation of which aid from
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and that those their Brethren might not want
encouragement in that their necessary assistance, Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Strode</hi> made a motion in the House; that all those
who would neither contribute, nor take the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
should have a price put upon them, and be sent to Sea;
that something might be given for them, who would
give nothing of themselves.</p>
               <p>And shortly after, by other Ordinances<note n="*" place="margin">20 Nov.</note>, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
upon all Merchandizes were advanc'd to a tenth

               <p>Besides this, the sum of three thousand pounds a

hundred pounds, toward the support of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

wherewith the vulgar were by that time in some

for a new Excise upon Flesh,<note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 60.</note> Victuals, and Salt; ever
heartning on the people with hopes of ease; and now
most especially, because the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was ready to
march; which was represented to be so formidable, as
that it would put a sudden end to the work. Which
Army (according to a Declaration they then set forth;

                  </note> that I
come to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Invasion: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the main end
of this Narrative is, his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically
to shew the
growth and effects of
<hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
which had its chief rise
and production from
<hi>Scotland;</hi> it will not be
improper to take notice;
that, though by their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48510:71"/>
first Invasion in <hi>an.</hi> 1639,
they had not only made
way for the setting up
that Discipline here: but
before their departure
laid a seeming sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
for the firm and
perfect establishment
thereof: yet, such was
the success that the
King had against those
fiery spirited men, that
he was then become to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
master of the feild
throughout the West,
and many other parts
of this Kingdom; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their strong-Holds
being likewise
gained; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a very hopeful
way, to have reduced
that perverse Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to an absolute obedience; with whom no fair invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and condescension, on his part (though with all
earnestness frequently sought) could prevail, to make
them return to their due allegiance by kindness and love.</p>
               <p>But it so fell out, that this their <hi>second Invasion</hi> (the
first fruit of their <hi>solemn League and Covenant</hi>) with so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and powerful an Army, raised cheifly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of their <hi>Preachers</hi> in that Realm; and brought
in with the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Boutefeus</hi> here; the Pulpits dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ringing with loud cryes and groans, <hi>for hastening the
slow feet of their dear Brethren to their aid,</hi> became fatal
to his Majesty. For the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle</hi> who
lay then in Sunderland with his Army, consisting of about
7000 men, which he had raised in the North, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
constrain'd to make his retreat towards <hi>York,</hi> left
all those parts to the rapine and spoil of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scene being therefore, by this means thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
chang'd; his Majesty who foresaw the Cloud
approaching) having by <hi>Proclamation</hi> dated 22 <hi>Dec.</hi> called
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48510:72"/>
all the Peers of this Realm, which had any sense of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and likewise all those Members of the House of
Commons, that upon the Principles of Loyalty and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had faithfully adhered to him in these his distresses,
to attend him at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">22 Jan.</note> upon the xxiith of <hi>Ianuary;</hi>
did there represent unto them, this their <hi>second Invasion;</hi>
desiring their speedy advice and assistance, both what
was to be said or done therein, as well in reference to
<hi>This,</hi> as <hi>That</hi> Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, those worthy persons so assembled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they saw, that many of his Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
offers of Treaty for peace, to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
then sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> had been rejected:
and taking into consideration, that those Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
had upon pain of death prohibited the address of
any Letters or Message to them, otherwise than by their
General (the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>) they did, by a special Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">27 Jan.</note>
bearing date the 27th of the same month of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
recommend unto him, their most earnest desire, that he
would faithfully, and industriously cooperate with them,
in a right sense, of the then past, present, and more threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
future calamities of this Kingdom; by obtaining
that some persons might be appointed, on either part,
and a place agreed on, to treat for such a peace, as might
redeem it from desolation. Which Letter was signed by
the Prince, the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> as also by fourty three
Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Vicounts and Barons of the
House of Peers, and cxviii members of the House of
Commons there present; many others, by reason of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of place, sickness, and imployments elsewhere in
his Majesties service, and for want of timely notice of
that Proclamation of Summons, not being then come
thither.</p>
               <p>But the effect which this their Letter produced, was;
in the first place, to be cryed throughout the Streets of
<hi>London</hi> in scorn, as <hi>the Petition of the Prince and Duke of
York for peace:</hi> and a meer frivolous answer, or Paper, in
form of a Letter, directed to the Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> (then
General of the King's forces) wherein was inclosed a
printed paper, called a <hi>National Covenant of the Kingdoms</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and two other Papers; the
one called a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dated 30 Jan.</note> 
                  <hi>of both the Kingdoms,</hi> and the other,
<hi>a Declaration</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48510:72"/>In that their General's Letter, it was pretended; that
because there was no address to the two Houses of
Parliament, nor acknowledgment of them, it could
not be communicated to them; whereas it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known, that he did so far impart it, as that
a Committee of theirs advised and fram'd the answer:
Besides, it plainly appears, by the penning thereof, that
they all concurr'd in the Resolution therein mention'd;
whereby 'tis clear enough, that this was but an excuse,
or shift, to avoid any Treaty. And what could that
printed <hi>Covenant,</hi> and two <hi>Declarations</hi> inclosed, signifie;
but to shew, that before they would admit of a Treaty,
all the Lords and Commons, assembled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> must
join in that <hi>Covenant</hi> with them, for the absolute extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Church-government here (without, nay tho
against the King's consent) submit the Lives, Liberties,
and Estates of themselves, and all others, who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their allegiance, had assisted his Majesty, to the
mercy of those members, then sitting at <hi>Westminster;</hi>
as also to admit of, and justifie that invasion of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> according to the plain sense of their Declaration.</p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding all this, the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> continuing still sollicitous for an happy
peace; for avoiding delay or cavil about Names or Titles,
or descants upon words, humbly besought his Majesty to
send Messengers with Instructions to desire a Treaty for
peace. Whereunto he readily assenting, two persons were
by him nominated, and a Letter written to the Earl of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
for their safe conduct. Which Letter had in substance
this Answer; <hi>viz.</hi> that if they would first agree, that those
Lords and Commons sitting a <hi>Westminster</hi> were <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the King's only Council,</hi> that those Gentlemen
should have a safe conduct.</p>
               <p>This being therefore taken into consideration, it was
thought fit to desire his Majesty to write his royal Letters
to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> himself; and therein to inclose a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
superscribed, <hi>To the Lords and Commons of Parliament as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Martii.</note> Which his Majesty accordingly did;
and thereby desired, <hi>that a convenient number of fit persons,
might be appointed and authorized, to meet with all convenient
speed, at such a place as they should nominate, with an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fit persons, appointed and authorized by him, to treat
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48510:73"/>
of the ways and means for setling the present distractions of
the Kingdom, and procuring a happy peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer whereunto,<note place="margin">9 Martii.</note> they insisted, that themselves (thus
sitting at <hi>Westminster</hi>) were the Parliament, convened,
according to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; and
that those loyal persons (members of the Parliament) who
were come to his Majesty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> according to his royal
Proclamation, had deserted their Trust, and levyed war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament: and in sum, did intimate, that what
they should do herein, must be with the concurrent advice
of the Commissioners for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their late solemn <hi>League and Covenant;</hi> calling his
Majesties earnest endeavours for Peace, but <hi>Professions;</hi>
and their own feigned pretences, <hi>most real intentions;</hi> letting
fall, by way of menace, <hi>that his Majesty could not be the least
and last sufferer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto, as a consequence of this <hi>second Invasion by the
Scots,</hi> I have given a brief touch of his Majesties farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
endeavours, for obtaining a happy peace, with these
violent spirited men, by an amicable Treaty. Which taking
no effect by reason they then saw such a likelihood,
through the aid and assistance of those their <hi>dear Brethren,</hi>
to carry all, powerfully before them; I shall look back a
little, and take notice, not only, how their heavy oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon the people, by many farther grievous Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
were carried on: but how they proceeded in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the <hi>Scepter of Iesus Christ,</hi> in this Realm <hi>(for so they
called their Presbyterian Discipline.)</hi> Wherein I observe, that
within six days, next after this their Invasion, the Members
at <hi>Westminster</hi> passed an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">22 Jan.</note> for regulating the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity
of Cambridge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scob. Coll. p. 61.</note> by <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> then
their Chancellour (that is to say, for turning out all loyal
persons, from their Headships, and Fellowships, in any of
the Colleges there:) and for removing scandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
(<hi>id est,</hi> all orthodox men) throughout the several as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated
Counties of <hi>Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Hertford, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
Huntington and Lincoln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Welch, also might be the sooner brought under
the yoke; they soon after made another Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">20 Febr.</note>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they impower'd Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> Knight,<note place="margin">Scob. Coll. ut supra.</note> to take

to the Militarie-business of this year

ground in the North and West, his farther success in
sundry parts was not unsutable thereto: for Sir <hi>Hugh

the <hi>Dehonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornish</hi> Rebels at <hi>Stratton</hi> in

<hi>Chudleigh,</hi> being Commanders in chief of them. In
which Battle were taken seventeen hundred Prisoners,
thirteen brass piece of Ordnance, seventy Barrels of
powder, and store of other provisions; by reason
whereof the greatest part of the West, except <hi>Plymouth</hi>
and some other Port-Towns, was reduced to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and in consideration of this signal service the
said Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> soon after (<hi>viz. 4. Sept.</hi> 1643.)
was advanced to the dignity of Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> of <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

               <p>The next month also ensued Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

(Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his seat) were quitted by the

in <hi>Somerset-<hi>shire,</hi>
                  </hi> where the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> had
the better of the Rebels, though the Valiant Sir <hi>Bevill

there lost their lives: the noise whereof did not a little

               <p>¶These being the most remarkable Actions on the
King's part for this year 1643. I come now to observe
what success the Rebels, who were not idle, had the

               <p>Siege being also laid to <hi>Wardour</hi>-castle in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi>
it was rendred<note n="r" place="margin">8. May.</note> So likewise was <hi>Monmouth</hi> in
<hi>Monmouth-<hi>shire:</hi>
                  </hi> And at <hi>Wakefield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>
His Majesties forces encountring the Rebels, were
worsted<note n="†" place="margin">21. May.</note> Soon after which <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi>
(both in <hi>Somersetshire</hi>) were also delivered<note n="t" place="margin">5. June.</note>
up to them.</p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding all this, they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their fears; and therefore dispatcht<note n="v" place="margin">6. July.</note> the Lord
<hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Warke,</hi> together with Mr. <hi>Henry Darley</hi> and
Sir <hi>William Armine</hi> (both trusty Members of their
House of Commons) by special order, into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
earnestly to sollicite the dear Brethren of that Realm
to their assistance.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this, they took<note n="x" place="margin">30. July.</note> 
                  <hi>Gaynesborough</hi>
in <hi>Lincolnshire;</hi> and attempted<note n="y" place="margin">2. Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>Basing-<hi>house</hi>
                  </hi> in

approaching<note n="z" place="margin">10. Septem.</note> 
                  <hi>Gloucester</hi> with a great strength,
caused the King to raise the siege which he had laid to
that rebellious place. In the same month also was

                  <hi>Lynne</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> yielded<note n="a" place="margin">16. Septem.</note> to the Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>

by him forcibly. <hi>Arundel</hi>-castle in <hi>Sussex</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in <hi>Ianuary</hi> following yielded<note n="c" place="margin">3. Jan.</note> to Sir <hi>William
Waller.</hi> Whereupon, being recruited with more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he was constituted Major General of <hi>Kent, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Hantshire:</hi> But that which proved
to be <hi>instar omnium</hi> was that grand Invasion of the
Scots, which on the 22d. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> crossed<note n="d" place="margin">22. Jan.</note> the
River Tine with their numerous Army,<note place="margin">The Scots Invasion.</note> to the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of these Rebels: (as hath been already obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:)
For at that time all the North of <hi>England,</hi>
beyond <hi>Trent,</hi> excepting <hi>Hull</hi> in <hi>York-<hi>shire,</hi>
                  </hi> and
some few inconsiderable places, being by the Marquess
of <hi>Newcastle</hi> (for so he had been lately made) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the King's obedience; as also the West by
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> (His Majesties Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews)
excepting <hi>Poole</hi> and <hi>Lime</hi> in <hi>Dorset-<hi>shire,</hi>
                  </hi>
and <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>Devonshire;</hi> the Members sitting at
<hi>Westminster</hi> became so startled, that some of the
leading-men prepared for quitting the Realm.</p>
               <p>But this great ayd from <hi>Scotland</hi> much revived
their drooping Spirits:<note place="margin">Anno 1644.</note> for winter being over, they
fram'd an Ordinance<note n="*" place="margin">26. March,</note> that Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> in
<hi>Cheshire</hi> should have authority to take Subscriptions
for raising more forces in that County:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scab. coll.</hi> p. 65.</note> and soon
after imposed<note n="f" place="margin">8. July.</note> a new <hi>Excise</hi> upon <hi>Allom, Coperas,

all manner of <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs;</hi> and on several other
commodities made or growing in <hi>England,</hi> not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
charged.</p>
               <p>And, having by their many and great grievous Taxes,
thus largely provided for welcoming in the Scots; those
their dear Brethren advanced Southwards, and with
the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> laid siege to the City of
<hi>York.</hi> The loss of all the North, being by this means
thus in great peril; and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> coming with the
chief of all His Majesties forces to the relief thereof;
he was encountred<note n="g" place="margin">2. July.</note> with the greatest strength
that the English Rebels then had,<note place="margin">The Battle at <hi>Marston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore.</hi>

Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> with the whole Scottish Army
commanded by <hi>Leslley,</hi> which drew off from their siege
of <hi>York:</hi> whereupon, in a bloudy Battle, fought at
<hi>Marston-moore</hi> (about four miles from that City)
though at first he utterly routed the Scots and the Earl
of <hi>Manchester,</hi> yet following the chase too far, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
the day his own; through the onely conduct
of <hi>Cromwell</hi> then Lieutenant General to <hi>Manchester,</hi>
with a fresh body of Horse, the rest of the royal Army,
after a valiant and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>harp dispute, being much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,
was totally shattered and vanquisht: So that
he was constrain'd to quit the field, and march South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with what Horse he had left; exposing <hi>York,</hi>
hopeless of relief, to the power of the Enemy: which,
by reason thereof was<note n="h" place="margin">13. July.</note> delivered up to <hi>Cromwell</hi>
within few days after.</p>
               <p>But of this fatal Action the King (then far remote)
knowing nothing at present, (His royal Heart inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
minding the preservation of his people from
further spoil by the wars,) sent<note n="i" place="margin">4. July.</note> to the Members
at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King's Message from <hi>Evesham.</hi>
                  </note> desiring, as formerly, that they
would appoint such and so many persons as they
should think fit, sufficiently authorized by them, to
attend him upon safe-conduct given; and there to
conclude how all things in question might be fully
setled.</p>
               <p>Which gracious Message, though not then regarded
(so much were they elated with that their success at
<hi>Marston-moore:</hi>) yet, after that grand defeat of
their old General (the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>) in <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
which hapned<note n="k" place="margin">1. Septemb.</note> on the first of <hi>September</hi> next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;

                  </note> them of that
his Message from <hi>Evesham;</hi> they did vouchsafe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two months following, to send<note n="m" place="margin">23. Nov.</note> him certain
<hi>propositions;</hi> but such as did still apparently manifest
their confidence to carry on the work by power,
through the ayd of the Scots, with whom they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into so firm a combination for assistance by their
solemn <hi>League and Covenant:</hi> For, by these <hi>propositions</hi>
(amongst others) they had the boldness to make these
following Demands, <hi>viz.</hi> that the King should swear
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48510:76"/>
to sign that Instrument, called <hi>the solemn League and
Covenant;</hi> adding, according to the example of His
Royal Father of happy memory (for so they had the
face to say; though Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> had exprest, <hi>that it was
such an Oath, as for matter, persons, and other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
was never in any age before</hi>) And, not onely so;
but that an Act of Parliament might be passed, for to
injoyne the taking of it, by all His Majesties Subjects
within His three Kingdomes. Next, that a Bill should
be passed, for the utter abolishing of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which Goverment it is well known, that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church ever was, since the Apostles times:)
And, that their Ordinance, for the calling and sitting
of their <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> should be confirm'd by
Act of Parliament. Also, that an Act should be passed for
confirming their Treaty, for bringing in the Scots-Army
into <hi>England;</hi> and for establishing that their
disloyal <hi>Declaration,</hi> made by themselves and the
Scots, bearing date 30. <hi>Ian.</hi> 1643. whereby Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> (His Majesties Nephews)
<hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby, William</hi> Marquess of <hi>Newcastle,
Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> with divers other of his Nobility;
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> (then
their prisoners) with a multitude of other worthy
persons, both of this Kingdome, and of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
were excepted as to life, and their estates doom'd to
pay publick Debts.</p>
               <p>Likewise, that a great number more (whose names
are there exprest) together with all those Loyal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament, which attended his Majesty
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> should be removed from His Majesties
Councils, and never to come within the Verge of the
Court, but by their permission.</p>
               <p>Then, that all Judges, Serjeants, Councellors, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
Doctors, Advocates and Proctors, in the Law-common,
or Civil, who had adhered to the King,
should be made uncapable of any practice, publick or
private: and all Clergy-men whatsoever, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
adhered to the King, to be incapable of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
or imployment in the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48510:77"/>Moreover, that the Forces by Sea and Land, for
the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> should be
setled by Act of Parliament in Commissioners nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by both their Houses of Parliament: and,
that the education and marriage of the King's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
as also the making Peace or War with any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes, should be with the advice and consent
or Parliament.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; that, by Act of Parliament the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
or chief Governour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be nominated
by both Houses of Parliament; and in the Intervals
of Parliament by Commissioners, to continue during
the pleasure of both Houses. And that the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
Lord Keeper, Lord Treasurer, Commissioners
of the great Seal or Treasury, Lord Warden of the
Cinque-ports, Chancellour of the Exchequer and Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
Secretaries of State, Judges of both Benches, and
Barons of the Exchequer, for the Kingdomes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> should be nominated by both
Houses of Parliament, to continue <hi>quamdiu se benè
gesserint;</hi> and in the Intervals of Parliament by the
before-mention'd Commissioners. The like for the
Kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> adding the Justice-general,
and in such manner, as the Estates in Parliament there,
should think fit.</p>
               <p>Divers other <hi>Propositions</hi> also they then sent, no less
unreasonable than these, which, for brevities sake, I
omit. So that (in short) the summe of all was no
less than that His Majesty should condescend to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
destruction and overthrow of the Religion by Law
established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he had
sworn to maintain; and whereunto all the reverend
Clergy of the Realm had likewise subscribed; sacrifice
the Lives and Estates of divers of his most faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the avarice and ambition of these men; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all those loyal persons learned in the Laws Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and Civil to their malice; Give up the power of
the Sword, totally, into the hands of his greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
therewith, not onely to oppress his good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

to molest and annoy his Friends and Allies abroad;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48510:77"/>
and prostitute the Education of his dear Children
with their disposal in Marriage to the vile affections
and humours of this hypocritical Generation.</p>
               <p>¶That their confidence, likewise, in carrying all
before them, with power and force, through the aid
of the Scots, might the more appear; I shall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
unto you <hi>Presbytery Triumphant,</hi> for a while.
For within six days after they had sent these insolent
propositions to the King, they voted<note n="f" place="margin">26. Nov.</note> down the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<hi>Liturgy</hi> by Law establish'd in the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> And, for a farther encouragement to those
their dear brethren, on whose assistance they did so
much relie, which emboldened them to make those
high demands, they passed an Ordinance<note n="g" place="margin">2. Decem.</note> for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Sum of sixty six thousand six hundred sixty
six pounds,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Scob. Coll.</hi> p. 75.</note> thirteen shillings and four pence, for their
supply by way of Loane, from such persons, as
should not voluntarily or proportionably lend, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their estates. Which Loane was to be paid
out of the Sequestrations of Delinquents.</p>
               <p>But to make the more specious ostentation to the
world, that all their Actions wholly tended to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, the publick good and nothing to their
own private interests; they farther voted,<note n="h" place="margin">9. Decem.</note> that
no member of either House,<note place="margin">The self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> should during that war,
enjoy or execute any office or command, military or
civil, which had been granted or conferred on them
by either House; or by any Authority, derived from
either House; and that an Ordinance should be drawn
up accordingly.</p>
               <p>Next they passed an Ordinance for the utter abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Pious <hi>Liturgy</hi> (commonly called <hi>the Book
of Common Prayer</hi>)<note place="margin">The Book of Common Prayer Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht.</note> complied by divers reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
(of which some died Martyrs;) and for the
establishing a <hi>Directory</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht.</note> (as they call'd it) for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, in the room thereof: whereby every
conceited person was left at liberty, unto his own
frothy fancy, in framing certain Prayers whereunto
the Congregation were to say Amen: a thing so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and destructive to the true and real service of
God, as that there needs no observations upon it. And
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48510:78"/>
the day following, to glorify their doings the more,
they adorn'd<note n="i" place="margin">4. Jan.</note> their House of Commons, with that
whole suit of Hangings, which were placed in the
Quire of the Collegiate Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
some other taken out of the King's wardrobe.</p>
               <p>And, having proceeded against the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> (whose memory, as a stout Champion
for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> against her fierce assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
the Romanists on the one side, and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
on the other; and for his many other great
and pious works, much beseeming a person of that
place, will be precious to succeeding ages) by arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him before themselves, upon articles of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(as they call'd them) wherein they charg'd him
with labouring to overthrow the Fundamental Laws
and Government of this Kingdome; subverting the
Religion establish'd, to set up Papistry and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
they did, by an Ordinance (passed the very same
day with that for abolishing the Book of <hi>Common
Prayer</hi>) condemn him to suffer death as a Traytor;
for the quicker dispatch whereof, they brought down
the Lords to sit with the Commons; and afterwards
beheaded<note n="k" place="margin">10. Jan. Arch. Bp. of <hi>Canterb.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> him on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>After which they admitted of a Treaty with certain
Commissioners nominated by the King, upon those
<hi>Propositions,</hi> so sent by them; as hath been observed.
Which Treaty<note place="margin">Treaty at <hi>Vxbridge.</hi>
                  </note> being by them limited to twenty days,
began at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> on Thursday the 30th. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take notice here, of the particular passages in this
treaty, considering that they are so exactly set forth in
print,<note n="l" place="margin">Impr. Oxon. 1645.</note> will not be needfull. The truth is; that
though these Grandees at <hi>Westminster,</hi> did then
make shew to incline unto a happy composure of all
things, by that amicable expedient (to the end, that
by this plausible pretence, they might the more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
the people) they really intended nothing less;
as may appear, not onely by those unjust and insolent
demands, whereupon they did so stifly insist; which
amounted to the uter subversion of the Religion by
Law establisht; getting the power of the sword into
their own hands; and carrying on the war in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48510:78"/>
according to their depraved wills and pleasures:
but by that seditious and impudent Sermon<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid. p. 31.</note>,
preach'd in <hi>Uxbridge</hi> Church, upon the first day of
that Treaty (it being the Market-day there) by Mr.
<hi>Christopher Love</hi> (after executed by themselves on
Tower-Hill) who, besides many passages therein, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to the King's person, and derogatory to his
Honour, stirring up the People against the Treaty,
and sharply incensing them against his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
said; that <hi>they came with Hearts full of bloud,
and that there was as great a distance betwixt that Treaty
and peace, as betwixt Heaven and Hell.</hi> For which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
expression, though complaint was made, and
Justice demanded, no redress could be had. Besides,
when the King's Commissioners desired<note n="n" place="margin">Ibid. p. 144. &amp; 145.</note> to treat
with them concerning his Majesties speedy return to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> they utterly refused so to do, though
they had ever given it out to the world, that the sole
reason for raising their Armies was to bring the King
to his Parliament.</p>

               <p>¶I now come to the Actions on the Rebels part in
this year 1644. wherein they had the better of the day:
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Fight<note n="g" place="margin">29. March.</note> at <hi>Bramden-<hi>Heath,</hi>
                  </hi> near <hi>Ailesford</hi>

               <p>In the Battle<note n="h" place="margin">2. July.</note> at <hi>Marston-moore,</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi>
the victory was chiefly gain'd by the valour and skilfull
conduct of <hi>Cromwel</hi> Lieutenant general to the Earl of
<hi>Manchester</hi> (as hath been already observed) with the
Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>'s Horse, in the left Wing, drawn
out of the Eastern association: shortly after which the
City of <hi>York</hi> was delivered<note n="i" place="margin">23. July.</note> up to him on hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48510:79"/>
terms by Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> then Governour
there: And in <hi>October Newcastle,</hi> after a long siege
of many months, given<note n="k" place="margin">19. Octob.</note> up to the Scots.</p>
               <p>In which month happened also the second Battel
<note n="l" place="margin">27. Octob. The second Battel of <hi>Newbery.</hi>
                  </note> at <hi>Newbery</hi> in <hi>Berkshire;</hi> where great slaughter
was on both sides. In which it was observed, that
none of the Rebels fought more fiercely, than those,
who at the delivering up their Arms in <hi>Cornwal</hi> (as
hath heen already mentioned) did then engage never
more to fight against the King.</p>
               <p>Upon the ill success of this Battel (for so the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at <hi>Westminster</hi> esteem'd it) the Parliament
party having double in number to the King) it was
that the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> their General became suspected
of carelesness or discontent: so that much debate
happened amongst them concerning that point: The
<hi>Independent</hi> party therefore, having a design to be rid
of him, to make the more specious ostentation, that
all their Actions wholly tended to the Glory of God,
and the publick good, and nothing to their private
Interest (being then more predominant than the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>)
prevailed in making a Vote;<note n="*" place="margin">9. Decemb. The self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> 
                  <hi>that no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of either House, should during that war, enjoy or execute
any office, or command, Military, or Civil, which had been
granted or conferred on them by either House, or by any
authority derived from either House, and that an Ordinance
should be drawn up accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which device that party did not only lay aside
this their great General, but outed many eminent Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
from divers beneficiall offices, both in the
Treasury, Garisons, and other considerable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
placing in their stead those of their own party.
Whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was constituted<note n="m" place="margin">31. Dec.</note> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of all their forces, and a new modelling of the
Army voted,<note n="n" place="margin">31. Dec.</note> but with no small difficulty, the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> much opposing it; so that the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
were necessitated to make use of their old trick
in getting petitions out of several Counties, ere their
Ordinance to that purpose could pass.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of which vote, his Commission (but
the clause in the solemn League and Covenant <hi>for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48510:80"/>
preservation of his Majesties person</hi> omitted therein) Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> with great formality received, Col.
<hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> though a member of the House of
Commons, being then made his Lieutenant general,
with whom they did specially dispense in that point
of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> Which being accomplish'd, and the
whole party not a little elated by this second Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scots to their aid, they began to cry<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heath</hi>'s Chron. p. 68.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
for Justice upon delinquents: whereupon Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Carew,</hi> one of the Knights of the Shire for
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> tasted sharply thereof. For this Sir <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
having been a most confiding man, and in
that respect constituted Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi>-fort,
at length discerning the greatest part of the
West reduced to his Majesties obedience, began ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to consult his own safety, and to make his peace
with the King, by the delivering up of that strong
hold: but his intention therein being discovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the business could be fully effected, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to death by a Council of War held at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi>
in <hi>London,</hi> and on the twenty third of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
beheaded<note n="p" place="margin">Ibid. 23. Decemb.</note> on Tower Hill, with the very same
Ax, by which the noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> lost his life.
Which notable accident is not fit to pass without a
special remark:<note n="q" place="margin">Ibid. p. 18.</note> for most certain it is, that upon vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Bill in the House of Commons for putting that
great man to death, the most Loyal Sir <hi>Bevill Grenevile</hi>
(the other Knight for <hi>Cornwall</hi>) sitting by Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
and much abhorring that unjust procedure
against a person, whose life the known Laws of the
Land could not touch, express'd himself thus to Sir
<hi>Alexander; Pray Sir let it never be said, that any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our County should have a hand in this fatal business;
and therefore pray ye give your vote against the Bill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> instantly replyed; <hi>If I were
sure to be the next man that should suffer upon the same
Scaffold, with the same Ax, I would give my consent to
the passing of it.</hi> How exactly this was verified is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known.</p>
               <p>Nor is it less worthy of note, that about this time
also they reckoned with their trusty Governour of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48510:80"/>
Hull, Sir <hi>Iohn Hothum,</hi> and likewise with <hi>Iohn</hi> his
eldest son, who had been Prisoners in the Tower of
<hi>London</hi> from the month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1643. (though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
much magnified for refusing to give the King
entrance there, as hath been already observed<note n="*" place="margin">cap. 8.</note>) whose
great crimes were, that when they discern'd the Earl
of <hi>Newcastle</hi> powerfull in the North; the Queen
also safe landed at <hi>Burlinton,</hi> with Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and the strength of the Rebels not a little
declining in all parts; and therefore deeming it best to
make their peace with the King in time, they private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated with the Earl of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> or his Agents
for the delivery up of that Garison, but so unwarily
as that their design was discovered: whereupon they had
sentence of death passed upon them on the seventh of
<hi>December,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> and others,
then sitting at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> which was
accordingly executed<note n="r" place="margin">1. Jan.</note> on his son, upon the first

               <p>Soon after which (the Tide running swiftly on

nothing of moment thenceforth being acted by

the King, which proved fatal to him, as we shall see
anon, all going thenceforth to wrack on his Majesties
part.</p>
               <p>For, at the very entrance of this year <hi>Donington</hi>-castle
was yielded<note n="c" place="margin">25. March.</note> up to them. Soon after which
<hi>Cromwel</hi> having defeated some of the King's forces near

All this while <hi>Fairfax</hi> continuing before <hi>Oxford:</hi>
but hearing that the King was somewhat considerable
after the taking of <hi>Leicester,</hi> he raised his siege and
march'd towards him. Both Armies therefore meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </hi> upon
their first encounter<note n="i" place="margin">14. June.</note> the King had the better:
but Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> having routed the one Wing of
the Rebells Troops, follow'd the Chase so far, that
the Foot being left open to the other, were by the
conduct of <hi>Cromwell</hi> put into a total confusion: by
which means <hi>Fairfax</hi> became master of the Field, and
regained<note n="k" place="margin">18. June.</note> 
                  <hi>Leicester</hi> within four days.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he marched to the Relief of <hi>Taunton</hi>

taking<note n="l" place="margin">27. June.</note> 
                  <hi>Highworth</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire</hi> in his passage.</p>
               <p>To accompany these sad misfortunes <hi>Carlisle</hi> in

               <p>After which nothing but loss and ruin every day

<hi>Westminster,</hi> and take notice of the
effects, which these their great succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the Camp, did this year produce in
their Counsels, and further practices: In
the observation whereof, I find that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
party thereupon grew so highly elated, that nothing
less was by them Resolved on, than <hi>the setting Iesus
Christ on his Throne</hi> (as their phrase was) that is to say
to make an absolute establishment of their <hi>Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
As a preparatory whereto, they passed another
Ordinance<note n="p" place="margin">23. Aug. <hi>Scob. Col.</hi> p. 97.</note> for the publick use of their <hi>Directory,</hi>
with a Penalty upon such as should use the <hi>Common

               <p>The King therefore discerning the increase of his
peoples calamities,<note place="margin">Message from the King for peace.</note> again endeavoured to remedy them
by renewing his desires of Peace: and to that end,
under his own Royal Hand wrote a Letter<note n="q" place="margin">5. Decem.</note> to the
Speaker of their House of Peers, desiring a safe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
for the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and some others,
whom he purposed to send with <hi>Propositions</hi> to the

there, from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for
the foundation of a happy and well grounded Peace.</p>
               <p>Whereunto obtaining no Answer, he added a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<note n="r" place="margin">15. Decem.</note> Importuning them earnestly to hearken to that
his desire. And having no Answer to that neither, he

sent a <hi>third</hi>

for his freedome and safety, in going and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to come himself to <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
for the space of fourty days, and there to treat
personally with them; offering to commit the <hi>Militia</hi>
of this Realm, unto certain persons, to be nominated
by himself and them, equally, for such a time, and
with such powers and limitations, as were delivered
in by a paper, upon the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridg.</hi>

               <p>After which <hi>third Message,</hi> he received their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to his second; which was the refusal of a safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct
to the Duke and those other, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to go; saying that they then had certain <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Bills</hi> under consideration, which they purposed
to tender unto his Majestie, for the setling of a safe and
well grounded peace (as they call'd it) which after
agreement upon them by the Scotch-Commissioners,
they resolv'd to present unto him.</p>
               <p>The King not satisfied with this, sent a <hi>fourth Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">29. Decem.</note>; whereby he earnestly pressed their embracing
his offer for <hi>a personal Treaty</hi> with them at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
And after expectance of an Answer thereto,
for the space of full twenty days; and hearing nothing
he sent them a <hi>fifth Message</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">15. Jan.</note> to the same purpose
enlarging his offers, for his People's quiet, in sundry
particulars. But whilst this message was upon the way
towards them, came an answer to his fourth, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
negative as to his admittance for coming to
them; still telling him of the <hi>Propositions</hi> and <hi>Bills,</hi>
which they were preparing to send.</p>
               <p>Which Answer being wholly unsatisfactory, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
manifesting their aversness to peace; he sent
a <hi>sixth</hi>

                  <hi>Message</hi> to them, incessantly importuning
their speedy Answer to his former; and within few

                  <note n="y" place="margin">24. Jan.</note>, wherein he expressed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in confutation of those frivolous Arguments,
which they had used against his <hi>Personal Treaty</hi> with
them; continuing his desires thereof.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that as they grew in strength and
power, so their Insolence, which thus prompted them
to decline all good expedients for accommodation,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48510:83"/>
increased more and more. Nevertheless, his Majestie
not totally despairing, but that by farther condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
he might move this hard-hearted Generation,
sent unto them his <hi>eighth Message</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">29. Jan.</note> whereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting
himself from having any hand in some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Ragland</hi> (then called Earl
of <hi>Glamorgan</hi>) in <hi>Ireland;</hi> which he well knew
that they would be apt enough to scandalize him
with; he offer'd; that, in case they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to come to <hi>London,</hi> in order to a personal
Treaty with them, he would leave the management
of the War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wholly to themselves: as
also the nomination of the Persons to be entrusted
with the <hi>Militia,</hi> with such power and limitations, as
were express'd in the Paper delivered by his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
in the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> for the Term of
seven years, as had been by them desired. Likewise
the nomination of the Lord Admiral, Officers of
State, and Judges. And, for Religion, to give liberty,
that all those, who were unwilling to communicate
with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Service already
establisht by Act of Parliament, should not be urged
thereto: provided, that all other Protestants, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themselves peaceably and quietly, in and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Civil Government, should have the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of theirs: tendring also unto them a general
Act of Pardon and oblivion.</p>
               <p>Which gracious Message, so full of condescension,
produced from them, nothing in effect, but Scorn
and Contempt. For though the King caused the Lord
<hi>Herbert</hi> for that his misdemeanor in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
upon suspicion of Treason, and imprisoned;
they traduced his Majestie with under-hand-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
therein, affirming, that he had given that
Lord a private Commission, with command to
manage it with all secrecie: and that it contain'd such
odious and shamefull things as himself blusht publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to own, or impart to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi>
his Lieutenant there. And, whereas he had in his said
Message most graciously tendred them all that the

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48510:84"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Liberty for their Consciences, safety for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

insomuch, as after a full months expectation of

by His <hi>ninth Message</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">26. Feb.</note>, he pressed them for
some Answer; but all to no purpose: For like as a
Shadow pursued, they still fled from him, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after the stay of one month more, he sent them
His <hi>tenth Message</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">23. March.</note>: wherein, taking notice of the
duty he owed to God, and sense of his peoples mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(that no means might be left unattempted, which
could conduce to a safe and well-grounded peace)
he offer'd unto them, that in case he might have the
Faith of both their Houses of Parliament, for the
preservation of his Honour, Person, and Estate; and
liberty given to all his faithfull Subjects, who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to him, to go to their own Houses, and
there enjoy their estates peaceably, without compelling
to take any Oath, that was not enjoyned by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Laws of the Kingdome, or other molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he would immediately disband all his Forces,
dismantle his Garrisons, return to his two Houses of
Parliament, pass an Act of Oblivion, and free pardon
there; and doe whatsoever else they should advise him
to, for the good and peace of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But these great Masters, who (to captivate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
before they had got sufficient power into their
hands) had, by their most solemn<note n="c" place="margin">22. Octob. <hi>Anno</hi> 1642.</note> Protestations
and Declarations, which are publisht in Print to the
world, profess'd in the presence of Almighty God, and
for the satisfaction of their consciences, and discharge
of that great Trust which lay upon them (as they
then exprest) made their solemn <hi>Protestation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
to this Kingdome and Nation, and to the whole
World; that no private passion or respect; no evil inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to His Majesties person; no design to the prejudice of
His just Honour and Authority, engaged them to raise For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c. And again—<hi>we profess from
our very Hearts and Souls, our Loyalty and Obedience to
his Crown; readiness and resolution to defend his Person,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48510:84"/>
and support his Estate with our Lives and Fortunes, to the
utmost of our power,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover—<hi>we profess we desire
nothing from his Majesty but that he would return in peace
to his Parliament</hi>—And again, <hi>We profess in the sight of
Almighty God, which is the strongest obligation that a
Christian, and the most solemn publick Faith which any
such State, as a Parliament can give; that we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him with all Honour; yield him all true obedience
and subjection, and faithfully endeavour to defend his
person and estate from all danger; and to the utmost
of our power to establish to him and his people all the
blessings of a most glorious and happy reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless so obdurate were their Hearts, being
then rais'd to an height of confidence, that they
should, by the power of Conquest, utterly destroy
him, that they disdained to vouchsafe him any answer
at all thereto.</p>

                  <hi>all means possible, by his frequent gracious
Messages, (wherein he had offered unto them all they had
before desired; and that he expected nothing, but what
themselves, since the beginning of those unhappy wars, had
offered, to procure a personal Treaty with them) for a safe
and well grounded peace: And, having, in stead of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and peaceable return to those his Messages, received
no Answer at all; or such as argued nothing would satisfy
them, but the ruine not onely of himself, his posterity and
friends, but even of Monarchy it self.</hi> Considering like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that his field-forces were shattered, and reduc'd
to nothing; his Garrisons almost all lost, or besieged;
and that a strong Army, under the command of
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> (their then General) was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> there to besiege him, together
with the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> All the great Officers of State,
and many other of his most eminent and faithfull
Subjects. In this his most sad, and unhappy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
revolving, whether he had better cast himself
upon the <hi>English-Army,</hi> or the City of <hi>London,</hi> or
rather his native Subjects the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had at that
time besieg'd <hi>Newarke</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> with a great
and numerous Army: <hi>Having<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> received very good
assurance (as he then believ'd) that himself and all that
did adhere to him, should be safe in their Persons, Honour
and Consciences in the Scotch Army. And that they</hi> (the
Scots) <hi>would really and effectually joyn with him, and such
other as would come in unto him, and joyn with them for
his preservation; and would imploy their Armies and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to assist him to the procuring of an happy and well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
peace, for the good of his said Majesty and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
in the recovery of his just rights (Necessity being
then his Councellour) he adventured<note n="f" place="margin">Eikon basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks.</note> upon their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who first began his troubles, trusting that God might
make them a means honourably to compose them:</hi> and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48510:85"/>
thereupon went<note n="g" place="margin">27. April.</note> out of <hi>Oxford</hi> disguised, in the
night time, with two persons onely accompanying
him; <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashburnham</hi> (one of the Grooms
of his royal Bedchamber) and one Mr <hi>Hudson</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
his Guide. From <hi>Oxford</hi> they first rode to
<hi>Henley</hi> upon <hi>Thames;</hi> Thence to <hi>Brainford:</hi>
Thence near to <hi>London,</hi> and so to <hi>Harrow</hi> on the
Hill, there being then a general muster of the City
forces in <hi>Hide Park,</hi> where he was expected, the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> being at that time in the Field, and his
Majestie almost perswaded to adventure himself into
their hands. But relying wholly on the Scots, who
had promised so fair (as before is observed) he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
those thoughts, and rode to <hi>St. Albans;</hi> so to
<hi>Harborough</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> where he expected the
French<note n="*" place="margin">Monsieur de <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.</hi>
                  </note> Agent (who had so treated with the Scots on
his behalf as I have already observed) with some Horse
to meet him, and conduct him to <hi>Southwell,</hi> the
then Head quarters of the Scottish-Army. But mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him there, he thence passed to <hi>Stanford</hi> (on
the edge of <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>) and so to <hi>Downham</hi> in
<hi>Norfolk:</hi> whence Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> was sent to the Agent;
and upon his return went directly to <hi>Southwel,</hi>
where he arrived<note n="a" place="margin">5. May.</note> the 5 th. of <hi>May;</hi> and put
himself into the hands of <hi>Alexander Lesley</hi> their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
resolving<note n="i" place="margin">K. Letter to the M. of <hi>Ormund</hi> ut supra.</note> to use his best endeavours, by
their assistance, and with the conjunction of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Marquess of <hi>Montrose,</hi>
and such of his well affected Subjects of <hi>England,</hi>
as would rise for him, to procure, if it might be, an
honourable and speedy peace, with those who had
hitherto refused to give ear to any good means ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereto.</p>
               <p>Being thus gone, siege<note n="b" place="margin">2. May</note> was immediately laid
to <hi>Oxford</hi> by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> soon after which, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places of strength were surrendred by the
King's special direction; <hi>viz. <hi>Newark,</hi>
                  </hi> the eleventh
<note n="c" place="margin">11. May.</note> of <hi>May,</hi> which had been besieg'd by <hi>Poyntz</hi> and <hi>Rosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
(the Scots assisting) from <hi>December</hi> before.</p>
               <p>The Castle of <hi>Banbury</hi> likewise, after a siege of

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:48510:86"/>
And on the thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> the Scots, having
not patience to attend the voluntary surrenders of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more places of strength, began<note n="d" place="margin">13. May.</note> their march
towards <hi>Newcastle</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> taking
the King along with them.<note place="margin">The King removed to <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tine.</hi>
                  </note> Where being arrived
(and quartering their Army thereabouts) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
pressed his Majestie to send Orders to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess

Governours of his Garisons in <hi>England,</hi> to give up
all the Towns and Castles then remaining, to such as
should be appointed to receive them for the Houses of
Parliament: Telling him, that otherwise, they neither
could, nor durst continue him in their protection.</p>
               <p>To which necessity his Majestie was constrain'd to
submit: but nothing was by them more earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, than that the Marquess of <hi>Montross</hi>
should lay down Arms; who, with a small strength
at first, had acted in Scotland to admiration: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many victories of less note, he had twice beaten
the Marquess of <hi>Argyle</hi> out of the Field; follow'd
him home, and wasted his Country with Fire and
Sword; and vanquisht <hi>Bayley,</hi> one of their best Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
made himself also Master of the Castle of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborough,</hi>
releasing divers of his Friends, who
had been seized on, and imprisoned there, when he
first took up Arms. But instead of those Aids which
he hoped for, he was unexpectedly set upon by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Lesley,</hi> who was sent from the Scottish Army in
<hi>England</hi> with six thousand Horse to oppose the
farther progress of this most valiant persons fortune.
However, he began to make head again, and was in
a way of fair success, when he receiv'd the Kings
command to disband; (<hi>viz. 31 May</hi> 1647.) To which
he readily conforming, took Ship, and put himself
into a voluntary Exile. After which time of this
their perfidious dealing with the King, 'tis observable
that they never prospered. But I proceed briefly to
point out the times of surrender of the rest of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Garrisons.</p>
               <p>In the same month<note n="e" place="margin">May</note> of <hi>May <hi>Dudley</hi>

<hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majestie having thus cast himself upon the

and protestations to him,<note place="margin">The King went from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Scot's Army at <hi>Southwell.</hi>
                  </note> I have already taken notice)
let us now behold the blessed Fruits of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> by
the subsequent Practises of these Zelots; which doth
amply make good, what King <hi>Iames</hi> long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<note n="k" place="margin">Basil. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. p. 42.</note> of that Sect; <hi>viz. that no deserts could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige;

those their solemn Oaths and Protestations,
they most perfidiously acted contrary to them; hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48510:87"/>
thereby that farther ruin, which soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
befel the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and at length
terminated in the wofull murther of their native Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
as is notoriously known to the World, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on all this, under the colour and veile of their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In order whereunto, the first thing observable, is
a plausible Letter<note n="l" place="margin">6. May. perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1166.</note> directed to the Committee of
Estates, at that time residing with the Scotch Army;
wherein they tell them; that</hi> their earnest desire, being
to keep a right understanding between the two Kigndomes,
did move them, to acquaint them, with that strange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
wherewith they were then surprised, together with
their carriage and desires thereupon; and to endeavour to
improve his Majesties being there, to the best advantage
for promoting the work of Vniformity, for setling of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Righteousness, and attaining of Peace, according
to the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> and Treaty, <hi>&amp;c. affirming,
that they</hi> had a Witness from Heaven; and that there
was nothing more in their desires, than in all their resolutions
and proceedings; to adhere to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and Treaty.</p>
               <p>¶What hopes this specious Letter might give his
Majestie for promoting his earnest endeavours, for
such an happy peace, as he desired, is hard to say;
considering what relation it had to the <hi>Solemn League
and Covenant:</hi> but his former assurances in order to
his coming to them (as I have already observed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such as they were; he became so confident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
as that, shortly after, he sent unto the two
Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> his xi th. Message<note n="m" place="margin">18. May.</note>, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
because they had made so great a noyse of setling
Religion; <hi>That,</hi> together with the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the
War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being the chief things insisted on,
in their former <hi>Propositions;</hi> he recomended to them
the advice therein of those Divines in both Kingdomes,
whom they had assembled at <hi>Westminster:</hi> And
for the <hi>Militia</hi> offred, that he would be content to
settle it, as they themselves proposed in the Treaty at
<hi>Uxbridge; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </hi> that all persons, who should be trusted
therewith might be named by the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the space of seven years; and after that time, to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48510:87"/>
be regulated as should be agreed on by his Majestie and
his two Houses of Parliament. And touching <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that he would do whatsoever was possible for
him, to give full satisfaction to them. And that,
if those his free offers would not serve; then he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that al such of their <hi>Propositions,</hi> as were then
by them agree'd on, might be speedily sent to him;
he being resolved to comply with them in every thing
that might conduce to the happiness of his subjects;
and removing all unhappy differences, which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
so many sad effects. Farther offring, that all
his forces should be forthwith disbanded; and <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
with the remainder of his other Garrisons, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
into their hands, upon honourable conditions;
and dismantled.</p>
               <p>But to this gracious Message (as to his former)
they turn'd a deaf ear; there being, then, another
Game to be play'd; which was the getting of the
King's person out of the Hands of the Scots; suspecting
(as they had cause) that those their <hi>dear Brethren</hi> would
make no little advantage thereof. Notwithstanding the
Votes<note n="f" place="margin">perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal. p. 1163.</note> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that <hi>he should be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, as they should desire and direct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which Votes at <hi>Westminster</hi> and
debates of both Houses thereupon, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
here to take notice: how they alledg'd<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. p. 1170 &amp;. 1171.</note>
that <hi>the Scottish Army in <hi>England</hi> was theirs;</hi> id est,
under their pay. Also <hi>that the King ought to be near
to his Parliament, whereby they might have recourse to
him, and obtain such things, as should be most necessary
for the Kingdomes.</hi> Likewise, <hi>that by</hi> Covenant <hi>they
were sworn to preserve the Rights and Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
but to detein the King from his Parliament was
altogether inconsistent with the</hi> Covenant.</p>
               <p>Of which Votes the Scots seem'd to take little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
but in stead thereof, and for diversion, amused
the Members at <hi>Westminster</hi> with several Letters,
which they caused to be written to them; one<note n="h" place="margin">18. Jnue. Ibid. p. 1236.</note>
from the general assembly of the Kingdome of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
wherein they told them; that <hi>their success a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Enemy</hi> (id est, the King's Forces) <hi>did lay a</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:48510:88"/>
strong obligation upon them, to improve the power put into
their Hands, for the advancement of the Kingdome of
Christ, and bringing forth the head-stone of his House:
<hi>And therefore</hi> did earnestly intreat and beseech them in
the Bowels of Christ, to give unto him the glory due to his
name, by a timeous establishment of all his Ordinances in
full integrity and power, according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Saying, that</hi> the Searcher of Hearts knew how they desired
to keep their <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>concluding with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to the Parliament,</hi> to endeavour all the ends of the
<hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other</hi>

                  <hi>to the</hi> Assembly of Divines, <hi>sitting at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein they expressed their</hi> Thanks for
their constant endeavours and labours, in the work of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the Grace of God, bestowed on you, and stir you up
to take notice; how, since you were precious in the Lord's

(even in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days) that there were found

the greatest praise of the good hand of God upon you, hath
been this; that amidst the many mists of Error and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
which have risen from the bottomless pit, to bespot
the face and darken the glory of the Church, while the

bear you on our Breasts before him night and day; and to
contribute our best endeavours to improve all opportunities
for your encouragement. And now we beseech you in the Lord
(Honourable and well-beloved) go on in this your strength,
and in the power of his might, who hath honoured you to be
faithfull. Stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ hath
made you free: And, in pursuance of this Truth, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
you will never cease to study the peace and nearer
conjunction of the Kingdomes; knowing, that a threefold
cord is not easily broken. Now the Lord Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and God even our Father, who hath loved and honoured
you, and given you everlasting consolation, and good hope
through Grace, comfort your Hearts and stablish you in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good work.</p>

                  <hi>from the said Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
at <hi>Westminster</hi> they told them,</hi> how they did
congratulate <hi>with</hi> the Lord's people in all their successes;
and did impatiently desire to have their Brethren here, and
themselves joyned nearer to Christ, and to one another in
all his Ordinances, and especially in <hi>Presbytereal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the neck of these Letters,'tis worthy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that the Marquess of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and Scottish-Commissioners,
delivered a paper<note n="m" place="margin">25. June Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1219.</note> to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> representing the Necessities of
their Army; desiring therefore, <hi>that their Quarters in
the North might be enlarged, and a considerable supply of
mony dispatcht to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most certain it is, that though these sanctified men
(both English and Scotch.) did seem to be so firmly
united by their grand Combination, called the <hi>solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league
and Covenant;</hi> as that, in humane reason few
there were that thought they could afterwards have
differed; the gayning of the King's person into their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48510:89"/>
Hands, began now to make it manifest, that this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sacred Tye, was but a mear jugling device, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
forged and set on foot for the better carrying on
their sacrilegious temporal ends. For, from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time, however they conceal'd themselves, with all
the subtilties imaginable, their animosities against each
other did daily increase (as 'twill hereafter appear)
Nevertheless, to make a specious outward shew, of
their continued accordance; they agreed together, in
sending certain <hi>Propositions</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">25. June. Propositions sent to the King at <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
                  </note> to the King (which
they had been no less than eight months in hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
in order to a well-grounded Peace, (as their
phrase was:) whereunto they required his Answer
within four days.</p>
               <p>How monstrous and unreasonable these were, the
tenor of them will sufficiently shew, (they being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
printed) in brief, that he should ratify <hi>the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn-league</hi>
and <hi>Covenant,</hi> abolish Episcopacy; invest
the subject with the power of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and exempt
from pardon several Lords and other considerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that during the war had adhered to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
His Majesty most piously and prudently made
this return; That they importing so great alterations
in Government, both in Church and Kingdome, it
was very difficult to return a particular and positive
answer to them, before a full debate, wherein their
necessary explanation, true sense, and reasons of them
were rightly weighted and understood. To which end
he desired to come to <hi>London,</hi> or any of his Houses
thereabouts, upon the publick Faith and the security
of the two Houses of Parliament, and Scottish-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.
Where, by his personal presence, he might
not onely raise a mutual confidence betwixt himself
and his people; but have those doubts cleared, and
those difficulties explained to him, which he then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be destructive to his just regal power, in
case he should give a full consent to those <hi>Propositions,</hi>
as they then stood: Engaging himself to give his chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
assent to all such Bills, as should be really to the
good and peace of his people; and to prefer the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of this Kingdome before his own particular. And,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48510:90"/>
as a farther means to work a confidence in them of
his own sincerity in these things, he offered again to
trust them with his own person: conjuring them, as
they were Christians and Subjects; and as they were
men who desired to leave a good name behind them,
so to receive and make use of that his Answer, that all
issues of bloud might be stopped, and those unhappy
distractions peaceably setled.</p>
               <p>But, as his former gracious and frequent offers, so
this, could not then find any acceptance at all with
them; by reason that it tended to the composure of
those lamentable distractions, which tended to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine of the King and Realm; their aims at first,
and continued resolutions still being to share the spoyl,
which by their strength and power they had most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
got. Nay, in stead of any kindness or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which he might rationally expect from their
many and most solemn promises and protestations,
they perpetually tormented his pious Soul, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
importunities, to take their hypocritical <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi>
and sent for several of their most rigid Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<note n="o" place="margin">Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal. p. 1233.</note>, to terrify him with their Kirk-censures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his refusal thereof.</p>
               <p>In which sad and disconsolate condition, I shall for
a while leave him; and take a short view of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
betwixt the Members sitting at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and those at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> with their respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Commissioners.</p>
               <p>The principal work being now done, here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by the help of the Scots; the Grandees here
(as well as others) began to be weary of their dear
Brethren: and for the sooner riddance of them, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Vote,<note n="p" place="margin">11. July.</note> that a Message should be sent to the
Scottish Army; <hi>that, in regard they were not usefull in
this Kingdome, for the present; and that the payment
thereof would be a great burthen thereto, they should
with all convenient speed, return into their Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Scots (never intending to be loosers by their
journey hither) knowing full well how to make the
best use of those advantages they then had, gave their
dear Brethren very good words; telling</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Weekly Accompt, Num. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>them in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48510:90"/>
their answer to the demands made in pursuance of that
Vote;</hi> that their earnest desires were, the setling of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and <hi>Church Government;</hi> which, as it was the
principal ground of their engagement in this <hi>Cause,</hi> so
would the perfecting of it be their chiefest joy, and Glory
of both Kingdomes: it being the constant resolution of that
Kingdome, against all opposition, to strengthen and cherish
the Brotherly kindness between the Kingdomes: and,
<hi>Peace</hi> setled with <hi>Truth,</hi> and those things performed by
the Honourable Houses, which by Treaty they were obliged
unto, to recall their Army, with as great alacrity, as they
were ready to send the same into <hi>England,</hi> for the assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of their Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in another Letter, speaking of the Arrears
due to their Army, they had these words</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Ibid.</note>—This
Kingdome lyeth under the burthen of great and vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
in raising and entertaining of Armies; and hath
with the lives of many precious men, set their own Houses
on fire, to quench the flame of yours. And seeing, by the
seasonable assistance afforded by this Kingdome to you, and
by the late successes wherewith God hath blessed your Armies,
you are in a great measure freed of your troubles, and are
in a far better capacity to pay the moneys, due to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than you were at any
time since the beginning of these Wars; we demand of the
honourable houses, to make payment of the summs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
duly owing to this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>¶The state of things standing thus, made the
Game now to be play'd betwixt these great Masters,
not a little difficult to each; the chief business of the
then predominant party at <hi>Westminster,</hi> being to
gain the person of the King into their own hands:
and in case he should not (upon the matter) totally
quit his Regal power to them, by taking their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and assenting to those their destructive proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before-mentioned; then to keep him close pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and exercise the same power without him.</p>
               <p>And the design of the Scots, not onely to use the
like Regal-power in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but to get a large
sum of mony to boot: considering, that having the
King in their hands, the Grandees there were able to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48510:91"/>
make their own terms on the behalf of themselves, as
to Riches and Honours. There was therefore no means
unessayed by each, for accomplishing their respective
ends: But the Arguments and debates about this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
continuing no less than six months, before all
things were fully agree'd, I shall reserve my observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon them till then; and in the mean time take
notice of what else did occur that is most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in order to the carrying on their main work; and
divide the same into two parts; the one touching
their attempts upon the King, in relation to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
and <hi>Propositions:</hi> the other towards the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the <hi>Scepter of Iesus Christ;</hi> for by that
title they called their <hi>Presbyterean Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the first; About the beginning of <hi>September,
Iames</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton, Lindsey</hi> Earl of <hi>Craford,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Cassiles,</hi> and some others, from the Estates of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> came<note n="†" place="margin">Perfect Diurnal p. 1303. &amp; 1304.</note> to <hi>Newcastle</hi> to the King;
and there earnestly solicited him to take the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
and sign the <hi>Propositions.</hi> To second which motion,
there was a petition presented to His Majesty from the
general Assembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religion,</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Church government;</hi> denouncing God's anger
upon him, and the hazard to lose the Hearts of his
good subjects, in case he assented not thereto.</p>
               <p>Soon after which, Mr. <hi>Andrew Cant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert
Blayre,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Douglass</hi> came<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1317.</note> thither also to
press him to the same purpose. To torment him
likewise yet more, one of these violent men (I mean
a rigid Presbyterean-preacher) besides many rude and
uncivil expressions<note n="v" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1419.</note> in his Sermon there before the
King; called for the 52. <hi>Psalm</hi> to be sung by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
which beginneth thus—<hi>Why do'st thou Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
boast abroad, thy wicked works to praise?</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
His Majesty instantly stood up, and called for the
56. <hi>Psalm,</hi> beginning thus—<hi>Have mercy Lord on me I
pray, for men would me devour:</hi> Which the people rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sung, waving the other.</p>
               <p>Nay, the fierceness of these Scottish-presbyters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48510:91"/>
His Sacred Majesty was such; as that upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Proposals</hi>

                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1414. &amp; 1435.</note>, made to those of them, who were
Commissioners from the general Assembly, <hi>viz. If the
King shall come into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Kingdome
of <hi>England</hi> shall exclude him of the Government there,
for his leaving them without granting the</hi> Propositions;
<hi>Whether or not it would be lawful to that Kingdome to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him for the recovery of the Government, he not granting
the</hi> Propositions, <hi>concerning</hi> Religion, <hi>and the</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>and not giving a satisfactory answer to the rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>

                  <head>Their Answer.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Quaere presupposeth the King's coming into this
Kingdome, which case (for the reasons expressed in our
late warning) we humbly conceive should not be put into
the Question: and therefore desire your Lordships to go
about all means for the present preventing of it, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of most dangerous consequence to <hi>Religion,</hi> this <hi>Kirk,</hi>
and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and to the King himself and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, if the Question be stated simply, without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
such a case in these termes.</hi> If the King be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Government in <hi>England,</hi> for not granting the
<hi>propositions</hi> concerning <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Covenant;</hi>
and for not giving a satisfactory Answer to the remanent
<hi>propositions;</hi> whether, in that case it be lawfull for this
Kingdome to assist him, for the Recovery of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Or, if it be not lawfull, being put to it, we cannot
but answere, in regard of the Engagement of this Kingdome,
by <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Treaty, Negative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Resolv'd upon the Question, That the Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> shall be governed as it hath been these
five years last past; all means being used, that the
King may take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and pass the <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Resolv'd, that the taking of the Scottish <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and passing some of the <hi>Propositions,</hi> doth not
give warrant to assist him against England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48510:92"/>
3. Resolv'd, that upon bare taking the <hi>National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
we may not receive him.</p>
                  <p>4. Resolv'd,<note place="margin">☞</note> that the Clause in the <hi>Covenant, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the King's Person,</hi> is to be understood in defence
and safety of the Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>5. Resolv'd, that the King shall not execute any
power in the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> untill such
time, as he hath granted the <hi>Propositions,</hi> concerning
<hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and given satisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to both Kingdomes in the rest of the <hi>Propositions,</hi>
presented to him by both Kingdomes at <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Resolv'd, that if His Majestie refuse to pass the
<hi>Propositions,</hi> he shall be disposed of according to the
<hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Treaty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Resolv'd, that the union be friendly kept between
the Kingdomes, according to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Treaty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By what hath last been instanc'd, tis easy enough to
be discern'd, that bargain so long in driving on, was
by this time concluded, in reference to the person of
the King (I mean the certain price for which the
Scots did sell him) which prompted them so eagerly
and frequently to press his taking their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and
consent to those destructive <hi>Propositions,</hi> which they
well knew, he could never do, without apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
to his Soul: and that he had manifestly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Arguments of Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson,</hi> whom
they brought to convince him therein. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
need to say no more of that matter, then to set
down the <hi>Quaeres</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">16. Jan.</note>, which His Majestie delivered to
the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon their last impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
him thereto, when they threatned to deliver
him up to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (as they then
called those Members at <hi>Westminster</hi>) in case of
his refusal.</p>
                  <p>It is a<note n="a" place="margin">Perfect Diurnal p. 1462.</note> receiv'd opinion by many; that Engagements,
Acts, or Promises of a restrained person, are neither valid,
nor obligatory. How true or false this is, I will not now
dispute: but I am sure, if I be not free, I am not fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
any of your <hi>Propositions:</hi> wherefore you should first
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48510:92"/>
resolve me, in what state I stand, as in relation to freedome,
before I can give you any other Answer. The Reason of this
my Question, the Governour can best resolve you. But, if
you object the loss of time, and urgency of it; certainly, in
one respect, it presses none so much as my self, which makes
me also think it necessary, that I be not to seek what to do,
when this Garrison shall be surrendred up; to demand of
you, in case I go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> if I shall be there with
Honour, Freedome, and Safety; or How; being ready to
give you a farther and more particular Answer, so soon as
you shall have resolv'd these two Quaeres.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Whereunto they give this insignificant Answer.</head>
                  <p>1. To the first, in what state you stand, as in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Freedome; the Parliaments of both Kingdomes
have given such orders, and directions, as they have
thought fittest for the safety of your Majesty and the
Kingdomes, to the General and Governour.</p>
                  <p>2. To your second <hi>Quaere,</hi> of your going into
<hi>Scotland;</hi> we shall humbly desire, that we may
not be put to give an Answer: but, if your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
shall either deny, or delay your assent to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;</hi>
we are in that case to represent to your
Majesty the resolutions of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶Having now done with their attempts upon His
Majesty in reference to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Propositions;</hi>
I come to their farther Progress for the establishing of

                  <p>But, notwithstanding all this holy Reformation, there
were some, who had not onely the Conscience to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here

was forthwith voted<note n="f" place="margin">Octob. 16. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1360.</note> to be brought in,
for repealing the Statute which enjoyn'd it. At
which time the House also ordered<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that all
Malignant Ministers (for so were the Orthodox cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
should be disabled from Preaching, and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
to be brought in for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>And, though by an Order<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 1364. 28. Octob.</note> of the House of
Commons, Mr. <hi>Sydrach Sympson</hi> (one of their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines, (and an eminent stickler for the Cause)
was, for some opinions and expressions, savouring of
<hi>Independencie,</hi> to have been silenc'd: yet, by reason of
his zeal to God's Glory (as they term'd it) that is
to say, his activeness against Episcopacie, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the Rigour of that sentence.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as they took care to disable those of the
Clergy, which were Orthodox and Loyal, from
preaching any more: so, to encourage all others
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48510:93"/>
who were for their turn, though not at all qualified
with learning, they gave liberty to every bold and
schismatical Mechanick to preach, under the notion of
<hi>Gifted-men.</hi> To which purpose an Ordinance<note n="i" place="margin">4. Novem. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1368. b.</note> was
brought in to the House, and read, for approving of
such illiterate persons to be Ministers.</p>
                  <p>And, that Episcopal Government might never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again, they passed<note n="k" place="margin">16. Nov. <hi>Scob. Col.</hi> p. 101.</note> an Ordinance for the
sale of all the Lands belonging to the Bishops; with
special instructions<note n="l" place="margin">Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal. p. 1387.</note> therein, for the Contractors
and Surveyors. Amongst which Instructions, it is
not the least observable; that for the better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
of Purchasers, they should sell them at ten
years purchase. Nay, such was their care, to make
this sacrilegious work as plausible to the people as
might be; that, besides the extraordinary pay their
Surveyors of those Lands had <hi>(viz. 20 s.</hi> a day, and
five shillings a day to every Boy that did but carry
the end of the measuring-Chain) they gave special
directions, that the Gentry and other popular-men,
residing in those parts where such Lands lay, should
be feasted by the Surveyors (which feasts amounted
to no small charge) saying, <hi>Wee must pay well and hang
well</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time also, there was a Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed<note n="m" place="margin">11. Nov. Perfect Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences.</note>
to inquire into the Value of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livings,
in order to <hi>the planting of an able Ministry,</hi> as
they gave out; whereas in truth, it was to discover which
were the best and fattest Beneficies, to the end, that
the principal Champions for the <hi>Cause,</hi> might make
choice of those for themselves (whereof some had
three a piece, and some four, as is very well known)
it being aparent, that where any small Benefice was,
there the Church-dores were shut up. The more to
justify which practice of theirs, I could name an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
man, who being told by an Eminent person,
that a certain Church in the West of <hi>England,</hi> had
no Incumbent; askt what the yearly value of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
did amount unto; and he answering sifty
pounds <hi>per annum:</hi> the Assembly man reply'd—<hi>if it
be no better worth, no Godly-man will accept of it.</hi>
                  </p>

But notwithstanding all this, the advancement of
the <hi>Scepter of Iesus Christ</hi> (that is to say, the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
the <hi>Presbyterean-Government</hi> by a Law)
went but slowly on, insomuch as the Covenanting
Brethren in <hi>London,</hi> who were dayly agitated with
the zealous breath of the <hi>Presbyterean Bellows,</hi> from the
Pulpits and otherwise; growing hot for the <hi>Scotch
Discipline,</hi> busyed themselves not a little in getting
Hands<note n="n" place="margin">5. Decem. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1406.</note> to a Petition, for prosecuting the ends of
the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and, that <hi>Presbyterie</hi> might be established.
And, for the better speed of that blessed work the
latter part of their new <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> being
brought in, by the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> and read in
the House of Commons; it was Ordered that
marginal notes should be forthwith added thereto,

Horse, Arms, Jewels, Plate and Money,
in no small proportion, so frankly offered up to this

of this great and glorious work was so near,
that the main Fabrick should begin to totter specially
by the unhappy assaults of their own Godly party;
and at last to tumble down; what could be more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48510:94"/>
deplorable? yet so it hapned. I must therefore here
begin to change my note: and, as I have Historically
manifested whence that sacred Impe of <hi>Presbytery</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
sprung; How 'twas first transplanted hither,
what a luxuriant growth in short time it had; and
what glorious fruit it produced. So shall I now
briefly shew how, and by what means it fell to decay:
and how that prodigious Monster<note n="†" place="margin">Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Independencie,</hi>
creeping up by the body thereof, at length did much
overtop it; and triumphing for a while, at last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no less direfull effects than what that old stock
of <hi>Presbyterie</hi> always did; even the barbarous destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our late gracious King (of ever blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
in his Royal person; after he had been most
inhumanly persecuted, despoiled of his Kingly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and most shamefully made Prisoner by those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Covenanters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶That Ambition and Avarice were most assuredly
the primary causes which incited this Saint-like Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to act such horrid things as no age hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
seen: and to carry on these their foul designs
under the specious veile of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Laws of the
Land,</hi> and <hi>Liberty of the subject,</hi> hath been already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifested. Having therefore, by this subtil stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
got the sword, and consequently the wealth
of the Realm into their power: I now come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
how, through the admirable justice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God upon these grand Hypocrites; which
first kindled the flames of Civil war amongst us; the
same power and wealth, was by the like ravenous
brood, now called <hi>Independents</hi> (which sprung forth
of their own pharisaical loyns) soon torn and wrested
out of their greedy Jaws, upon the like principles;
and what use they made of it.</p>
               <p>By what hath been already said, 'tis sufficiently
manifest, how and to what end the establishment of
the <hi>Scottish Discipline,</hi> was first and principally aymed
at by the <hi>Presbyterean</hi> party here; but the severity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being at length discerned by some, through a
cleerer Light; the new Reformers thought it most
proper, not onely to represent to the People, the true
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48510:95"/>
face thereof in its proper shape; but to hold forth
unto them an absolute freedome from the merciless
phangs and teeth of that cruel beast, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Christian-Liberty;</hi> whereby every man might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
himself in the pretended service of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what form or order he list, as <hi>Independent</hi>
from any that could call him to account; which
pleasing Doctrine being not a little gratefull to the
vulgar, soon obtain'd so fair an entertainment
especially amongst the souldiery; as that, not onely
the generallity of the Army and many of the Garisons
cheerfully embraced it; but most of the people, through
out all parts of the Realm, right willingly inclin'd
thereto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-Hedge being therefore thus troden
down; no wonder was it, that, like scattered Flocks,
multitudes were gathered up by other Shepherds into
new Congregations; <hi>Anabaptists, Millenaries</hi> (or fifth
Monarchy-men) <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. each differing from
other in divers material points; but all centring in
opposition to <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> which strange opinions (no
less absurd than various) were so inconsistent with the
zealous <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> (who termed them Heretical
and Blasphemous) that they spared for no pains in
endeavouring to suppress them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Tenets and practices of these</hi> Independent-<hi>Libertines, let this one instance serve for a Tast; one
Mr.</hi> Gregory <hi>(of Colonel</hi> Rich <hi>his Regiment) preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a Widows house near</hi> Northampton; <hi>told his
Auditors,</hi> that he thought he was obliged to unfold the
Scripture, as it was revealed to him: <hi>Likewise,</hi> that
he hoped to see the Shop-windows open on the Lord's day:
<hi>Also,</hi> that the Psalms were no Scripture; and, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that Parish was a Minister of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding this apparent danger to the
<hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> from this blessed brood of their own
hatching, some confidence they yet had of putting a stop
to their farther growth: to that end therefore (as to
their former notable pranks they frequently did) by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Ordinance</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">1. Feb. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1471.</note>, they caused a day to be set a part for
humbling themselves, and seeking of God (as they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48510:95"/>
term'd it) by fasting and prayer, the preamble where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have thought fit here to insert;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We the Lords and Commons assembled in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi>
                  </hi> having entred into a <hi>solemn
Covenant,</hi> to endeavour sincerely, really and constantly,
the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> in Doctrine, Discipline, and
Worship; and the extirpation of Popery, Superstition, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Schism, Prophaneness, and whatsoever shall be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godlyness: And,
having found the presence of God wonderfully assisting us in
this <hi>Cause,</hi> especially since our Engagement in pursuance
of the said <hi>Covenant;</hi> have thought fit (lest we partake
in other mens sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of
their plagues) to set forth this our deep sense of the great
dishonour of God, and perillous Condition, that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is in, through the abominable Blasphemies, and
damnable Heresies vented and spread abroad therein; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the subversion of the Faith, contempt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Ordinance of Iesus Christ. And, as we are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to imploy and improve the utmost of our power, that
nothing be said or done against the Truth, but for the Truth:
So we desire, that both our selves, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may be deeply humbled before the Lord, for that great
reproach and contempt, which hath been cast upon his
name, and saving Truths; and for that swift destruction,
which we may justly fear will fall upon the immortal Souls
of such, who are or may be drawn away, by giving heed to
seducing Spirits. In the hearty and tender compassion
whereof, we the said Lords and Commons do order and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
that <hi>Wednesday,</hi> being the tenth day of <hi>March</hi>
next be set apart for a day of publick Humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to back this their Godly Exercise (forasmuch
as their solemn <hi>League and Covenant</hi> had effected such
great matters otherwise) the House of Peers soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
voted<note n="p" place="margin">8. Febr. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 1479.</note> an <hi>Ordinance</hi> to be brought in, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
every person whatsoever, from bearing any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Civil or Military, that should refuse to take the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>

But that which they deemed above all, not onely
to get a hand over this many-headed-Monster <hi>(Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie)</hi>
but to establish to themselves a lasting domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the persons and Estates of all other people
was to gain the King's person into their power; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom they had been trucking with the Scots
for the space of six months at the least (his Majestie
being all that while at <hi>Newcastle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> and
their Army quartered in the Adjacent Counties) not
without some Heart-burnings towards those their dear
Brethren, for keeping him so long, and continuing
their Army in this Realm, at so vast a charge and

               <p>
                  <hi>Nor did this deteiner pass without some quick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes

had no right of joynt exercise of interest, in disposing

                  <hi>likewise; that</hi> forasmuch as he had deserted
his Parliament and People; entred into, and continued in
a bloudy and dangerous war against them; had not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those <hi>Propositions,</hi> which by both Kingdomes were
sent unto him, as a means of a safe and well-grounded
peace: he was not therefore at present in a condition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, after much dispute the Scots in brief told</hi>

                  <hi>them; that</hi> their Army by the Oath of Allegiance, their

that<note n="u" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</note> it was the Law and common practise of all Nations,
not to deliver the meanest subject fled to them, though

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48510:96"/>

               <p>

the ends of a solemn <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi>
whereof one Article is, <hi>to preserve and defend his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's

exercise of that Right and Interest in this Kingdome. <hi>And
therefore said;</hi> it seemed very strange that when upon
invitation they were come into <hi>England,</hi> as for other
ends, so <hi>to defend his Majestie's person,</hi> their being in

                  <hi>Whereunto the English Commissioners replyed;</hi>
that the Scotch-Army came in hither as Auxiliaries, under
pay; and therefore they ought not to capitulate herein at
all. <hi>And that whereas the Scots did so much urge
their Obligation by the</hi> Covenant, <hi>to</hi> preserve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the King's person and Authority; <hi>they told<note n="y" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 21, 54, &amp; 55.</note> them</hi>
that they left out the principal Clause, which was relative
<hi>viz.</hi> in the preservation and defence of the true Religion
and Liberties of the Kingdomes, without which the other
part ought never to be mention'd</p>
               <p>But the plain truth is, that all this fencing with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
came at last to a meer Money-business.
For whereas the Grandees at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation

on; the one half in hand, upon delivery up of the

mouths of those Vultures, and put a period to all this
hot contest: All their Oaths and Obligation whereon

the two Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the Lord

of his People for the future, and firm establishment of the

               </p>
               <p>In which Petition it was also desired, that for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Parliament and City, such as had been in
opposition to the Parliament (id est, loyal to the
King) might be removed out of the City, and kept
at a distance from his Majestie's Royal presence. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1525.</note> likewise to the whole world, that they
still were, and resolved to remain in their zeal as fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to the Parliament as ever: And, according to
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> did next under God rely upon the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Justice of the Parliament, for settlement of
their Peace and Prosperity.</p>
               <p>And, discerning the <hi>Independent</hi>-party of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
beginning to be then predominant,<note place="margin">Anno 1647.</note> had drawn
the Army neerer to the City of <hi>London,</hi> than the
Grandees at <hi>Westminster</hi> did well like; it was by
them farther petitioned, that the Army might be
forthwith removed, and with all convenient speed
disbanded: As also, that the Court of Common-Council
might have authority to elect Members for
the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City, in pursuance of a former
Petition of theirs to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, after much debate and quick dispute
(the <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-party in the House being at that
time most numerous) it was resolved<note n="†" place="margin">27. April. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1569.</note>, that the
whole Army, Horse and Foot should be disbanded;
onely<note n="*" place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie p. 33.</note> five thousand Horse, one thousand Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and some few Fire-locks to be continued in
pay, for the safety of this Kingdome; and some to
be sent for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which vote so awakened the Souldiery, that no less
than eight Regiments of Horse, soon sent up a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Petition
<note n="t" place="margin">30. April. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1572.</note> to the Parliament, wherein they give
reasons why they could not engage, in the service of
<hi>Ireland:</hi> (for thither 'twas resolved they should go
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48510:99"/>
upon their disbanding) and complained of many
scandalous suggestions, which had been raised against
them, and their proceedings: as also, that they saw
designes put upon them, and upon many of the
Godly party in the Kingdome. Signifying likewise,
that they could not engage for <hi>Ireland,</hi> till they
were satisfied in their expectations, and their just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
granted.</p>
               <p>But these things, as yet, being not publickly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
on, nor own'd by any other than the common
Souldiers; it was ordered<note n="v" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that Major-General
<hi>Skyppon,</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Commissary-General
<hi>Ireton,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> should be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sent down to the Army, to acquaint them, that
there should be a considerable sum of money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them, before their disbanding; and that
their Accompts should be audited: as also an Act of
Indemnity for all the mischeif they had done in the
time of warr; it being expected, that this bountiful
and gracious offer, would quiet their stirring Spirits,
and incline them to submit tamely to the pleasure of
their great Masters.</p>
               <p>And so confident, at that time, were the <hi>Presbytere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>-party
in the two Houses at <hi>Westminster</hi> to baffle
their <hi>Independent</hi> offspring, by this artifice of disbanding
the Army; that to make room for them in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
upon their riddance here, they fram'd an Ordinance<note n="x" place="margin">11. May. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 1584.</note>,
for clearing that Kingdome of those Scottish forces,
which were then imploy'd there, as Auxiliaries against
the Irish-Rebels. And soon after, did accordingly
order<note n="y" place="margin">25. May. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1601.</note>, that the Army should be disbanded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
first with the General's Regiment (then at
<hi>Chelmesford</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>) and that so many of them as
would engage for Ireland, should be presently taken
on, and a fortnights pay advanced to them, together
with two months pay of their arrears. The like for
the rest of the Army, at their respective Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzes.</p>
               <p>But whilst these now distinct parties of Godly men,
were thus striving for Masteries; the King, who still
was kept at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> under a most deplorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straynt;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48510:99"/>
(and the whole Kingdome under grievous
oppressions) finding no sense at all in them, neither
of His, nor his peoples miseries, sent his sixteenth Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<note n="z" place="margin">12. May. The King's 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note>; wherein, complaining of his disconsolate
condition there; his Servants being denyed access to
him; none admitted to bring or receive any Letters
from him: nor any other but the Parliaments Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
(who were then his Spyes as well as
Guardians) to converse with him: by which means
he was not Master of those ordinary Actions, which
are the undoubted right of every free-born-man, how
mean soever; and so not qualified to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
nor give Answers (as himself did then most
rationally observe,) yet so much was he desirous of
peace; that unto those <hi>Propositions,</hi> which they sent to
him at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> when he was in custody of the
Scots <hi>(viz. 25. Iune An.</hi> 1646.) and whereupon he
then gave a general Answer, with desire to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to treat personally with them at <hi>Westminster;</hi>
that, presuming they might insist upon the same still;
he did then, by this his 16th. Message, as to <hi>Religion,</hi>
offer to confirm the <hi>Presbyterean-government,</hi> the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Divines</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the <hi>Directory</hi>
for three years, being the time required by those <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;</hi>
so that himself and his Houshold were not
hindred from that order in Gods service, which they
had formerly used. Offering, that a free consultation
should be had with those their Divines at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
twenty of his own nomination being
added thereto; whereby it might be determined
what Government in the Church should be after
those three years.</p>
               <p>But, as to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he told them, that he was
not satisfied therein; desiring, that upon his admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>London,</hi> he might be assisted with the advice
of such of his own Chaplains, and other Divines, as
he should think fit to consult with: farther signifying
to them; that the <hi>Militia</hi> by Sea and Land, in case it
were onely as a security, for preservation of the peace
of his Kingdome (after due performance of all other
Agreements, then to be considered of) should be, for
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48510:100"/>
the space of ten years, in the hands of such persons,
as the two Houses should nominate.</p>
               <p>And as to the prosecution of the War in <hi>Ireland</hi>
(other things being agree'd) he would give them
satisfaction therein [those being the most material of
these <hi>Propositions.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But, to be short; the guilt of these men, being
like that of <hi>Cain</hi> (greater than in their own opinion
could ever be forgiven) they still cryed out, <hi>that
His Majesty was averse to peace, and never yet pleased to
accept of any tender, fit for them to make: nor to offer any
fit for them to receive.</hi> And their preachers were still
taught to pray, <hi>that God would incline the King's Heart,
to come to His Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶Leaving His Majesty therefore out of all hopes
to obtain any good by these his earnest and incessant
Messages; I now return to the Grandees of the Army,
who had, about this time, a considerable Game to
play, (the most active of them being then become
<hi>Independent</hi>) whose main work was to avoid disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
yet not to be seen therein, in the least manner
themselves. To which end, as at the first beginning
of this woful Rebellion, the rabble and baser sort of
people in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were piped up by the zealous
Kirkmen, to lead on the Dance; the <hi>Gentry</hi> next, and
<hi>Nobility</hi> last (as they discern'd the way) following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same Musick: So were the Common-souldiers
here taught to appear in opposition to those Orders of
the Parliament; whereupon at<note n="a" place="margin">25. May. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 1604.</note> 
                  <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
in the first place they alledg'd, that they were at that
time, no less than fifty six weeks pay in arreare; so that
the eight weeks pay voted, was not a considerable part
thereof. Next, that no visible security was given, for
what should not then be payd. Thirdly<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 1605.</note> that nothing
was done for their Vindication: and that having been
declared Enemies, and sent home, they might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against as Enemies, unless that Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Army of <hi>March</hi> the XIIIth. was recalled: and
therefore they petitioned the General, for a publick
Rendevouz, whereat their Grievances might be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
Whereupon intimation<note n="c" place="margin">29. May. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1606.</note> was given; that,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48510:100"/>
these things considered, there would be a necessity for
the officers complyance with the Souldiers, lest that
Rendevouz should otherwise prove tumultuous, and
destructive to the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>In which petition; considering the late Order for
disbanding, without redressing their Grievances, or
vindicating the Army; or calling such persons to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
who had been Intenders or Contrivers of their
destruction; they desired, that he would speedily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a general Rendevouz, and to use his utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
that they might not be <hi>disbanded,</hi> before
their sad and pressing greivances were heard and fully
redressed.</p>
               <p>Which Petition being communicated<note n="d" place="margin">30. May. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1608.</note> by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to the two Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> did so
startle their High and Mightynesses there; that they
forthwith ordered<note n="*" place="margin">3. June <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1611.</note> to the common Souldiers, all
their Arrears, deducting free Quarter, according to
the usual Rules of the Army. Also, that the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
officers should have the like: and the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-officers
one months pay more, added to the two
formerly voted. Likewise, that the Declaration against
the Army (before mentioned) should be rased out of
the Journals of both Houses, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
And that there should be an Ordinance drawn
up, for their farther satisfaction, in point of <hi>Indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
with an <hi>Ordinance</hi>

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:48510:102"/>
¶There is nothing more certain, than that at this
time, there was so great a terrour upon the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>-Grandees
sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by reason that
the Army had gotten the person of the King into their
hands, that they left no likely means unessayed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the two Interests; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Presbyterean,</hi> then
predominant in the Parliament, and <hi>Independent</hi> in
the Army, whereof to give particular instances would
be too tedious. Nor is it less true, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who
all this while sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and by his
trusty confidents called <hi>Agitators,</hi> actuating the Army)
did put them upon all those practises; and, the more
to fool his fellow-members, did with the greatest asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations
imaginable, confidently profess his dislike
of the Souldiers refractoriness: assuring the House,
that if he might have leave to go down to the Army,
he would undertake they should submit, and lay
down their Arms at the Parliament door.</p>
               <p>Which vain hope did then so far dote most of
the Members; that some of them said publickly;
that, having done such glorious things for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as a chief Commander in the Army<note place="margin">The Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz of the Army at <hi>Triplo-Heath.</hi>
                  </note>) and
now, that he would qualify the Souldiers in this
their desperate mutiny, <hi>he deserved to have a Statue in
Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, having by this artifice, obtain'd liberty to get
away; when he came to the Rendevouz<note n="m" place="margin">10. June. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1623.</note>, at <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo-Heath;</hi>
he did not onely approve of all that they
had done, but openly joyn'd<note n="n" place="margin">Hist. Inde. p. 34.</note> with them in all their
bold Engagements, Declarations, Remonstrances, and
Manifestos; saying to some in private, that <hi>now he had
got the King into his Hands, he had the Parliament in
his Pocket:</hi> but protested his ignorance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
adding<note n="o" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 35.</note> an Execration upon his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in asseverating thereof.</p>
               <p>And, as heretofore the leading-members at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
did usually pen petitions, and send them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by those of their party, for countenanceing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they had a mind to act: so (then) did the
Grandees of the Army, not being ignorant what
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48510:102"/>
advantages had formerly been made of those devises
<hi>viz.</hi> one from<note n="p" place="margin">Perfect Diurnal p. 1625.</note> 
                  <hi>Essex</hi> to the General, in the
name of the well-affected-People there: desiring,
<hi>that in regard of the present unsettled condition of the
Kingdome and the design of many to deprive the subject of
their liberty, he would not consent to the disbanding of the
Army, nor any part thereof, untill there should be a general
settlement of things in the Kingdome.</hi> The like Petitions
from<note n="q" place="margin">Perfect Diurnal p. 1625.</note> 
                  <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> desiring <hi>that there
might be no disbanding untill the general grievances were
redrest and Iustice done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But see the dreadfull horrors and apprehensions,
which attend the Consciences of wicked men in times
of distress and danger! No sooner did the Army
march from the parts about <hi>Triplo</hi> towards St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans;</hi>
but the <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-Members at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and those of that gang in London, fell into
such Agonies; that they forthwith ordered<note n="r" place="margin">12. June. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1626.</note> all
the Trayned-Bands in <hi>London</hi> to be raised upon
pain of Death; and strong Guards to be set about
the Line: nay, that all the Citizens should shut up
their Shops. So that whereas formerly his Majestie's
incessant Messages to them for peace, were contemn'd
and laid aside; and when they had bought him of
the Scots, he must not be suffered to come nearer
<hi>Westminster</hi> (where they hatch'd all their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
contrivances against him) than <hi>Holdenby</hi> in
<hi>Northamptonshire;</hi> now they voted his coming to
<hi>Richmund,</hi> and did vouchsafe to write Letters to
him.</p>
               <p>But alas, too late; <hi>Independencie</hi> being then trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and <hi>Presbytery</hi> gasping (as you will see by and

                  <note n="†" place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie p. 36.</note>,
<hi>that no place might be proposed for his Majestie's residence

a paper<note n="t" place="margin">21. June. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1612.</note> was sent to the Houses at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
intituled <hi>the Representation</hi> of <hi>the Army.</hi> In
which it was in the first place required, <hi>that the
Houses should be speedily purged of such Members as for

they Voted that the Army should remove four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> being in number no less
than <hi>Eleven</hi> of their chief Members, who had from the
beginning vigorously born the heat of the day.</p>
               <p>Great stickling indeed there was by all their party
to have preserv'd those men still in that holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave:
but all would not do; for it was clearly
discern'd<note n="x" place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie p. 37.</note> that by their power in the House, the
<hi>Ordinance for disbanding the Army</hi> did pass. So that to
avoid suspending the whole House, it was thought
most fit that these men should retire. And so they
did<note n="y" place="margin">26. June. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1627.</note>; it being high time: for the Army did not
stick to threaten<note n="z" place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie p. 37.</note> to march up to <hi>Westminster,</hi>
if those Members were not suspended; courting the
City of <hi>London</hi> to sit Neutralls, and let them work
their will with the Parliament.</p>
               <p>This indeed was a stroke almost fatal to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterean:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26. June. the King remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Royston</hi> to <hi>Hatfield.</hi>
                  </note>
for it lost them not onely all these leading-men,
but a far greater number that staid: some
falling off from that side under colour of clearer Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:
and some others were so much daunted
thereat, that they had not afterwards courage enough
to hold up their heads as formerly: But upon the
retiring of these <hi>Eleven Members,</hi> the prosecution of
their charge was totally forborn.</p>
               <p>And now that the House was thus purged the
greater part of the remaining Members became most
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48510:103"/>
obsequious to the Army; and declared<note n="a" place="margin">28. June. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1630.</note>, <hi>that they

to be kept throughout the whole Kirk of that
Kingdome; setting forth a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Causes
moving them thereunto, the Copy whereof I have
thought fit here to insert.</p>
               <p>1.—That, notwithstanding our solemn Engagement
in the <hi>Covenant;</hi> our Obligations for great and singular
mercies, and our many warnings by Iudgments of all sorts:
yet, not onely do we come far short of that sobriety, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and Holiness, that becometh the Gospel of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: but ungodliness and worldly lusts abound every
where throughout the land, unto the grieving of the Lord's
Spirit, and provoking of the eyes of his glory, and to
make him increase his plagues upon us; and to punish us
seven times more, because we continue to walk contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
               <p>2. That the Lord's hand is still stretched out against us,
in the Iudgment of the Pestilence, which spreads not onely in
several parts of the Country; but continueth and increaseth
in many of the most eminent Cities of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>3. The great danger that threatens Religion and the
work of Reformation, in these Kingdomes, for the number,
power, and policy of the Secretaries in England; which
are like, not onely to interupt the progress of uniformity,
and the establishment of the Ordinances of God, in their
beauty and perfection; but to overturn the foundation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
laid, and all that hath been built thereupon, with
the expence of so much bloud and pains.</p>
               <p>And therefore we are earnestly to pray to the Lord, that
<hi>the solemn League and Covenant</hi> may be kept fast and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable,
notwithstanding all the purposes and endeavours
of open Enemies, and secret underminigs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>We are to intreat the Lord, on the behalf of the King's
Majesty, that he may be reconcil'd to God; and that he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48510:104"/>
may be now furnished with wisdome and councill from above,
that he be not involved in new snares, to the endangering
of himself and these Kingdomes; but that his Heart may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to such resolutions, as will contribute for setling of
<hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are also to intreat the Lord, on the behalf of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of England; of the Synod of Divines; and of all
such in that Land, as do unfeignedly mind the work of
God; that they may not be discouraged nor swerve in the
day of temptation; but that every of them in their Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and according to their places and callings, may be
furnished with Light and Strength from Heaven, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their duty with faithfulness and zeal.</p>
               <p>We are to supplicate for direction to our Committee of
Estates, that they may discern the times, and know what
is fitting to be done, for securing our selves and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
our Brethren.</p>
               <p>We are to pray for a Spirit of Light, of Love unto our
Assembly, that they may be instrumental in preserving
Truth, and advancing Holiness amongst our selves; and
for carrying on the work of God amongst our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Lord would pour out upon all sorts of persons,
in these Kingdomes, a Spirit of Grace and Supplication,
that it may repent us of all our Iniquities; and that we
may be reconcil'd unto the Lord; that so all tokens of his
wrath may be removed from amongst us, and he may bless
us with the sweet fruits of Truth and Peace.</p>
               <p>It cannot easily be thought, but that the Scots did
somewhat more than <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> considering the
desperate condition wherein their <hi>Covenanting-Brethren,</hi>
especially at <hi>Westminster</hi> and in <hi>London,</hi> then
stood; and that <hi>the great work of Reformation</hi> (as they
call'd it) lay in such hazard. But, at such a distance
what more could soon be expected, than that they
should by the help of the zealous Preachers, earnestly
incite the <hi>Covenanters</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to bestir themselves;
and put more courage into those drooping Members,
who (after the late purge) were then left in the House,
which (for certain) they under-hand in some sort
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48510:105"/>
did; and were like enough, above board, to have
done much more; considering that by an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. of Ind. p. 40.</note> of <hi>May</hi> the 4th. then past, the <hi>Militia</hi> of
that great City was established in the hands of such
persons as were nominated by the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Common-Council there. To secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
therefore against this iminent danger, the Army
were necessitated, by picking a quarrel<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 39. &amp; p. 40.</note> with the
City, to wrest the <hi>Militia</hi> out of their hands, and then
totally to cleanse the House at <hi>Westminster</hi> of the
remaining <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-humour, by a stronger purge
then it formerly had.</p>
               <p>In order whereunto, there was a Letter<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid.</note> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
sent from General <hi>Fairfax</hi> and the Army, together
with a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
demanding the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City, to be put into their
Hands. Whereupon the House of Commons tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and readily voted<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the repealing of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>May</hi> the 4th. and presently passed a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
for reviving the old <hi>Militia;</hi> and transmitted
it to the Lords.</p>
               <p>Which unexpected change caused the City to meet
<note n="i" place="margin">24. July. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 41.</note> in <hi>Common-Council,</hi> and to resolve of Petitioning the
Parliament again therein, within two days following.
And so they did<note n="k" place="margin">26. July. <hi>Ib.</hi>
                  </note> by their Sheriffs, and some of
the Common-Council. But, to second this Petition
there followed them (within three hours) some
thousands of Apprentices, and other stout fellows with
another Petition, whereby they claim'd the <hi>Militia</hi> as
the Citie's Birthright by sundry Charters, confirm'd in
former Parliaments: for defence whereof they alledg'd,
that they had adventured their Lives as far as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
and thereupon <hi>desired, that the Militia might be
put again into the same Hands, in which it was put with
the Parliament and Citie's consent upon the 4th. of May.</hi>
And this they did in so tumultuous a fashion, that the
Lords (who were then but seven in number) presently
granted it.</p>
               <p>And having so done, and sent it to the Commons,
slipping out by a postern, went themselves away by
water. But the Commons having no mind to displease
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48510:105"/>
the Army, refus'd to do the like; and angrily bad the
Apprentices to be gone, intending to rise and adjourn
themselves. Which purpose of theirs being discern'd
by those youngsters, was by them soon prevented, by
shutting up their doors, and peremptorily requiring
their complyance with the Lords. The Commons
therefore seeing themselves in this streight, did at
length (with much unwillingness) yeild to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of these their bold Suitors: and, not onely
so, but were by them forc't to pass a farther vote;
which was, <hi>that the King should be admitted to come to</hi>
London <hi>to treat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this uproar being made known to the Grandees
of the Army, the greatest advantage imaginable was
made thereof. For the confiding Members, being
thereupon sent for to the Army, fled<note n="l" place="margin">29. July. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 43.</note> to the Head-Quarters
at <hi>Windsore</hi> within three days after; the
Speaker also bearing them Company; who, having
cousened the State of vast sums of Money, was
threatned with an Impeachment if he did not come
with them.</p>
               <p>Of the House of Commons that so fled<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the
Army, the number was said to be above fourty: and
of the Lords which came after, the names were these;

Commons, then sitting at <hi>Westminster</hi> ordered
to be published throughout all <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales;</hi> wherein (after a large preamble) they went
on thus;</p>
               <p>—We do, in the presence of Almighty-God, profess, that
there is nothing in the world, that we more desire, than
that His Majesty may be put and left free, in such an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
condition and capacity, as his person may appear
to be at Liberty, to receive and treat upon such <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
as shall be presented unto him from the Parliaments
of both Kingdomes: for our Consciences tell us, that whilst
his royal person is environ'd by an Army, and remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power thereof, we cannot expect that either His
Majestie's Princely Heart, can give that free assent unto
those things, which shall be propounded unto him, as is
requisite: or if he do, cannot hope, with good reason, that
we and our posterity shall, without alteration enjoy the
same: And therefore we are resolved; earnestly (yet with
humility) to apply our selves to the Parliament, to this
purpose: and hope, that all good Subjects, who are touched
with any sense of that duty and allegiance, which by the
Law of God and man, they owe unto the King, will unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
joyn with us therein.</p>
               <p>We cannot omit also to declare unto the Kingdome, how
we have sadly observed, since the <hi>Eleven accused Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
withdrew themselves; and that the Army hath daily
grown upon the Parliament; that a great and considerable
number of other Members of the House of Commons, have
also retired themselves, to the endangering of the Kingdom,
which never more needed a full Council: And, therefore,
we shall make our speedy address to the honourable House of
Commons, to call in all the Members of their House, residing
in the Army, or retired to their dwellings, by leave of the
House or otherwise. And we shall particularly insist upon
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48510:106"/>
the readmission of the <hi>Eleven Members,</hi> lately driven out
of the House of Commons, by the violent pursuit of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
contrary to the sense of the same House, the Law of
the Land, and the Priviledges of Parliament: wherein
also we are confident, all good English-men, and Lovers
of their Country, will adhere unto them and us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we declare, that we sincerely desire an happy and
speedy Peace, by the settlement of true Religion in this
Kingdome; by re-establishing His Majesty in his just Rights
and Authority; by upholding all lawful Priviledges of a
free Parliament; by maintaining the Fundamental Laws
of the Land; by restoring and securing the Subject unto,
and in his just liberty and property; and, by freeing the
long oppressed Kingdome of all Taxes, and enforced free
Quarter, towards the maintenance of an Army, which of
a long time hath had no visible Enemy to encounter.
And from this Resolution (by the blessing of God) we shall
never recede, for any earthly consideration, or advantage
whatsoever.</p>

by some of them, that the Speaker should command

might then attend the House.</p>
               <p>But these motions were violently opposed, with

¶Being thus entring upon one of the last Scenes
in this most woful Tragedy; I must look back a little;
and, from what hath been said, summarily observe;
first that however specious and plausible the <hi>Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Vows,</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> of these monstrous men
have otherwise been; their chief design originally was
to destroy and extirpate Monarchy, in all His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
Realms and Dominions. Secondly; that, when
by the assistance of the giddy-multitude (deluded and
captivated with many glorious promises) they had got
the sway of all into their Hands; they most traiterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murthered the King in his politick capacity; setting
him totally aside, as to Authority and Rule; and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
burying him alive, by a severe and barbarous
imprisonment, most insolently tooke the Reynes of
Government into their own usurping power.</p>
               <p>Next, that as <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> eagerly incited
some Grandees of the faction to shoulder out the rest,
from sharing with them in the spoyl they had got;
though no less active than themselves, in accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the general ruine: the like haughty and covetous
desires prompted others, to be no less solicitous for
their own temporal advantage. So that, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of miscarriages and corruptions in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was at first cryed up by the <hi>Presbyterean-Brethren;</hi>
and nothing in sted thereof exercised but oppression
and destruction: So likewise, under as fair and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretences, the power was soon wrested from that
seeming Holy Generation, by the more Seraphick-Saints
of the <hi>Independent</hi> Tribe; who, captivating the
<hi>Souldierie</hi> at last, as the <hi>Presbytereans</hi> had done the
<hi>people</hi> at first by their splended allurements, with an
imaginary Happiness; got the King by that means,
into their own cruel Hands: and then subjugating the
City of <hi>London</hi> (which had been both Mother and
Nurse to that Imparallel'd Rebellion) made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of their Task the less difficult.</p>
               <p>And as this grand work was originally begun by
the <hi>Presbytereans,</hi> under the Popular name of a <hi>Blessed-Parliament</hi>
(by which subtile Enchantment the vulgar
were at first most cunningly abused) and pursued to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48510:109"/>
the utter <hi>subversion of the King's regal power.</hi> So was it
carryed on by the <hi>Independent</hi> to the last (as by and
by shall be manifested) untill it became thoroughly
compleated in the horrid <hi>murther of his royal person:</hi>
towards the perpetration of which prodigious Fact,
I shall now briefly shew, by what degrees and steps
they did most audaciously proceed.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus subjugated the City, and
purg'd the two Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
(as is already observed) they then put

under that disguise, pretending their desire to make
peace with the King, presented<note n="o" place="margin">7. Septem. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1727.</note> him with the

                  <hi>that</hi> unto some

of the Army, and of all those whose affections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
with them: <hi>And therefore desired that the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
of the Army might be likewise treated on, in order
to the setling of a lasting peace; <hi>still urging his desires
of a</hi> personal Treaty.</p>
               <p>But to this, vouchsafing him no reply at all, they
cast off that veile and proceeded yet farther in bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the City, by Impeaching<note n="q" place="margin">24. Sept. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1748.</note> the Lord Mayor, divers
Aldermen, and some eminent Citizens, for having
an Hand in the <hi>Petition, Engagement,</hi> and <hi>Force upon the

                  <hi>It is not the least observable; that, as at this time
the</hi> Independent <hi>Grandees were laying the foundation
of their own future dominion: So the</hi> Presbyterean <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
though then under Hatches, were as busy, as in
such a condition was possible; setting on the old</hi>-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
<hi>in <hi>Scotland</hi> to make a loud noise, as appears
by a Letter</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">6. Nov. Ib. p. 1796.</note> 
                  <hi>from their Commissioners (then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at Westminster) sent to the two Houses of
Parliament, chiefly concerning their</hi> Lord and Sovereign
the King <hi>(for so they call'd him) wherein they took
notice, that he was still under the power of the Army;
and of the many</hi> Professions <hi>and</hi> Engagements <hi>made by
the said Houses to the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland; viz.</hi>
                  </hi>
that they would take care of the preservation of his person,
and of his just Power and Greateness, which both Kingdomes
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48510:110"/>
had sworn <hi>(as that Letter did import)</hi> not to diminish.
Also, that they were Informed of some intentions by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to remove His Majesty from <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And
finding that their stability and happiness did so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the safety and preservation of his royal person;
being resolv'd that the alteration of affairs, should never ☜
separate them from the duty and allegiance they did owe
unto him; nor from their constant resolution to live in all
loyalty under his Government; they had often shewn their
earnest desires, and contributed their utmost endeavours,
towards the composure of those unhappy differences. <hi>And,</hi>
that the Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> having by their Votes
of October the xxvith. intimated unto them their resolution
to apply themselves to His Majesty: as also, that they
were preparing <hi>Propositions</hi> to be tendred to him; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that they might be expedited, and communicated to
them; that, according to their many Engagements, and
relations, there might still be a conjunction of Councils in
those things which were for the Common-peace, and joynt
Interest of both Kingdomes: And therefore, that for the
assisting of them, in clearing His Majestie's doubts, and
for giving mutual satisfaction to each other; they desired,
in the name of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that there
might be a <hi>Personal Treaty with His Majesty,</hi> as the
best and readyest means to obtain the joynt desires of both
Kingdomes: And, to that end, that the King might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to come to <hi>London,</hi> with that Honour, Freedome
and respect, as was due to His Majesty; or at least, remain
at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and not to be under the power and
restraynt of the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>But this project of the Scots for a <hi>Personal Treaty,</hi>
which might in any sort tend to the good of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
or the people, was then set on foot too late; the
Grandees of the Army, at that time driving on another
designe, in order to his absolute destruction; wherein
the common Souldiers were to act their parts, by those
pernicious Instruments, called <hi>Adjutators:</hi> which was
by making shew to frame certain Articles, in order for
setling the Liberties of the people, and Interest of the
Army; and this to be called <hi>the Agreement of the people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people.</note>

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:48510:111"/>
To which end they chang'd their Guards; putting
such upon him as were more strict, and discharging
well nigh all his Servants, whom they had formerly
admitted to wait on him. The tenor of which Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
called <hi>the Agreement of the people</hi> was to this
effect.</p>
               <p>1. That there should be a more equal distribution,
by <hi>Counties, Cities</hi> and <hi>Boroughs,</hi> for election of their
Representatives in Parliament.</p>
               <p>2. That the Parliament, then sitting, should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
upon the last day of <hi>September, anno</hi> 1648. then
next ensuing.</p>
               <p>3. That the people might, of course, choose a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for themselves every two year; and to begin
on the first Thursday in <hi>April,</hi> then next following,
and to end upon the last of <hi>September</hi> ensuing.</p>
               <p>4. That<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1799.</note> the people were thenceforth to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Supream-power,</hi> whereunto that, and all future
<hi>Representatives</hi> should be subordinate and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>This not pleasing the Members at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
was by them voted to be the very destruction of the
Parliament, and fundamental Laws of this Kingdome;
But no less active were they themselves (though in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
in framing an Impeachment against the King,
by the name of <hi>Charles Stuart;</hi> a Committee being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to collect together all His Majestie's Letters, and
other Papers taken at <hi>Navesby,</hi> or elsewhere; to the
end they might be ready, when the House should have
occasion to use them: Yet all this while <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who
was the very Soul of that party) did so play the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodexter,
that he sometimes made shew to the King,
how well he was pleased with his late Answer to those
<hi>Propositions</hi> from the Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in that
he seemed more to approve of the Armies <hi>Proposals,</hi>
than those from thence: At other, heightning the
Grandees there, by all the subtilties imaginable against
His Majestie's Answer: But privately spurring on the
Agitators to the greatest fierceness that might be: yet
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48510:111"/>
whispering to the King such a fear of their unrulyness,
as that His Majesty stood in no little danger to be
clandestinely murthered by the Hand of some hot-spirited
Enthusiast.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND here to enlarge a little farther upon this
grand Impostor <hi>Cromwell</hi> (from the relation
of a person of credit, who was at that time
a confident of his) I shall observe; that when
the King was on the way from <hi>Holdenby</hi> with that
body of Horse commanded by <hi>Ioyce</hi> (as before hath
been observed) the Head-Quarters of the Army were
at <hi>Kenton</hi> in <hi>Cambridg-shire,</hi> about three miles
from <hi>Newmarket,</hi> where <hi>Fairfax</hi> the General, being
walkt out with one of his Officers, having speedy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
thereof, by one that came with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hast from thence, he presently returned back to the
Town, where he found <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Watson</hi> a Scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
(immediately come from the Parliament) new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alighted off their Horses.</p>
               <p>To whom imparting the News, <hi>Cromwell</hi> seeming
not a little surprised therewith, absolutely dissavowed
any knowledge thereof: but forthwith concluded with
the General to dispatch a special Messenger presently
away, to prevent His Majestie's being brought to the
Army. Whereupon the Messenger, hasting away
with that errand, met the King about two miles from
<hi>Childerley,</hi> and there acquainting His Majesty that
the General and Lieutenant General thought it not
safe, that he should at that time come to <hi>Kenton</hi> or
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> advised for the present, that he should
lodge at <hi>Childerley,</hi> where the Lady <hi>Cutts</hi> then lived,
and had fit accommodation for him. Which being,
by His Majesty assented to, he rested there that
night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:48510:112"/>
Whereupon <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> coming thither on
the next day, 1647. and behaving themselves with all obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiousness
to him; he askt them by whose authority
he was thus taken from <hi>Holdenby,</hi> the Commissioners
which were put there as a Guard upon him, knowing
nothing from their Masters at <hi>Westminster</hi> of any
Order for the same. Whereunto they answered, that
it was not by any direction from either of them; and
with no little confidence seemed to dislike the Action.
To whom the King replyed; <hi>If then you do not hang up</hi>
Joyce, <hi>I will not believe you;</hi> desiring to go to his own
House at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> whereunto they assented; and
using very large expressions of fidelity to him, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
His Majesty thither, within few days after.</p>
               <p>There it was that <hi>Cromwell</hi> first gave him hopes of
his restoration, and that he would be cordially instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
therein; and, as an earnest thereof permitted
divers of his own trusty Servants and Chaplains to
come and serve him in their respective places: All
which had been formerly denyed him, as well by those
Parliament-Commissioners who were placed over him
upon his remove from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> as by the Scots
for the time he was in their Hands.</p>
               <p>After which being carryed from place to place (as
hath been already observed) he was brought at length
to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and continually fed with fair
promises, and great hopes by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that he should
be restored to his just rights; Commissary-general <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
(who had marryed <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s daughter, and had
the most power with him of any, as is well known)
being totally averse to the <hi>Presbyterean-government,</hi>
which the then predominant party in Parliament had
resolved to set up: Boldly expressing at <hi>Colebrooke</hi>
(but in private) so great an indignation against it,
and such an intire affection to the King, out of a
seeming hearty sense of his patient sufferings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
condiscensions; <hi>that rather than His Majesty
should continue thus enslaved by that vile party, if but five
men would joyn with him, he would adventure his life in
order to his restoration; Cromwell</hi> himself, having for
the same reasons afterwards at <hi>Putney,</hi> solemnly
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48510:112"/>
professed; that <hi>if but ten men would stick to him, he
would hazard his life and fortune for him upon the same
score,</hi> or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Being thus at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and enslaving <hi>Propositions</hi> were brought to
him from the Members at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as he had
received from them when he was at <hi>Newcastle</hi> and
<hi>Holdenby,</hi> having no small hopes of his restoration,
through the power of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who had the greatest
influence on the Army: and being well aware that
the predominant party in Parliament did still ayme at
the establishing themselves in a perpetual dominion:
as also, that, in order thereto they did resolve so to
garble the Army, according to their own Interest, so
that the strength thereof might be broke in pieces, and
a new modell set up, consisting of those, who should
hold firm to the <hi>Covenant;</hi> His Majesty plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
how destructive this must needs be, not onely
to himself and his royal family, but to Monarchick
government, thought fit in his Answer to those their
<hi>Proposals,</hi> to take care of the Armies's interest, which he
then lookt upon as the better friends to himself and the
publick.</p>
               <p>But before he would fully resolve what Answer to
make, call'd that person to him from whom I had this
relation, (he being a great officer under <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and in
much esteem with him;) and told him he must resolve
him a short Question; which was, whether he could assure
him, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was the same in his Heart to him,
as he had by his Tongue so freely and frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself to be. At which Question that person
being not a little startled; and fearing the danger of
an uncertain and unsafe Answer, intreated respite till
the next day at Noon. Which being given him, he
went privily that night to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> then in bed at <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi>
and acquainting him freely with the occasion of
coming to him at such a time, <hi>Cromwell</hi> in brief assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, that he did really and uprightly intend from
his Heart, to perform the same to his utmost, which
he had formerly so often professed to His Majesty that
he would do; which was the full restoring and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48510:113"/>
him in his just and lawful rights: imprecating,
that neither himself, his wife or children might ever
prosper, if he did not perform what he had so promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
in case the Army remained an Army: and if not
they were obliged to fall with him: and that he would
stand by him if there were but ten men besides that
would adhere to him, with most bitter reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that rigid party in Parliament, which by their <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterean</hi>
principles and practises did meerly design to
enslave him.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this assurance, that person
was so cautious, that he conditioned with <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
that, if any thing should thenceforth happen, which
might hinder the real accomplishment of this his fair
design, that His Majesty might have timely notice
thereof, to the end he might endeavour to avoid the
danger, which being assented to, he return'd to His
Majesty with a cheerful countenance (not at all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the least to the contrary) and imparted to him
the substance of what had then passed betwixt them.
Whereupon the King, framing his Answer to those
<hi>Proposals</hi> from the Parliament (so brought to him as
abovesaid) sent it by the same person to <hi>Cromwell</hi> and
<hi>Ireton</hi> to be perused, with liberty to add or alter what
they should think fit. Which being done by them,
and returned to His Majesty, he wrote it a new
and sent it to <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But see now the horrid perfidiousness of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and
<hi>Ireton.</hi> No sooner was this candid and gracious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the King Imparted to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but that both of them appeared with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in their bitter invectives against it. The News
whereof being forthwith brought to the King, he call'd
for the person, who had been so lately with <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
and acquainting him therewith, sent him back to
<hi>Cromwell</hi> to require a reason thereof. Whose answer
was, that what he had then said in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
was to sound the depth of those virulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
wherewith the <hi>Presbytereans,</hi> whom he knew
to be no friends to the King were possess'd with all: But
after that time he never came more to His Majesty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:48510:113"/>
That person therefore, whom the King had so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> observing thus much, made it
his chief business to find out the Councils and designs
of the principal Officers of the Army at Putney:
and discerning at length how dangerous they were in
reference to His Majesty, gave him private Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, to the end he might consider which way
best to preserve himself. Whereupon, resolving to
get privately from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> to the City of
London, the same person (so imploy'd as abovesaid)
undertook to find him out a secure lodging there: and,
accordingly leaving him, did provide such a one;
His Majesty determining, that so soon as he should get
safe thither, to let him have knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>And now at length, being fully sensible of what
he had so long feared: which was, that notwithstanding
his own clear and candid dealing with them in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;
and that he did so far rely upon them, that
he had strictly prohibited all those of his faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who had served in his Armys, that they should
not joyn with the Scots, in case they should raise any
forces in order to his pretended restoration, as <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
seem'd to suspect that they might (though nothing
less would have been the effects thereof, considering
they stuck so close to their <hi>solemn League and Covenant:</hi>)
he was to expect no better than destruction and ruine
to himself and his posterity, and absolute slavery to
all his good Subjects; he caused a Boat to be privately
brought to the River-side; and upon the eleventh of
<hi>November,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King went from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> 11. Novem.</note> about the beginning of the night, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
from the Privy-lodgings, through a Door where
no Guard stood, into the Park; and so crossing the
<hi>Thames</hi> landed at <hi>Ditton;</hi> where Sir <hi>Iohn Berkley</hi>
(afterwards Lord <hi>Berkley</hi>) Mr. <hi>Iohn Ashburnham</hi> and
Colonel <hi>William Legg</hi> (sometime Groomes of his
Bedchamber) were placed with Horses.</p>
               <p>But so it hapned, that when the King was got on
Shore, and had stay'd some time for them, Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
diswaded him from going to <hi>London,</hi> and
led him into <hi>Hantshire,</hi> where His Majesty deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of him, to what place he intended to conduct
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48510:114"/>
him; he answered into the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whereof
Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> was then Governour, in whom
Mr. <hi>Ashburnham</hi> had no little confidence.</p>
               <p>To which His Majesty replyed, that he would not
adventure himself thither; unless he might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
assurance, under the Governour's hand, for his
security from any danger; and thereupon sent Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnham</hi>
and Sir <hi>Iohn Berkley</hi> into the Isle, to treat with
<hi>Hamond</hi> to that purpose, staying himself at Lichfield-<hi>house</hi>
(belonging to the Earl of Southampton) with
Colonel <hi>Legg,</hi> till they returned: strictly charging
them, that they should not let <hi>Hamond</hi> know where he
was, unless he would give him full assurance under
his Hand, for his freedome, and return thence when he
pleased.</p>
               <p>But, instead of observing these His Majestie's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they came back, and brought <hi>Hamond</hi> with
them. And being come to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> went to the
King (then in his Bed-chamber) leaving <hi>Hamond</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
telling His Majesty what they had done;
whereat the King, being not a little amazed, askt
them if they had a promise under <hi>Hamond</hi>'s hand,
for his security; and they replying No, but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

told them, that they had betray'd him, or words to

                  </gap>
take some other course for His Majestie's safety. But
to this their vain proposal the King did utterly
refuse to assent, rather choosing to yeild up himself a
Sacrifice (as he afterwards was made) to those bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty-men,
who had resolved his destruction, and
subversion of the Government, than to be guilty of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to take away the life of that one Rebel in cold
bloud. And putting himself thereupon into the
hands of that unworthy person, was by him kept in
no better condition than a prisoner, untill he was by
his consent taken away by the direction of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and
the rest of those bloudy Regicides, who brought him
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48510:114"/>
to the Block, as we shall see anon. But I return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At his departure from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> he left in
his withdrawing-room a Letter directed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
which attended him there, to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to both Houses of Parliament; the effect
whereof was to tell them,</hi> that he had with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
endured a tedious restraint; which he did willingly
undergo, whilst he had any hopes that it might conduce to
the peace of the Kingdoms: but then finding by too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
proofs, that this his continued patience, would not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turn to his personal ruin, but be of much more prejudice
than furtherance of the publick good; he did conceive,
that he was bound, as well by natural as political obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to seek his safety, by retiring himself for some time
from the publick view both of his friends and enemies:
challenging the judgment of all indifferent men, if he had
not just cause to free himself from the hands of those <hi>who
did change their Principles with their condition; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
urging, that all just Interests (viz.</hi> Presbyterean,
Independent; Army, <hi>and</hi> Scots) <hi>might be heard, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with himself, with Honour, Freedom, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and then, that he would instantly break through
that cloud of retirement, and shew himself to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Pater patriae.</p>
               <p>In this Letter of his Majestie's (who unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
Sufferings had raised his Observations to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pitch than some who have been much magnified
for their Wisedom did ever reach) it is to be noted,
that he saw <hi>he had just cause to free himself from the
Hands of those who did change their principles with their
condition.</hi> Now, lest this his expression should be
thought to have reference meerly to the <hi>Independents,</hi>
in whose power he then was; it will not be amiss to
consider that Letter, written by the Commissioners of
<hi>Scotland</hi> unto the two Houses at Westminster,
dated the sixth of <hi>November,</hi> then past, in reference to
the King; together with that Answer of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners

certain <hi>Proposals</hi> made to them <hi>anno</hi> 1646. touching
the King's coming into that Realm, upon his exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>Another message from the King to the Houses at</hi> Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note>
                  <hi>wherein, <hi>to shorten that Work, he expressed his mind
to this effect; viz.</hi>
                  </hi> That, conceiving himself to be at much
more freedom and security than formerly, he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to offer such Grounds to the two Houses for that
purpose; which, upon due examination of all Interests,
might best conduce thereto. And therefore, as to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Arch-Bishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he could not consent
to it, as he was a Christian and a King: first, being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his Iudgment, that this Order was placed in the
Church by the Apostles themselves; and, that ever since
that time, it had continued in all Christian Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World, till this last Century of years: And in this
Church, in all times of Change and Reformation, it had
been upheld by the wisedom of his Ancestors, as the great
Preserver of <hi>Doctrine, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Order in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</hi> Next, as a King at his Coronation, that
he had not onely taken a solemn Oath: but, that himself
and his predecessors, in their confirmation of the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
had inseperably woven the Right of the Church into
the Liberties of the rest of the Subjects: Nevertheless was
willing, that it should be provided, that the particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
might perform the several Duties of their Callings,
both by their personal Residence, and frequent Preaching
in their Diocese; as also, that they should exercise no Act
of Iurisdiction or Ordination without the consent of the
Presbyters; and to limit their powers, that they might not
be grievous to tender Consciences.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that he could not consent to the Alienation
of the Church-lands, it being a Sin of the highest Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;
conceiving it also to be a prejudice to the publick
good; many of his Subjects having the benefit of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Leases at much easier rates than if those Possessions
were in the hands of private men; besides the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48510:115"/>
that it would be to all Learning and Industry, when
such eminent Rewards shall be taken away: yet, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the great distemper concerning <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi>
and that the <hi>Presbyterean-Government</hi> was then in
practice; to eschew confusion as much as might be, and for
satisfaction of the two Houses of Parliament, was content,
that the said Government should be legally permitted to
stand in the same condition it then was for three years:
Provided, that himself and those of his Iudgement (or
any other, who could not in Conscience submit thereto)
might not be obliged to comply therewith, but have free
practice of their own profession. And that a free Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Debate might be had with their Divines at
Westminster (twenty of his Majestie's nomination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added to them) whereby it might be determined by
his said Majesty and the two Houses, how the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
after that time, should be setled, (or sooner,
if differences might be agreed) as should be most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God; with full Liberty to all those
who should differ upon consciencious grounds from that
settlement. Provided, that it might not be understood to
tolerate those of the Popish-profession; nor to exempt those
from the penalty of the Laws, or tolerate <hi>Atheism,</hi> or
<hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As to the <hi>Militia,</hi> though it was undoubtedly the
inherent right of the Crown: yet, to evidence his desire
to secure the performance of such Agreement as should be
made in order to a Peace, his Majesty was content, that,
during his whole reign, it should be disposed of by his two
Houses of Parliament.</p>
               <p>3. As to the Arrears of the Army, that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in any thing that might be done without violation of
his Conscience and Honour.</p>
               <p>4. As to the Disposal of the great Offices of State, and
Naming of Privy-Councillers, he offered the disposing of
them, for the whole time of his reign, by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament,</p>
               <p>5. For the Court of Wards and Liveries, that it should
be taken away, so as a full recompence might be setled on
his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors in perpetuity.</p>
               <p>6. That he would consent to the making of all Oaths,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48510:116"/>
Declarations, and Proclamations, against both or either
House of Parliament null and void. So likewise of all
Indictments and other proceedings against any person for
adhering unto them. And that he would pass a general
Act of Oblivion.</p>
               <p>7. That, for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he would give satisfaction to them.</p>
               <p>8. That as to such Acts and Grants passed under his
great Seal since the 22th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1642. and confirming
such as had been passed under that, made by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he would give satisfaction in what might reasonably
be desired.</p>
               <p>9. That, for confirmation of all these and whatsoever else
might be proposed by the two Houses; and also of what he
should propose on his own part, he did earnestly desire a
<hi>personal Treaty</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> with Honour, Freedom
and Safety.</p>
               <p>10. And that the Proposals of the Army, concerning the
Succession of Parliaments, and their due Elections should
be taken into consideration.</p>
               <p>11. So likewise that as to what concern'd the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he would apply himself to give all reasonable
satisfaction.</p>
               <p>After the sending of this Message by his Majesty,
the next thing observable that hapned, was a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<note n="f" place="margin">1. Decemb. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1805.</note> through the influence of the <hi>Presbytereans,</hi>
presented to the two Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the
Common-Council of the City of <hi>London;</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Parliament (for by that Title they then
call'd those Members sitting at <hi>Westminster</hi>) to be
the <hi>Supream Power in this Kingdom:</hi> and <hi>(inter alia)</hi>
praying that the <hi>Covenant</hi> might be duly observed.</p>
               <p>No wonder then, that his Majestie's gracious Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of <hi>November</hi> the xvjth. was so little regarded, as
that he had no Answer at all thereto, upon the sixth
of <hi>December</hi> following, he therefore put them in mind
<note n="g" place="margin">6. Decem. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1838.</note> of it, still pressing for a <hi>personal Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto, insted of an Answer, they sent him
four Bills to be assented unto by him, as preparatory
to a Treaty.<note place="margin">The four Dethroning Bills.</note> These were those <hi>four Dethroning Bills,</hi>
which, if passed into Acts, as they required, might
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48510:116"/>
have saved the labour of a Treaty. Unto which, for
Answer, his Majesty made these most prudent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Observations.</p>
               <p>1. That the Commissioners of <hi>Scotiand</hi> had openly
protested against them.</p>
               <p>2. To allow of that great Seal, made by them, without
his authority, before consideration should be had thereupon
in a Treaty, might afterwards hazard the security it self.</p>
               <p>3. That these Bills did not onely contain the devesting
himself of all Sovereignty, and that without possibility of
recovering it, either to Himself, or his Successors (except
by Repeal of them:) but also, making his Concessions guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the greatest Pressures that could be upon his Subjects:
as in other particulars; so by giving an arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Power to the two Houses for ever, to raise and levy
Forces for land or sea service, of what persons (without
distinction of quality) and to what numbers they should
please, and likewise for levying money for their Pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that these their Proposals, being thus destructive
to Himself and his Successors, he (in that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer) declared;</hi>
That neither the desire of being freed
from that tedious and irksome condition of life, he had so
long suffered, nor the apprehension of what might befall
him, in case they would not afford him a personal Treaty,
should make him change his resolution, of not consenting to
any Act, till the whole Peace were concluded: <hi>still earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pressing for a personal Treaty with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It being now visible enough, that <hi>Independency</hi> grew
up every day more and more, <hi>the Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  </hi>
became so sensible thereof; that the Assembly of
Divines of that Kirk, wrote to those sitting at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi>
passionately desiring them to adhere unto
the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and constantly to endeavour the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Heresie and Schism in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And, to second that, came another Letter to the
Members of both Houses sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
from the Scotish-Commissioners, wherein was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a large</hi> Declaration, <hi>in which are these Expressions.</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:48510:117"/>
—<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 1850.</note> There be some things which properly concern
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> their <hi>Rights, Laws,</hi> and
<hi>Liberties:</hi> But there be other matters, which in their
own nature, as being common to both, or by <hi>Covenant</hi> or
<hi>Treaty</hi> concern both Kingdoms; wherein, unless we should
forget our duty to God, to the King's Majesty, to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Kingdom, and to this Nation, our common Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Interest cannot be denyed. For as <hi>Scotland</hi>
was invited and engaged in this War, upon grounds and
reasons of common Interest: so we trust it will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,
that in making Peace, we claim from the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
an improvement of the very same principles, and a
performance of the Treaties they have made with us; that
the same measure of conjunction of Interest be given to us,
which was had of us, and promised unto us; wherein the
very Law of Nations, and the Rules of common Equity,
doth plead for us. Yet, in the application of this Rule,
we shall not stretch our selves beyond our lines, the express
condition of our <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> the duty
of our Allegeance, and the <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Kingdoms; which are so many strong Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as all who have Honour or Conscience must acknowledge
should be inviolably observed.</p>
               <p>Having laid this, as a most just and solid ground of
our proceedings, we shall speak of the best and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
means to procure a good agreement with the King,
for setling <hi>Religion</hi> and a lasting peace: and next to the
<hi>Propositions</hi> which are to be the foundation of the peace
and safety of both Kingdoms. And it is still our opinion
and judgment, that the most equal, fairest and just way,
to obtain a well-grounded Peace, is by a <hi>personal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
with the King; and that his Majesty, for that end, be
invited to come to <hi>London,</hi> with Honour, Freedom,
and Safety. And, as it is far from our thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
in expressing our differences upon the <hi>Propositions,</hi>
to provoke or give offence: so we trust, that our freedom,
in discharge of the trust committed to us, proceeding from
our <hi>Zeal to Religion, Loyalty to the King,</hi> and <hi>Love
to Peace,</hi> shall receive a candid interpretation from the
honourable Houses; and that they will, in their Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
not slight the desires of a Kingdom, who in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48510:117"/>
time of <hi>England</hi>'s greatest danger, esteemed no hazard
too hard for their assistance; and are now seeking nothing
but the performance of the mutual <hi>Obligations, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Treaties</hi> between the two Kingdomes; and to
prevent the danger, which may ensue upon the violation
and breach of so solemn Engagements.</p>
               <p>The Houses of Parliament have frequently professed,<note place="margin">☜</note> that
the cheif end of their wars was the <hi>Reformation and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant:</hi>
and they have often promised and declared to the King, and
to all the world (not without deep attestations of the name
of God) that no trouble or success, should ever make them
wrong or diminish the power of the Crown, which were the
chief motives and arguments that induced <hi>Scotland</hi> to
engage with them in this war. Let therefore that be given
to God, which is God's, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is <hi>Caesar</hi>'s;
whereby it may be evident, that you are not unmindfull of
the solemn Vows you made to God in the time of distress,
for Reformation of Religion; and it may also really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the advantages and power, which success hath
put into your hands, hath not lessened your loyalty to the
King. And, according to our many professions and near
relations, let us really and cordially cherish and strengthen
the union between the two Kingdomes, under His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
by all pledges of reciprocal kindness, that so <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Righteousness</hi> may flourish, and both Kingdomes
languishing under the heavy pressures and calamities of
an unnatural war, may live in peace and plenty.</p>
               <p>As we cannot agree to this way of sending those four Bills
to His Majesty for his assent, before any <hi>Treaty</hi> upon the
rest of the <hi>Propositions:</hi> so we are extremely unsatisfied
with the matter of those new <hi>Propositions,</hi> lately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
unto us, for the reasons expressed in our answer unto
them, which we do herewith deliver unto your Lordships to
be presented to both Houses of Parliament. And we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
that they would take the whole business into their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration, and that there be a <hi>personal Treaty,</hi>
with His Majesty here at <hi>London,</hi> upon such <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as shall be agreed upon, with advice and consent of
both Kingdomes, according to the <hi>Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:48510:118"/>
This in general was their <hi>Declaration:</hi> but the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
desires, which they exhibited, were these; <hi>viz.</hi> that the
honourable Houses would establish <hi>the solemn League and
Covenant;</hi> and that His Majesty be desired to give his
royal assent for confirming the same by Act of Parliament.
That the setling of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and an <hi>uniformity in
Religion,</hi> in the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
be inserted in the new <hi>Propositions:</hi> And, in particular,
that the <hi>Confession,</hi> the <hi>Directory for worship, form
of Church-Government,</hi> and <hi>Catechisme</hi> agreed upon by
the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> be established: That effectual
course be taken by Act of Parliament for the suppressing of
<hi>Blasphemy, Heresy</hi> and <hi>Schisme</hi> and all scandalous Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines,
and practises, as are contrary to the light of Nature,
or to the known principles of Christianity, or the power of
Godliness; or which may be destructive to order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
or to the peace of the Church or Kingdome.</p>
               <p>That the Ordinances concerning the calling and sitting
of the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> be desired to be confirmed by
Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>That the Proposition, for the confirmation of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
betwixt the two Kingdomes, and the proceedings betwixt
them, be expressed. And that Treaty for the return of the
Scots Army of the date of <hi>Decem.</hi> 23. 1646. be inserted
amongst the rest.</p>
               <p>That His Majestie's assent be desired to what the two
Kingdomes shall agree in the prosecution of the Articles of
the large <hi>Treaty,</hi> which are not yet finished: and that all
other things be inserted concerning the joynt Interest of both
Kingdomes, or the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular.
That the Armies in both Kingdomes, which were raised for
the <hi>preservation of Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> and <hi>defence of the King's
person,</hi> may be disbanded, now the war is ended, and
have due satisfaction for their arrears. That speedy releif
may be sent to <hi>Ireland:</hi> and that an Act of Oblivion
may be agreed upon, to be passed in the Parliaments of both
Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>That His Majesty be restored to His Rights; and that in
the <hi>Propositions</hi> a conclusion may be added; promising
all real endeavour, that His Majesty may live in the splendor
and glory of his royal progenitors, as beseemeth his royal
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48510:118"/>
place; that so all differences and troubles may end in a
mutual confidence and rejoycing.</p>
               <p>Upon debate of which Message from His Majesty
(<hi>Nov.</hi> 16.) and of that <hi>Declaration</hi> and those <hi>Proposals</hi>
by the Scottish-Commissioners, the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
passed these following Votes<note n="i" place="margin">3. Jan. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1865.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That no more addresses be made from the Parliament

               <p>2. That it should be Treason for any person whatsoever,
to deliver any Message to the King, or receive any Letter
or Message from him, without leave from both Houses of
Parliament.</p>
               <p>3. That the Members of both Houses, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of both Kingdomes, had power to sit and act alone (as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formerly
the Committee of both Kingdomes had) for the
safety of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>4. And, that a Committee should be nominated to draw

of the reasons of passing these Votes.</p>
               <p>To back which <hi>Votes,</hi> the General and Council of the
Army, did put forth a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">11. Jan.</note> signifying
their Resolutions to adhere to the Houses, for setling

own hand, for the satisfaction of all his
people; which, soon after was made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
by the Press. Whereby, representing his sad and
most disconsolate condition, through a long and strict
Imprisonment, together with his earnest endeavours
to have composed all things by an happy peace;
whereunto he added most just, cleer and undeniable
Reasons, why he could not assent to pass those <hi>four
dethroning Bills</hi> before-mentioned: farther shewed what
usage he had endured by Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in whose custody he then was; most of his
servants being by him discharg'd, the Guards redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and himself restrain'd of that Liberty, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had been allowed. Appealing also to the
world, how he had deserved that dealing from his
subjects; having sacrificed to them, for the peace of
the Kingdome, all, but what was much more dear
to him than his life; <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi>
and, desiring nothing more than to perform it, in
the most proper and usual way; <hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>personal
Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Taking notice likewise of the often repeated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and Engagements made to him by the Army,
at <hi>Newmarket</hi> and St. <hi>Albans,</hi> for asserting his just
Rights in General, by their voted and revoted <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,</hi>
which he had reason to understand should be the
utmost that would be expected from him: yea that
in some things he should be eased. And conlcuded;
that, if it were peace they desired, he had shewed the
way thereto (being both willing and desirous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his part in it) by a just complyance with all cheif
Interests.</p>
               <p>Was it plenty and Happiness? Those were the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
effects of peace. Was it <hi>security?</hi> His Majesty
who wisht that all men would forgive and forget like
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48510:119"/>
him, did offer the <hi>Militia</hi> for his own time. Was it
<hi>Liberty of Conscience?</hi> He who wanted it, was most
ready to give it. Was it <hi>right administration of Iustice?</hi>
Officers of Trust, were referred to the choyse of the
two Houses. Was it <hi>frequent Parliaments?</hi> He had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
and fully concurred therewith. Was it the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears
of the Army?</hi> Upon a settlement, he told them
that they would be certainly payd, with much ease;
but before that there would be found much difficulty,
if not impossibility in it.</p>
               <p>But all this was then to no purpose: for having
got the power of the Sword into their hands, the Voice

               <p>And to cajole the <hi>Presbyterean</hi> (having formerly
secured themselves from the reach of their Holy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline)
they passed an <hi>Ordinance</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">29. Jan. <hi>Scob. coll.</hi> p. 139.</note>, for the speedy
dividing and setling the several Counties of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
into distinct <hi>Classical-Presbyteries,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Elderships.</hi> And, desiring to seem men of
the greatest Sanctity imaginable, they constituted<note n="r" place="margin">Weekly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer. p. 824.</note>
a <hi>Committee, for the enumeration of great crying sins;</hi>
appointing that they should daily meet, and do their
utmost endeavour to suppress them: And passed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ordinance</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">11. Feb. <hi>Scob. Col.</hi> p. 143.</note> for suppressing of <hi>Stage-plays,</hi> and
demolishing <hi>Play-Houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all these devices were meerly circumstantial;
those which more immediately tended to the carrying
on their grand work, being the chief; <hi>viz.</hi> the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
which the people then had (or seem'd to have)
of their <hi>Votes for no more Addresses to the King.</hi> Towards
the obtaining whereof, having been not a little solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous,
they imploy'd their most busy Emissaries, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48510:120"/>
confiding-friends in all parts of the Realm. Who
acted for them so vigourously; as that, from <hi>Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
(a populous corporation in <hi>Somersetshire)</hi> they
had very great Thanks for the same. So likewise from
the Godly-party in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi>

made large promises to adhere to, and stand by them
in the farther prosecution thereof, to the utmost of
their abilities, against all opposers: desiring, that they
would proceed to a speedy setling of the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in such a way as might best conduce to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and happiness of this Nation: and that they would
put forth their power, for promoting of <hi>Religion</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of God: to give due encouragement
to all Godly and able Ministers; to cast out such as
were scandalous, and unfit for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:
and to be tender of the Consciences of such,
whose conversations were, as becometh the Gospel of
Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For which the Petitioners had not onely thanks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
rendred unto them, for their constant affections
to the Parliament: but an order was forthwith made;
that the Petition should be printed, to the end that the
world might take notice of the singular affections of
the Petitioners; and that they might be an example
for other Counties of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Which transactions here,<note place="margin">Anno 1648.</note> so awakened the Brethren
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> that seeing no good could be effected
by words, they resolv'd to dispute the business other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and therefore agreed of raysing an Army. But
the general <hi>Assembly of that Kirk,</hi> endeavouring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them therein, the estates of Parliament there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<note n="v" place="margin">... April. Perfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal p. 1978.</note>, that the breaches of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
should be represented, and reparations sought for
the same. Next, that the War which they were to
make with <hi>England,</hi> should be for strengthning the
Union betwixt the two Kingdomes, and encouraging
the <hi>Presbytereans</hi> and well affected there. Moreover,
that they would declare His Majestie's concessions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Religion, not to be satisfactory. And that
whereas <hi>Religion</hi> had been, and they trusted should be,
the principal end of all their undertakings; so they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48510:120"/>
would be carefull, that the then present question to be
stated, should contain security and assurance, to be
had from His Majesty, by his solemn Oath, under
his hand and Seal, that he should, for himself, and for
his successors, give his royal assent, to pass Acts of
Parliament, injoyning the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
<hi>Presbytreal Government,</hi> the <hi>Directory for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> in all his Dominions: and
that he should never make opposition to any of these,
nor endeavour any change thereof: As also, that this
security should be had from him before his restitution
to the exercise of his royal power.</p>
               <p>All this notwithstanding, the <hi>Kirk</hi> was not one jot
satisfied: but earnestly urged<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1979.</note>, <hi>that the Parliament
should declare against His Majestie's concessions, positively,
without any condition, and presently without delay;</hi> they
being (as they exprest) so prejudicial to the <hi>Cause</hi> and
<hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when they discerned, that Forces were levying
throughout that Kingdome, they so much feared, that
His Majesty and his good Subjects might receive any
benefit thereby; that they did put up a large <hi>Petition</hi>
to the Parliament there: wherein they earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 1994.</note> the Lords, as they would answer the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at the great day of Judgment, that they would not
proceed so, as to give any encouragement unto the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical</hi>
or <hi>malignant party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> nor be any
grief to the <hi>Presbyterean Party; nor to restore the King,
untill he had resolved the settlement of Presbytery, and
that what they intended on the King's behalf, might be
with subordination to those ends exprest in the</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Parliament there, declared<note n="z" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that
they would be so far from joyning, or associating with
the <hi>popish, prelatical,</hi> or <hi>malignant-party,</hi> if they should
again rise in Arms, either to oppose or obstruct all or
any of the ends of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
they would oppose, and endeavour to suppress
them, as Enemies to the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> on the
other side.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:48510:121"/>
Likewise, that in regard His Majestie's late conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and offers concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> were not satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
and that the principal ends of all the undertakings
of that Nation, had been, and they hoped should be,
to see <hi>Religion</hi> in the first place setled: and that, as they
should endeavour the rescuing of His Majesty from
those, who malitiously carryed him away from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denby</hi>-House
against his own will, and the declared
resolutions of both Kingdomes, and did still detein
him close prisoner, to the end he might come, with
honour, freedome and safety, to some of his Houses
in or about <hi>London,</hi> where both Kingdomes might
make their application to him, for setling of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and a well grounded Peace: So they did resolve, not
to put in His Majestie's hands, or in any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
such power, whereby the ends of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
or any one of them might be obstructed, or
opposed; <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterean-Government</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered:
but, on the contrary, that before any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
should be made, His Majesty should give
assurance, under his solemn Oath, and under his Hand
and Seal; that he should, for himself and his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
give his Royal assent and agreement to such Act
or Acts of Parliament, of both, and either Kingdomes
respectively, for enjoyning <hi>the League and Covenant,</hi> and
fully establishing <hi>Presbyterean-Government, Directory for
Worship,</hi> and <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and that he should never make opposition to
any of these; nor endeavour any thing thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that if any war should be made; as it
should be on just and necessary grounds; so did they
resolve,<note place="margin">☞</note> to give the trust and charge of their Armies
and Committees to none, but such as should be, and
were of known integrity, and against whom there was
no just cause of exception.</p>
               <p>Also, that the Parliament was willing to subscribe,
for the grounds of their undertaking an Oath; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
both in the framing of it, and otherwise, they were
willing the Church should have interest, as had been
in the like case. And, that the resolutions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
thereupon might be the more effectual, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48510:121"/>
in regard of the then present condition of affairs, it
was their opinion, that the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi>
should be put in a <hi>Posture of Defence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Posture of Defence.</note> as it was in the
year 1643. And, like as they had drawn that <hi>Act
of Posture;</hi> which being allow'd in Parliament, and
sent to the Shires, they thought it fit time to send their
demands to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and that
some descreet man should be sent with the same, and
a limited time appointed for his return with answer.</p>
               <p>¶I shall not stand here to give instance of such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as further happened betwixt the Grandees at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Scots, upon this business: for
all those passages were to no other end, than by thus
fencing with each other, to prevent any censure in
their respective Actings; and consequently, to obtain
the peoples assistance upon occasion. For in short, the
state of the business stood thus; the <hi>Independents</hi> of the
Army, to gain the whole and absolute power of rule
into their hands, having printed and published several
<hi>Declarations, Remonstrances, Manifestos</hi> and <hi>Proposals;</hi>
besides Petitions of their own framing (whereunto they
got subscriptions in many places) insinuating to the
people their willingness to redress publick Greivances,
to be the Restorers of Peace, the Laws and Liberties of
the Subject; to be setlers of <hi>Religion,</hi> maintainers of
the <hi>priviledges of Parliament;</hi> Callers to accompt of
all Committees, Sequestrators, Treasurers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
to be their deliverers from <hi>Excise,</hi> and other Taxes;
but, above all, preservers of all true Interests; <hi>Restorers
of the King</hi> to his just Rights and Prerogatives, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Freedom and Safty to his person; without which,
they professed <hi>there could be no setled peace or happiness
in this Nation.</hi> And, in pursuance of their undertakings,
having made Addresses to His Majesty, with more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
overtures, than any that he could obtain from
the Members, sitting at <hi>Westminster;</hi> they, after a
while, made private proposals to him, sutable meerly
to their own Interests, but wholy derogatory to his
Regal power, the <hi>Religion</hi> established by Law; as also
to the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of the Subject. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
when they saw, that the King could not, with
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48510:122"/>
his Conscience and Honour assent, they enterteined
new designs against his Person and Government,<note place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie part 2. p. 5.</note> usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in by the help of a <hi>Levelling-party;</hi> who in
pursuance thereof, obtruded clamourous <hi>Petitions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any farther <hi>Treaty</hi> with His Majesty, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
exemplary Justice from the Members at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
against him; which, through the influence
that the Army had on them (considering how the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
had been garbled) were entertain'd with Thanks.</p>
               <p>Hence was it, that when those <hi>Propositions</hi> of 13.
<hi>Nov. anno</hi> 1647. were brought into the House from
His Majesty, whereby he pressed them so earnestly
for a <hi>personal Treaty,</hi> the <hi>four Dethroning Bills</hi> were sent
to him, to be first signed, before they would admit
thereof: And, upon his refusal to yield unto them;
those <hi>Destructive Votes,</hi> of <hi>no more Addresses</hi> to him were
passed.</p>
               <p>The miserable condition of his Majesty, and in
him of all his loyal Subjects being therefore thus evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
seen by most men, who beheld nothing but
slavery and oppression, thenceforth to be their portion;
did so awaken them; that from <hi>Essex</hi> there came a
<hi>Petition</hi> by many thousands, to the Members at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
for a <hi>personal Treaty</hi> with the King, as the
most proper means to a well grounded peace. After
that, another from<note n="a" place="margin">16. May.</note> 
                  <hi>Surrey,</hi> a multitude of that
County, accompanying it to <hi>Westminster.</hi> Which
relisht so ill with the Grandees, that they sent the
Guards to beat them away; whereupon divers were
wounded and some slain.</p>
               <p>Nor had the <hi>Kentish-men</hi> better success: for having
by their Grand Jury, in the name of the whole Shire,
fram'd a petition for peace; the Committee of that
County, being jealous, that the people would take
Heart thereat, prohibited<note n="b" place="margin">History of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie part 1. p. 95.</note> the same, by printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
published in all the Churches; branding it to be
<hi>seditious</hi> and <hi>tumultuous;</hi> saying, <hi>that they would hang
up two in every Parish, that were promoters of it, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester
the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, when the people, seeing themselves opposed in
that their modest way of Application, resolved of farther
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48510:122"/>
consideration therein, by a general meeting, and to
come arm'd for their own defence; a party of Horse
was first sent in amongst them; and afterwards the
whole Army (under the Command of their General
<hi>Fairfax,</hi>) whereupon some of them fled into <hi>Essex,</hi>
where Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and divers of that County joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them; as also the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> at <hi>Colchester,</hi>
with some Horse which necessitating the rest, for their
own defence to make to <hi>Sandwich</hi> and some Castles
on the coast thereabouts; the Army advanc't after,
slew and took divers of them prisoners, and sequestred
the estates of all that desired peace; <hi>Weever</hi> (a hot-headed
<hi>Independent</hi>) having<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 97.</note> mov'd in the House of
Commons, <hi>that all</hi> Kent <hi>might be sequestred, because
they had rebell'd; and all <hi>Essex</hi> because they would rebel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding the strength of their Army,
and severity against those, who did not submit to their
oppressive power; the Scots, having rays'd an Army,
which was then ready to march into <hi>England,</hi> in
pursuance of the ends of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
there were many others in sundry parts of the
Nation, as well <hi>Presbytereans</hi> as <hi>Royalists,</hi> discerning no
better fruits to themselves of those successes, which the
<hi>Independents</hi> then had, than oppression and slavery;
boldly made attempts, in order to the rescue of His
Majesty out of their cruel hands, and to free the whole
Kingdome from their farther Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Of these, the first was by Sir <hi>Nicholas Kemish,</hi> who
got<note n="a" place="margin">3. April.</note> with some forces into <hi>Chepstow</hi>-castle. The
next was that of the valiant Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi>
who shortly after surprized<note n="b" place="margin">30. April.</note> the strong town of
<hi>Barwick.</hi> After this, Col. <hi>Laughorn, Poyer</hi> and
<hi>Powell,</hi> having raysed eight thousand men in <hi>Pembroke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
secured <hi>Lenvy</hi>-castle, with the town and castle
of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> and declared<note n="c" place="margin">8. May.</note> in those parts for
the settlement of the King and Kingdome. Sir <hi>Philip

                  <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisse.</hi>
About the same time<note n="*" place="margin">27. May.</note> likewise, part of the
royal Navy (consisting of twenty great Ships of War,
under the command of their Vice-Admiral <hi>Batten</hi>)
revolted, and came<note n="f" place="margin">27. May.</note> in to the Prince in <hi>Yarmouth</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:48510:123"/>
road; <hi>Pontfrait</hi>-castle, being within few days, after
surprized<note n="g" place="margin">3. June</note>. by the Royalists; and the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with the Lord <hi>Francis Villers</hi> in Arms<note n="*" place="margin">5. July.</note> with
two thousand men, near <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to make the expectation more secure, Duke
<hi>Hamilton,</hi> with a powerfull Army of the <hi>Scots</hi> entring
<note n="h" place="margin">13. July. The third <hi>Invasion</hi> of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> published a Declaration, consisting of
these heads, 1. That the King should be brought to
<hi>London,</hi> to treat in person with the two Houses of
Parliament. 2. That all those who had a hand in, or
contrived the carrying of the King from <hi>Holdenby,</hi>
should be condignly punished. 3. That the English
Army should be disbanded. 4. That <hi>Presbytery</hi> should
be settled. 5. And that the Members of Parliament,
which were forcibly secluded from the House, should
be re-seated there.</p>
               <p>After which, within few days, Major <hi>Lilburne</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Iohn</hi>) Governour of <hi>Tinemouth</hi>-castle in the
Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> declared<note n="i" place="margin">9. Aug.</note> for the King.</p>
               <p>But the fruits of all these fair hopes were soon bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted:
for as that Castle was shortly after storm'd by
Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig,</hi> and <hi>Lilburne,</hi> with his men put to
the Sword: So was <hi>Chepstow</hi>-castle by Col. <hi>Eure;</hi>
and Sir <hi>Nicholas Kemish</hi> kill'd in cold bloud.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> also with the Lord <hi>Francis Villers</hi>
were encountred by Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> Major <hi>Gibbons</hi> and
Sir <hi>Michael Livesey,</hi> totally routed<note n="k" place="margin">7. July.</note>; the Lord <hi>Francis
Villers</hi> slain; the Earl himself pursued to St. <hi>Ives</hi> in
<hi>Huntingdon-shire,</hi> and there taken. <hi>Laughorne, Poyer</hi>
and <hi>Powell</hi> were likewise defeated by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Horton:</hi> And Sir <hi>Iohn Owen,</hi> who was in Arms
about that time in <hi>Northwales,</hi> vanquisht by Major
General <hi>Mitton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Navy also (brought in by <hi>Batten</hi>) fell off to
the Earl of <hi>Warwick:</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with his Army,
being utterly routed<note n="l" place="margin">17. Aug</note>. at <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi>
and in his flight at <hi>Uttoxeter</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> taken
prisoner. <hi>Colchester</hi> lastly, which had held out with
great hardship, expecting relief from Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
was forc't to surrender<note n="m" place="margin">27. Aug.</note> and submit; whereupon
Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George L'isle,</hi> were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48510:123"/>
sacrificed to the rage of these merciless men;
the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> made prisoner, and the Townsmen
fined at fourteen thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>But those black clouds, before they were thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst,
betokening a suddain storm, put these new
Saints, for their more security, upon some desperate
thoughts of taking away the King's life. To which
end one Captain <hi>Rolfe</hi> was imploy'd<note n="d" place="margin">10. June. Ib. p. 104.</note> by them (as
himself did confess) to remove his Majesty out of the
way, by poison; or any other means; forasmuch as
it would highly conduce to their affairs.</p>
               <p>Whether it was by Reason that <hi>Osburne</hi> (a confident
of <hi>Rolfe</hi>'s) had discovered the design; or that, upon
more considerate thoughts they took other resolutions,
it is hard to say: but the execution of that murther,
was then, at present, laid aside.</p>
               <p>Many were the petitions, at that time, to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> from sundry parts; all pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
earnestly for a <hi>personal Treaty:</hi> yea some of them
from such as they durst hardly displease; as from<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 110.</note>
the Masters of the <hi>Trinity House,</hi> Captains of Ships, and
Sea-men; and another from<note n="f" place="margin">2. July. Ib. p. III.</note> the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶There is no doubt, but that the <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-members,
were private well-wishers, if not contrivers
of this third <hi>Scottish Invasion;</hi> though, by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the other faction, a Vote<note n="g" place="margin">15. July. Ib. p. 120.</note> was passed in the
House of Commons; that the Scottish-Army, under
the command of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were Enemies, and
that they should accordingly proceed against them;
In which argument the <hi>Independents</hi> were so fierce;
that, when it was objected by one, that he thought
the Lords would not concur therein; Reply<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 130</note>. was
made; <hi>That the House of Commons, being the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the people, had power to act without the Lords,
for the peoples safety, in case the Lords deserted their
Trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, whether it was the courage that the
<hi>Presbytereans</hi> then took, by reason of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s
Invasion, and those other disturbances, before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
or whether it was the doubts the <hi>Independents</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:48510:124"/>
had, of the dangers which these approaching troubles
might produce, 'tis hard to say: Sure it is, that after
much debate and many Arguments, it was resolved<note n="i" place="margin">28. July. Perf. Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, p. 3003.</note>
                  <hi>That his Majesty in person should be treated with by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners

                  </hi>
Which <hi>Vote,</hi> with other circumstances, did then make
such a change in the face of things, that the City of
<hi>London</hi> began to assume the power of their own
<hi>Militia,</hi> and listed men; saying<note n="k" place="margin">Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. p. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>they did it by the

and of the Land:</hi> and by a farther <hi>Authority, which
would make little for the advantage of the Parliament to
question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which so startled the Members at <hi>Westminster;</hi>
that resuming their old <hi>Presbyterean-cloak,</hi> they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
dispatch't Letters<note n="l" place="margin">3. Aug. <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 126.</note> to the <hi>Assembly of the Kirk of
Scotland;</hi> setting forth what the Parliament had
done in the way of setling peace, reforming the
Church and Universities, and maintaining the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
and union betwixt the two Nations; complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Duke <hi>Hamilton's Invasion,</hi> under colour of
authority from the Parliament of that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And though the <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> grounded
this their third Invasion upon the <hi>Covenant;</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi>-members
at <hi>Westminster</hi> utterly denied
that their assertion; affirming<note n="m" place="margin">Ib. p. 128.</note> stoutly, <hi>that the
Scots had broke the</hi> Covenant <hi>therein: yea, that in so
doing, they had set the English at Liberty from it; and
that the</hi> Covenant <hi>was no more</hi> jure divino <hi>than Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which was answered by the <hi>Presbytereans</hi> (for
concerning this point there grew a tough dispute in
the House betwixt those two Parties) <hi>that the large
Treaty contained the</hi> League <hi>between the two Nations;
so did not the</hi> Covenant, <hi>which was a vow made unto
God, with their Hands lifted up to Heaven, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and observation of the ends and principles expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the</hi> Covenant, <hi>from which no power on earth could
absolve them. And that, though the</hi> Covenant <hi>was not</hi> jure
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48510:124"/>
divino; <hi>yet the keeping of it, after they had taken it,
was</hi> jure divino; <hi>it being the revealed will of God that
they should not offer unto him the sacrifice of fools, a</hi>
Covenant <hi>to day, and break it to morrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this some of the more zealous replied; that
the <hi>Covenant</hi> was originally framed to satisfie the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the first bringing in of
their Army hither, <hi>to help the Lord against the mighty;</hi>
without which, the Scots would not have come in to
their assistance: And that work being over, they were
not at all obliged by the <hi>Covenant</hi> any further; it
being to be laid aside, as an Almanack out of date.
And therefore, to strengthen themselves the more,
there were private Listings<note n="n" place="margin">Ib. p. 124.</note> of the <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and
<hi>Antimonarchists,</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Which did so awaken
the <hi>Presbyterean</hi>-Saints in that City; that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to the House of Commons; representing the
danger thereof: saying, <hi>that if the Houses did not give
them leave to look to their safety, they must have recourse
to the Law of Nature, and act in their Militia, without
the Houses, in order to self Defence, allowable by all Laws,
and practised by that very Parliament against the King;
and likewise by</hi> Fairfax <hi>his Army against the Parliament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which words, there were such high exceptions
taken; that some of the fiery-spirited <hi>Independents</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. p. 135.</note>; <hi>that the Parliament having fought with the
King for the</hi> Militia, <hi>and gotten it by the Sword; no other

practised to purpose, as by and by will appear.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next thing whereof I am, in order of
time to take notice, is that this fatal and
absolute destruction<note n="p" place="margin">P 17. Aug.</note> of the Scottish-Army,
under the command of Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
by Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell,</hi> at that time
Commander of the Parliament's forces (<hi>Fairfax</hi>) having
declin'd to serve against the Brethren) was not by any
formal Battel; but rather a beating up of Quarters,
and some slight Skyrmishes: and that it was then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attributed to the over-confidence which Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
had in the strength of his own Countrymen;
exposing those English, which were Commanded by
the truly noble Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> to be over
powred by the Enemy; thereby expecting an absolute
Conquest through his own puissance; and so to have
reapt the whole honour of restoring the King, if he
ever had any such intent.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Cromwell</hi> being now triumphant over the
whole Scottish-Army (which was the most formidable
of any then on foot against them) and not long after
over those right valiant and loyall persons at <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
The Ships also, which went over to the Prince,
falling off again, (as hath already been observed) He
became so strangely elated, that nothing then to be
done, could give satisfaction to his ambitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
desires.</p>
               <p>But here, I shall also observe; that notwithstanding
the strong factions into which these men were then divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
had begot a perfect hatred of each to other (as the
many printed pamphlets then spread abroad do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
shew:) Nevertheless, for the utter eradicating
of the <hi>Religion by Law establish'd in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which themselves had at first (3. <hi>May</hi> 1641.)
solemnly protested to maintain; about this time, they
all agree'd together, in framing an <hi>Ordinance</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">29. Aug. <hi>Scob. coll.</hi> p. 165.</note> for
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48510:125"/>
the establishing of <hi>Presbytery;</hi> containing a particular
form and order of <hi>Church-government,</hi> in their <hi>congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Classical, Provincial</hi> and <hi>National Assemblies:</hi> In
which the Lay Elders, constituted at that time, in all the
Parishes, throughout the City of <hi>London,</hi> are expresly
nominated; with direction for the setling of all others,
throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and limitation
of their powers: unto the sharp and rigorous penalties
whereof, all conscientious and orthodox Protestants
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were to be subject: but
the <hi>Independent</hi> brood, (consisting of all sorts of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks

               <p>¶And now to proceed. As I have already taken

                  <note place="margin">Treaty in the Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi>

of <hi>September;</hi> the chief persons permitted to attend
his Majesty there, being these; the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi>
the Marquess of <hi>Hertford;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and
Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> (Gentlemen of his Bedchamber:)
the Bishops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Hamond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oldsworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Turner</hi>

               </p>
               <p>These other Divines, for the King being afterwards
added; <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Iames Vsher</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> in

Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Vines,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lazarus
Seaman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ioseph Caryll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But withall, as it is now most evident to the world,
that there was never any real purpose, on the part of
the Grandees at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that the Treaty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48510:126"/>
at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> should take any good effect: so
was there less expectation here, the King being then
their prisoner, and all his forces come to nothing: for,
though they then gave way to this <hi>Treaty;</hi> they were, at
that very time, contriving and framing the formality
of his absolute destruction; of which the symptoms
were visible enough, during the whole continuance of
that <hi>Treaty,</hi> by sundry <hi>Petitions</hi> to the Members at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> all declaming bitterly against it. Which
Petitions (as 'tis well known) were first fram'd by the
Grandees themselves, and then sent amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to be subscribed, according to their usual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
In most whereof, it was desired, that all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
without exception, might be brought to
condigne punishment; one whereof concluding<note n="†" place="margin">Moderate Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, n. 16.</note>
thus, from <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. ver. 6, 7, 8, and 9. <hi>Let the high
prayses of God be in the mouths of his Saints, and a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Sword in their Hands, to execute vengeance upon the
Heathen, and punishment upon the people; to bind their
Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron:
to execute upon them the Iudgments written;</hi> This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
have all his Saints.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is farther to be observ'd; that after the
destruction of this Scottish-Army at <hi>Preston,</hi> and the
reducing of <hi>Colchester, Cromwell</hi> went into <hi>Scotland;</hi>
where he not onely laid the plot with the Marquess of
<hi>Argyle,</hi> for the destruction of the King, and extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Monarchy; but by his help, in the contrivance
of that unparalel'd murther; agree'd in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
conducing thereto.</p>
               <p>¶And now, as to this <hi>Treaty</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
'tis sufficiently known that it was on His Majestie's
part, totally and singly managed by himself, against
all those subtile persons above-mentioned; the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> not permitting him to have any
assistant therein, either Divines or others. Also, that
it was perform'd by him with so much judgment, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
meekness, and curtesie; as not onely much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonisht,
but made converts of some, that had been
his greatest Enemies, and were then his Antagonists
there. Wherein, to manifest his earnest desires for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48510:126"/>
the peace of those distracted Realms, he was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to devest himself, totally in effect of his own Regal
power, for life; and to trust those insatiable men with
the exercise thereof; as is apparently to be seen by
the particular Articles, then assented to by him; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to the <hi>Militia,</hi> he consented thereto, as 'twas
required by their <hi>Proposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For Episcopacy, though he could not consent to
the utter abolishing thereof; yet he offered, that it
might be regulated and reduced to the primative u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
and so setled and continued in the Church:
And, in order thereto, that it might be enacted, that
the Bishops should not act without the Council and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Presbyters, in the exercises of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Iurisdiction:</hi> and therefore desired the consent
of the Houses in the one, that he might the more
freely give his assent unto the other. Offering to
lessen the extent, or multiply the number of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
as should be agreed upon by both Houses.</p>
               <p>3. As to Bishops lands, that he could not consent
to the alienation of them; but offred what he had
done before, for satisfaction of the Purchasers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters
(which was for the enjoyment of them for a
certain time:) being therein seconded by the opinion
of many Divines (who differ in other things) that
the alienation of them would be no less than <hi>Sacriledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That he would confirm their Ordinance, for the
calling and sitting of the Assembly of Divines.</p>
               <p>5. That he would confirm the form of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
presented to him, with the <hi>Directory;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
those Statutes, which enjoyn'd the use of <hi>Common
Prayer:</hi> and all this for three years; provided that a
consultation should be had, between the <hi>Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
and twenty of His Majestie's nomination added
to them, in the mean time, for the farther setling of
the Church, at the end of those three years; and that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48510:127"/>
Himself and His might have the use of the <hi>Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

But, for the <hi>new Articles of Religion,</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
haveing not had time sufficient, as yet, for conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of so weighty matters, as concern <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> desired, that that part of the <hi>Proposition</hi> might,
for the present be omitted.</p>
               <p>6. That he would confirm the <hi>Ordinance</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alterations should be made of some expressions in them,
which did reflect on former establisht Laws; it being
therefore necessary, that they should be penned in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
termes.</p>
               <p>7. That he would pass an Act; for prevention of
saying Mass in Court, or other places: provided one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that his Queen might have free exercise of her
Religion, for her self and her ordinary servants, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Articles of Marriage, made between the
two Crowns, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Lastly, that for the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he could not in
Conscience take it himself, nor impose it upon others;
therefore hoped that it should not be insisted on, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the imposing thereof could not tend to peace;
a great part, even of the Parliaments-party, being
utterly persuaded against it: And further, because all
the ends of the <hi>Covenant</hi> would be obtained, if an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were made in the rest of the <hi>Propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were the chief; referring the rest untill his
coming to <hi>Westminster,</hi> where he might personally
advise with his two Houses, and deliver his opinion,
with the reasons thereof, which done; he would leave
the whole matter of those remayning <hi>Propositions</hi> to the
determination of his two Houses.</p>
               <p>But, as His Majesty had formerly well observed the
humours of these impious men to be restless; ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and changing their Principles with their success:
So did he then find the greatest and most wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48510:127"/>
thereof. For, having, by the defeat of D. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s
Army; the reducing of <hi>Colchester,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the Welch, in <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi> cleared all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which any could make against them; they then
did openly manifest to the world, that nothing should
suffice, but the absolute destruction of the King, and
utter extirpation of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Towards the accomplishing of which execrable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
a prodigious <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">16. Nov. Declaration of the Army at St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
                  </note> was contrived by
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his son <hi>Ireton,</hi> with some other vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous-minded
officers in the Army, then at St. <hi>Albans,</hi>
and presented to the House of Commons by Colonel
<hi>Evre</hi> and seaven other Officers of the Army, whereby
<hi>they fiercely declaymed against any peace at all with the
King; and likewise against his Restauration:</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that <hi>he should, by a Tryal, be brought to Iustice.</hi>
So likewise against those Members of Parliament, as
had been impeached the year before; and all others
that sate, when the Speaker and Members fled to the
Army, that they might be excluded the House: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
that the Souldiers arrears should be paid
out of the King's and Dean and Chapters lands. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that a certain terme should be prefixed to that
present <hi>Long-Parliament;</hi> as also a more equal number
of persons, as <hi>Representatives of the People,</hi> to be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
elected, in whom the supreme power should
thereafter reside.</p>
               <p>In which <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> it is not unworthy obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that they said; <hi>whereas it might be objected, that
by the</hi> Covenant <hi>they were obliged to the preservation of
His Majestie's person and authority;</hi> it was with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction;
<hi>viz. in the preservation of the true Religion,
and Liberties of the Kingdome.</hi> So that; <hi>considering Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the publick Interest, were to be understood the
principal and supream matters engaged for; and of the
King's person and authority, as inferiour and subordinate
thereto. As also, whereas the preservation of his person
and authority was not consistent with the preservation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☜</note>
                  <hi>and the publick Interest; they were therefore, by
the</hi> Covenant, <hi>obliged against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:48510:128"/>
And the better to illustrate this, they instanced the
practice of the Parliament, all along the late wars;
<hi>which not onely opposed his Majesty and his authority, but
really endeavoured to kill and destroy both his person and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by Bullets and otherwise, in order to the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdome.</hi> Which
<hi>Remonstrance</hi> was soon after presented<note n="v" place="margin">120. Nov.</note> to the
House of Commons, and tendred to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole Kingdome. But three days after,
they <hi>Treaty</hi> (having continued fourty days, whereunto
they limited it) ended<note n="x" place="margin">27. Nov.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And here it is not improper to take notice; that as
they had frequently used to procure <hi>Petitions</hi> from
sundry places, to countenance the carrying on of any
notable design, which they had in hand: So now,
having publisht this wicked <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> they obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Congratulations</hi> from those called the <hi>Well-affected</hi>
in several parts; to the end that others might be the
more danted from any opposition thereto.</p>

               <p>As an Introduction whereunto, it may be sit enough to
observe; that though the Parliament had been garbled
(as before is shewed) whereby the Remnant of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
was totally disheartened: Yet did the Invasion from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and Risings in other Parts, about that
time, put so much Life and Courage into the drooping
Spirits of that Party; as that, having with no little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
carryed the Vote for a <hi>Treaty;</hi> they strugled to their
utmost, for such an issue thereof, that the King might be
at some better Liberty, than he was at that time: and the
Administration of his Authority, in the Two Houses, as
formerly. And then, though the Army stood not right
to them at present; the Majority, of Votes might some
time or other, so alter the case, as that the sweetness of
Dominion might return to them again.</p>
               <p>To second therefore what they had so vigorously begun,
discerning that the Army in pursuance of their late <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi>
were on their March towards <hi>London,</hi> they Voted
<note n="y" place="margin">Hist. of Indep. part 2.</note> a Letter to the General, forbidding his nearer approach.
Which Vote so irritated the Souldiary, that immediately
they publisht a sharp <hi>Declaration;</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">p. 25. &amp; 26.</note> therein accusing the
Parliament with <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Trust, Inconstancy</hi> and <hi>Indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
saying that <hi>they would appeal from them to the People;</hi>
threatning forthwith to advance up to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and
there to do what God should enable them; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
came up<note n="a" place="margin">30. Nov.</note> to the corner of <hi>Hide-park.</hi> Where
upon it was put to the Question in the House; <hi>whether that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48510:129"/>
approach of the Army were not prejudicial to the Freedom of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</hi>
But into such a terror were the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they durst not hold up their Heads
to give their Votes therein.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, within two days following they took bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
heart, and set on foot a debate,<note n="b" place="margin">2. Dec.</note> touching the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriness
of His Majesties Answer to the <hi>Propositions in the
late Treaty.</hi> And, though the same day, the General en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Westminster</hi> with Four Regiments of Foot, and Six
of Horse, taking up his Head Quarters at <hi>White-hall:</hi>
and that soon after the King was seized on in his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
and carryed<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 29. 4. Dec. The King taken from the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and sent to <hi>Hurst-castle.</hi>
                  </note> to <hi>Hurst-Castle</hi> (a Block-house in
the Sea, not far from the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where the cold was
most sharp, and the Air very unwholsome) as men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slam'd,
in this desperate condition, they again took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and held out a stout contest with the <hi>Independant</hi>-Party,
for the space of a whole day and night together: And, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the many sharp Menaces, which they had
from the Sword-men, on the other side; they then Voted,
<note n="d" place="margin">6. Dec. Ib. 1. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>that the King's Answer to the Propositions from both Houses,
was a ground for them to proceed on, to the settlement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which put the Army into such a rage, that they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
sent a Paper to the House by <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hewson</hi> (two
of their Collonels) requiring, <hi>that the formerly impeached
Members, together with Major General</hi> Browne (whom they
charg'd to have been an Inviter of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with
the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army) <hi>might be secured, and brought to Iustice.
As also, that the Ninety and odd Members, who refused to Vote
against the late</hi> Scottish <hi>Engagement; and all that Voted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
the Votes of</hi> Non-Addresses: <hi>and likewise those that Voted
for the late Treaty; and that the King's concessions therein were a
ground for the Houses to proceed to a settlement, should be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
suspended the House. And that all such faithful Members,
as were innocent of those Votes, should by protestation acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from any concurrence in them, to the end they might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And scorning to make any long stay, for an Answer to
that their Paper, they sent, the next Morning, certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Horse and Foot to <hi>Westminster,</hi> who setting
Guards upon all the Avenues to the Parliament House,
seized upon one and Forty of the Members, then Sitting, <hi>viz.</hi>

called <hi>Hell;</hi> where they kept them all night,

the House, leaving<note n="f" place="margin">7. Dec.</note> it to about an hundred and

¶It is very well known to the world, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole course of this grand Rebellion, it was the
usual practise of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to make great advantages
unto their Party, by frequenting of Sermons, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of other pretended exercises of Religion. Amongst
which the strict observance of such dayes, as were set apart
by their Leaders for <hi>Seeking of God</hi> (as they call'd it) by
<hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and other wayes of Humiliation, were
not the least. In which act of deluding the People, they
were at length grown to be such excellent Masters; that,
when any transcendent work was to be done, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ushered in, with this sanctified veile; under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that in the zealous performance of those Duties, they
<hi>did ask Council of the Lord:</hi> and thereupon, by some more
than ordinary Illumination, were directed to proceed in
the business design'd.</p>
               <p>Which notable example the <hi>Independants,</hi> deeming fit to
be imitated, in order to their own High and Mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
they kept a Fast<note n="g" place="margin">8. Dec.</note> in the House of Commons, upon
the Eighth of <hi>December.</hi> Where Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshall</hi>
(formerly the Great Bell-weather of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Flock) Mr. <hi>Carrill</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> Preacht that day to
them; under pretence of directing them to humble their
Spirits, now that God had so signally appeared to them in
their great Victory over the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Preston,</hi> and other
eminent manifestations.</p>
               <p>Next to which devout work, the remaining Members,
that sate after this <hi>Grand Purge,</hi> damn'd<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 37. &amp; 38.</note> all the Votes,
which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had made, either in reference to the
<hi>Treaty,</hi> or to their secluded Brethren. And, within few
days after, divers of the Lords went to the General, to
express their good affections to him, and concurrence with
his purposes for the Common God: as also to let his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
know,<note place="margin">☞</note> that they would wave their <hi>Priviledges</hi>
and <hi>Titles,</hi> in case they should be found burthensome to the
Liberties of the People.</p>
               <p>And, as the Lords had thus manifested their obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Army: so did also the most Godly men of the
House of Commons; by subscribing<note n="i" place="margin">Ib. p. 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 49.</note> a <hi>Protestation</hi> against
the late Treaty with the King, in the Isle of <hi>Wight:</hi> but
especially against that Vote of 5. <hi>Dec.</hi> allowing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Answer to the <hi>Propositions</hi> of Both Houses, to be a
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48510:130"/>
ground for them to proceed on for a Settlement: the names

the King. Whereupon <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> stood up and said,

Council.</hi>

as a return of Prayer, and that God had rejected him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it was lawful to circumvent a wicked man with deceit and fraud.</hi>

Charles Start, <hi>they should repaire, the day following, at Two

having a Sword and Mace carryed before him; and
for his Guard Twenty Souldiers with Partizans, under the
Command of Colonel <hi>Fox</hi> the Tinker.</p>
               <p>Where, after this Prodigious Monster (<hi>Bradshaw</hi>) with
the rest of that Bloody-pack (in all to the number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
two, the rest then declining to shew their Faces in
so Horrid an Enterprize, though most of them afterwards
avowed the same) were set; and that Hellish Act read,
whereby they were constituted the King's Judges; His
Majesty was brought to the Bar by Colonel <hi>Hacker,</hi>
Guarded with a Company of Halberdeers. In whose
passage, it is not unworthy of note, that <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>
(one of their wicked Preachers) did set on divers of the
Souldiers to cry out <hi>Iustice, Iustice,</hi> against him, and that
one of them did then Spit in the King's Face.</p>
               <p>Which being done, that insolent <hi>Bradshaw</hi> stood up, and
most impudently told<note n="c" place="margin">Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. Part. 1. p. 87.</note> the King (calling him <hi>Charles Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art)
that the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament,
being sensible of the great Calamities brought upon this Nation;
and of the Innocent Blood shed (which was referred to him as the
Author) according to that duty which they did owe to God, the
Nation, and themselves; and according to that Power and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48510:133"/>
Trust reposed in them by the People, had Constituted
that High Court of Iustice, before which he was then brought;
and that he was to hear his Charge, upon which the Court would
proceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cook</hi> their Sollicitor, went on, and said,<note n="d" place="margin">Ib,</note> 
                  <hi>that
he did accuse</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>there present, of High Treason,
and Misdemeanors; and did, in the Name of the Commons of
England, desire that the Charge might be read against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon they caused their most false and Infamous
Charge to be read. Which importing, <hi>that he being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
King of <hi>England,</hi> and trusted with a limited Power,
for the good and benefit of the People, had Trayterously and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
levyed War against that present Parliament, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
therein represented; and caused and procured many Thousands
of the Free People of this Nation to be slain. Concluding,
that he did therefore impeach him, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
and a publick and implacable Enemy to the Common-wealth
of <hi>England;</hi> Praying, that he might be put to answer the
premisses; and that such Proceedings, Examinations, Tryals,
Sentence and Iudgment might be thereupon had, as should be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not stay here to give instance of the particular
expressions then made by His Majesty unto those Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirsty
men. Which were with the greatest Wisdom, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and Christian Courage imaginable; considering that
they already are by some Historians, and others, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
publisht to the World: He absolutely denying and
renouncing that their usurped Jurisdiction, and Authority
thus to convent him; and stoutly refusing to submit to
their power. In which he most undauntedly persisted every
time he was brought before them, with incomparable
magnanimity of Spirit.</p>
               <p>On the Second<note n="e" place="margin">21. Ian.</note> day of their Sitting, they held a Fast at
<hi>White-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on the Third day,<note n="f" place="margin">22. Ian.</note> the <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners
delivered in certain Papers to them, with a <hi>Declaration</hi>
from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> importing a dislike
of those their Proceedings against His Majesty, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
regarded.</p>
               <p>After which, to the end that these Barbarous Regicides
might the better consult touching the manner of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and to perform it with the greater Ignominy,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48510:134"/>
they respited his Sentence of Death for Four or Five days.
But then, having fully determined thereon, upon <hi>Saturday</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">27. Ian.</note> the Twenty Seventh of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> they caused Him to be
brought before them again. Where, after a most insolent
Speech, made by the same <hi>Bradshaw</hi> the President, His
<hi>Sentence of Death</hi> was read; there being then present no
less than Seventy two of those His Bloody Murtherers,
called Judges, who stood up and avowed the same, the
Names of which I have noted with an <hi>Asterism</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Catalogue.</p>
               <p>Which being done, a Publick Declaration<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 108.</note> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be drawn against the Proclaiming of Prince
<hi>Charles,</hi> after the removal of his Father out of this Life;
denouncing it to be High Treason for any one so to do.
Likewise, that no person upon Pain of Imprisonment,
and such other punishments as should be thought fit, might
speak or divulge any thing contrary to those their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>And upon the Morrow, being <hi>Sunday,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">28. <hi>Ian.</hi> Ib. p. 109.</note> some of the
Grandees came, and tendred to him a Paper Book, with
promise of Life, and some shadow of Regality, in case he
would Subscribe it; which contained many particulars
destructive to the Religion establisht, to the Laws of the
Land, and to the Liberties and Properties of the People.
Whereof one was, that he should pass an Act, for keeping
on Foot their Army during the pleasure of such, as they
should nominate to be entrusted with the <hi>Militia;</hi> with
power, from time to time, to recruit and continue them,
to the Number of Forty Thousand Horse and Foot, under
their present General and Officers, and that the Council of
War, should have power to make choise of new Officers,
and Generals, from time to time, as occasion should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and they think fit: as also to settle a Tax upon the
People, by way of Land-rate for supporting the same
Army; to be Collected and levyed by the Souldiers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And for the establishing a Court-Marshal of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
extent. But so soon as His Majesty had read
some few of those Tyrannous <hi>Proposals,</hi> he threw them
aside; saying, <hi>that he would rather become a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for
his People, than thus betray their Laws, Liberties, Lives, and
Estates, with the Church, the Common-wealth, and Honour of the
Crown, to so intolerable a Bondage of an Armed Faction.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:48510:134"/>
And such a Sacrifice they really made him, upon the
<hi>Tuesday</hi> following (which was the Thirtieth<note n="k" place="margin">30. <hi>Ian.</hi> Ib. p. 110.</note> of <hi>Ianuary</hi>)
having (the more to affront and deject him, had it been
possible) built a Scaffold for His Murther, before the Great
Gate at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> whereunto they fixed several Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Iron, and prepared Cords, to tye him down to the
Block, had he made any resistance to that Cruel, and Bloody
stroke. To which place they then brought him on Foot,
from St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s attended by Guards of Souldiers;
having filled all the Streets, from <hi>Charing-Cross</hi> to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> with Troops of Horse, and Companies
of Foot.</p>
               <p>Whereon, being ascended with the Greatest Christian
Magnanimity imaginable; he told them, <hi>that they were in
a wrong way to the Kingdoms Peace, their design being to do it
by Conquest, in which God would never prosper them.</hi> Farther
declaring to them, <hi>that the right way thereto, would be first
to give God his due, by regulating rightfully the Church, in a
National Synod, freely call'd and freely debating. Secondly the
King (his Successor) his due: wherein the Laws of the Land
would sufficiently instruct them. Thirdly the People, theirs;
in such a Government, whereby their Lives and Gods might be
most their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was for that</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I come now hither; for would I
have given way to an Arbitrary sway, to have all Laws changed,
according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come
here.</hi> Telling them farther (<hi>but praying God, it might not
be laid to their Charge) that he was the Peoples Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, most Christianly forgiving all,<note place="margin">The King Murthered.</note> praying for
His Enemies, he meekly submitted to the stroke of the
Axe. It is not unworthy of Observation (and therefore, not
finding a more proper place for it, I have thought fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
it here.) that some of those most Impious Regicides,
who sate, and gave judgment of Death upon this Blessed
Martyr, when, (after the happy Restoration of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Soveraign) they were brought to their Tryals for
that unparallel'd Murther; stuck not (in justification of
themselves) to plead, <hi>that they were not within the compass of
Treason, as it is declared by the Statute of 25. E. 3. For that,
questionless,</hi> (said they) <hi>must intend private Persons, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilling,

and Commons, the Parliament of <hi>Enlgand,</hi> and by virtue of
their Authority was raised; they pretending by the Laws, that the
right of the Militia was in them; whereupon, accordingly, they
rais'd a Force, making the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> General, and after

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND here, having made a mournful stop, for

loss of this excellent Prince,<note place="margin">Whether the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> or <hi>Independants</hi> were the chief Actors Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King</note> and the direful
actings of these matchless Conspirators; I
begin to consider, that the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
may (possibly) take much exceptions at this Historical
<hi>Narrative,</hi> in regard that by the Life of the King was not
taken away by them, but by that Sect which are usually
called <hi>Independants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I answer, that, it is not denyed, but that he
was actually put to death, by those who (in common
discourse) do pass under that name. But whether the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> can clear themselves from the Guilt of his
Murther, as I know not how to excuse them; so am I
somewhat doubtful thereof.</p>
               <p>For in the First place I would ask, whether they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
not the men, which Originally put themselves in Armes
against him, and strenuously endeavoured to kill him in
sundry Battles? and whether the name of <hi>Independant</hi> was
ever then heard of?</p>
               <p>Next, whether they did not <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and therein vowed to endeavour the establishing of Church-Government
here, consonant to that of theirs, which is
well known to be <hi>Presbyterian?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:48510:136"/>
Likewise, whether they, either before, or whilst the
King was in their Hands, did ever make <hi>Proposals</hi> to him;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but that the establishing of their <hi>Discipline</hi> was chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Moreover, whether they were not the first that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
betwixt <hi>His Person</hi> and <hi>His Office?</hi> and by the
strength of their Armies, Murthered him in his Politick
Capacity, usurping with great boldness, the Power and
Authority thereof?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Likewise, whether they were not the very men, that
made him their Prisoner at <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and <hi>Holden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
refusing him the comfort of any one of his own Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Finally, whether they did not perpetually torment
him, with their incessant importunities; not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Felo de se,</hi> in Murthering himself in his Regal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
by giving up the Power of the Sword, into their
ambitious Hands: but by endeavouring to extort his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
for the Sacrificing the Lands of the Church to their
greedy Appetite; aiming therein, as much as in them lay,
at the very ruine of his Soul, by making him a Robber of
God; and thereby pulling upon him all those heavy Curses,
denounc'd by the Pious Donors of those large Possessions,
on the Violaters of their devout Gifts, which they full well
knew, that by his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> he was strictly obliged
to defend.</p>
               <p>And, though a more violent and rigid sort of these
men, who severed from the rest, not so much in point of
difference in Religion (if I may say they have any Religion
in them at all) as to secular Interest; did get the King out
of their Hands; using him no less Barbarously, and at
length did put an end to his Life by an insolent and cruel
Murther of his Royal Person: what was this worse, than
was done to him by the <hi>Presbyterian?</hi> who most inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tormented him, by a lingring and disconsolate Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment;
wherein he was in perpetual fear of Murther,
by Pistol, Dagger, or Poyson. Nay I would ask of any
Rational man, whether the would not rather choose to
have an end to the like Miseries, by an open and Publick
Death, as His Majesty had, whereby the World might be
the more convinc'd of his Innocency, and Goodness;
than to be so strictly immur'd in the merciless hands of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48510:136"/>
such, who might thereby take advantage to divulge what
they list of him.</p>
               <p>I cannot deny, but that so soon as this Hellish-Murther
was committed, many of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against it; seeming as much to wash their Hands of
the Guilt, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did from the Death of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
And I am not ignorant, that whosoever shall, in
any sort, charge the Guilt of his Blood upon them, must
expect to be severely censur'd by all that Party.</p>
               <p>Therefore I shall herein refer the decision of this point,
to a Person wholly unconcern'd, and without exception;
being a Forreigner both by Birth and Residence, most
Eminent for his Learning, throughout the Christian

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND now, before I proceed farther in this
Historical Discourse, there are two mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Scandals, wherewith these wicked
men, since that execrable Murther of their
Lawful Soveraign, have endeavoured to
bespot his precious Memory.</p>
               <p>The first is, that to colour these their most perfidious
and Barbarous dealings, they have not stuck to say, that
<hi>Cromwell</hi> had a real purpose (after the King was so taken
from <hi>Holdenby</hi>) to restore him to his just Rights (as hath
been already observed,) with this condition, that he
should wholly rely upon him, and his Party, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to procure any aid from the <hi>Scots</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But, that after he was brought to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
a certain Letter from the Queen was intercepted by them,
and privately opened; the Contents whereof were, that
she did thereby acquaint him, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were, Raising,
or preparing to Raise an Army in order to his Restoration,
or expressions to that effect. And, that <hi>Cromwel,</hi> having
seen this Letter, and made it up again so artificially, that
no violation of the Seal could appear, convey'd it to the
King, and the next Morning sent <hi>Ireton</hi> on purpose to His
Majesty, to enquire of him what he knew of any Hostile
Preparations then in hand by the <hi>Scots</hi> to the purpose afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
Unto whom the King briefly saying, that <hi>he did
neither know nor believe any thing thereof, Ireton</hi> return'd with
this answer; and that thereupon both of them concluding
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48510:137"/>
that His Majesty was not to be farther trusted, they did
thenceforth resolve to proceed against him, as hath been
already shewed.</p>
               <p>To the which Story, as to the improbability of it, I
reply, that 'tis very well known the King was in that open
Freedom at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> all the time he remained
there, that divers of his old and Faithful Servants were
not only permitted to attend on His Royal Person, in their
respective places, but many others had the Liberty of Free
access to him: So that it is not at all likely, that any Letter
from the Queen should come to him at that time, by other
hands than those who were of known trust.</p>
               <p>Besides, what could he expect from the <hi>Scots,</hi> which
might conduce to the Restoring him to any part of his
Regal Authority, without submitting to their solemn
<hi>League and Covenant,</hi> which they full well knew he could
never be prevail'd with to do.</p>
               <p>Next, that he had no great reason to conside much in
Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s fair intentions towards him, in case he
should have vanquisht those men. And lastly, that it had
been no Prudence to depend upon the strength of their
Armes, considering that the Events of War are uncertain;
especially, having so much reason to hope, and believe,
that <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Party (who had such an influence upon
those Members which then Sate in their Parliament, as on
the Army) would accomplish what he had so solemnly
promised; considering also, (in all Humane reason) it
would conduce to his own proper Interest. Thus much as
to the Improbability of any Truth herein.</p>
               <p>But now to the Impossibility thereof. Let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that the <hi>Scots</hi> could not foresee any danger towards
His Majesty till after he left <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> which
was upon the Eleventh of <hi>November</hi> 1647. Nor then, till
the Month of <hi>December</hi> next following, that they saw the
Fur <hi>Dethroning Bills,</hi> which through the influence of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
and his Party were sent to him; and the Vote on the
Third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> ensuing, of <hi>No more Addresses;</hi> Shortly
after which he was made close Prisoner by Colonel <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which destructive Bills, and malevolent Votes, was that
which in truth alarm'd the <hi>Scots,</hi> as it did the <hi>English</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Parts: who, discerning His Majesty in this miserable
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48510:138"/>
condition, made several attempts in order to his rescue
(though without success, as hath been already observed:)
who thereupon, and not till then did constitute<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> 1648. Vide <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi>'s Hist. of K. <hi>Charles</hi> p. 1071.</note> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee

to any preparation for Raising an Army) and necessitated
them to consider what was without delay to be done in
this great exigent; foreseeing well, that the Tyranny of
these Antimonarchists would, in the end, overwhelm
them there, as well as the <hi>English</hi> here. Whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to Raise an Army in order thereto.</p>
               <p>Besides, most apparent it is, that the King was so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of any Preparations made by the <hi>Scots</hi> to that purpose,
that,<note place="margin">

Prudence, Patience, and Piety, in those his woful Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
would be made openly conspicuous to the World;
and not being able to suppress them, (as they did earnestly
endeavour to do) they made it their work to blast them,
by their false and Impudent Reports, that they were none
of his own, but composed by some Royallist to gain a
Reputation to his Memory, which they studyed by all
malicious projects and practises to suppress, and to that
purpose encouraged a needy Pedagogue, preferring him
to the Office of Secretary, to write that Scandalous Book

               <p>What I have here instanced to wipe off this soul stain,

the mouths of those vile Detractors, which are any way

many Annotations. To the Duke of <hi>York</hi> his large

               <p>Hereunto it will not seem impertinent, I presume, to

                  </hi> which he caused Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Harington</hi> to compare with the Original, who found
it most accurately done.</p>
               <p>Those particulars are such, whereof those who have
publisht much of his Life and Reign have not taken
notice.</p>
               <p>To give a Character of his Eminent virtues I shall not
need, it being already so well done by Dr. <hi>Pireinchief</hi> in
the short History which he hath publisht of his Life; but
shall take notice, that his delight in Learning was such,
that he understood <hi>Greek, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian</hi>
Authors in their Original Languages, which Three last he
spake perfectly; no man being better read in Histories of
all sorts, being able also to Discourse in most Arts and
Sciences.</p>
               <p>In one of his Books he wrote this Distich of <hi>Claudian.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Rebus in adversis facile est contemnere vitam,</l>
               <l>Fortiter ille facit, qui miser esse potest.</l>
               <p>And out of another Poet, against the Levellers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonar
chists then predominant:</p>
               <l>Fallitur egregio quisquis sub principe credit</l>
               <l>Servitium. Nunquam libertas gratior extat</l>
               <l>Quàm sub Rege pio—</l>
               <p>Whereunto I shall add, that after Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had much
sollicited those who were then in Power, that His Royal
Corps might be Buryed in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
at <hi>Westminster,</hi> near to the Grave of King <hi>Iames;</hi>
which they refused, alledging the danger of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to that place out of a superstitious respect; they
thereupon granted a Warrant to him, bearing Date the
Sixth of <hi>February</hi> for the Interring thereof at <hi>Windsor.</hi>
Hence it was, that Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> having often heard His
Majesty speak with Great Honour of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourth, from whom he was descended, he resolved to
Bury the Corps in that Vault under the Monument of that
King (which is betwixt the High Altar and the North Isle)
and gave order for the opening thereof accordingly: but
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48510:140"/>
the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Hertsord,</hi> Earl of
<hi>Southampton,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> coming to <hi>Windsor</hi> to
perform their last duty of His Memory, in seeing His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Corps decently Interred; and walking up the Quire,
where they found by knocking on the Pavement an hollow
found, they caused the place to be opened, it being near
to the Seats, and opposite to the Eleventh Stall on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's
side; in which were Two Coffins, one very
large, of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the other of Queen
<hi>Iane</hi> his Third Wife, both covered with Velvet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they concluded to deposit it there. It was therefore
brought down accordingly out of the King's Lodgings,
in the upper Ward of the Castle, into the Court, the Air
being then Serene: but (which is observable) before they
came to the Door of the Chapel, there hapned Snow to
fall, which covered the Hearse of Black Velvet, in which
it was carryed, that it was all White. It being brought
to the Grave, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Iuxon</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi>
who had been permitted to wait on His Majesty in the
time of His Preparation for Death, and on the Scaffold,
was there ready to have performed the Office of Burial, as
it is prescribed in the Publick Liturgy of the Church; but
the Governor of the Castle (Colonel <hi>Whitchcot</hi>) would not
suffer it.</p>

Serious and Grave consideration, and debate the Particulars in the
Papers here humbly offered to you: and also present them to the
Honourably Parliament, that they may be improved so far, as
shall be found agreeable to the will and word of God. Which
done, we doubt not, but God shall have much Glory, the Godly
Party shall be comforted: Natural men (enjoying their Estates)
will be at rest also, and much satisfied, and this Common-wealth
will be exalted, to be both an Habitation of Iustice, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Holiness; even such a People as God shall Bless.</p>
               <p>An humble Advice, concerning the Government of the
Kingdom, according to the former Platform, or Model.</p>
               <p>1. That you would stir up Godly Ministers, and People,
throughout the Kingdom, to Associate, or incorporate into Church-Societies;
and grant them your special Favour, Provision and
Protection; so shall you be Saints Nursing Fathers.</p>
               <p>2. That you would please to satisfie the Godly-dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
both of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> (by such ways
and means as your Wisdoms shall think fit) how both their Interests
may meet herein, that so they may concur with one heart in the
work.</p>
               <p>3. That Sister-Churches over-see such Incorporations, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodyings,
that only such as be of approved Godliness, may have
the Right-hand of Fellowship given to them.</p>
               <p>4. That such Churches, where more of them are thus Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and imbodyed in any Division, Circuit, Province, &amp;c. may
choose and send out some Delegates, Members, and Officers to
Meet in one Sessions, Lesser-Parliament, Presbytery, or Assembly,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48510:142"/>
for ordering of all such affaires as there occur, according to the
word, if appertaining alone to that division.</p>
               <p>5. That all such Churches, and the Members thereof, have
voices in Elections of such as are to sit in General Assemblies,
or Church-Parliaments, so often as occasion is; and those Elected
to Sit there as Christ's Officers, and the Churches Representatives;
and to determine all things by the word, as that Law, which God
will exalt alone and make honourable.</p>
               <p>6. That you take special care to send out, and encourage Godly
Preachers, that may go into the rest of the Kingdom, to Preach
the Gospel; that so, when others are converted, and the Son of God
makes them Free, they may enjoy the former Freedom with the rest of
the Saints.</p>
               <p>And in father order to the utter abolishing of <hi>Kingly
Government,</hi> they appointed all those Antick and most Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
<hi>Regalia,</hi> conserved in the Treasury at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and chiefly made use of at the Magnificent Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Kings of the Realm, and solemn Proceedings
to Parliament: And also the costly Hangings, precious Jewels,
with other of the Kings Goods,<note place="margin">18. Febr.</note> and rich Furniture for his
several Princely Palaces, to be sold. And, within few
days following, caused the Heads of <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,
Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Holand,</hi> with that truly Noble <hi>Arthur</hi>
Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> to be cut off. Touching whose actings against
them, having already made some brief mention, I shall
only take notice of their dealing with Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before his Execution,<note place="margin">2. Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. p. 2. p. 131.</note> which was that in order to his
discovery of such Members of Parliament, and Citizens
of <hi>London,</hi> as had any Hand in calling him in, <hi>Cromwel</hi>
took a Journey on purpose, to <hi>Windsor,</hi> and there flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
him with fair promises of Life: and though he could
get nothing out of him; nevertheless he caused <hi>Bradshaw</hi>
to carry a favourable countenance towards him upon his
Tryal in <hi>Westminster-Hall;</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi>
Colonel <hi>Wayte</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> being likewise imploy'd to
him upon the like Errand: who told him, that they would
not much obstruct him Pretended Plea of Quarter from
<hi>Lambert,</hi> upon Articles: <hi>Peters</hi> also promising him to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the same for him (though <hi>Wayte</hi> upon his Report to
the House of Commons, of the manner how he took him,
had affirmed, that he yielded at discretion, and that <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:48510:142"/>
was not near him.) Nay honest <hi>Hugh</hi> seem'd so
zealous in his behalf, that he Prayed openly for him as his
Lord and Patron, and fed him with no small hopes in case
he would impeach those whom they suspected. But <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
in stead of complying with them therein. (expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise to save his Head) did not only offer them
an hundred thousand Pounds for his Life, intimating what
Service he would do them in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but assured
them, that he would joyn Interests with <hi>Argile,</hi> and be a
Servant to them there. Whereupon Messengers were sent
Post thither, to know <hi>Argile</hi>'s mind; who resolving, that
none should share with him in so Glorious a Work, refused
any conjunction with him. The Wind, therefore, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that Door, <hi>Bradshaw</hi> used him more roughly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Farther Tryal, than before; and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
what he had formerly testified; insomuch, as
Sentence of Death was given against him. Nevertheless,
that he might still expect Life, and not give that Glory
to God in this his Judgment, and cast Infamy upon them,
by a Christian acknowledgment of his own and <hi>Argile</hi>'s
mutual Practises, they soon cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>And immediately after this, they passed an Act,<note n="a" place="margin">17. Martii Scob. Coll. p. 7.</note> for
discharging all people from their Allegiance to the late
King's Issue, and <hi>abolishing</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid: p. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kingly Office.</hi> Likewise for
<hi>abolishing the House of Peers, as useless and dangerous: but
with favour to some Lords, who had demeaned themselves with
honour, courage and fidelity to the Common-wealth</hi> (as the words
are) <hi>so that they might be capable of Voting in Parliament, if
elected; Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> being<note n="c" place="margin">16. Apr.</note> the first, which
had the benefit of this Act, being admitted a Commoner
in this new fram'd Parliament; and the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>
of Escrick the Second. After whom followed <hi>William</hi>
Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>—</p>
               <p>And wisely considering;<note place="margin">An. 1649.</note> that as the <hi>Preachers</hi> had been
their chief Instruments, for infusing such Principles into
the Vulgar sort of People, by their Seditious Lecturing
Sermons, as had at last accomplisht their long studied
design, for the abolishing of Monarchical Government:
Lest therefore, that by the same Engine, the like ruine in
time, might be brought upon themselves; they ordered,
<hi>that no Minister, in the Pulpit, should meddle with any State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Matters;</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48510:143"/>
therein pursuing the practise of the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
who had done so before, for the prevention of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to their own Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But now to digress a little; let us here behold what a
Brain-sick Generation in a short space of time sprung up
from this precious root of <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About<note n="d" place="margin">Hist. of Indep. p. 2. p. 152.</note> this time, there came Six Souldiers into the
Parish-Church of <hi>Walton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi>
near Twylight in the Evening (Mr. <hi>Faucet,</hi> the Preacher
there, having not till then ended his Sermon) one of
which number with a Lanthorn in his hand, and a Candle
burning in it; and in the other Hand, four Candles not
lighted, desired the Parishoners to stay a while; saying,
that he had a Message from God unto them, and thereupon
offered to go up into the Pulpit. But the people, refusing
to give him leave so to do, or to stay in the Church, he
went into the Church-yard, and there told them, that he
had a Vision, wherein he had received a command from
God, to declare his will unto them, which he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
and they to receive, upon pain of damnation; it
consisting of Five Lights.</p>
               <p>1. That the Sabbath was abolisht as unnecessary, Iewish, and
meerly Ceremonial; <hi>And here</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I should put out my
first Light, but the wind is so high I cannot kindle it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That Tithes are abolisht, as Iewish and Ceremonial, a
great Burthen to the Saints of God, and a discouragement of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Tillage; <hi>and here I should put out my Second
Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. That Ministers are abolisht, as Antichristian, and of no
longer use, now Christ himself descends into the hearts of his Saints,
and his Spirit enlighteneth them with Revelations, and Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>And here I should put out my Third Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Magistrates are abolished, as useless, now that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is in purity of Spirit come among us, and hath erected the
Kingdom of the Saints upon Earth. Besides they are Tyrants and
Oppressors of the Liberty of the Saints, and tye them to Laws and
Ordinances, meer humane Inventions: <hi>And here I should put
out my Fourth Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Then putting his Hand into his Pocket, and pulling
out a little Bible, he shewed it open to the People, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Here is a Book you have in great Veneration, consisting of
Two parts, the Old and New Testament: I must tell you, it is
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48510:143"/>
abolished, it containeth Beggarly Rudiments, Milk for Babes:
but now Christ is in Glory amongst us, and imparts a farther
measure of his Spirit to his Saints, than this can afford, I am
commanded to burn it before your Face. <hi>So taking the Candle
out of his Lanthorn, he set fire on it. Then putting out
the Candle he said;</hi> and here my Fifth Light is extinguished.</p>
               <p>Nay, the stream at that time carryed Multitudes, so
violently, this way, that the Souldiers fell to Preaching
<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 153.</note> in many places; six of them, in one day, exercising
their Gifts, in that kind, at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> in so much,
as that Grand Impostor <hi>Cromwel,</hi> subtilly observing the
bent of this Tide, ascended the Pulpit there himself, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that he was called up by the Spirit of God; and
standing a good while with his Eyes lifted up (as it were
in a Trance) his Head inclining to one side, he fetcht ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deep Groans; spent one hour in his Prayer, and near
two in his Sermon. In which Prayer, his Humility was
such; that, in imitation of <hi>Moses,</hi> he desired God to take
off from his Shoulders the Government of this Mighty
People of <hi>England,</hi> as being too heavy for him to
bear.</p>
               <p>And so much did he then pretend to <hi>Revelations,</hi> and
<hi>Inspirations;</hi> that when any weighty matter was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, he usually retired for a quarter of an hour, or
more, and declared what was revealed to him. But to
proceed.</p>
               <p>About this time they passed an Act,<note n="f" place="margin">7. <hi>April.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 8.</note> for supporting
of their Military Forces, by imposing a Tax of Ninety
thousand Pound; <hi>Per Mensem</hi> upon the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And that the people might be totally confounded as to
matter of Religion, or have any regard to Moral Honesty,
but wholly guided by those whimsical Fantasies, which
were, by their Ring-leaders called the <hi>Revelations</hi> and
<hi>Inspirations of God's Holy Spirit;</hi> it was referred<note n="g" place="margin">12. <hi>April.</hi> Ib. p. 156.</note> to a
Committee, to consider of a way for the Raising of
Pensions, and allowances out of Deans and Chapters
Lands, to maintain certain <hi>Itinerant Preachers,</hi> who were
Authorized to go up and down, and spread abroad their
Antimonarchical Doctrine, whereby the Rabble might
be set up, and comply with the Souldiery against the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, Clergy, Lawyers, and all orderly
Government. But upon better consideration, fearing
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48510:144"/>
that the Liberty, might in time, overwhelm them with
confusion; and give such a countenance to the <hi>Levellers</hi>
(of whose help they had made no small use, for the King's
Destruction) as would bring upon them inevitable ruine;
<hi>Cromwel</hi> moved<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 157.</note> in their Parliament, that the <hi>Presbyterian
Government</hi> might be setled, promising his endeavours
thereto; and that the secured and secluded Members
might be again invited to return into the House.</p>
               <p>They likewise imploy'd divers of their Preachers (of
which Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carrel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi>
and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> were the chief) to cajole others of their
own Coat, together with the Citizens and expulsed
Members, with certain Discourses and Proposals; telling
them, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did differ with the King in
point of Civil Interest, which was much more irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than the Interest of Church Government, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shew was made to the contrary: Also,<note n="i" place="margin">Ib. p. 158.</note> that it was
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who first made War against the late King,
brought him low, and prepared him to receive his deadly
blow from the <hi>Independants:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> and therefore, that the King
would look upon them, as equally Guilty with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants,</hi>
and endeavour equally to cut them off; their
design being thereby to cast the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> into utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair;
and so, to bring them in point of self Preservation,
to joyn with their Interests, for common defence.</p>
               <p>And to carry on their work with the more shew of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
they ordered,<note n="k" place="margin">19. <hi>April.</hi> Ibid.</note> that a strict Fast should be kept, to
humble themselves, and implore God's Forgiveness, for
the Ingratitude of the People, who did not sufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
with Thankfulness, Gods Great Mercies
upon this Land, in Freeing them from Monarchy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
Liberty upon them, by changing <hi>Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
into a <hi>Free State,</hi> or Republick.</p>
               <p>To sweeten, likewise, the affections of the Vulgar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, they made most specious pretences of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the publick Debts, and raising Three Hundred
thousand Pounds for supplying the necessities of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
(as they term'd it) without any charge or
burthen to the people; and to that end passed an Act
<note n="l" place="margin">30. <hi>April.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 16. Act for sale of Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> for abolishing all Deans and Chapters, and for sale of
their Lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:48510:144"/>
And the better to fortifie themselves, and their Usurped
Dominion, they fram'd another Act,<note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>May.</hi> Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. p. 2. p. 167.</note> whereby they
declared certain particulars to be Treason, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. If any man should maliciously affirm their present
Government to be Tyrannical, usurped, or unlawful:
or that the Commons in Parliament were not the Supream
Authority of the Nation; or that should endeavour to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that their Government.</p>
               <p>2. If any should affirm their Council of State or Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
to be Tyrannical or unlawful, or endeavour to
Subvert them, or stir up Sedition against them.</p>
               <p>3. For any Souldiers of their Army to contrive the
death of the General, or Lieutenant General; or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Raise Mutinies in the Army; or to Levy War against
the Parliament, or to joyn with any to Invade <hi>England</hi>
or <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Counterfeit their Great Seal, or kill any
Member of their Parliament; or any Judge or Minister of
Justice in their duty.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, they framed and passed another Act,
<note n="n" place="margin">19. <hi>May.</hi> Scob. Coll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 30.</note> declaring <hi>England</hi> with all the Dominions and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
thereto belonging, to be a <hi>Free State,</hi> and to be
Governed by the Representatives of the People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without any King or House of Lords. Which Act
was Proclaimed<note n="o" place="margin">30. <hi>May.</hi> Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. part 2. p. 184. &amp; 185.</note> in the City of <hi>London,</hi> by Alderman

               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Londoners</hi> being by that time brought unto so much
Vassalage by these insolent Regicides; as that, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to a Vote, made by their servile Parliament, they
were constrain'd to invite<note n="p" place="margin">7. <hi>Iunii.</hi> Ib. p. 187.</note> that wicked Conclave to a
<hi>Thanksgiving Dinner;</hi> whereat all of them were to rejoyce
together, for bringing the Grand Delinquent to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(that is to say for the Murther of the King) for the
greater honour of that day, the Lord Mayor met the
Speaker, and the other Members of Parliament at <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Bar:</hi>
and there resigning the Sword to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48510:145"/>
it again, and carryed it before him to <hi>Christs Church.</hi>
Whence, after a Canting Sermon, he conducted them to
<hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> and entertain'd them in the quality of
a <hi>Free State:</hi> the Cooks having every one of them an
Oath to prepare for those Saints, nothing but wholsome
Food.</p>
               <p>Being therefore thus seeming firmly setled in their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Dominion, they went on in passing sundry other
Acts, in their Pseudo-Parliament, of which the Ruling
Grandees had the chief benefit, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. To<note n="q" place="margin">25. <hi>Iunii.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 45.</note> encourage the Purchasers of Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Lands, by the sale of them at Ten years Purchase, in
case of ready Money; or doubling what was due to those
as should so purchase.</p>
               <p>2. Another for<note n="r" place="margin">4. <hi>Iulii.</hi> Ib. p. 46.</note> the sale of the Goods, and Personal
Estate of the King, Queen, and Prince.</p>
               <p>3. A Third<note n="s" place="margin">16. <hi>Iulii.</hi> Ib. p. 51.</note> for sale of the Crown Lands, with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Instructions to sell them at Thirteen years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.</p>
               <p>4. Soon after this they passed another Act,<note n="t" place="margin">17. <hi>Iulii.</hi> Ib. p. 64.</note> for Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of new Money; with direction for the form of the
stamp to be thereon.</p>
               <p>5. Another,<note n="u" place="margin">17. <hi>Iulii.</hi> Ib. p. 65.</note> declaring what Offences should be thenceforth adjudged Treason; <hi>viz.</hi> to express or publish
their Government to be Tyrannical; or that the Commons
in Parliament were not the Supream Authority.</p>
               <p>6. And for the quicker riddance of Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Lands, they added farther Power<note n="x" place="margin">31. <hi>Iulii.</hi> Ib. p. 68.</note> and Instructions to
the Trustees for the sale of them.</p>
               <p>7. Next, to reward their Bloody President <hi>Bradshaw,</hi>
who gave Judgment of Death upon the King, they passed
another Act,<note n="y" place="margin">15. Aug.</note> for settling Two thousand pounds <hi>per
annum</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p>And that there might be a known mark of distinction,
betwixt themselves and others they passed an Act,<note n="z" place="margin">2. <hi>Ian.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 101. Act for the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for
the Subscribing an <hi>Engagement;</hi> whereby every man should
promise <hi>to be true and Faithful to the Government then established,
without a King or House of Lords;</hi> or in case of refusal to
have no benefit of the Laws.</p>
               <p>But the Crown-lands, so doom'd to be sold, went but
slowly off: they therefore passed another Act<note n="a" place="margin">18. <hi>Febr.</hi> Ibid.</note> to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a Committee to remove obstructions in the sale of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48510:145"/>
them. Nor was all this sufficient to satisfie their greedy
appetites, or was evident enough from the aim they had
to devour all the Gleabe and Tithes throughout the whole
Kingdom. To which purpose they passed an Act,<note n="b" place="margin">22. <hi>Febr.</hi> Ib. p. 104<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Vicaridges, Donatives, and all other Ecclesiastical liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and of all Impropriations and Gleabe-lands, then
under Sequestration; out of which to allow an yearly
maintenance, for such as should be approved of for the
work of the Ministry; this act being called <hi>An Act for the

But withall making advantage of his then distressed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

they required that he should take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

have acted as opportunity might best serve.</p>

prohibited the doing Evil, that Good might come thereof)

on that work. Whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> having by the help
of their Preachers, soon Rais'd a powerful Host (and for
that reason called the <hi>Kirk-Army</hi>) as a preamble to that
Slavery which they intended to the King, welcom'd him

               <p>In this seeming lost condition, therefore when those
proud Presbyterians of that Realm had in conceit swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him up, Almighty God made him the apparent and

by the utter overthrow<note n="k" place="margin">Battail of <hi>Dunbar. 3. Sept.</hi>

               <p>It will not (I think) be amiss, before I proceed farther,
to observe fome particulars, which passed by Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Castle,</hi>
within a few days after this great Victory
at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> the Governour objecting;<note n="m" place="margin">Perf. Diurnall. p. 476. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>First that the</hi>
English <hi>had not adhered to their first Principles, nor had been
true to the ends of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And Secondly that men of
Civil imployments had usurped the calling and imployment of the
Ministry, to the scandal of the Reformed Kirks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the first of these objections therefore,</hi> Cromwel <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of them;</hi> whether their bearing witness to themselves of
their adhering to their first Principles, and ingenuity in presecuting
the ends of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> justifies them so to have done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they themselves say so. Adding, that they must have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48510:147"/>
to have the truth of their Doctrines and Sayings, tryed by
the Touch-stone of the word of God: and that there be a Liberty
and duty of Tryal, there is also a Liberty of Iudgment for them
that may and ought to trye. Which, if so, then they must give
others leave to say and think, that they can appeal to equal Iudges,
who they are that have been the truest fulfillers of the most real and
equitable ends of the Covenant. But if those Gentlemen (<hi>quoth</hi>
Oliver) who do assume to themselves, to be the infallible Expositors
of the Covenant, as they do (too much to their Auditories) of the
Scriptures, account a different sense and Iudgment from their
own, to be a breach of the Covenant, and Heresie; no marvel
<hi>(quoth he)</hi> that they judge of others so authoritatively and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely:
but we <hi>(quoth he)</hi> have not so learned Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to the second answered thus;</hi> Are you troubled that
Christ is Preached? Is Preaching so inclusive in your Function?
Doth it scandalize the Reformed Kirks and <hi>Scotland</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?
Is it against the Covenant? Away with the Covenant, if it
be so. I thought the Covenant and these could have been willing,
that any should speak good of the name of Christ: If not 'tis no
Covenant of God's approving; nor the Kirk (you mention) so
much the Spouse of Christ. For a Conclusion. <hi>In answer to the
witness of God upon our solemn Appeal,</hi> you say you have
not so learned Christ, to hang the equity of your Cause upon events.
We could wish, that blindness had not been upon your Eyes, to all
those marvellous Dispensations which God hath wrought lately in
<hi>England.</hi> But did not you solemnly Appeal and Pray? Did
not we do so too? And ought not we and you to think, with fear
and trembling, of the Hand of the Great God, in this Mighty
and strange appearance of his, but can slightly call it an event?
Were not both your and our expectations renewed from time to
time, whilst we waited on God, to see which way he would manifest
himself upon our Appeales. And shall we, after all these our
Prayers, Fastings, Teares, Expectations and solemn Appeales,
call these bare Events? The Lord pitty you. Surely we fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath been a merciful and gracious deliverance to us.</p>
               <p>I beseech you in the Bowels of Christ, search after the mind of
the Lord in it towards you, and we shall help you by our Prayers,
that you may find it. For yet (if we know our Hearts at all)
our Bowels do in Christ yearne after the Godly in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not unworthy of Observation likewise, that as
this signal dissaster to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> did very much
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48510:147"/>
raise the Spirits of the <hi>Independant</hi> Grandees; so did it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them to give all possible encouragement to the rest of
that Party, and to all other Sectaries, of whose help,
upon occasion, they might stand in need. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
first passed an Act,<note n="n" place="margin">27. Sept.</note> Intituled <hi>An Act for the relief of
Religious and peaceable People, from the rigour of former Acts
of Parliament in matter of Religion:</hi> amongst which those of
<hi>primo</hi> and 35<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Eliz.</hi> which concern the Subjects obedient
repairing to Church, were repealed. And shortly after
that, another Act,<note n="o" place="margin">22. <hi>Nov.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 148.</note> whereby they directed all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
at Law, scil. Writs, Pleadings, Patents, Books of
Reports, and other Law Books to be in <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next they imposed<note n="p" place="margin">29. <hi>Nov.</hi> Ib. p. 149.</note> a Tax of an hundred and twenty
Thousand Pounds a Month for the support of their Army:
and not long after passed an Act,<note n="q" place="margin">22. <hi>Ian.</hi> Ib. 151.</note> declaring that their
new Great Seal, Engraven with a Cross and an Harp,
with this Circumscription, <hi>The Seal of the Parliament of the
Common-wealth of</hi> England, should be the Seal of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and be only used by order
of Parliament; and that it should be Treason to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
the same.</p>
               <p>Most certain it is, that the late wonderful defeat,
which the <hi>Scots</hi> received at <hi>Dunbar</hi> by the <hi>English</hi> then
commanded by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> did not a little startle the whole
Godly Party in that Nation. For whereas before, though
it was through the advantage they made of the King's
Name (whom they had got thither, as hath been already
observed) that they rais'd their Army; 'tis very well
known, that His Majesty was not permitted to have any
hand in the conduct thereof; no not so much as to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally
in that part of the Realm, in which it was; lest
his presence should have had any influence thereon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to his own just Rights; so much did their own
guilt of Disloyalty terrifie them.</p>
               <p>But the case was now altered: For soon after this great
overthrow, they sent to His Majesty, earnestly desiring
his presence with them; and to Court him with the fairer
assurance of their fidelity, appointed a certain day for
his Coronation,<note n="r" place="margin">1 Ian.</note> which was accordingly perform'd with
great Solemnity. So that then standing clear with his
best Subjects of that Kingdom, he began to form an Army
upon his own, and their Interest: Yet not without the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48510:148"/>
assistance and Joynt-help<note n="s" place="margin">Hist. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dep. p. 4. p. 20.</note> of the Kirk-Party there, which
in humane reason might have been thought to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
In the Head whereof he entred<note n="t" place="margin">7. Aug.</note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> at
<hi>Carlisle</hi> upon the Seventh of <hi>August;</hi> and marcht to
<hi>Worcester</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">22. Aug.</note> without any great opposition. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was any thing of Treachery in them that then
over-perswaded His majesty to make stay there, against
his own judgment: or whether Almighty God would
not give his Blessing to the aid of those who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been so false and perfidious to His Royal Father and
himself, is hard to say. Sure we are, that so great was
the confluence, from most parts of <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
assistance (the Presbyterians then joyning<note n="x" place="margin">Ib. p. 22.</note> with
him, and divers of their Preachers, Marching with him
in a Military way) that after a most sharp dispute, at and
near that City, being over-powered with strength and
numbers, his Army was totally routed<note n="y" place="margin">3. Sept.</note> and destroy'd;
himself, and some few others being necessitated to escape
by flight.</p>
               <p>It may seem strange (I presume) to some, that I should
here touch the Presbyterians so near the Quick, there
being some of opinion; that though the most rigid of
that Sect, were at that time forward against the King:
yet, that His Majesty had many Well-wishers of them in
this his adventure. But if I be herein censured, I desire
to know, what this expression, used by those Thirty six
Presbyterian and Independant Ministers, which joyn'd
together in a Petition for respiting the Execution of
Mr. <hi>Love</hi> (one of their own coat, of whom I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
given some touch) doth mean, <hi>viz. that in putting him to
death, the hopes and expectations of the Common Enemy, against
compliance with whom, he had made open protestation at his Tryal,
will be heightened. And, that the forbearance of so putting him
to death, would manifest to the World, that you</hi> (id est the
Parliament) <hi>do put a difference betwixt those, who offend from
Principles of Enmity against God and his People; and others, who
transgress through the mistakes of an erroneous conscience, in the
midst of great and various changes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, I would gladly know what construction is to
be made of those words, Printed in one of the News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books
of that year,</hi> viz. The Presbyterians in <hi>Lancashire,</hi>
and parts adjacent, have not only declaimed against the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48510:148"/>
in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> but declared against the Conjunction and
<hi>Proceedings of Iockey,</hi> and their young King, with
<hi>Middleton, Ogilby,</hi> and the rest of the Royal Party; and
are resolved to adhere to the present Government, and to walk
close and stedfast in the ways of Truth and Holiness.</p>
               <p>¶Here it will not be impertinent (I hope) to make a
little pause, and contemplate the infinite goodness and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, in so wonderful a preservation of the King (our
present Sovereign) after this fatal ruine of his Army at
<hi>Worcester.</hi> Who, though pursued and sought for, with
all the art and skill, that these Bloody Regicides, and their
whole Party could devise; was through the signal fidelity
of some few persons (of whom certain Narratives of the
particular passages therein, which are already made pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick,
do make honourable mention) so well secured
from their fury; and with such admirable contrivance and
skill conducted, that he Landed safely upon the Fifteenth
of <hi>October</hi> following at <hi>New-Haven</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as so strange, and little less than Miraculous a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of His Majesties Person, deserves (for a perpetual
Thankfulness to God Almighty) to be specially recorded
to Posterity: So doth the Memorial of Gods most evident
Judgments upon the <hi>Scottish Nation,</hi> after their unhappy
defection from the obedience which they did owe to His
Royal Father their Native King; levying divers Armies;
solemnly <hi>Covenanting</hi> with His <hi>English</hi> Subjects against him,
and the Establisht Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lastly selling Him
for Money, when for his Safe-guard and Protection, he
became necessitated to fly from the fury of these, and to
put himself into their Hands. For 'tis not unknown, that
they did twice Raise their <hi>Covenanting Brethren</hi> in <hi>that</hi> Realm,
to invade <hi>this,</hi> in an Hostile manner; and after much spoil
and Rapine made in this (no less than Three of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being utterly destroy'd; the first at <hi>Preston</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire;</hi>
the Second at <hi>Dunbar</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the
last at <hi>Worcester</hi>) the flower of their Youth and most
Eminent for Chivalry, were either slain in open Battail;
Famisht and wasted by most cruel and merciless usage in
Prison, or Barbarously sold to Forreign Plantations, there
to be Enslav'd with perpetual Servitude.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>UT to go on with my Story. Certain it is,
that this fatal blow at <hi>Worcester</hi> did not
only much deject all true hearted and Loyal
Persons; but seem'd so firmly to establish
this Barbarous Generation, in their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

alter the Scene. Therefore the more to perpetuate their
future oppressive Dominion, their next business was, to
lessen and opress the <hi>Nobility;</hi> and to Flatter the <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi>
into a Slavish subjection to their Usurped and Rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
power: To which end they (shortly after) passed
Two Acts<note n="a" place="margin">4. <hi>Febr.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 178.</note> in their Grand Convention at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
(called the Parliament) the one relating to the <hi>Nobility;</hi>

known to be the sole Instrument.</p>
               <p>All being therefore now in their Power,<note place="margin">An. 1652.</note> and no visible
Enemy to disturb their quiet; though at the beginning of
their Rebellion (<hi>Anno</hi> 1642.) they highly complemented
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> desiring that the King might have no manner of
Supplies from them, in respect of the near Relation that
was betwixt that Model, into which they themselves then
aimed to cast this Government, and the State of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
and for that reason, expected not only their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but a Loan of Money from them upon the <hi>Publick
Faith</hi> (as in the Twelfth Chapter of this Work may more
fully appear.) The case was now altered; For looking
upon themselves, after all this wonderful success as Mighty
Potentates in their New <hi>Common-wealth</hi> and <hi>Free-State;</hi> they
imployed <hi>Oliver St. Iohn</hi> (the Chief Justice of their Court

as Embassador into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> not only
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48510:149"/>
to make a firm alliance with the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the similitude
of their Governments, against all Soveraign Monarchs
and Princes; but to weaken the Interest of the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> with them, who had Married the King's
Daughter.</p>
               <p>Which curteous overture being not at all relisht, was
taken in great disdain by our Grandees here. But the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
Mogens</hi> on the other side; being the Elder <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
strong in Shipping, and expecting to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

not to stoop, by yielding them the Flag or the old

supprest, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> at every turn the chief Agent
therein; not only in those his bold adventures against the
<hi>scots,</hi> but in many other, both here and in <hi>Ireland</hi> (as
though Victory had been entailed upon his Sword) the
time was now come, that he thought fit to act his own
part more nearly; yet still under colour of solely minding
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48510:150"/>
the Publick. As he had therefore made the Souldiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
for the ruine of the King, by the influence of
his inferior Officers, call'd <hi>Adjutators;</hi> so now did he, again
set those active Engines on work, for the utter confusion
of that Impious <hi>Iuncto</hi> called the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Which <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutators</hi>
being readily inclinable to any thing of change,
objected to the <hi>Iuncto,</hi> that they had not approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
such worthy Patriots as they expected, but had
sought themselves, and their own peculiar profit. And
therefore (as good Common-wealths-men, and Friends
to the Publick) required, that they should suddenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
a Period to their Sitting; to the end that the Godly
Party, and good People of the Nation, might thereupon
make choise of a more equal Representative, for the
rectifying and amendment of what was still out of
order.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding this fair pretence,<note place="margin">An. 1653.</note> the aim of the
Souldiers, was by outing those old Saints, to reduce the
whole sway of all under the power of themselves, which
made them so earnest and forward in the work; being fed
with those hopes, through the insinuation of <hi>Cromwel.</hi> The
<hi>Iuncto</hi> therefore, foreseeing this danger; for preventing
thereof, were neither slack nor unactive: endeavouring
first to break the Army by Disbanding; and in the next
place, to spoil their design by delays: Nevertheless, with
much zeal, seem'd earnest to retire; affirming, that they
then were in contrivance for a new <hi>Representative</hi> to succeed
them. All which availed nothing, there being no halting
before an Old Cripple: for <hi>Cromwel</hi> was not ignorant of
what they aimed at; being well assured, that if he let
them alone, his design would be Cross'd: and therefore
determin'd without more ado, to turn them out of
Doors.</p>
               <p>To which end, having well seasoned the Souldiery for
his purpose; and for the better engratiating himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
taken the Officers into his Council, he resolv'd (as
'twas usual with him) to carry on this great work, under
the specious Mask of <hi>Religion</hi> and pretended <hi>Revelations;</hi>
those standing him in such stead upon all his attempts, as
that there were not a few that really believ'd, whatever he
undertook could not easily miscarry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:48510:150"/>
Upon the Twentieth of <hi>April</hi> therefore, attended with
strong Guards, he entred the Parliament-House (with
<hi>Fleetwood</hi> his great Confident) commanding some few of
his attendants to tarry without. Where, without moving
his Hat, or going to any Seat, he first addressed his Speech
to the Chief Justice <hi>St. Iohn;</hi> telling him, that <hi>he then
came to do that which grieved him to the very Soul, and what he
had earnestly, with Tears, pray'd to God against. Nay, that
he had rather be torn in pieces than do it: But, that there was a</hi>
Necessity <hi>laid upon him therein, in order to the Glory of God,
and the good of this Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereunto</hi> St. Iohn <hi>answered,</hi> that he knew not what he
meant; but did pray, that what it was which must be done, might
have a happy Issue for the General Good.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cromwel</hi> turning towards the Speaker, told him
how long, under colour of Service to the Publick, they
had sate and acted there: and that in stead thereof, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Kindred (Engrossing all places of great
profit) had, upon their own Pride and Luxury, consum'd
the Wealth of the Land. Which being said, he gave a
stamp with his Foot, and bad them for shame be gone,
and give place to honester men.</p>
               <p>Whereupon a Member standing up, and modestly say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it stood not with common Justice to cast so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
an aspersion upon them all, without any Proof; he
in wrath taking Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> Junior by the Cloak, said
<hi>thou art a Iugling Fellow;</hi> and told <hi>Allen</hi> the Goldsmith,
that he had inricht himself by Cousening the State, for
which he should be call'd to account: and commanded
those of his Guard, who at the signal of that stamp, were
entred the Door,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> turns the Parliament, called the <hi>Rump</hi> out of Doors.</note> immediately to turn them out of the
House; Colonel <hi>Harrison</hi> accordingly pulling the Speaker
out of his Chair.</p>
               <p>It was observed, that as they went out of the House,
he pointed at <hi>Harry Martin</hi> and <hi>Tom Challoner;</hi> and said,
<hi>Is it fit that such Fellows as these, should sit to Govern? Men of
vicious Lives; the one a noted Whore-Master, and the other a
Drunkard?</hi> Nay he boldly upbraided them all, with sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cavaliers Estates by bundles; and said they had
kept no Faith with them.</p>
               <p>This, as it was one of his greatest Adventures, so was it
the most grateful to the People of all that ever he did; it
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48510:151"/>
being no less than the quelling of that many-headed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
which glutted with unmeasurable Rapine, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Blood, had been not a little dreadful to the greatest
part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having therefore so happily remov'd this Block, yet
still keeping close the main end of his design, under the
shadow of ruling by a Civil Power; after much pretended
seeking of God, he selected certain Persons to manage
the same, as a <hi>Council of State,</hi> whose Names were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,</p>

in the Council-Chamber at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> Whence,
after a Grave Speech made to them by <hi>Cromwel;</hi> expressing,
that he had thus called them together, to consult of the
great affaires of these Three Kingdoms, they adjourned
themselves to the House of Commons at <hi>Westminster;</hi>
and there taking their places, and chosen Mr. <hi>Rows</hi> to be
their Speaker; admiring the great goodness of God, that
had put it into the Generals Heart, to select them for so
great a work, they Voted themselves to be <hi>the Parliament
of <hi>England,</hi>
                  </hi> and by that Title to be known and
called.</p>
               <p>Having so done, they fell vigorously to work for a
<hi>thorough Reformation;</hi> Dreaming of nothing less, than that
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> must shortly Reign with them here on Earth.
To prepare the way therefore to his Personal coming,
they considered of abolishing the <hi>Ministerial Function,</hi> as
favouring (in their opinion) totally of Popery. Likewise
for the taking away of <hi>Tithes,</hi> as the Reliques of Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.
Also to abrogate the <hi>Old English Laws,</hi> as Badges of
Conquest and <hi>Norman</hi> Slavery. And lastly to suppress
the <hi>Universities,</hi> and all Schools for Learning, as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
and unnecessary; with all <hi>Titles of Honour</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
as not agreeable to Christianity. All which
they had (without question) soon effected; but that some
few of them, of better judgments, gave a stop to their
Frenzy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:48510:153"/>
But the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> they really Voted<note n="e" place="margin">5. Aug.</note> down;
and passed an Act<note n="f" place="margin">24. <hi>Aug.</hi> Scob. Coll. p. 236.</note> for the solemnizing of all Marriages
by Justices of Peace, after Publication made of such
purpose in the Church or open Market: and that the <hi>Birth</hi>
(but not <hi>Baptizing</hi>) of Children should be thenceforth
Registred, which shews of what Judgment they were in
that point.</p>
               <p>The Act likewise for Subscribing that Instrument, call'd
the <hi>Engagement,</hi> which was passed 2. <hi>Ian. An.</hi> 1649. they
Voted<note n="g" place="margin">4. <hi>Nov.</hi> Ib. p. 268.</note> unfit to continue, and totally repealed it. And
for the Tryal of what they called Treason or High Crimes,
they Erected<note n="h" place="margin">21. <hi>Nov.</hi> Ib. p. 272.</note> a new <hi>High Court of Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which Phrentick doings, having made themselves,
as well distastfull, as ridiculous to the World, their Grand
Master (<hi>Cromwel</hi>) to ingratiate himself farther with the
People, put a Period<note n="i" place="margin">12. Dec.</note> to their Sitting; the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Morning a little sooner than usual</hi> (12. Dec.)
<hi>those of the Members which were</hi> Cromwel's <hi>chiefest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents,
came to the House; where finding then but few
of the</hi> Anabaptists, <hi>an Eminent Member stood up, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself of the Speaker, told him,</hi> that he must
disburthen himself of some things that had a long time lain upon
his Heart: That he was now to speak to the <hi>Esse,</hi> or being,
rather than the <hi>Bene Esse,</hi> or well-being of the Common-wealth,
which was ready to sink under them, through the ill management
of the power betrusted with them; and, that for his own part,
he must resign his power from whence he had it; foreseeing cleerly
that their Waitings and Expectations of ever coming on the things
of publick good were more and more disappointed: <hi>and so descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to these particular instances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That they had dealt disingeniously with the Army,
in moving, that the Officers should be treated with to lay
down their Pay; and when they could not effect that, the
Bill of Assessments was endeavoured to be cast out.</p>
               <p>2. That they had not a Spirit to do Justice, which
appeared in their Act for confirming the sale of Sir <hi>Iohn
Stowells</hi> Estate, though he were relieved by the Court of
Articles. And however he was as vile as could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
(so was his expression;) yet he knew not but that
man was left to be a Tryal upon them, whether they would
do Justice, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:48510:153"/>
3. That they had a Principle amongst them, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
and pulling down, though nothing were set up
in the stead; and that this was especially manifested in
their Vote, for removing the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and total alteration
of the Laws.</p>
               <p>4. That though they called their selves a Parliament,
yet they Acted most unlike unto it; and that appeared
in their endeavours to destroy propriety, in attempting
to take off the Power of Patrons to present to Church
Livings.</p>
               <p>5. That they would destroy the Ministry it self, which
appeared by their Vote on Saturday before: and that for
these Considerations, they could not satisfie themselves
to sit any longer, and so be guilty of bringing confusion
and desolation upon the Nation. But if any would yet be
so hardy as to continue there, he would say unto them in
the words of the Prophet; Ephraim <hi>hath joyned himself to
Idols, let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being seconded, and after him pressed earnestly
by some others, much startled the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> then present,
who spoke fiercely against it. Insomuch as those who
had appeard for their Dissolution, fearing, lest by delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
time in Speeches, more of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> might come
in and out-Vote them; moved, that all who were for
their <hi>Dissolution,</hi> should rise and walk out. Whereupon,
the Speaker and divers other, forthwith went out of the
House. But <hi>Squib, Moyer, St. Nicholas,</hi> and some more
of that Gang (to the number of about Twenty) sate still,
and having placed Mr. <hi>Moyer</hi> in the Chair, fell to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
against what the rest had done; professing, <hi>in the
presence of the Lord, that their Call of God to that place, was
the Principal Motive that drew them thither; and that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
their said Call, was chiefly for promoting the Interest of
Iesus Christ.</hi> Whereupon they continued there until Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Goffe,</hi> with some Musketeers came, and asked them
<hi>What they sate there for?</hi> Whereunto it was Answered, <hi>to
seek the Lord:</hi> But perceiving what the Issue thereof was
like to be, they (nevertheless) departed, and Subscrib'd
an <hi>Instrument,</hi> whereunto some others had set their Hands
before, for surrender of their Power into the Hands of their
Master, <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:48510:154"/>
                  <hi>Which Instrument,</hi> so signed, being brought to His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
he lifted up his Eyes with seeming great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
and at first, with no less modesty faintly refus'd
it: but at length, after assiduous and importunate sute,
earnestly representing to him the welfare of the Nation;
inculcating to him also, how zealous a Patriot he had ever
been for the People, he was at last overcome (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly)
to receive it.</p>
               <p>¶This Pageant therefore, being thus formally over;
the next work was, his assuming to himself the sole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Rule: a thing which sew could think it safe for
any of them to aspire unto, considering what had been
acted by him and his Party, utterly to eradicate Monarchique
Government. But, as the Common Water-men, look
always the contrary way to that they Row; so did this
Grand Impostor: The contrivance thereof being secretly
laid by himself and Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> (who had an
aime in time, to succeed him in the Government) <hi>Lambert</hi>
was the man that dealt with the Principal Officers of the
Army, to carry on this design, with all subtilty imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he first told them, how much the Governing
by a single Person, would conduce to the General quiet
and advantage of the Publick; and next to the peculiar
Interest of each of them in particular, in case it were bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with sober limitations, and not to be by the Title of
King. For an expedient therefore, they resolv'd on the
name of <hi>Protector;</hi> and of a formal Instrument, wherein
should be contained the Rules of his Government.</p>

(and about One of the Clock that day)
Five Regiments of Foot, and Three of

<hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>Westminster-Hall:</hi>
whereof one (<hi>viz.</hi> Colonel <hi>Goffs</hi>) was placed within the

to the Door of <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> Where alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his Coach, there proceeded, First the City Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals:

Next the Two Keepers of their Great Seal (<hi>Keble</hi> and

the Parliament Mace, the City Mace, the Council of State's
Mace, and the Lord Keeper's Mace:) After thses the

Lord Mayor: And next to him <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself in a Black
Sute and Cloak Lined with Velvet, Boots, and a Gold
Hatband (all bare headed:) And after him the Principal
Officers of the Army, and Council of State.</p>
               <p>In which manner they proceeded to the <hi>Chancery-Court,</hi>
where a Rich Chair of State was set, with a large Cusheon,
and Carpets on the Floor.</p>
               <p>Being ascended into the court, <hi>Cromwel</hi> standing before
the Chair, with the Two Keepers and Judges on each
hand of him; Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> declaring to him the
Dissolution of the Parliament, and exigency of the times;
did, in the name of the Army, and of the Three Nations,
desire him to accept of the Protectorship of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he assenting, a large Instrument (extending to a

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48510:155"/>
the form of his Government, and somewhat, called an
Oath; at which he lifted up his Right Hand and Eyes,
and assented thereto.</p>
               <p>Then did the Lord Mayor present the Sword to him,
and the Keepers the Seal. Both which he delivered back
to them respectively.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cromwel</hi> made Lord Protector.</note> This being done, a Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

                  </hi> After which there was a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

and after a little pause; the like twice more.</p>
               <p>Then he went back to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the Lord Mayor
carrying the Sword upright before him, the Protector
having his Hat on. After which (in the Evening) were
several Vollies of small shot, and some great, with Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

High Treason; and if he should fail therein, then that the Sheriffs
should perform it. And after such Election should be made, to be

all Elections against these Rules should be void, and the transgressors
Fined at Two Years value of their Revenues, and third part of their

the Parliament, without the consent of the <hi>Protector</hi> and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
But if it should not be thought necessary hereafter, that any
Army should be maintained; then whatsoever surplusage of this
Tax should be, to be kept in the Treasury for sudden Emergencies.</p>
               <p>That if there might happen to be occasion of making extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
choices, and to Raise new Forces, it should not be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consent of Parliament; but that in the Intervals of Parliament,

               <p>That the Chrisian Religion, as it is contained by Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

to the end he might have the greater Veneration

through the city in State to that Feast, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
perform'd as followeth.</p>
               <p>First the several Companies of <hi>London,</hi> having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to meet at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> in their Liveries, went
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48510:157"/>
thence, and placed themselves, according to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
in the Streets, from the lower end of <hi>Cheapside</hi> to
<hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> within Rayles, hung with blew Cloath; the
City Banner, and Streamers, belonging to the respective
Companies, being set before them. Then the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
with his Mace, Sword, and Cap of Maintenance,
attended by the Aldermen in Scarlet, and their Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chaynes,
Rode to <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi> Where, meeting the

Sword to him, making a short congratulatory Speech to
his Highness. Which being ended, they proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>First the City-Marshal, and some other Officers.<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Grocers-Hall in State.</note> Then
six Trumpets. After them his Highness Life-guard. Then

Next his Highness Heraulds, with rich Coats, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with the Common-wealths Arms (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cross</hi>
and <hi>Harp</hi>) Then the Mace and Cap of Maintenance.
Next the Lord Mayor (<hi>bare-headed</hi>) carrying the Sword.
After him two Gentlemen Ushers. Then his Highness
the <hi>Protector,</hi> with twelve Footmen in Gray Jackets, laced
with silver and black-silk Lace. After him Rode Major
General <hi>Skyppon,</hi> and the rest of the Council. Then the
Officers of the Army: And lastly divers other, on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
and in Coaches.</p>
               <p>Being thus come to <hi>Grocers-Hall,</hi> the Recorder
made a Speech to him; letting him understand, how
happy that City did account themselves under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and likewise in the enjoyment of his presence
there with them that day. Which done, he Knighted the
Lord Mayor; and then dined at the midst of a long Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

distance on his Right hand, and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> on his left:

               <p>But, notwithstanding this great Entertainment; well
knowing, that all the Bloodshed and confusion, which
had formerly been; as 'twas chiefly accomplisht by the
Pulpits, so by the like means his new establisht Rule might
easily be shak't; he fram'd another Ordinance,<note n="b" place="margin">20. <hi>Martij</hi> Scob. coll. p. 279.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

prevention whereof, be it Ordained by his Highness the <hi>Lord
Protector,</hi> by and with the consent of his Council; that every
Person, who shall from and after the 25th, day of <hi>March,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,

Having now ended this year 1653. as to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Transsactions at Home, I must look back a little, and
take notice of our farther Military contests with the
Dutch: wherein I find, that on the second of Iune, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another sharp Fight in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> rode,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Iunij.</hi> Heath's hist. p. 344. 345.</note> they much

day of Iuly, wherein <hi>Van Trump</hi> their famous Admiral
was slain.</p>
               <p>But both parties, at length, growing weary of this
chargeable and destructive War, before the end of this
year, a Peace was concluded<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 357.</note> betwixt them, though
not ratified till <hi>April</hi> ensuing.</p>
               <p>Which Peace with the Dutch,<note place="margin">An. 1654.</note> and the slavish condition,
whereunto this Monster <hi>Cromwell</hi> had brought the People
of these Nations, made him not only much Idolized here,
by all his Party, but somewhat feared abroad: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that most of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> made
application to him; amongst which the French King
was the first, his Embassador making this Speech to him
in the Banquetting-house at <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28. Martij.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Your most serene Highness hath received already some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
assurances of the King my Master, and of his desire to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
a perfect Correspondency, between his Dominions and
<hi>England.</hi> His Majesty gives unto your Highness, this day,
some publick Demonstration of the same, and sending his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
for his Service, in the quality of Embassador to your
Highness, doth plainly shew, that the esteem which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty makes of your Highness, and the Interest of his People, have
more power in his Councils, than many Considerations, that would
be of great concernment to a Prince less affected with the one
and the other. This proceeding, grounded upon such sound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and so different from that which is only guided by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
renders the Friendship of the King my Master, as
much considerable for its firmness, as for the Utility it may
produce: and for that reason it is such eminent esteem, and
sought after, by all the greatest Princes and Powers of the
Earth. But his Majesty doth Communicate none to any, with
so much Ioy and Chearfulness, as unto those, whose vertuous
deeds, and extraordinary Merits, render them more eminently
Famous than the greatness of their Dominions. His Majesty
doth acknowledge all these advantages, wholly to reside in your
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48510:158"/>
Highness; and, that Divine Providence, after so many Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Calamities, could not deal more favourably with these
three Nations, nor cause them to forget their past Misery with
more content and satisfaction, than by submitting them to so just
a Government. And whereas it is not enough, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of their happiness, to make them enjoy Peace at Home,
since it depends no less on a good correspondency with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nations
abroad; the King my Master doth not doubt but
to find also the same disposition in your Highness, which his
Majesty doth express in those Letters, which his Excellencie
hath Order to present unto your Highness. After so many
Dispositions exprest by his Majesty and your Highness, towards
the accommodation of the two Nations, there is cause to believe,
that their wishes will be soon Accomplisht. As for me, I have
none greater, than to be able to serve the King my Master,
with the good liking and satisfaction of your Highness; and
that the happiness I have to tender unto your Highness the first
assurances of his Majesties esteem, may give me occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
by my respects, the honour of your Gracious Affection.</p>
               <p>Being therefore thus puft up he (soon after) passed
an Act<note n="d" place="margin">12. <hi>Apr.</hi> Scob. coll. p. 288.</note> of Grace and Pardon to all Persons of the
Scottish Nation, excepting <hi>Iames</hi> late Duke <hi>Hamilton,

Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Calender,</hi> and many more therein spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
named. As also another Act,<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 293. Act for making <hi>Scotland</hi> one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth with <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> for making <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
one Common-wealth with <hi>England.</hi> Whereby
it was likewise Ordained, that thirty Persons of that
Nation, should serve in Parliament here, for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
And, that the People of that Nation should be
discharged of their Allegiance to any Issue of the late
King. Also, that Kingship and Parliamentary-Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should be there abolished; and the Arms of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(viz. St. Andrew's Cross</hi>) should thenceforth be borne
with the Arms of this Common-wealth. All which
being done, he removed<note n="f" place="margin">18. <hi>Apr. Cromwell</hi> first seated himself at <hi>Whitchall.</hi>

he received a shameful defeat.<note n="*" place="margin">25. Apr. Heath's <hi>hist. p.</hi> 370. et 371.</note> But the next Month

Spaniards in <hi>Iamaco</hi> timorously flying before them when
they Landed there, an easie acquisition was made by

a very prosperous and beneficial Plantation. But to
return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> by this time being grown very great; to
make himself the more formidable to all his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
good Subjects (then called Royalists) by establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Dominion upon more Innocent blood; having
by the wicked practises of his Emissaries, trayn'd in

he caused another bloody Theater to be erected in

were accordingly Sacrificed, as a peace-Offering to this

               </p>
               <p>For the better maintenance, likewise, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Preaching-Ministers;</hi> and for uniting and sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and on the day following, went thither
from <hi>White-Hall</hi> in State; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thus;</p>
               <p>First a Marshall with his Staff.</p>
               <p>Then all the Life-Guard,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his proceeding to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and his Domestick-Officers,
with some well-affected Citizens; <hi>viz.</hi> his Draper and
other Tradesmen, in rank, three and three (on Foot)
bare-headed.</p>
               <p>Next, a rich Coach, drawn by six Horses, in the
hinder end whereof he himself sate; the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi>
on his left side, and the Lord <hi>Lawrence</hi> President of his
Council, on the right; the Lord <hi>Strickland</hi> and Captain
<hi>Howard</hi> (Captain of his Life-Guard) walking on Foot.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord <hi>Claypole</hi> Master of his Horse (on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back)
leading the Horse of State, with a Rich Saddle,
curiously Embroydered with Gold and Pearl.</p>
               <p>Next, a War-Horse led, with Pistols at the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>After this, another rich Coach, wherein sate the Lord
Keepers of the Great Seal, and two Serjeants at Arms,
with their Maces.</p>
               <p>Then another rich Coach, wherein rode the Secretaries
of State.</p>
               <p>Thus, with all his Guard of Gray-coats (having new
Halberts) and twelve Footmen in like Liveries, they
went to the Abby-Church at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where Mr.
<hi>Iohn Goodwyn</hi> Preacht: and from thence, on Foot, to
the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> carrying the Sword before him. Where, standing by a rich Chair, set by
the Wal, on that side the Room towards the Lord's
House, he made a long speech to them. wherein (using
many canting expressions) he told them, they came that
day to settle, not only the Interest of three great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48510:160"/>
but of all the Christian-people in the World, he
talkt likewise very much of <hi>Healing,</hi> and <hi>Setling;</hi> and
of the danger by the <hi>Levelling party.</hi> Also of those, who
had only a <hi>form of Godliness, but not the power thereof.</hi> He
likewise complain'd of an <hi>Extremity,</hi> that (as formerly
he said) none having a good Testimony, and who had
received Gifts from Christ might Preach, <hi>if not Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
That then, on the other hand, many who were
<hi>Ordained,</hi> had <hi>Antichristianism</hi> stampt upon their calling,
so that he ought not to Preach, nor be heard. As also,
that there was inveighing against such, as denyed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to those, who had earned it with their Blood;
who had gained civil liberty, and Religious also.</p>
               <p>Next he toucht upon those many <hi>honest people</hi> (as he
call'd them) whose hearts were sincere; many of them
(as he said) belonging to God; <hi>viz.</hi> the mistaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>fifth-Monarchy men;</hi> a thing pretending more
to Spirituality, than any thing else affirming that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
and <hi>Property</hi> were not the Badges of the Kingdom
of Christ; who, instead of regulating Laws, would
have Laws subverted, and bring in the Judaical Laws.
He told them also of the advantages, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy (<hi>id est</hi> the Royalists) did make by those their
divisions. Likewise of the endeavours here by the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of the Jesuits; of the decay in their Trade by the
War with <hi>Portugal, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> and the remedy
applyed was that Government, calculated for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the people; instancing what <hi>Reformation</hi> had been
aimed at by it; that is to say, the <hi>Reforming the Laws,</hi>
and putting the administration of them into the hands
of just men. Also to put a stop to every man, who
would make himself a <hi>Preacher;</hi> and that That work was
committed to the trust of persons, both of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
and <hi>Independent</hi> judgments, of as known ability and
integrity, as any this Nation then had: Men (as he said)
who had put such into that great imployment, <hi>who had
received Gifts from him, that ascended on high, and had Gifts
for the work of the Ministry, and for the edifying of the Body
of Christ.</hi> He told them also, that <hi>That Government</hi> had
been instrumental to the calling of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> which
they saw there that day: Saying it was <hi>a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
He told them likewise what <hi>Peace</hi> they had with
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48510:160"/>
Neighbour Princes; and of a people, which were brought
out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> towards the Land of <hi>Canam;</hi> but, through
unbelief, murmuring and repining; and other tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and sins, wherewith God was provoked, they were
fain to go back again, and linger many years in the
Wilderness. He also added, that they had cause to take
notice, how that they were not brought into misery, but
that a door of Hope was open: And, that if the Lords
blessing and his presence, went along with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of affairs, at that meeting, they would be enabled
to put the top Stone to their work, and make the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
happy. He likewise told them, that they were like
to the people under <hi>Circumcision,</hi> but raw, their Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but newly made: and that it was one of the great
ends of calling that <hi>Parliament,</hi> that their Ship of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-wealth</hi>
might be brought into safe Harbour: perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them therefore to a Sweet, Gracious, and holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of one another. And concluded, that he
had not spoke those things to them, as one that assumed
to himself Dominion over them; but as one that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to be a fellow-Servant with them, to the Interest
of those great affairs, and of the people of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And so dismissing them, they went to the House of
Commons, and chose <hi>William Lenthall</hi> their Speaker.</p>
               <p>But, instead of falling to work, as the <hi>Protector</hi> had
directed in his Speech; so great was the Ambition of
those, who had been Members of the late <hi>long Parliament,</hi>
to get the sole power into their hands again; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some private discourses amongst one another, they
fell to clandestine plots, for the pulling down this their
great Master, and setting up themselves in their old Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Dominion again. To which end they fell to
making Speeches in derogation of the Lord <hi>Protector</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
pressing earnestly, that those Members of the
<hi>good old Parliament</hi> (as they call'd it) which were then, by
Gods providence (as they said) so met together, should
forthwith declare for, and reassume their just and rightful
Power.</p>
               <p>Which motion, being backt with many plausible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
found at that time such favourers in the House, that
the promoters of it hourly got ground, upon those of the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48510:161"/>
contrary party. The debate therefore holding on with
much eagerness, and drawing very near to a dangerous is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
did so awaken the <hi>Protector,</hi> (who discern'd his own
certain ruine, if it ever came to the question; his party in
the House, being then too weak for the other) that, having
first sent his Souldiers, to shut up the <hi>Parliament</hi> doors, and
to signifie to the Members, that he would meet them again
in the <hi>Painted-Chamber;</hi> he came thither accordingly; and
with a stern, but troubled Countenance, said; <hi>that at his
last being there, he did acquaint them with the Rise of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which had so call'd him thither, and with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
thereof, as also that he then acknowledg'd they were a free
Parliament. And so you are</hi> (quoth he) <hi>whilst you own the
Government and Authority,</hi> which call'd you hither. But,
discerning what they drove at, which toucht him so near,
he farther, plainly, told them, <hi>that he now came to magnifie his
Office, which before he had not been apt to do;</hi> saying, that <hi>if
God would not bear it up, let it sink.</hi> Adding also, that <hi>if a
duty were incumbent on him, to bear his own testimony unto it (which
in modesty he had till then forborn) he was, in some measure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he went on, and affirmed, that</hi> he called not himself
to that place; <hi>but that</hi> his calling was from God, and the people
of these Nations; and that his calling being such, God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should take it from him, else he would not part with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To manifest therefore, that such was his</hi> Call, <hi>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and said; that</hi> being a Gentleman by birth, he had been
called to several imployments in the Nation! First in Parliament;
then in the late Wars. Which being ended by that great Victory
at <hi>Worcester; <hi>he said,</hi>
                  </hi> he did hope to have god leave for
retiring to a private life! and beg'd again and again, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
of his charge; calling God above as witness thereto: <hi>but
expressing,</hi> that he could not therein obtain, what his Soul long'd
for. <hi>And farther added,</hi> that he pressed the Parliament (as
a Member) to put a period to themselves, again and again; nay
ten and twenty times over: <hi>and said, that</hi> he told them, that the
Nation loathed their sitting; and, that, so far as he could discern,
that when they were dissolved, <hi>there</hi> was no visible repining at it;
no not so much as the Barking of a Dog: <hi>Affirming,</hi> that they
aim'd to have perpetuated their sitting to the Worlds end; and that
under their arbitrary power, poor men were driven like flocks of
sheep to confiscation of goods and estates. Also that the seeming
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48510:161"/>
remedy, which those Members then offered, was to have had a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Parliaments always sitting, whereby the Liberties, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'rests,
and Lives of the People, should still have been judg'd by an
arbitrary power. Likewise, that the remedy, by so dissolving them
(as they had been) was fitted to the disease: And, that thereupon,
he desiring to see, if a few called together, for some short space
of time, might not put the Nation into some way of certain set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement;
he therefore, called those persons<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Praise-God Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> and his Fellows.</note> together, out of the
several parts of the Nation; and this he did, that he might have
had an opportunity, to lay down the Power, which was then in his
hands; wherein he appealed to God <hi>(as he said)</hi> before persons,
who knew God, and what Conscience was; as also what it was
to Lye before God. A desire <hi>(he said)</hi> sinful enough, he was
afraid, to be quit of that Power, which God had most providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
put into his hands, before he called for it again; and before
those honest ends of their fighting were attained, and setled (he
being by Act of Parliament, General of all the Forces in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But that meeting, not answering the hopes of it, and they bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him an Instrument of Resignation of that Authority, so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon them (whereof he professed he knew nothing before it
was brought, and tendred to him) he was then exceedingly to seek
what to do, his Power then being (as General of all the Forces in
the three Nations) as boundless as before.</p>
               <p>At length therefore, (<hi>as he said</hi>) divers Gentlemen, consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seriously together, did frame that model of the then present
Government, he being not at all privy to their Councils; and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so done, told him, that except he would undertake the same;
Blood and Confusion, for lack of a settlement, would break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. Yet nevertheless, that notwithstanding this their offer,
he denyed it again, and again; till at length, weighing, that it did
not put him into an higher capacity, than he was in before, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bounded and limited, as appeared by the Instrument, he then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
it; instancing the publick formality of that his acceptance,
in the great Hall at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and in the presence of
the then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> Aldermen, &amp;c. and divers
Persons of quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adding,</hi> that what he had then expressed, was a Narrative,
discovering to them the series of Providence and Transaction, which
had led him into that condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he went on, and said,</hi> that he did not bear witness to
himself (being far from alluding to him that said so) but that he had
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48510:162"/>
a cloud of witnesses; instancing the Officers of the Armies in the
three Nations, as appeared by their respective Remonstrances;
and the consent of those persons, that had somewhat to do in the
World, who had been instrumental, by God, to fight down the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God and his People, in the three Nations.</p>
               <p>Likewise, that for farther witness, he had the City of <hi>London,</hi>
manifested by their congratulatory Entertainment of him at <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers-Hall,</hi>
upon Ashwednesday 1653. And of the Grand-Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from several Counties. Also of the Iudges, who received
Commissions from him, and all the Iustices of Peace in <hi>England.</hi>
Nay all the People in <hi>England (<hi>he said</hi>)</hi> were his Witnesses,
and many in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> Moreover, all
the Shireeves, and all that came in upon Processes Issued out by
the Shireeves, yea the return of Elections to the Clerk of the Crown,
by the Inhabitants of all the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs: and
lastly, themselves, as returned upon those Elections; the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Government,</hi> being distinctly read at all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of such Elections, wherein was that special proviso; <hi>viz.</hi>
that the persons so chose, should not have power to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as then setled in <hi>one single Person,</hi> and a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Farther adding;</hi> that he was then in possession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by a good right from God and Men; and that he did
not know, why he might not ballance that providence, as in the sight
of God, with any Hereditary-Int'rest, as being less subject to those
cracks and flaws they are commonly incident to, and which had cost
so much Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He told them likewise,</hi> what Liberty of Conscience they
had by that Government; and that all the Money of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
would not have tempted men to fight, if they had not had hopes
of Liberty, better than from <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
Concluding, that considering, that this Government was thus own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of God, approved by men, and testified to, as afore hath been
said; that in relation to the good of these Nations, and to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
he should sooner be willing to be rolled to his Grave in blood,
and buryed with Infamy, than to give consent to the throwing it
away. And therefore, that he had caused a stop to their entrance
into the House, till such time as they should subscribe a <hi>Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
thereof, and did submit thereto. And, that if things were
not satisfied, as were then reasonably demanded, he for his part
should do that which becom'd him, seeking his Council from
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:48510:162"/>
The truth is, that which principally emboldened him
to be thus peremptory with them was the strength of the
Souldiery, which were generally of his side; and which
the adverse party knew full well. So that, of the whole
number of those Members,<note place="margin">The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

upon all occasions within the House, they might
do him more mischief, than they could any way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
came in by degrees, and formally signed the
same. But, as those, who were his chief Confidents,
did strive all they could to carry on affairs, for his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Interest, according to the frame of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby he was so advanced to that place and
Title: sure it is, that the rest, by those rubs and obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which they cast in his way, did make all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

Charles the second,</hi> did adhere to the Protestant Religion,
professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> even in those days
when there was so little hopes to see it ever restored; the
Rebels in this Realm being then so prosperous, that the
greatest Potentates courted their alliance: but even then,
so fervent was his Majesties zeal thereto; that, by his
great and effectual care, he prevented the perverting of his
Brother, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> to that of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the relation of which, there are so many consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
circumstances, whereof very little publick notice
hath been taken; that, contrary to the designed brevity
of this History; I shall give a full account of the same;
partly taken from a Relation Printed at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>an.</hi> 1655
and partly from the certain information of persons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
credit, yet living, who were present at the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:48510:163"/>
His Majesty understanding, that there was a firm League
very far advanced betwixt the French King and <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
withdrew himself this year into <hi>Germany</hi> out of
<hi>France</hi> (where, till then, he had ever resided since his
happy and miraculous escape from Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ester) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to take the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> with him, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with by the Queen, his Mother, to leave him with
her at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon promise she would not permit any
force to be put upon him, to change his Religion; but
that he should be attended by those Protestant-Servants
himself had placed about him, and have free liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to the publick Service of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
at the King's Chappel in Sir <hi>Richard Brown</hi>'s House, then
his Majesties Resident at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> in this year, the
Duke (under pretence of weaning himself from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of some young French Gallants, who being in the
same Accademie, were grown into a more familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with him, than was thought convenient) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to <hi>Abbot Mountague</hi>'s House, at his Abby near Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiso:
And, after a few days, <hi>Mr. Lovel</hi> his Tutor, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Paris,</hi> for one day only, on business (designedly
contrived, as was suspected by <hi>Abbot Mountagu</hi>) during his
absence, was most vehemently pressed by the Abbot to
turn Roman-Catholick with all the motives spiritual or
temporal he thought might prevail upon him, having at
that time no Protestant near him, to advise with, but Mr.
<hi>Griffin</hi> of his Bed-Chamber (a young Gentleman since
dead; but his Fame for his servent zeal to the Protestant
Religion, and faithful service to his Master, yet living) who
deported himself with greater prudence, than could with
reason have been expected, for one of so tender years (as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
only by so young a second; for both their ages did,
but some few years exceed thirty) replying to their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with great ingenuity, evidencing no little zeal for
his Religion.</p>
               <p>For he told the Abbot, he admired how he durst make
this attempt upon him, knowing how the Queen (his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
had engaged to the King his Brother, that no change
in his Religion should be endeavoured. Also, that for his
own part he was resoly'd not to incur the Kings displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
by neglecting the observance of his command, which
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48510:163"/>
was not to listen to any Argument for change of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Likewise, that as to the specious proposals of
making him a Cardinal, and promising to advance him to
be King of <hi>England,</hi> he did with indignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
deride and reject them: complaining withal, how
disingeniously he was dealt with, to be thus assaulted in
the absence of his Tutor, whom the King had placed over
him; and who, he doubted not could easily refute all
their Arguments: which in truth, at his return to Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roise,
he did so fully, that it was thought convenient to
remove the Duke back thence to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was
permitted to resort to the Kings Chappel, and enjoy the
free exercise of his Religion, though not long. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some little time, the Queen, his Mother; did own the
attempt made on him, to have been done with her appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
and declared she could not but labour to have her
Son shew'd the right way to Heaven: and though she had
promised he should not be forced by her: yet to have that
way proposed to him she thought requisite. And that he
might the easier be prevail'd upon, his Protestant Tutor
was put from him, and he himself hurryed out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
in such hast, that he might be deprived of the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Advice of any Protestant, that he could not
(though he earnestly beg'd it) prevail to stay, till he might
get some warmer Cloaths; and convey'd to Mr. <hi>Crofts,</hi>
(afterwards Lord <hi>Croft</hi>'s) his House, but under the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Abbut Mountagu;</hi> none of his Servants but young
<hi>Mr. Gryffin</hi> being permitted to attend him.</p>
               <p>The News whereof did deeply afflict all the loyal-Protestant
Exiles then in <hi>Paris,</hi> but no man was more
passionately concern'd, than that Eminent sufferer for his
loyalty to the Royal Family, and Zeal to the Protestant
Religion, the late <hi>Lord Hatton:</hi> Who, as soon as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
how violently this young Prince was Persecuted
for his Religion, he consulted with that famous Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
for the Church of <hi>England, <hi>Dr. Iohn Cosens,</hi>
                  </hi> late
Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> (but at that time Dean of Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
and Chaplain to his Majesty) then residing in
Paris and drew up what Arguments and Instructions
he thought convenient to Fortifie the Duke, in this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Assault: And, knowing how strictly he was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the access of any Protestant, his Lordship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:48510:164"/>
by his Lady related to the Abbot, went to give him
a Visit: but his design was soon guessed at: and though
he obtained access to the Duke, he was so carefully
watcht, that with great difficulty he did unperceived,
convey to him the Instructions he had prepared for him;
yet was forc'd to Vary his Stratagems to have farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
from time to time delivered to him.</p>
               <p>But so narrowly was the Duke eyed by the Popish
Spies set over him; and the Priests were all the day long
so incessantly torturing him, with their Pressures to change
his Religion, that he had no opportunity to peruse any
Papers sent to him; so that he was constrained to deliver
them to his faithful Servant <hi>Gryffin;</hi> who in the night
time as he lay in his Bed-Chamber, acquainted him what
the scope of them was. By the advantage of which,
through the Assistance of Almighty God, he did so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
withstand all the violent shocks of his Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
that thereupon they resolved, not only to remove
<hi>Mr. Gryffin</hi> from him, but to Imprison the Duke in the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
Colledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof the King (his Brother) then in <hi>Germany,</hi>
receiving advise, he did immediately use all possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for his relief, and sent an Expostulary Letter to
the Queen, his Mother, with Commands to all his most
Eminent Protestant-Subjects, in <hi>Paris,</hi> to be, to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
aiding and Assisting to him, in this his distress.</p>
               <p>Some dayes before he was to have been removed to the
<hi>Iesuits-Colledge,</hi> Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi> attempted the delivery
of a Letter to him from the King (his Brother) but though
he was admitted to his presence, he could not with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
do it. Whereupon he was necessitated to leave it
with <hi>Mr. Gryffin</hi> to be convey'd to him.</p>
               <p>In which Letter his Majesty minded him of the strict
Command he left with him at his parting, to continue
firm in his Religion, as also of the Vanity of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
the emptiness of their Promises, the last Charge of
their dead Father, which he solemnly gave him, with the
entail of his Blessing annexed: withal telling him, if he
suffered himself to be perverted in his Religion, by any
inticements whatsoever; or put himself into the <hi>Iesuits-+Colledge,</hi>
he had the last Letter he should ever have from
him, and must never look to see his Face again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:48510:164"/>
As soon as the Duke had, with an unexpressible joy,
received this Letter, with all hast possible he transcribed
a Copy of it, and forthwith sent it to the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
begging her leave to come to Paris both upon
the account of those commands of the King, and the
News of his Brother, the Duke of <hi>York's</hi> being return'd
from the French Army. But her Majesty was pleased to
send him word she could not cease wishing his so great
and eternal good, as the change of his Religion; to
which she would not force him, but advised him to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to what <hi>Abbot Mountagu</hi> should farther deliver to him;
which was, that he should howsoever be willing to go to
the <hi>Iesuits-Colledge,</hi> where he should have liberty in all
things he could desire: To which it was still designed to
have forced him, had it not been prevented by the arrival
of the then Marquess (but since Duke) of <hi>Ormund.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That great and loyal subject attending on his Majesty
in <hi>Germany,</hi> when the news of this attempt upon the
Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> came: perceiving how much his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was concern'd thereat, and how sollicitous he was
to rescue him out of the hands of his Persecutors, profered
to go and fetch him to his Majesty. But it was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how great a hazard it would be to his Person in so ill
a season of weather, to take so long and dangerous a
journey, just upon the withdrawing of the Armies into
their Winter Quarters; the Souldiers having beset all the
ways, so that no person could pass without much Peril.
But that Noble Lord, who had lost so vast an Estate,
and so often most Eminently hazarded his Life in the
Glorious Service he had done the King, and in defence
of the Protestant Religion, was not to be affrighted from
any attempt to do the like for the future: And therefore
he the more earnestly pressed his Majesty for his leave
to go, and for his Letters and Instructions to carry with
him.</p>
               <p>Certainly the concern was of such high consequence,
that he or none could accomplish it: For, had any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of less Authority, Interest, and renown for his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in State-Affairs, or Zeal for the Service undertaken
it, he had probably return'd <hi>re infecta:</hi> For had not his
Lordship made all possible expedition, and staid but
four dayes longer before his Arrival at <hi>Paris</hi> he had
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48510:165"/>
come too late, the Duke had certainly been shut up in
the <hi>Iesuits-Colledge,</hi> from whence there had been no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
him: For the French Court had so zealously e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused
this Affair, that his Lordship was necessitated to
exert all his prudence that he might accomplish the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
he came about.</p>
               <p>As soon as his Lordship was arrived at the <hi>Pallace-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ai,</hi>
he did so effectually pursue his Instructions, that the
Duke had liberty to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and enjoy the free
exercise of his Religion; but going sometime after to the
French-Court, both the Queen-Mother of <hi>France,</hi> and
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> pressed him with all the allurements
they thought might prevail upon him, to turn Roman-Catholick:
Telling him, that they look't on him as a
Child of <hi>France,</hi> that it was only for his advantage, and
the opportunity they should have thereby of highlyer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him good, that induced them to move him thereto:
Adding, that since his Father was dead, he ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his Mother in all things she commanded.</p>
               <p>To which (observing the King, his Brother's Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,)
not to engage in any dispute; he replyed only, in
general termes, <hi>that he was resolved to obey his Mother as
much as any Son could, and ought to do;</hi> and thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged
himself from any farther pursuit at that
time.</p>
               <p>But all the allurements of the French-Court, and
the severity used towards him by the Queen his Mother,
could not in the least shake his firmness in his Religion:
which her Majesty, with great Indignation perceiving;
some few dayes after she took him apart; and (as he
afterwards discovered) beginning with all sweetness I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable,
she declared to him how great and tender
affection she had for him, and how much it grieved
her, that very love it self should compel her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now with such seeming severity. She presumed
he was weary of it, and truly she was so too; and for
his ease sake, she would shorten his time of Tryal: And
therefore, proposing to him all the good she aimed at
in this design; the duty he owed her; and the disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the King (his Brother) to maintain him; she
commanded him to withdraw himself presently into his
Lodging, and there give one hearing more to <hi>Abbot
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48510:165"/>
Mountagu:</hi> And then, sequestring himself from any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
for a while, to ponder seriously what she and
he had said to him; and that night, either send or bring
her a full and final answer.</p>
               <p>The Duke, upon the first appearance of this intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
privacy of his Mother with him; in the little inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim
of clearing the Room, he took opportunity of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Mr. Gryffin</hi> to find out the <hi>Marquess of Ormond,</hi> and
to desire him to come to him as soon as he returned from
the Queen, that he might be advised by him how to
deport himself as occasion should serve: And as soon as
he came from her, according to her command, retired
to his Chamber. Whereunto the Abbot coming before
the <hi>Marquess of Ormond</hi> could be found, after he had at
large expatiated on what the Queen had but briefly
hinted to him, he pressed him for his final Answer.
Which the Duke refused to give till he had first consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Marquess.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Abbot withdrew, desiring to be sent
for when the Marquess should come; which, if not in an
hours time, he would return again. though not sent
for.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Marquess came, the Duke quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
what answer to make; but having been so long
harassed, was desirous to take a little breath, so that he
neglected sending to the Abbot, and went out of his
Lodging into the Court to divert himself. No sooner
was he gone but the Abbot came, and missing him
sought up and down. At last finding him, he severely
rebuk't him, for neglecting his Mothers Commands,
and his Instructions which were seriously to Ponderate on
what he had said; and for having not sent for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well Sir,</hi> says the Duke, <hi>I have seriously considered on all
hath been said to me; and my final answer is, I am resolved to
continue firm in my Religion.</hi> Then replyed the Abbot;
<hi>I am Commanded from the Queen, your Mother, to tell you,
that she charges you to see her Face no more.</hi> At which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
expression, the Duke being not a little moved, with
great earnestness intreated, that he might, at least begher
parting Blessing, till he could prevail for her Pardon,
but could not obtain it, though he endeavoured it again
the next Morning, (being Sunday, before her Majesty
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48510:166"/>
went to her Devotions) by the Intercession of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> who did, with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
compassionate his condition, and with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
moved on his behalf.</p>
               <p>But the Queen was inexorable to all that spoke in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of him; nor would she intimate her pleasure to
him by any Person but <hi>Abbot Mountague,</hi> who again sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
him; aggravating the Peril of his Mother's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
advising him at that instant, being the most
proper time, as she was going to Mass at her Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to apply himself to her: For she had proposals to
make to him, which would set his heart at rest, though
he could not then name them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which the Duke replyed,</hi> if so I can: For my heart
can have no rest but in the free exercise of my Religion; but I
fear her Propositions will not: I am sure yours never tended to
give me any ease or quiet.</p>
               <p>At which Instant the Queen passed by in her Coach,
going to her Nunnery. Whereupon the Duke approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards her, attempting to beg her Blessing, but was
with great Indignation rejected. Whereat, being much
discomposed, the Abbot came up to him, and askt him
what it was her Majesty had said to him, which put him
into so great disorder. To which he briefly replyed;
<hi>what she said I may thank you for Sir; and it is but reason.
What my Mother therefore said to me, I shall say to you; Be
sure I see your Face no more;</hi> and so turn'd away from
him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Abbot calling after him, said; <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are you going good Sir.</hi> To whom the Duke (look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over his shoulder) answered, <hi>to Church;</hi> and so went
with a sad and dejected Countenance, which did much
abate the joy of the Congregation, who were much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to see him accompany his Brother, the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> thither. But they partook with him in his sorrow,
when they understood, that after Sermon he was to seek
where to get a Dinner; for which he must send to the
Cooks, or Fast; for there was a very strict Prohibition
given to all the Officers in his Mothers Court, that they
should not furnish him with any Provisions, or Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:48510:166"/>
That Night, after Evening Prayer, he had hopes to
enjoy one moment of satisfaction, by conversing with
his Sister, the Princess <hi>Henrietta</hi> (afterwards Dutchess of
<hi>Orleans</hi>) during his Mothers absence. But, as soon as
the young Princess heard the news of his designed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;
she was so frighted into shrieks and tears, that
she cryed out <hi>Oh God my Brother! Oh me my Mother! I am
undone for ever; what shall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which as soon as the Duke heard, he retyred, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing his dear Sister should by her kindness to him
purchase her Mothers displeasure. In this disconsolate
condition he went to his Lodging: Where at nine of the
Clock at night, his Groom came to know what he should
do with his Horses: For the Queens Comptroller was come
to him with a charge to remove them instantly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Groom Pleaded it was then too late, and that
on the morrow it would be time enough. But the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
replyed, he should then be put out of his place ere
Morning.</p>
               <p>The next day the Sheets were taken off his Bed. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore that he could not be permitted to stay at
the <hi>Pallace-Royal,</hi> he thought until he could provide Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for his Journey into <hi>Germany,</hi> to retire to the
House of <hi>Mr. Crofts</hi> (afterwards <hi>Lord Crofts</hi>) near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
whereof the Queen hearing, she chekt <hi>Mr. Crofts</hi>
for being willing to receive him; with which he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Duke; but submits however to his pleasure.</p>
               <p>In this straight the Duke betook himself to the advise
of that faithful Servant to his Family, and zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
the <hi>Lord Hatton,</hi> by whose judicious Instructions
he had received much satisfaction, in this his distressed
Condition, who, so soon as the Duke had made known
to him, that he was not only turn'd out of his Mothers
House, but that all persons that had any dependency on
her were forbidden to receive or assist him: His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
told him, if his Highness would please to honour
his House with his Presence, he should there be received
with all the dutiful regard that could be payed to him,
by so antient and faithfully devoted a Servant to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family; and with an entertainment as suitable to his
Quality, as the remains of that Fortune he had spent in
his Fathers Service would afford.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:48510:167"/>
But this the Duke, out of great modesty, seemed to
decline? alledging the hazard his Lordship might run to,
having his Estate again sequestred in England; and
likewise incurring the displeasure of the French Court,
as well as of the Queen his Mother; to be exiled that
Realm for his Kindness to him, as he had been <hi>England</hi>
for his Service to his Father; and perhaps be endangered
in his person by the Rabble, animated by some enraged
Papists for thus disappointing them of making a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
of him, as they boasted they had done, and given
publick thanks in divers Churches.</p>
               <p>But his Lordship assured him; that, as he had spent
the greatest part of his life and fortune, in the Service
of his Highnesses Royal Family, and defence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, he would willingly Sacrifice the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of both on so honourable an occasion as this.
With which hearty invitation his Highness was so pleased,
that he took no farther thoughts whither to go, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with his Lordship.</p>
               <p>Being thus gone from the <hi>Pallace-Royal,</hi> the Queen
Mother of France came immediately thither, to try a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
(as 'twas thought) if she could prevail with him to
change his Religion: And as soon as she came, sent her
Son the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> (afterwards of <hi>Orleans</hi>) to visit
him; who return'd with the news, that he was not to be
found. But as soon as it was known, that he was at the
<hi>Lord Hatton</hi>'s House, she sent the then Marquess (since
Duke) of <hi>Plessis</hi> (a Person of such famed parts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
that, in consideration thereof he was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to perswade with him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his Mothers advise: for effecting whereof he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
all his parts and elocution with great earnestness;
urging, that since the Death of his Father, the Queen his
Mother had the sole Power and Authority over him: Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
whether (the King) his Brother, as his Sovereign,
had equal Authority to dispose of him.</p>
               <p>And the discourse growing somewhat publick, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
of <hi>Ormund,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Hatton</hi> (then present) argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Dukes defence; the French Marquess finding
himself overmatch't, in great passion return'd without the
success expected at the <hi>Pallace-Royal,</hi> where the French
Queen staid very late till he came back. Whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48510:167"/>
when both Queens heard, they were then fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Dukes firmness to his Religion; so that after
that, no considerable attempt was made on him, though
he continued for near two months very nobly entertained
by the <hi>Lord Hatton,</hi> until through the Marquess of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>'s,
and his Lordships Interest, Necessaries could be
provided for his going into <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not to be doubted, but that the
Convening of these persons from all
parts of the Nation (considering that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them being Members of the <hi>Old
Long Parliament,</hi> and eagerly thirsted to
obtain their wonted power again, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
to that end, corrupted a great part of the Army)
did not a little endanger his new-raised Dominion.</p>
               <p>But such was his vigilancy, that their Plots took no
effect. Seeing therefore, both how, and by whom his
Authority had been thus affronted; lest others, in time,
by such examples might be swayed; his next business was
to gain some shadow of being owned by the generality
of the people throughout the three Kingdoms: which by
the help of his Emissaries in short time he accomplisht;
first from <hi>Scotland</hi> by Gratulatory Petitions; and next
from the Counties and chief Places throughout <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being effected, he then put on the Mask of a
most tender and zealous Patriot, earnestly promoting the
performance of Justice; encouraging Virtue, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing
Vice. And to gain those of the Clergy,
who might be most serviceable to his purpose, he made
no small shews of his favours unto them; yet with a
check to the insolency of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and depressing
the <hi>Episcopal</hi> and Orthodox. To those also of the <hi>Romish</hi>
persuasion, though he seemed severe, 'tis certain enough,
that he did somwhat favour them: there being not any
sort of men, to whom he carried not some shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
having an excellent faculty of courting them with
some appearance of kidness. But to captivate those,
who were seemingly Religious, he had a singular art of
discoursing with them most Divinely; and not only so,
but Praying, Sighing, Groaning, and somtimes shedding
Tears in their presence; yet having a special vigilancy
upon all Parties and Interests, which possibly might disturb
his quiet: So that the Royalists, whose generous and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48510:169"/>
active Spirits were ever prompting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               <p>But the lives of these Loyal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> this
subtle Tyrant: for he took advantage thereby, to cause
the Estates of all others of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> sate
quiet, to be decimated, except such as by mony could
free themselves from that great exaction: And for the
strict Levying of that most oppressive Tax, he constituted
<note n="†" place="margin">15. <hi>Octob.</hi> Major Generals.</note> fourteen select <hi>Major-Generals;</hi> each of which had several
Counties under his Jurisdiction; who not only exercised
their Authority, in an Arbitrary and unlimited manner;
but at length grew so insolent, that he thought it not fit to
continue them in that power.</p>
               <p>And now looking upon himself as an absolure Monarch,<note place="margin">An. 1656.</note>
he exercised the Authority of conferring the Honour of
Knighthood; first<note n="*" place="margin">20. Sept.</note> upon the Lord Mayor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
And having soon after concluded a League<note n="*" place="margin">20. Sept.</note> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>France,</hi> he went on and Knighted two of his Colonies;
<hi>Pride</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">17. Ianu.</note> and <hi>Barksted</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">19. Ianu.</note> (the one who had been a Dray-man,
the other a seller of Thimbles and Bodkins of Silver.)
And having throughout all parts of <hi>England,</hi> by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
practices (those of his Preaching-Clergy serving him
therein to some purpose) made way for an Election of
such Members, for another <hi>Parliament,</hi> as might best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his future ambitious designs, he sent out Writs<note n="†" place="margin">10. Iuly.</note> of
Summons for Convening of them accordingly. At which
meeting,<note n="*" place="margin">17. Sept.</note> none were permitted to enter the House, which
refused to acknowledg and subscribe to his Authority.
Whereupon some being excluded, went back to their
Countries.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cromwels</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament called.</note> But those which sate went stoutly on with the
work, having made choice of Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> to be
their Speaker.</p>
               <p>That the chief end whereat this proud and subtle Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
at that time drove, was by the help of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
to be invested with the Title of <hi>King,</hi> few
there were to whom it was not evident enough, though he
cunningly seemed to look another way. That there
might therefore be the less suspicion thereof, the design
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:48510:169"/>
was so laid, that the work should be brought about by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and in a Collateral way. To which end, in the
first place as a preparation thereto, they passed an Act,
<note n="*" place="margin">Scob. Cell. <hi>p.</hi> 571.</note> whereby <hi>the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
(for so are the words) <hi>did in the name of all the people of
that Common-Wealth, fully, clearly, and absolutely, and for ever
disclaim and renounce all Fealty, Homage, or Allegiance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be due unto <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> Eldest Son of the
late King <hi>Charles; Iames Stuart,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c. <hi>or any other
Issue or Posterity of the said King; or any person or persons
pretending, or which should pretend Title, by, from, or under
them, or any of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And soon after that another Act,<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. <hi>p.</hi> 372.</note> for security of the
person of his Highness the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Nation in Peace and Safety; the preamble
whereof beginneth thus; <hi>for asmuch as the Prosperity and
Safety of this Nation, and the Dommions thereunto belonging,
very much dependeth, under God, upon the security and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the person of his Highness,</hi> &amp;c. In which Act se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
offences were adjudged Treason; and certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> therein nominated,
for the Tryal of Offenders against the said Act.</p>
               <p>Which foundation being so laid, it was by his Friends
and Favourers, then thought high time to discover what
they would be at; and accordingly moved,<note n="*" place="margin">Alderman <hi>Pack</hi> a great Excise-Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the first that moved it. 21. <hi>Feb.</hi>
                  </note> that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Nation had for thirteen hundred years at the least,
been governed by <hi>Kings;</hi> and though some of them had
offended the people; yet that Title had never been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
Also, whereas the Government; by the said Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
was interwoven with the Laws, and accommodated
to the dispositions of the people; that they should humbly
<hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Advise</hi> his Highness to take upon him the same
Title.</p>
               <p>Which motion took such effect, that there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
soon drawn up by them,<note place="margin">The humble Petition and A Advice.</note> called <hi>the Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Advice,</hi> whereby they besought his Highness so to do.</p>
               <p>Whereunto (that he might not seem to have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of what they were about, much less any desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
but be still more and more sought to and importuned
therein) he answered with all shew of modesty; that
(indeed) those Arguments which they had used to him,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:48510:170"/>
were persuasive, but not compulsive; and that the Title
of <hi>Protector</hi> might be well accommodated to the Laws.</p>
               <p>To which they replyed, that the Title ought to be such,
as was suitable to the Laws, and the Laws not be made
suitable to the Title; urging the Statutes of 9. <hi>Edw.</hi> IV.
and 3. <hi>Henr.</hi> VII. whereby it was provided, that no one
should suffer for bearing Arms on the behalf of him, that
was <hi>de facto</hi> King, though he had no just right to the
Crown. Which Arguments were made use of to him
meerly for shew, the better to disguise his ambitious aim;
as though, without such strong motives, he could not have
been won thereto.</p>
               <p>But the plain truth is; that after this business came thus
in question, the Sectaries of all sorts, nay a great part of
the Souldiery, shewed a vehement dislike thereof, being
privately instigated by <hi>Lambert,</hi> and some other of the
Principal Officers, who did themselves, upon <hi>Cromwels</hi>
death, expect to have succeeded him in the Place of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector;</hi>
it being Elective, as is manifest from the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Government,</hi> whereby that Tyrant was at first so
Constituted (whereas had he been advanced to the Title
of King, the case might have been otherwise.) So that
this crafty Fox, discerning no small peril to himself by
such divisions, as might thereby arise; especially in the
Army, wherein lay his chief strength and support, thought
it the safest way to decline<note n="*" place="margin">8. May.</note> it, and to stick still to<note n="†" place="margin">19. May.</note> that
of <hi>Protector;</hi> yet to have the Government setled in a
kind of Monarchic manner. And so in imitation of that
which had formerly been Regal, to have a <hi>House of Peers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But against that also, there were great and high oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
so that, though it was with much ado agreed, that
there should be <hi>another House;</hi> yet it would not be allowed
the Title of an <hi>House of Peers.</hi> Whereupon the result
was, that an Act Intituled <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice,</hi>
should pass; whereby they ordained what Stile the chief
Magistrate should have; <hi>idest,</hi> Lord <hi>Protector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth</hi>
of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and the Dominions and Territories thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Likewise, that <hi>Parliaments</hi> consisting of <hi>two Houses</hi>
should be called once in three years, with qualifications
of such as should serve therein. And that the number of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48510:170"/>
such, as should sit in <hi>the other House</hi> should be nominated
by the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and approved by the House of
Commons. Moreover, that he should have power to
nominate his Successor. And that a <hi>Confession of Faith</hi>
should be agreed on by his Highness and the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
according to the Rule and Warrant of the Scriptures.
Which Act being presented to him, accordingly, was
assented to, and passed.<note n="*" place="margin">25. <hi>May.</hi> Scob. Col<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 378. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>But that Act being in some sort deficient; about a
month following, they passed another, relating thereto,
and called</hi> The Explanatory Petition and Advice. <hi>Wherein</hi>
(inter alia) <hi>is this Clause;</hi> viz.— Whereas in the Fourth
Article Publick Ministers, or Publick Preachers of the Gospel,
are disabled to the Elected to serve in Parliament; it is hereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
and declared, to such Ministers and Preachers only, as

Congregations. <hi>In which Act is also contained the Oaths of

Oaths of the Members of that</hi> Parliament.</p>
               <p>Soon after which, he was again, in <hi>WestMinster</hi>-Hall
(standing under a Rich State) solemnly invested into
his Old Title of <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and into the Government
thus new modelled. Where in the presence of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington</hi> their Speaker,
delivered unto him, in the name of them all (and as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives

of succeeding him, were then, by that new framed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
frustrated, began to fall off from him, and
to incline to the Fanaticks. Which so awakened the
<hi>Protector,</hi> that he took from him his Commission of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General and gave it to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of his Daughter, stood more nearly typed to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>

and some other which were no great friends to him, to
conform the more pliantly, to this his new setled Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
he tickled them with the specious Title of <hi>Lords,</hi>
by calling them to fit in the <hi>other House;</hi> obliging also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

than the Royallists were forward in their
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48510:172"/>
contrivances for pulling him down. But so great was his
vigilancy, and no less his cost, whereby he had allured
some Birds of that Feather; that the Consultations of his

so that, when ever he pleased, he could take
them in his Net, as he always did, when he thought that
examples of severity might be for his advantage.</p>
               <p>It being therefore once more expedient to renew those

the <hi>High-Court of Iustice,</hi>

where for the more formalities sake, the persons
whom he did design for destruction were brought; the one
Dr. <hi>Iohn Heuit,</hi> a Reverend Divine, the other Sir <hi>Henry
Slingsby,</hi> Kt. a <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Gentleman of great Loyalty and
Valour; who being charged with High Treason against
his <hi>Protectorship;</hi> and stoutly denying the Authority of

them, which they did accordingly suffer,<note n="*" place="margin">2. &amp; 8. <hi>Iun.</hi>
                  </note> with great
magnanimity; though there was no little endeavour
used for to save their lives: his Daughter <hi>Claypole</hi>
(whose interest otherwise with him was beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
solliciting for the Doctor with all earnestness
that could be.</p>
               <p>But it concerning him at that time,<note place="margin">

                  </note> so much in point
of Policy, to sacrifice some for a terror to others; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her incessant Supplication nor Tears could prevail;
which brought upon her such excessive grief of mind;
that falling into a sharp fit of sickness; wherein crying
out against him, for Dr. <hi>Heuits</hi> blood; she dyed with the
most bitter torments imaginable.</p>
               <p>Which death of hers was the fore-runner to that of
this wicked Tyrant: for soon after a deep Melancholy
seized closely upon him: in which the guilt of so much
innocent blood, as he had spilt, might (perhaps) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
touch him. But without doubt that which stuck
nearest to him, was his real consideration, that he could
never ascend unto such an height of Sovereignty, as his
ambitious desires had long gaped after. For he plainly
saw, that the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Fifth-Monarchy men,</hi> whom
in order to the destruction of his lawful Sovereign, he had
so much cherisht, then were, and were ever like to be,
as thorns in his sides, and blocks in his way thereto. And
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48510:172"/>
which is more, that not only <hi>Fleetwood</hi> (his Son in Law)
whom privately he had designed to be his Successor in the
Government, was an especial friend and favourer of those
desperate Fanatics; but that <hi>Desborough,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Collonel <hi>Sydenham,</hi> and many other of his Council,
were underhand well-wishers to <hi>Lambert</hi> and his party,
who were known enemies to all Monarchick Rule; and
consequently to that, wherein he had so long aimed to be
setled.</p>
               <p>Which sorrows and perplexities of his restless mind,
meeting with some Natural infirmities of his Body, struck
him into a sharp and Feaverish distemper: whereat his
Physicians expressing their thoughts; he told them, <hi>that
if they supposed him in a dying condition, they were utterly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
forasmuch as he had been comforted with Revelations to
the contrary.</hi> Nay he was farther so transported with those
vain Enthusiasms, and had such brain-sick persons about
him (even those of his Chaplains) who were equally pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with such giddy-headed conceipts; that they foolishly
dreamed and fancyed as much: and told it in publick;
<hi>that having sought God by Prayer, for the prolongation of his
life, they received such assurances of his grant to their Petitions;
that they not only gave out, that he effectually recovered, but kept
a solemn Thanksgiving for the same, at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
where he then lay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which strange and bold confidence, caused forthwith
his removal from thence to <hi>White-Hall;</hi> where he had
not been from that time, many days, but his Physician
allarm'd them with his near approaching death. Which
so awakened the best of his Friends, that they soon fell
to enquiry, whom he intended for his Successor. But so
little sense had he then of that question, that he made
them an answer no whit to the purpose. Whereupon
they askt him, whether it was not his Son <hi>Richard;</hi> to
which he made them some signs of assent. But farther
enquiring of his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> whereby they
presumed that he had nominated his Successor, he directed
them to his Closet, and other places for search; but all to
no purpose, for nothing could be found.</p>
               <p>In which discomposure, departing<note n="*" place="margin">Sept. 3.</note> this life upon the
third of <hi>September;</hi> to the end that the Government might
not fall to the ground; some few of the Council giving
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48510:173"/>
out, that <hi>Richard,</hi> was (according to the Instrument) the
Person declared, they immediately caused him to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<hi>Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus traced this Monster to his death, which
happened on the same day of the month, whereon he had
been twice wonderfully victorious (<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Dunbar</hi> and
<hi>Worcestrer</hi>) it will not be amiss to take notice of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning his Carcase, which was wholly preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural;
<hi>viz.</hi> that notwithstanding it was Artificially
Embowelled, and Embalmed with Aromatick Odours,
wrapt also in six-fold Cerecloth, and put in a sheet of Lead:
with a strong wooden Coffin over it; yet did it in a short
time so strangely ferment, that it burst all in pieces, and
became so noysom, that they were immediately necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to commit it to the Earth, and to celebrate his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
with an empty Coffin. Which solemnity was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
from Somerset-House in the <hi>Strand,</hi> unto
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths Chappel at Westminster, with
that Grandeur and State,<note n="*" place="margin">Nov. 23.</note> upon the 23. of <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
that it did equalize the greatest and most glorious
of our Kings, amongst which they laid the Corps of this
infamous Regicide.</p>

been so various, and uncertain, touching
his Parentage, and course of life, before

make a short digression; and as briefly as may be, to say
somthing of both.</p>
               <p>That his Extraction by the Fathers side, was from

of King <hi>Henry,</hi> was for that cause (and no other) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

credit, however some have fancyed otherwise, which
Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> thereupon writing himself <hi>Cromwel,</hi> alias <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi>
was then in such Favour and Grace with the King;
that having received the dignity of Knighthood<note n="*" place="margin">

Heroick behaviour at a Tilting in 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. he had
also the great Abby of Ramsey, the Nunnery of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinbroke,
with the Priories of <hi>Sautrey,</hi> and <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi>
given to him upon the disposal of the Monastery
Lands. All which he left unto Sir <hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> Kt. his
Son and Heir. Who, making Hinchinbroke his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Seat (as more pleasantly situate than <hi>Ramsey</hi> is)
left Issue Sir <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> made Knight of the Bath
at the Coronation of King <hi>Iames;</hi> and <hi>Robert Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
a younger Son (with some other Children.) Which
<hi>Robert,</hi> though he was by the countenance of his elder
Brother, made a Justice of Peace in <hi>Huntingtonshire,</hi>
had but a slender Estate; much of his support being a
Brew-House in <hi>Huntington,</hi> chiefly managed by his
Wife, who was Sister to Sir <hi>Robert Steward,</hi> of the City of
Ely, Knight, and by her had Issue this our famous <hi>Oliver,</hi>
stiled <hi>Protector</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as hath been observed.</p>
               <p>In his Youth he was for some time bred up in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Cambridg;</hi> where he made no great proficiency
in any kind of Learning: but then and afterwards sorting
himself with Drinking-Companions, and the ruder sort
of people (being of a rough and blustering disposition)
he had the name of a Royster amongst most that
knew him: and by his exorbitances so wasted his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony;
that, having attempted his Uncle <hi>Steward</hi>
for a supply of his wants, and finding that by a
smooth way of application to him, he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
he endeavoured by colour of Law to lay hold
of his Estate, representing him a person not able to
govern it. But therein failing, for lack of better
mantenance, his aim was for <hi>New-England,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there to fix, as is very well known.</p>
               <p>Observing therefore, that most of those unquiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who were refractory to the <hi>Church-Discipline</hi> by Law
Establisht here, were the principal persons which had
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48510:174"/>
stored that new Plantation; and that none but such
Schismaticks were welcome guests thither: for his better
furtherance from those of that gang, and the fairer accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
upon his arrival there, through the recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Godly Brethren; he forthwith quitted his old
Companions, and betook himself to the acquaintance
of the pretended Holy Tribe; most formally canting in
their demure Language and affected tone, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sermons of the fiercest Boutefeus. Amongst
which (as a blessed Convert, in whom they much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried)
he gained in short time a very high Reputation. So
that having better Natural parts than the most of that
Sect, and confidence enough to put forth himself, upon
any fit occasion; he was especially made choice of by
those, who ever endeavoured the undermining of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Authority, to be their Orator at <hi>Huntington,</hi> unto
the late Kings Commissiones of Sewers there, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to His Majesties most commendable design, for the
general drayning of that great and vast level of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Fenns. In which adventure, his boldness and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
gained him so much credit; as that, soon after,
being necessitated through his low condition, to quit a
Country Farm, which he held at St. Ives, and betake
himself to mean Lodgings in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
party there, chose him a Burgess for their Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in that unhappy <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi> which began at
Westminster upon the third of <hi>November,</hi> 1640.</p>
               <p>Wherein he bestirred himself, with as much violence
and heat, as any Schismatical Bankrupt did in that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievious
Convention; being well aware, that a general
imbroilment of the Kingdom, by an intestine War, might
be of advantange to such necessitous and desperate people.
Whereupon, in short time, he did accordingly obtain his
long desired ends: for being one of the first of those, who
put themselves in Arms against the King, he was made a
Captain of Horse in the Earle of <hi>Essex's</hi> Regiment, and
afterward Lieutenant General to the late Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which service, his great strength of Reason, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
with no less Courage, soon gained him such expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in the Discipline of War; as that taking strict care
for the well Arming of his men, and preventing their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48510:174"/>
upon any hot pursuit; such success attended him
upon all occasions, as at length gained him the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a skilful Commander; by reason whereof he arrived
to much higher advancements. Where soon discerning
the general humour of the Souldier, and that many of
them were possessed with conceited Revelations; some
expecting a personal Reign of Christ, here on Earth;
fancying themselves the men who were to make way for
his coming; and to that purpose that they were to destroy
the wicked and possess their Estates; he chiefly applyed
himself to the humor of those desperate <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> and by
his subtle arts in Praying, Preaching, Groaning, and
Howling amongst them, got himself no less Credit than
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> of old, did with his Followers. And so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ascending those steps of Command and Power,
whereof instance hath been given in the precedent Story,
raised himself at last, to the highest pitch of Soveraignty,
as hath already been observed.</p>

               <p>But so active and earnest were the Fanaticks against it,
that they spared not their utmost industry for the supplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof: And discerning <hi>Fleetwood</hi> (then General of the
Army) to be very much a friend unto all of their party;
unto him they made addresses for furtherance of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
speciously suggesting, that the Office of <hi>Protector,</hi>
being at the disposal of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> was to him alone inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
though <hi>Richard</hi> had been Proclaimed by some few of
the Council.</p>
               <p>And to the end that the Souldiers might likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to their side, they put them on to require the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their Arrears; two pence a week having been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
of their pay: and not only so, but to insist upon
greater priviledges, as Souldiers, than they had enjoyed
in <hi>Olivers</hi> time; <hi>viz.</hi> that no Souldier should be displaced,
without consent of the Council of War: no nor questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
for Murther, Robbery, or any other Offence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than by the Law-Military; whereby they were sure
to have no little favour. Likewise, that it should be in
the power of the Army, upon all occasions, to make
choice of their General: of all which they had first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
with this <hi>Richard,</hi> and afterwards, by their <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances</hi>
did insist upon boldly.</p>
               <p>These perrillous attempts, being therefore discerned by
his Highness,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rich. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he forthwith summoned a <hi>Parliament</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the tenor of the old Instrument) which <hi>Parliament,</hi>
was (for its greater honour) to consist of <hi>two Houses;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not doubting but to scatter these dangerous clouds; and
met accordingly at <hi>Westminster</hi> upon the seventh of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7. Ian.</note>
But consulting together; instead of complying
with his Highnesses designs, they fell to questioning the
Authority of the <hi>Other House.</hi> Nor did they at all brook
the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> sent thither as Representatives from
each of those Realms. Nevertheless, after divers tedious
and warm disputes, they were at length content<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 36.</note> to
<hi>transact</hi> with those, who Sate in that <hi>Other House;</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
such Peers, who had been faithful to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48510:175"/>
from their priviledges of being summoned as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof,<note place="margin">An. 1659.</note> and that they would receive any Message
from them, but by some of those, who were Members of
their own House.</p>
               <p>And, to the end they might, by degrees, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into power, they attempted the asserting of their
Interest in the <hi>Militia,</hi> by a <hi>salvo</hi> in their Vote relating to
the Fleet. Moreover, to captivate the people with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
shews of alleviating their burthens, they made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
formal Speeches for the taking away of all <hi>Excise:</hi>
as also of <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> after the next three years.
Likewise, to make shew how tender they were of the
<hi>peoples Liberties;</hi> they did not only set at large Colonel <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi>
and others (which had been committed to Prison by
<hi>Oliver</hi>) without payment of Fees; but questioned the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Tower for detaining those persons there.
Appointing<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> also a Committee of Inspection for Publick
Accompts. Which Committee Reported the Yearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be
eighteen hundred sixty eight thousand, seven hundred and
seventeen pounds: and the Issues to be no less than two
Millions two hundred and one thousand five hundred and
forty pounds. By which they saw, that three hundred
thirty two thousand, eight hundred twenty three pounds
of Debt, incurred Yearly upon them, by the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that great Revenue; which was treble to what
any King of <hi>England</hi> ever enjoyed. And further saw,
that to maintain the Conquest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were
at the Yearly charge of one hundred sixty three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
six hundred and nineteen pounds, more than the
Revenue of that Kingdom did then yield unto them.</p>
               <p>Other particulars they then had likewise in hand, all
tending to the publick benefit of the Nation; forbearing
to give mony, beneficial Offices, or rewards (as formerly
had been usual) amongst themselves; by which means the
world, might by degrees, be wrought into a dislike of
being Governed by that Military power, which for so long
time had Ruled the Roast: and to restore the general sway
of the Realm to themselves, as the <hi>Representative of the
People,</hi> in whom, according to the <hi>Presbyterian Maxim</hi> the
whole Sovereign Power virtually was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:48510:176"/>
Which design, so destructive to the Sword-mens Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
did not only disturb their minds, but by doubts and
jealousies, at length divided their strength into Parties
and Factions; some of them holding their Councils at
Wallingford <hi>House,</hi> with the General: others at <hi>White-hall</hi>
with the <hi>Protector</hi> and his Confidents. But, in this
Fraction, those of Wallingford-<hi>House,</hi> being much the
more numerous, drew up a bold <hi>Representation,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">April 7.</note> both
to the <hi>Protector</hi> and the House; which so startled his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he forthwith stood<note n="†" place="margin">April 8.</note> upon his Guard: and so
allarmed the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> that they thereupon Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>April</hi> 18. History of Indep. part. 4. p. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>That during the Sitting of the Parliament, there should
be no General Council, or meeting of the Officers of the Army,
without direction, leave, and Authority of the Lord Protector,
and both Houses of Parliament.</hi> And, <hi>that no person should
have and continue any Command or Trust, in any of the Armies
or Navies of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any
the Dominions and Territories thereto belonging, who should refuse
to subscribe, that he would not disturb, or interrupt the free meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Parliament, or their freedom in their Debates or Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to sweeten the Common-Souldiers, lest they
should joyn with their Officers in turning them out of
Doors (as they had formerly done) added,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 38.</note> that they
would presently take into consideration, how to satisfie the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears
of the Army, with present pay; and likewise to prepare
and Act of Indempnity for them.</p>
               <p>A great Task (indeed) had that <hi>Parliament</hi> then upon
their Hands; <hi>viz.</hi> the pleasing of the people, which could
no otherwise be, than by alleviating their heavy burthens;
and satisfying the Souldiery by feeding them with mony,
whereon they fell seriously to consider. But whilst they
were intentive on these necessary works, the Animosities
of the Army. Officers grew higher and higher against each
other; strict Guards being kept by those at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
with the <hi>Protector,</hi> against those at Wallingford-<hi>House,</hi>
with the General; the <hi>Protector,</hi> in pursuance of
the <hi>Parliament</hi>-Votes, forbidding any further Convention
of those Officers at Wallingford-<hi>House.</hi> Which prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
signifyed little; for the Wallingford-<hi>House</hi>-men, being
much the more numerous and sturdy; at length so awed
and daunted his Highness, that they obtained his consent
<note n="*" place="margin">April 22.</note> to a Commission and Proclamation (ready penned to

some others, to the number of about twenty. At which

<hi>William Lenthal,</hi> the Old Speaker, and meet<note n="*" place="margin">7. May.</note> in the
House on <hi>Saturday</hi> the seventh of <hi>May;</hi> in order thereto,
they set forth this following <hi>Declaration; viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Publick concernment of this <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> being,
through a vicissitude of dangers, deliverances, and back-slidings
of many, brought into that state and posture, whereon they now
stand; and our selves also contributing thereto, by wandring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ways from Righteous and Equal Paths. And, although
there hath been many Essays to obviate the dangers, and to settle
these Nations in Peace and Prosperity; yet all have proved ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
the only wise God, in the course of his providence disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
all endeavours therein. And also, observing to our
great grief, that the good Spirit, which formerly appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, in the carrying on of this great work, did daily decline,
so as the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> it self became a reproach; we have
been led to look back, and examine the cause of the Lord's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
his wonted presence from us, and where we turned out
of the way, that through mercy we might return, and give him
the Glory. And, amongst other things calling to mind, that the
<hi>Long Parliament,</hi> consisting of the Members there Sitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. were eminent assertors of the
<hi>Cause,</hi> and had a special presence of God with them, and were
signally blessed in that work (the desires of many good people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with ours therein) we judg it our duty to invite the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Members, to return to the exercise and discharge of their
Trust, as before the said 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we do hereby most earnestly desire the <hi>Parliament,</hi> consisting
of those Members, who continued to Sit from the year 1648. until
the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1653. to return to the exercise and discharge
of their Trust: and we shall be ready in our places, to yield them,
as becomes us, our utmost assurance to Sit in safety, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
present opportunity, for setling and securing the Peace
and Freedom of this <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> praying for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and blessing of God upon their endeavours.</p>

               <p>As to the Actings of these old Members, it is not a little
observable; that first they ordered<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. Iune.</note> the sale of all such
Houses and Lands, of the late King, the Queen, the
Prince, with Bishops, Deans and Chapters, or other then
unsold; and that they should forthwith be exposed to sale.
Also, that such persons on whom any Title of Honour
had been conferred by the said King, should pay those
forfeitures for the same, as had been by their Acts and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
in that case provided, and bring in their Patents.
Amongst which Houses intended for Sale, <hi>Somerset-House,</hi>
in the <hi>Strand,</hi> was one; the materials where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be pulled down and sold, were valued<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 49.</note> at 5545 <hi>l.</hi>
1 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, having some compassion on their late Lord
Protector <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> so outed of his Sovereignty, as
before is observed, they Voted<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 50.</note> him an exemption from
Arrests, for six months.</p>
               <p>Likewise, the more to ingratiate themselves with the
people, they passed an<note n="†" place="margin">Iuly.</note> 
                  <hi>Act of Indempnity;</hi> but without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to any, who should boggle at subscribing to a <hi>new
Engagement</hi> against the Government by the single Person,
Kingship, or House of Peers, seizing<note n="*" place="margin">2. Iuly.</note> upon divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in and about <hi>London,</hi> and upon Horses and Arms;
pretending Trayterous designs against them by the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists;
the Preachers, in their Pulpits crying out in this
manner;<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord stir up the hearts of his people to Prayer, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Humiliation, and fill them with Unanimity and Courage in
this evil time: and make the people to see, whatever fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
may be made use of by the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> to get
power into their Hands: yet, should they prevail, no man
that hath been of a party against them heretofore; yea no man,
that hath been a meer Neuter, but must expect, that his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48510:179"/>
Estate, as well as the Publick Liberty, shall become a
prey to a desperate crew of Ravenous, and Unreasonable men.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that throughout the whole Realm, the
people were weary of their Oppressions; and saw, that
notwithstanding these shiftings of the Dominion from
one hand to another, they were no whit eased of their
Taxes and Burthens: and therefore not only the Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
but most of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (being then out of play)
to rid themselves of that lingring slavery, did pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
engage to rise: and accordingly began so to do in
<hi>Cheshire;</hi> putting<note n="*" place="margin">I. August.</note> themselves under the command of
Sir <hi>George Boothe</hi> Baronet, (a person of a fair Estate in
those parts.) Which so alarm'd the old <hi>Iuncto</hi> sitting at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Rump</hi> (they being
the fag-end or Tail of the <hi>Long Parliament</hi>) as that they spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sent down into those parts, what Forces could soon
be got together, under the command of Major General
<hi>Lambert;</hi> publishing a <hi>Proclamation</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 55.</note> against them, and
their adherents, as Rebels and Traytors; Sir <hi>George</hi> in the
mean time, causing a <hi>Declaration</hi> to be Printed, and spread
abroad: Whereby manifesting to the world, that this
<hi>Iuncto at <hi>Westminster,</hi> had violated all Laws of God and
men; did profess, that the defence of the Laws and Liberties
was the chief thing, he and those with him aimed at, which
would never be setled by those Self-Seekers at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
and therefore desired a new and Free Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this good design was soon blasted: for <hi>Lambert</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
them near to <hi>North-Wiche,</hi> so over-powered
them with numbers, and more experienced Souldiers,
that he utterly routed<note n="*" place="margin">19. Aug.</note> and dispersed all their strength.
Which success so far elated this active General, that he then
thought of nothing more than his own personal advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And to the end that he might the more endear the
Souldiers to himself; not only magnified their merits, by
Letters to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> but when he had a thousand
pounds sent, to buy him a Jewel, in token of their high
esteem of that service, he forthwith distributed it amongst
his Common Souldiers. And in farther order to that his
design, under colour of seizing all Arms thereabouts, he
subtilly got them into his own hands.</p>
               <p>All which was no whit dissatisfactory to the <hi>Rumpers,</hi>
who then did not at all dream of <hi>Lamberts</hi> design: and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48510:179"/>
therefore having received Letters<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 57. September.</note> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which gave them much assurance of General <hi>Monks</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
they laid their Insurrection in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> wholly to the
Royallists charge; and forthwith resolved upon an Oath
for abjuring the Kings Title, the formality whereof I have
here added;</p>
               <p>I. <hi>A. B.</hi> do hereby declare,<note place="margin">The Oath for abjuring the King.</note> that I renounce the pretended Title
of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and the whole Line of the late King <hi>James;</hi>
and of every other Person as a single Person, pretending to the
Government of these Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions and Territories thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And that I will, by the Grace and Assistance of Almighty
God, be true, faithful, and constant to this <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi>
against any King, single Person, and House of Peers, and
every of them: and hereunto I subscribe my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to shew how Zealous their Clergy, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
therein, I shall only give instance of a precious pack
of those in</hi> Leicestershire;<note n="†" place="margin">9. Septem. Mere. Polit. N. 586. p. 721.</note> 
                  <hi>which personally came out of
that County to the Parliament, and presented to them a
Paper, Intituled</hi> The humble Representation of divers well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Ministers of the Gospel, in the County of <hi>Leicester</hi>
whose names are hereunto subscribed. <hi>Which was so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of, that they being called in; one of them (as the
mouth of the rest) addressing himself to the Speaker, said;</hi>
That, being all Ministers of the Gospel in the County of <hi>Leicester,</hi>
faithful servants to the Parliament, and imbarqued in the same
bottom with themselves; that some of them marched along with
their Forces to suppress the late Rebellion of Sir <hi>George Boothe,</hi>
and others: and, that they well knowing how much it concerned
them, with all the true Godly of the Land, to strengthen the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
hands, in the work of the Lord, were desired by many
of their Brethren, Ministers of the Gospel, in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi>
to tender that their humble Representation, in their and their own
names; with desire that it might be communicated to the House;
<hi>the Heads whereof were, as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That they did acknowledg it, as the product of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love and Goodness towards the Nation; that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the many changes of Persons and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Godly and <hi>Preaching-Ministry,</hi> had been, and still
was countenanced, protected and maintained by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:</hi>
and that the Lord had been pleased, after so
many years interruption, to restore them again to their
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48510:180"/>
places, for the accomplishing of all those just and good
things, which they formerly prosecuted, in order to an
happy settlement.</p>
               <p>2. That, as in duty bound, they desired, with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
to own the <hi>Parliament,</hi> under God, as eminent
Instruments thereof; looking upon their Piety and Zeal
for God therein; not only as a strong obligation upon their
Spirits, to a more faithful and chearful discharge of their
duties, as Ministers; but also to adhere to them.</p>
               <p>3. That they were the more encouraged thereto,
when they reflected upon the late Votes for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and maintenance of a <hi>Preaching-Ministry,</hi> and also
for the vindication of their just Rights, as men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>4. That they doubted not, but the same Divine Hand,
which had begun to lay the foundation of a Righteous
settlement of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in this Nation, continually
blasting the counter-designs of the Common Adversaries,
would in due time rear the top corner-stone, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of all that did with well to <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That they could not but with shame, and bleeding
of heart, bewail that Cloud of darkness, which had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overspread divers of their old professed friends, who
at first deeply engaged with them: yet, through that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity, which did still work in the Nation, had
been misled and caused to stumble; not only to the hazard
of their own Lives and Liberties; but to an involving
this poor Island in confusion and blood; yet the Ruin
thereof, if God had not stept in for its relief, by blessing
the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Counsels, and prospering the endeavours
of a faithful Army, against the enraged malice of the old
Common Enemy, and the dissatisfactions of such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with them, to hinder the designed work of easing
their Loads, and of settling their Foundations in Peace,
Truth, and Righteousness.</p>
               <p>6. That they took themselves bound in duty to let the
<hi>Parliament</hi> know; that (through mercy) their souls had
not entred into the secret of the late Insurrectors; but that
they did profess an utter detestation thereof; and that, the
Lord helping them, they would not cease crying mightily
to him, that he would still pour out upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
a Spirit of Wisdom, and of the fear of the Lord, to carry
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48510:180"/>
them on in their work, against all discouragements and
oppositions whatsoever; the names of the Subscribers
being these.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Which</hi> Representation <hi>being read, they were all called
into the House again, the Speaker telling them; that,</hi>
upon due consideration thereof, they found in it a Gospel-Spirit,
of Meekness, Sincerity and Holiness; and that they had also
considered the Seasonableness of it; and that it expressed, not only
on outward Letter, but an inward Spirit, <hi>&amp;c. and so gave
them the</hi> Thanks of the House.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:48510:181"/>
Soon after this the House appointed a Committee to
prepare somthing in order to the setling of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for the better support whereof they Established
the laying a Tax of one hundred thousand pounds by the
month, besides <hi>Excise</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> and the Sequestered
Estates of new Delinquents. And,<note n="*" place="margin">History of Indep. part 4. p. 59.</note> that such persons
as had been assessed to find Horse and Arms, by virtue of
the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for setling the <hi>Militia;</hi> and had
not brought in their Horse and Arms; nor paid in lieu
thereof, the sum of money appointed by the said Act: that
every such person and persons, should under the penalty
in that Act mentioned, pay after the rate of Ten pounds for
an Horse and Arms, for such number of Horses and Arms
respectively, as they had been charged to find. And that
such person and persons, as had been assessed to find Arms
for a Foot-Souldier, and had not sent in the same, or
mony in lieu thereof, should under the penalty in that
Act mentioned, pay respectively, for every such Foot-Arms,
such sum of money, as the Commissioners should
appoint; not exceeding twenty five shillings for every
such Foot-Arms.</p>
               <p>So that it is plain, that mony was it they only aimed
at, though Horse and Arms were the pretence.</p>
               <p>But amidst these their devices for inriching themselves,
<hi>Lamberts</hi> ambition began to be suspected; which was no
less than to set up himself, through the interest he then had
with the Souldiery (as his old friend <hi>Oliver</hi> had formerly
done.) Wherefore for prevention of this danger, they
resolved to trust him no longer, with any Command in
the Army; but cunningly to withdraw him, that he
might be severed from the Souldiers: and to that end, sent
a seeming courteous invitation, to allure him back to
<hi>London:</hi> of which he accepted,<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 61.</note> with as fair a shew
of Thanks. But this stratagem of the <hi>Rumpers</hi> succeeded
not: for soon after ensued a <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">5. Octob.</note> from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
directed thus,</p>
               <p>To the Supream Authority of these Nations, the Parliament
of the Common-Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> the humble Petition and
Proposals of the Officers, under the Command of the Right
Honourable the <hi>Lord Lambert,</hi> in the late Northern Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:48510:181"/>
Which <hi>Remonstrance</hi> did so much tend to the advantage
of the Souldiery, and asserting their unlimited power;
as that the <hi>Rumpers</hi> forthwith declared,<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>that to have any
more General Officers in the Army, than were already setled by
Parliament, was needless, chargeable, and dangerous to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, and in this manner, began the first rise of those
differences, and distractions, which at last so happily shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
these grand Hypocrites into pieces.</p>
               <p>But the Army-Officers, having not sufficiently ripened
their main design, were then necessitated to dissemble it
for a while: and therefore seeming to lay aside their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold
proposals; represented to the Parliament, <hi>that they
would adhere to their Authority, in opposition to the Common
Enemy; and that they would not at all fail to stand by them,
in the settlement of the Common-Wealth, against all disturbances
whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which fair expressions did lull the <hi>Rumpers</hi> into such a
seeming security, (the City also feasting them, at a <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
Dinner,</hi> whereat the Officers of the Army, were also
present) that being totally void of any fear from those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
so lately obvious, they fell upon Sequestring such
new Delinquents, as had at that time appeared in Sir <hi>George
Booth's</hi> Rising: As also setled the <hi>Excise;</hi> Revived the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesment
for the Army; neglecting no other means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for gaining the whole wealth of the Nation into
their Ravenous Clutches.</p>
               <p>But the design of the Army, being shortly after ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the Officers, which for a while had cunningly sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
their purposes, under a plausible disguise, began
again to appear in their proper colours; and presented the
House with such another bold Address, as they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done. Which so startled the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> that they
gravely declared;<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. p. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>That every Member of the Army, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>England</hi> had a right of Petitioning the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
but withal, thought fit to let them know, that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners
ought to be very careful, both in the manner, and
in the matter of what they desired, that the way of promoting,
and presenting the same, may be peaceable; and the thing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
for, not tending to the distrubance of the</hi> Common-Wealth,
<hi>nor to the dishonour of the Parliament. And that
it was the duty of Petitioners to submit their desires to
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:48510:182"/>
the Parliament, and acquiesce in the judgment thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevertheless, doubting (as they might do very well)
that the Souldiers, which so often before, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>would again follow the
example of <hi>Oliver,</hi> either in turning them out of Doors,
or making them Hackneys to their ambitious ends; being
not ignorant, that, without mony those Sword-men could
no way subsist; and that none was like to be so plausibly
raised, as by the name of a</hi> Parliament; <hi>to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that they might the more insensibly diminish their
power, they passed an Act,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 65. &amp; 66.</note> That all Orders, Ordinances, and
Acts made by any single Person, and his Council, or both, or either of
them, or otherwise; or by any Assembly, or Convention, pretending
to have Authority of <hi>Parliament,</hi> from and after the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of <hi>April</hi> 1653. and before the seventh of <hi>May</hi>
1659. and which had not been, or should not be Enacted,
Allowed or confirmed by that present <hi>Parliament;</hi> should be
and were thereby declared, deemed, taken, and adjudged to be of
no force and effect, from and after the said seventh day of <hi>May</hi>
1659. And that no person or persons, should after the eleventh
of <hi>October</hi> 1659. Assess, Levy, Collect, Gather, or Receive
any Custom, Impost, Excise, Assesment, Contribution, Tax,
Tallage, or any sum or sums of mony, or other Imposition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
upon the people of that Common-Wealth, without their
consent in <hi>Parliament;</hi> or as by Law might have been done
before the third of <hi>November</hi> 1640. And that every person
offending contrary to that Act, should be, and was thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be guilty of High Treason, and should forfeit and
suffer as in case of High Treason.</p>
               <p>And thinking then, that their whole work was in effect
done, they lookt upon themselves as men of such might;
that they Voted the Commissions of <hi>Lambert, Desborow,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">12. Octob.</note>
and some other eminent <hi>Magnifico's</hi> of the Army, null
and void; and that they and every of them should be
discharged from their respective Military imployments:
Likewise, that the Army should be governed by seven
Commissioners (the most confiding men, you may be
sure) <hi>viz.</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> Lieutenant General
<hi>Ludlow,</hi> General <hi>Monke,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haselrigg</hi> Baronet,
Golonel <hi>Valentine Walton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Herbert Morley,</hi> and
Colonel <hi>Robert Overton,</hi> or any three or more of them,
who were to give notice unto <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the rest, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48510:182"/>
they were each of them discharged of their respective
Military imployments.</p>
               <p>Which was no sooner made known to those Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
than that General <hi>Lambert</hi> and his party prepared
for their defence: on the other side, the Commissioners for
the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> issuing out Orders suitable to the exigency of
their affairs. Of which <hi>Lambert</hi> and his followers being
made aware, they drew down to <hi>Westminster</hi> in an
Hostile equipage; where they possessed themselves of the
<hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> and all avenues leading thereto;<note place="margin">12. Octob.</note> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
given out, that they found it absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray
to Dissolve the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the good of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But for the support of that Convention, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Rump,</hi> another part of the Army, were no less
earnest and active; and in opposition to <hi>Lambert</hi> did<note n="†" place="margin">13. Octob.</note> at
the same time, march thither also; placing themselves in
<hi>King's-street,</hi> and other parts about <hi>Westminster.</hi> All
which was done betimes in the morning; so that when
<hi>Lenthal</hi> the Speaker, came in his Coach, according to the
usual time, to sit in the House, though he found his way
clear enough through the Souldiers in King-Street,
when he came to the <hi>Palace-Yard</hi> he saw it otherwise,<note place="margin">The <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> Excluded.</note> and
therefore made his return.</p>
               <p>It was then thought by some, that the Souldiers thus
met, would not have departed so tamely: But <hi>Lambert</hi>
having his ends by shutting out the <hi>Rumpers,</hi> both parties
retreated quietly, closing again in a seeming friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>But that there might not be wanting, some shadow of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herewith whilst they were in hand, came
a Letter out of <hi>Scotland</hi> from General
<hi>Monke;</hi> importing that himself, and
some of the Officers there with him, were
much dissatisfied with their transactions
here: and that he had not only secured
divers strong Holds in that Kingdom, but committed to
safe custody those of his Officers, who were Dissenters
from him therein; as also Possessed himself of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Narwocl.</hi> Which unexpected Alarm, did not a
little disturb them. Yet on they must, or be overwhelmed
with Confusion. They therefore soon ordered that their
Forces in the North, together with some other Regiments
from the Southern-parts of this Realm, should forthwith
march to the Borders of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and in the mean
time sent Colonel <hi>Cobbet</hi> to Treat with General <hi>Monke;</hi>
expecting that he by fair words might cajole him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Monke</hi> then discerning an hopeful way open, to do
that which his heart had long desired to accomplish, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<hi>Cobbert</hi> from stirring abroad; being well aware, that
by taking his Liberty, he might either have endangered
the corrupting of his men; or carry back Intelligence of
their whole strength and posture; and thereupon modeled
his Army sutable to his own mind; publickly declaring;
<hi>That he would assert the Authority of <hi>Parliament</hi> against all
violence whatsoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which News arriving with the <hi>Committee of Safety;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
that they might please <hi>Monke</hi> with the Establishing
of a free State, though they disowned the <hi>Parliament</hi> for
whom he had declared, they culled out seven of their
ablest contrivers, to prepare a <hi>Form of Government,</hi> to be
set up, throughout all the three Kingdoms, in the Nature
of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> or <hi>Free-State;</hi> and sent away two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels,
<hi>Whalley</hi> and <hi>Goffe;</hi> with <hi>Carryl</hi> and <hi>Barker</hi> (two of
their <hi>Assembly-men</hi>) to Treat with him thereon, for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farther difference; the Officers of the Army at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
seconding the same with Letters into <hi>Scotland;</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:48510:184"/>
urging most earnestly a necessity of their Brotherly union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monke</hi> therefore foreseeing, that delays would destroy
them; their Forces not being able to subsist long without
money, ordered Colonel <hi>Talbot</hi> and Dr. <hi>Clarges</hi> (who had
been also sent from <hi>England</hi> to him) to advertise Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Fleetwood,</hi> that himself and his Officers had nominated
Colonel <hi>Wilkes,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Clobury,</hi> and Major
<hi>Knight,</hi> to repair speedily to <hi>London;</hi> and to Treat with
the like number of Officers there, in order to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a firm and stedfast aimity betwixt them: and for
the furtherance thereof sent Letters from himself to that
purpose; with promise that his Forces should not advance
any farther.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> not knowing how to trust
him, issued out sundry Commissions, for setling the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
which upon fit occasion was to be ready in a moment.
Whereof General <hi>Monke,</hi> being soon advertised, and that
<hi>Lambert</hi> was on his march Northwards with thirteen
thousand stout men: he dispatcheth away those his three
Messengers, to Treat for a speedy Peace. Which Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
being accordingly come<note n="*" place="margin">12. Nov. Ib. p. 73. &amp; 74.</note> to <hi>London,</hi> the Treaty
soon began, and ere long concluded<note n="†" place="margin">14. Nov.</note> in these ensuing
Articles; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That the pretended Title of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> or any other
claiming from that Family, should be utterly renounced.</p>
               <p>2. That the Government of these Nations, should be by a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>State,
or Common-Wealth, and not by a single Person, King, or
House of Lords.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, That a Godly and Learned Ministry should be
maintained and encouraged.</p>
               <p>4. That the Universities should be Reformed, and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
so as that they might become Nurseries of Piety and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>5. That the Officers and Souldiers, and other persons, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, should be indempnified for what was past, touching
their late differences, and all unkindness betwixt them, buried in
perpetual oblivion.</p>
               <p>6. That the Officers, who were made Prisoners in <hi>Scotland</hi>
should be forthwith set at liberty.</p>
               <p>7. And that the Armies should be presently disposed of into
Quarters: as also a Committee of nineteen Constituted, whereof
nine to make a <hi>Quorum,</hi> which should consider of qualifications

Which Articles, so by them agreed on, being returned
to General <hi>Monke.</hi> who had reserved to himself the power
of ratifying whatever was to be Treated on; and that the
same should not be of force, till confirmed under his
Seal; he forthwith commanded the coming back of the
Commissioners: and to shew his dislike of what they had
done, clapt up Colonel <hi>Wilkes</hi> into Custody, for exceeding
his bounds; and immediately declaring the Treaty to be
void, advanc'd towards <hi>England,</hi> having made these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

               </p>
               <p>First, That they would, during his absence (which would not be
long) preserve and secure the Peace of that Nation. Secondly,
That they would supply him with some men for his undertaking
(which he engaged upon his honour, should be to their satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and if any troubles should arise, to assist him in the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thereof. Thirdly, That they would advance and raise what
mony they could, before-hand.</p>
               <p>Unto which <hi>propositions,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Gleucarne</hi> (Chair-man

               </p>
               <p>First, That they could not engage to preserve the Peace of the
Country in his absence, wanting Arms, and so in no condition to do it;
but they should, with all faithfulness (notwithstanding) endeavour it.
To the second, that they were uncapable to answer his desires, for the

                  </gap>ons aforesaid: neither did they think it prudent for them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in a war; which should it prove unsuccesful on their part, would
be a ruin to them: or, if succesful, they did not understand, that it
would be advantagious, in any measure. Thirdly, That they were
content to levy monies, and to advance a years Tax before-hand.</p>
               <p>With which answer from that Earl, General <hi>Monke</hi> being
well satisfied, he gave them power,<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 78.</note> forthwith to Arm
themselves; and until all things were in better readiness,
delaying his march Southwards, made some seeming over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> for a second Treaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereunto the Committee replyed;</hi> That they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
transmitted part of a form of Government, to be Establisht in
these Nations, unto a certain Committee of the Officers in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by them to be considered. Which Officers, having thereupon
met, had gone through the most of it, with great satisfaction.
And that they were very desirous to have such a Government, as
might best preserve the Liherties of the people, and secure the
Cause, wherein they had contended, as well against <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:48510:185"/>
as any other, that might disturb the Publick Peace; hoping in
time, to make it appear, that their Enemies were liars, in rendering
them to the people, to be meerly Self-Seekers. <hi>And concluding
said,</hi> they hoped that the Faith of Gods People, would hold out,
and not make hast: and that good men would help them in their
Prayers, that God the Lord would bring forth Righteousness and
Truth; and discover and bring to nought the secret contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of all their Adversaries.</p>
               <p>About this time Petitions being in hand,<note place="margin">Petitions from all parts for a new and free Parliament.</note> in sundry parts
of the Nation, all tending to the desire of a <hi>New and Free
Parliament,</hi> gave such high offence unto the <hi>Committee of
Safety,</hi> that they issued out a solemn <hi>Proclamation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">ult. Nov.</note> against
them, calling them dangerous Papers, and prohibiting
their Subscriptions: also requiring, if offered, to suppress
them; causing likewise the endeavourers of such Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
to be apprehended, as disturbers and Enemies to
Peace. Which distastful restraint caused the peoples
greater earnestness; especially the <hi>Londoners,</hi> whereupon
Colonel <hi>Hewson</hi> was sent<note n="†" place="margin">5. Dec.</note> with some forces into the City,
to awe them: but with little effect, the Souldiers in all
places, being scorn'd and affornted. Whereat <hi>Hewson</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so much enraged, that he murdered some of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
in the streets.</p>
               <p>But that which toucht them in point of danger more
nearly, was the revolt<note n="*" place="margin">4. Dec.</note> of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> whereof
Sir <hi>Arthur Haselrigg,</hi> Colonel <hi>Walton,</hi> and <hi>Herbert Morley,</hi>
with the consent of <hi>Whetham</hi> the Governour, had then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
themselves: The news whereof coming to the Ears
of the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> they speedily sent both Horse
and Foot, to reduce it. But the people in general, being
impatient till a readmission of the <hi>Rump,</hi> or to have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else bearing the name of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> necessitated the
<hi>Committee of Safety</hi> to declare<note n="†" place="margin">10. Dec. Ib. p. 80.</note> that a <hi>Parliament</hi> should be
called, and appointed to sit down before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>February</hi> next
ensuing: and, that the <hi>Parliament,</hi> so to be called, should
be according to such qualifications, as then were, or should
be agreed upon, and might best secure the just Rights, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and Priviledges <hi>of the people.</hi> Taking care, that
when met, there should be no alteration of these Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 81.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That no Kingship should be excercised in these Nations.</p>
               <p>2. That no single person should exercise the Office of chief
Magistrate therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:48510:185"/>
3. That an Army should be continued and maintained; and so
conducted, that it might secure the Peace of these Nations: and
not be disbanded, nor the Conduct thereof altered but by consent of
the Conservators appointed.</p>
               <p>4. That no imposition might be upon the Consciences of them
that feared God.</p>
               <p>5. That there should be no House of Peers.</p>
               <p>6. That the Legislative and Executive power should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and not in the same hands.</p>
               <p>7. That the Assemblies of <hi>Parliament,</hi> should be Elected
by the people of the Common-Wealth duly qualified.</p>
               <p>But to nip these in the bud, came a <hi>Declaration</hi> from
Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawson,</hi> and his fellows, in the Navy;
giving several Reasons of a necessity, for the <hi>Old Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
to sit again. And to second this, came News, that
those Forces, which they had sent to reduce <hi>Portsmouth,</hi>
had forsaken their Commanders, and were gone in to the
Revolters.</p>
               <p>Nor were the generality of the people, about that time,
less active every where: some labouring earnestly, that
the <hi>Rump</hi> might sit again: others for joyning all the Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Members to them. But the greatest part, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the most sober men, were in their desires wholly for a
<hi>Full and Free Parliament;</hi> yet could not be heard: for the
<hi>Rump</hi> through the power of the Souldiery,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Rump <hi>readmitted.</hi>
                  </note> was readmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note n="*" place="margin">24. Decem.</note> and solemnly owned by them, as the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
both here, and in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whereupon, beginning
to sit,<note n="†" place="margin">26. Decem.</note> they disposed of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to the
custody of Sir <hi>Anthony-Ashley Couper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weever</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
and recalled <hi>Lambert</hi> from his Expedition against
General <hi>Monke;</hi> (most of whose men were by that time
gone in to <hi>Monke;</hi> or for want of pay very much dispersed.)
And well considering the tumultuousness of the people, in
many parts, and insolency of the Souldiers, wheresoever
they came, they hastned up General <hi>Monke,</hi> as their chief
shelter. Who having so prudently secured <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>General</hi> Monke <hi>hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from</hi> Scotland.</note>
and dealt privately with Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> to take the like
care of <hi>Ireland,</hi> advanced forwards, as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But no sooner were the</hi> Rumpers <hi>thus got into the House,
than that some old Secluded Members, required, also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance.
Which put them upon this following Vote;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">27. Decem. Ib. p. 83.</note> That
upon the fifth of <hi>January</hi> ensuing, the House would take into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48510:186"/>
the case of all absent Members; as also how to supply
the vacant places, in order to the filling it up. And that in the
mean time it should be referred to a Committee, to consider of
all proceedings, and all Orders and Cases, touching absent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and make their Report thereof, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Which Vote did not prove so satisfactory as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
for the City being discontented, made preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for a <hi>Posture of Defence:</hi> and in the Country the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered-Officers,
and the depressed Nobility and Gentry
courted General <hi>Monke,</hi> all along as he marcht, incessantly
crying out for a <hi>Full and Free Parliament.</hi> Whose answer, in
substance, was no more than this; viz. <hi>that he would use his
best endeavours to persuade unto Reason and Iustice;</hi> wishing all
persons to acquiesce, in what should be the issue.</p>
               <p>Most certain it is, that though the <hi>Rump</hi> had fair hopes
of <hi>Monk's</hi> firmness unto them; yet were they not without
their jeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sies of him: and therefore, under colour of
Congrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ing his coming into <hi>England,</hi> they sent <hi>Thomas
Scot,</hi> and <hi>Luke Robinson,</hi> to sound him more nearly. But
he deported himself with so much reservedness and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they little discerned the real purposes of his Heart.
And when the City of <hi>London</hi> sent their Sword-bearer to
Court him; he only said; <hi>that he was for the Parliament:</hi>
yet assured them, <hi>that when he came thither, he would satisfie
their desires, and the hopes they had of him.</hi> Promising no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; that <hi>that he would first see all force removed from
the Parliament.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the House should be
filled: and lastly, That there should be good provision for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>Parliaments.</hi>
                  </hi> So keeping on a soft pace, he came
at length to St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever apprehensions and fancies others then had of
his purpose, it is not to be doubted, but that the <hi>Rumpers</hi>
made all Cocksure for themselves; not only in the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but Executive power; and for disposing all places of
Benefit and Trust, so that their sitting without limit, might
be perpetuated: in order thereto, passing this Vote;<note n="*" place="margin">5. Ianuar. Ib. p. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.
Resolved touching absent Members, that the Parliament doth
adjudg and declare, that the Members, who stand discharged from
Voting or Sitting in year 1648. and 1649. do stand duly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
by judgment of Parliament, from sitting as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this Parliament, during this Parliament; and
that Writs do issue forth, for electing of new Members in their

Appointing that the Oath<note n="*" place="margin">2. Ianuar. Oath for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the King taken by Members of Parliament.</note> for abjuring the King, and
the whole Line of King <hi>Iames,</hi> should be taken by every
Member, thenceforth sitting in <hi>Parliament:</hi> and thereupon
grew so insolent, that they imprisoned divers persons, for
Petitioning to have a <hi>Free Parliament.</hi> Which occasioned
General <hi>Monke</hi> to come the sooner to <hi>London;</hi> and to
take up his Lodging<note n="†" place="margin">3. Februar.</note> at <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where having rested about two or three days, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the House according to Order; and modestly
giving them an account of his whole undertakings, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 86. &amp; 87.</note> That he deserved not the Thanks, which the House had<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 86. &amp; 87.</note>
then given him, having done no more than his duty therein: but
wisht them rather to praise God for his mercy, desiring them to
satisfie the expectations of the people, in the Establishment of their
Laws, Liberties, and Properties: God having restored them,
not so much as that they should seek their own, as the Publick
Good. Desiring them in particular, to take away the jealousies
men had of their perpetuity, by putting a period to that their own
Session, and providing orderly for future <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
Wishing them to use the Nobility and Gentry civilly: and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that it would be their wisdom rather to enlarge than contract
any whit of their Interest. <hi>And farther told them,</hi> that the
fewer qualifications they did put upon succeeding <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
it would be the better. <hi>Desiring them</hi> to be tender in imposing
new Oaths (<hi>for he had heard of the Oath of Abjuration</hi>)
alledging, that there was more reason to repent of those already
taken, than to take farther new ones. And so warning them to
beware of Cavaliers and Fanaticks; commending <hi>Scotland</hi>
to their care, and assuring them of <hi>Ireland,</hi> concluded, with
some intimation of his thoughts for a Free-State.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken his leave of the House, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to his place in the Council of State. Where the first
thing he found under consideration, was; that the Citizens
of <hi>London,</hi> being grown somwhat unruly, had stifly
resolved to own no power, but of a <hi>Full and Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(encouraged thereto, by sundry <hi>Petitions,</hi> to that
purpose, which they had seen from several Counties) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to pay Taxes, but by consent of such a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
Which put the <hi>Rumpers</hi> upon this desperate exigent; <hi>viz.</hi>
either to reduce them to obedience by a strong hand, or
themselves to be reputed but the shadow of Authority.</p>
               <p>In order whereunto, they commanded General <hi>Monke,</hi>
to march thither with his Forces; and to compel them to
pay the Assesments. Whereupon he advanced with speed
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48510:187"/>
to <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> and there made his demand of what the
<hi>Parliament</hi> had required. Which much dashing the hopes,
that the Citizens had otherwise of him, they modestly
answered; <hi>that in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> confirmed by the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right,</hi> and ratified by that present <hi>Parliament,</hi>
the day before their forcible Dissolution; they were to pay no Taxes,
but by their consent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which at that present they
had not.</hi> Yet to avoid the giving him any just offence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
farther time to consider thereof.</p>
               <p>Which, though the General readily granted; yet he
wrote to the House for their farther direction. Whereupon
answer was forthwith returned; that he should in the first
place imprison Colonel <hi>Bromefield,</hi> Alderman <hi>Bludworth,</hi>
Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Iackson,</hi> Major <hi>Cox,</hi> Colonel <hi>Vincent,</hi> &amp;c.
(some of which number had attended him from the City,
but a little before.) And secondly, that he should remove
their Chains, dig up their Posts, and break down their
Gates.<note n="*" place="margin">9. Febru.</note> Which harsh and rough service did at first not a little
startle him; considering it was done, partly to make tryal
of his patient obedience to them: and partly to occasion a
certain enmity betwixt him and the City, and then to cast
him off, by diminishing his power, as he very well discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But, foreseeing the event, he submitted thereto;
which was to enrage the Citizens throughly against the
<hi>Rump;</hi> and that upon the expiring<note n="†" place="margin">10. Febru.</note> of his Commission
the next day after; his power would be diminished by the
conjunction of six others with him in equal Command.</p>
               <p>Which, being made known by him to his Officers, who
lookt for a better reward for their service; concluding that
the <hi>Rump</hi> would shortly lay them aside also, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
their own sitting. Having likewise made so sure an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of the Cities temper, which he then knew was
positive for their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Rights:</hi> and concluding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that he might safely put his confidence in them; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
private discourse had with some of the chief Citizens;
he first wrote his Letters to the <hi>Rumpers, wishing them, at last
to put a period to their siting, and make some certain provision
for future Parliaments.</hi> And thereupon marching with his
Forces into the City, immediately declared for <hi>a Full and
Free Parliament.</hi> Which raised the hearts of all people so
much, that they expressed their great joy by Bells, Bonefires,
and all other testimonies of joy imaginable.</p>
               <p>And having waited a while, for a return to his Letter,
and receiving no manner of Answer thereunto, he procured
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48510:187"/>
a Conference with some of the old Secluded Members.
Finding also, that the settlement proposed by the <hi>Rumpers</hi>
was too weak and slender, to repair the breaches in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he resolved to withdraw all force from the
House, and to admit those to sit there, whose tempers were
more moderate; and therefore sending for the Secluded
Members to meet him at <hi>white-hall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20. Febr.</note> he represented
unto them, what he then thought best to be done, <hi>viz. The
meeting of a Full and Free Parliament;</hi> saying <hi>that the House
should be open unto them, and wishing them all happy success therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which old Members being by this means met<note n="†" place="margin">21. Febr. Ib. p. 93, 94.</note> together
again; they began where they broke off in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648.

               <p>But, notwithstanding all this, the danger was not totally

in some Officers of the Army, and some other turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Spirits, to this hopeful settlement; and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
an Engagement from them, of their peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor,
were necessitated to imprison some of the most
obstinate refusers; amongst which <hi>Lambert</hi> was one, and
not the least; who finding the Fanaticks most eager for

Which through the great vigilancy of the General, being

as much brevity as I well could do:
whereby it hath been fully made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
by what Artifices this seeming-Godly
Generation did at first get power
into their cruel hands; that is to say,
their many specious <hi>Declarations,</hi> and solemn promises,
for <hi>the Defence of the Protestant Religion; the Laws of the
Land; the Liberties of the Subject, and Priviledges of Parliament.</hi>
I shall now crave leave to make some short Observations
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:48510:189"/>
thereon; and give most ample instances of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Actings in every of these; even in those very times,
in which their Dagon of <hi>Presbytery</hi> was visibly Triumphant.<note place="margin">Their Actings against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>
And first as to the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After they had, under pretence of great danger by a
Jesuitical-party, of destroying the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
fram'd a <hi>protestation</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">3. May.</note> for preserving the same, <hi>as it was
exprest in the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </hi>
Which <hi>protestation</hi> (the farther to satisfy the People of
their own integrity) was solemnly taken by all the
Members, and Ordered<note n="b" place="margin">4. May.</note> to be Printed, and sent down
into the several Counties: within few days after, they
made an Explanation<note n="c" place="margin">12. May.</note> thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>by the true
reformed Protestant Religion, was meant so far as it was
opposite to Popery: and that the said words were not to be extended
to the maintenance of any Form, Discipline, or Government;
nor of any Rules, or Ceremonies of the said Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </hi>
And, having given themselves such Latitude, by that
their After-explanation (<hi>viz.</hi> not to desend the <hi>Protestant
Religion,</hi> as it stood establisht by Law, and was exprest
in the XXXIX Articles, but as it was repugnant to
Popery, and taught perhaps by all <hi>Brownists, Anabaptists,
Familists</hi> and other Sectaries, which made way for all
that brood to joyn with them.) They then Ordered
<note n="d" place="margin">21. May.</note> 
                  <hi>that no Minister should take any Oath at his Induction, but
what should be warranted by Scripture.</hi> And soon after fell

of <hi>England</hi> by Archbishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been found
by long experience, to be a great impediment to the perfect

to the civil Government of this Kingdom. <hi>As also</hi> that

                  <hi>What private Conferences they had, about this time,

being insisted on, that Heresies would farther spread, if Bishops

was an obstacle to the suppression of the Bishops; but afterwards
they might have free libertie of their practise. The words were
uttered by Mr. <hi>Calamine</hi> who was afterwards to violent against
their toleration.</p>
               <p>And to hasten this universal Confusion, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

<note n="n" place="margin">9. Sep.</note> injoying the due observation of the Book of <hi>Common

lie in the woods are come into your Sheep-fold, and roare in the

broken down the Hedge of this thy Vineyard, which thy right

               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon many good People beginning to whisper
their Fears of that which shortly after hapned; these
subtile Foxes, to drive their great work with the less
suspition, in their</hi> grand Remonstrance<note n="r" place="margin">15. Decem. Exact. Coll. p. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>of the 15th of</hi>
December, <hi>cryed out against certain Malignants (as they
term'd them</hi>) who had infused into the People, that they meant
to abolish all Church-Government, and leave every Man to his
own fancie for the Service and Worship of God; absolving them
of that obedience, which they owe, under God, unto His Majesty;
acknowledging him to be intrusted with the Eclesiastical Law, as
well as with the Temporal, to Regulate all the Members of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> by such Rules of Order and Discipline
as are established by Parliament. <hi>And in the same</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
<hi>declared,</hi> That it was far from their purpose, or desire,
to let loose the golden Reynes of Discipline and Government in the
Church, and leave private Persons, or particular Congregations,
to take up what forme of Divine-service they pleased; holding it
requisite, that there should be, through the whole Realm, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to that Order, which the Law enjoyns.</p>
               <p>But to the end they might bring the work to pass by
others; in which they did not then think fit to shew
themselves openly (as their Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> had done)
the Tumultuous rabble of Sectaries were (by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance)
brought<note n="s" place="margin">28. Dec.</note> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there violently
assaulted the great Church, threatning to pull down the
Organs, and Popish Reliques; for so they called those
stately Monuments of the Kings and others.</p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">Anno 1642.</note> after His Majesty was driven from <hi>London,</hi>
and that they had got his Navy, Forts, Magazine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
into their hands; they ordered,<note n="t" place="margin">9. April. Exact. Coll. p. 135.</note> that an <hi>Assembly</hi> of
<hi>Divines should meet, with whom they might consult, for setling of the
Church-Government and Liturgy.</hi> Shortly after which a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(pretended to have been brought from <hi>Cornwall</hi>) was</p>

Read<note n="u" place="margin">22. April</note> in the House of Commons; amongst other
things desiring, <hi>that the Ceremonies and Service of the Church
might be abolished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding all this, left any jealousy of their
intentions should so far prevail, as to stagger the People
(whom they had hitherto deluded with their specious
pretences) especially being then about to raise their
Rebellious Forces; they declared,<note n="x" place="margin">26. July.</note> 
                  <hi>That their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Arms was for security of Religion, the safety of His
Majesties Person,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And having thus form'd an Army, the first work
wherewith they began, was to<note n="y" place="margin">The Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced by Col. <hi>Edwyn Sandys.</hi> 26. August.</note> Deface the most
Antient and Chief Cathedral of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Soon after which, some of their Forces, in their first

the Church at <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

defaced whatsoever was decent therein; tore the Bible
and Book of Common-Prayer; sticking the leaves of
them upon the walls with their Excrements.</p>
               <p>And when their whole Army, under the Command
of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> came to<note n="z" place="margin">24. Sept.</note> 
                  <hi>Worcester,</hi> the first
thing they there did, was the Prophanation of the
Cathedral; destroying the Organ; breaking in pieces
divers beautiful Windows, wherein the Foundation of
that Church was lively Historified with Painted Glass,
and barbarously Defacing divers fair Monuments of the
Dead. And as if this were not enough, they brought
their Horses into the body of the Church, keeping fires
and Courts of Guard therein, making the Quire and
side-isles, with the Font, the common places, wherein
they did their easements of Nature. Also, to make
their wickedness the more compleat, they rifled the
Library, with the Records and Evidences of the Church;
tore in pieces the Bibles and Service-books pertaining
to the Quire; putting the Surplices and other Vestments
upon their Dragooners, who rode about the streets
with them.</p>
               <p>Which shameful outrages done by the Souldiers thus
early, being much taken notice of; and observation
made of the liberty given to their seditious Preachers,
caused thereupon a general murmur by most People.
To cast a mist, therefore, before their Eyes for a while,

the utter eradication of Episcopacy; yet they intended not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
the Liturgy and Common Prayer; but so far to Regulate
the same,<note place="margin">☞</note> as might agree with the Truth of Gods word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which purpose, and that it might bear a fair sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Reformation, they brought in a Bill<note n="b" place="margin">6. Oct.</note> for

though he had scandalized the Liturgy of the Church;</hi>
calling the Book of Common-Prayer <hi>a great

shutting up the Cathedral of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> upon Sundays. Yet, that they
might not be suspected in their well-wishes to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

to bring in Popery.</p>
               <p>All which fair pretences, and Votes were made by
the Members at <hi>Westminster,</hi> whilst their Forces in
divers parts went on with such horrid practises, as the like
hath not been seen in this Realm, since the Pagan-Danes,
upon their Invasions, exercised their Heathenish Cruelties
here; Sr. <hi>William Waller</hi> (their Western-General, about
this time) entring<note n="d" place="margin">16. Dec.</note> 
                  <hi>Winchester;</hi> where his Souldiers
Committed the like barbarous outrages, in that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
as was done by the E. of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Men at <hi>Worcester;</hi>
tearing likewise in pieces those Chests of Lead, wherein
were enshrin'd the Bones of divers Saxon Kings, Queens,
devout Bishops and Confessors: with which they broke
in pieces the Costly Historical Windows there. Besides
this, they battered and Defaced the Brazen Statua's of the
King, and that of His Royal Father K. <hi>Iames</hi> (which
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48510:191"/>
His Majesty, as a pledge of his Princely favour had
given to that Church) hack't and hew'd the Crown
on his Head, swearing that they would bring him back
to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And, having so done, seized upon
the Rich Hangings, Cusheons, Pulpit-Clothes, and
Communion-Plate:
spoiling or carrying away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else was of Ornament or worth. The like, for
the most part, they did soon<note n="e" place="margin">29. Dec.</note> after, in the Cathedral
at <hi>Chichester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was there any place they came to, where they
made not the like devastation. At <hi>Sudeley,</hi> in <hi>Gloucester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
(the Seat of the Antient and Noble Familes of the
Lords <hi>Sudley</hi> and <hi>Chandos,</hi>) they broke<note n="f" place="margin">28. Jan.</note> down the
Monuments; made the Body of the Church a Stable
for their Horses, and the Chancel their Slaughter-House.
To the Pulpit they fastned Pegs, on which they hang'd
the Carcasses of Sheep. Of the Communion-Table
they made a Dresser or Chopping-board to cut their
Meat. Into the Vault, where lay the Bodies of those
Noble Persons, they cast the Guts and Garbage of the
Sheep; leaving in every Corner of the Church their own
loathsom Excrements.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Elvaston,</hi> in <hi>Derby-shire,</hi> (about this time)
Sir <hi>Iohn Gell</hi>'s Souldiers (after their Plunder of the Lady
<hi>Stanhope</hi>'s House) demolished a Costly Monument,
newly made for Sir <hi>Iohn Stanhope;</hi> entred the Vault,
wherein many of his Ancestors lay Interred; and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
over the Dead, thrust their Swords into the
Coffins.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> another of their Armies
entred <hi>Lichfield,</hi> under the Conduct of the Lord <hi>Brooke.</hi>
Where the Souldiers (notwithstanding that Lord lost his life
in the Assaulting that Cathedral upon St. <hi>Chad</hi>'s Day, to
which Saint it was Dedicated) exercised the like Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisms,
as were done at <hi>Worcester,</hi> in demolishing all
the Monuments, pulling down the curious Carved work;
battering in pieces the Costly Windows; and destroying
the Evidences and Records belonging to that Church:
which being done, they stabled their Horses in the
Body of it, kept Courts of Guard in the Cross-Ifles;
broke up the Pavement, poluted the Quire with their
Excrements; every Day hunted a Cat with Hounds
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:48510:192"/>
throughout the Church, delighting themselves in the
Eccho from the goodly Vaulted Roof: and to add to
their wickedness, brought a Calf into it, wrapt in
Linnen; carried it to the Font; Sprinkled it with water;
and gave it a Name in scorn and derision of that Holy
Sacrament of Baptism. And when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that Church by force; <hi>Russel</hi> the Governour
carried away the Communion Plate, and Linnen, with
whatsoever else was of value.</p>
               <p>About the same time also, the like spoile and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
was done by <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and his followers
in <hi>Lincoln<hi>-Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi>
                  </hi> tearing up all that beautiful Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the upper part of the Quire; watering their
Horses at the Font. And at the same time pull'd down two
of the Parish-Churches of that Antient City, for the
better opportunity of their Fortifications.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lestithiell</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Aug. 1644.</note> also in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> when the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was there with his Army, one of his
Souldiers brought a Horse into the Church, led him up
to the Font; and made another hold him, whilst he
Sprinkled water on his Head, and said; <hi>I signe thee with
the signe of the Cross, in token thou shalt not be ashamed to fight
against the Round-Heads at <hi>London,</hi>
                  </hi> with a deale more
of such Balsphemous stuff; blowing up that Church, with
Gunpowder, at their departure.</p>
               <p>I pass by the mention of <hi>Exeter, Peterborough,
Salisbury, Gloucester,</hi> and divers other fair Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals,
besides divers goodly Callegiate-Churches, with
many of the Chappels in the University of <hi>Combridge,</hi>
which tasted of their outrages, about that time; being
so much Defaced, as that they will remain to posterity
for infamous badges of their barbarous impieties.</p>
               <p>And that it may appear that their great Masters the
<hi>Londoners,</hi> did very well approve of these their doings;
they did, by a publique Act of Common Council,

of equal esteem with Churches and Holy-Oratories; and
a Ditch or a Dunghill thought as fit for Purial, as any

for Testimony whereof, take Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General's word: who, having received a Message
from Sir <hi>Iohn Boys,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dunnington</hi>-Castle
for His Majesty; whereby it was signified to him, that
the number of the Rebels Bodies, which were slain in
the assault of that Castle, were so many, that he could
not give them Christian-Burial; and therefore out of a
Charitable Respect tendred liberty to take them off, and
do it elsewhere; returned answer,<note n="k" place="margin">31. July. 1644.</note> in these words
—<hi>That he conceived no Holiness to be in any place, or Burial;

                  <hi>Against which Hethenish Principle, I shall tell you
what their own Mr.</hi> William Prynne <hi>hath said, in his
Book,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">p. 248. &amp; 249.</note> 
                  <hi>Intituled,</hi> The Antipatby of English Lordly-prelacy.
<hi>Wherein complaining of</hi> Pandulphus <hi>Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi>
who perswaded K.</hi> Iohn (<hi>as he saith) to submit himself to</hi>
Stephen Langton <hi>Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and others
that had interdicted the Realm, he cryeth in these very
words</hi>—Let me inform you, that during the time of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,
all Ecclesiastical Sacraments ceased in England, except
<hi>Confession</hi> and the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> in extream necessity, and the
Baptisme of Infants; so as the Bodies of Dead-men, were carried
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:48510:193"/>
out of Towns and Villages, and Buried like Dogs in High-ways
and Ditches, without Prayers, and the Ministry of Priests.
<hi>Whereby it is plain, in Mr.</hi> Prynns <hi>opinion, that</hi> Burial
without Prayers, and the Ministry of Priests, is like the
Burial of Dogs. <hi>And therefore what Burial this of Sir</hi> William

               <p>
                  <hi>But to return to our precious Reformers, who were
so hardned by the daily exercise of new out-rages; that
the Members at <hi>Westminster</hi> at length, for their credit,
though fit to have a total devastation of whatsoever was
comely in the Church, or decent for the service of God:
and this to be done by</hi> an Ordinance for abolishing of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
(<hi>for that was the Title of it) viz.</hi> that all represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
or sculptures in any Cathedral, Collegiate, or Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church,
or Chappel, or any other place within this Kingdom,
shall be defaced, and utterly demolished: and that all Organs;
the frames or cases wherein they stand in all Churches, and
Chappels, shall be utterly defaced: And that the Chancel-ground
of every Church, or Chappel, raised for any Communion-Table
to stand on, shall be levelled with the ground: And that no Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisses,

more used within the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In accomplishment of which Ordinance, Sir <hi>Robert

               </p>
               <p>And to prevent the future cost on God's House;
about that time, six thousand pounds which had been
Collected for the Rebuilding of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church in
<hi>Holborn,</hi> was seized on by these great Reformers:
and four hundred pounds taken out of the Hospital at
<hi>Guilford</hi> in <hi>Surrey</hi> (which was the whole stock of their
Treasure) and imploy'd to promote the Rebellion.</p>

Mr. <hi>Nye, Alexander Henderson,</hi> and others of that seditious
Tribe, then exercising their gifts, in extemporary Prayers,
and Preaching.</p>
               <p>And, that there might be nothing wanting, to make
odious the Orthodox Glergy of the Realm, and to enrage
the People against them (as heretofore the Enemies of
the Gospel did those holy Martyrs, whom they clothed
in the Skins of Wild-beasts, to animate Dogs to worry
them) they caused a most Libellous Pamphlet,<note n="*" place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor M. <hi>Iehn White,</hi> a Member of the Long Parliament.</note> against

work; that, in short time (as their Chairman Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi>
reported)<note n="t" place="margin">17. May. 1641.</note> they had got in nine hundred Petitions
against such Ministers.</p>
               <p>I do here omit to make mention of the particular
Imprisonments, Plundrings, and other oppressions,
exercised by them, towards most of our greatest and

would not make better discharge of their Duty, in the defence
of Religion, Laws, and Liberties</hi> (for so they term'd this

               </p>
               <p>In Testimony whereof, certain Troopers, of Popish

why they would serve against the King: answered, <hi>that
it was all one for Point of Religion: but only if they served the
King, they could not be permitted an open excercise of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,

               </p>
               <p>But, as to this Point of assistance from those <hi>Walloons,</hi> and
others of the <hi>Romish</hi>-Religion, let us hearken to a witness
without exception; <hi>viz. Robert Mentet de Salmonet,</hi> by
Birth a Scotchman, of good extraction; and a secular
Priest of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> who hath, in French,
written a well esteem'd History<note n="*" place="margin">Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in Fol. 1661.</note> of our late civil Wars,

                     <pb n="564" facs="tcp:48510:194"/>That which did the most

that they found amongst the

although in their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they called the King's

to render it odious to the

                  </gap>liaments urging and pressing that false and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
imputation of his favouring, and imploying many of
that Religion in his Army, saith thus:</p>
               <p>For our affection to that Religion, our continual practise,
our constant profession, and several protestations will satisfy all
the World; against which Malice and Treason it self cannot find
the least probable objection. We wish from our heart the Zeal
and affection of these Men to the true <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>
were as apparent as ours. For the imploying Men of that Religion,
in our present service in the Army, whosoever considers the
hardness and straights, the malice and fury of these Men have driven
us to; their stopping all passages, and ways, that neither Men or Money
might come to us; their declaring all such to be Traytors, who
shall assist us; their entertaining Men of all Countries, all Religions
to serve against us, would not wonder if we had been very well
contented to have received the Service and Assistance of any of
our good Subjects, who had Loyalty enough, (whatsoever their
Religion is) to bring them to our succour.</p>
               <p>All Men know the great number of Papists which serve in
their Army, Commanders and others: the great industry they
have used to corrupt the loyalty and affection of all our Subjects
of that Religion: the private promises and undertakings they
have made to them; that if they would assist them against us,
all the Laws made in their prejudice should be repealed. Yet,
neither the weakness of our own condition, nor the other Arts
used against us, could prevail with us to invite those of that
Religion to come to our succour, or to recal our Proclamation
which forbad them so to do: and we are confident tho we know
of some few, whose eminent Abilities in Command and Conduct,
and moderate and unfactious dispositions, hath moved us, in this

great necessity, to imploy them in this service) that a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

in our own; and we do assure our good Subjects, tho as we
shall always remember the particular Services which particular Men
have or shall, in this exigent of ours perform to us, with that
grace and bounty, which becomes a just Prince: Yet we shall be
so far from ever giving the least countenance or encouragement
to that Religion, that we shall always use our utmost endeavour
to suppress it by the execution of those good and wholsome Laws,

               <p>And now, whilst I mention this overthrow, I cannot
omit the notice of a passage somewhat remarkable:
which was, that the day of that great and absolute defeat,
the Rebels in <hi>Gloucesler,</hi> held one of their solemn
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:48510:196"/>
counterfait Thanksgivings, for a feigned Victory, which
they pretended (to abuse the People) that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
had at <hi>Landsdowne</hi> upon the fifth day of the same
Month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another of their Lectures in <hi>Southampton,</hi> pray'd
thus;</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Aug.</note> Bless the King, O Lord, mollify his hard heart, that
delighteth in blood: Open his Eyes, that he may see, that the
blood of the Saints is dear in thy sight. He is fallen from
faith in thee, and become an enemy to thy Church. Is it not He,
that hath sinned and done evil indeed? but as for these sheep,
what have they done? Let thme hand, we pray thee, O Lord our
God, be on him, and on his Father's House; but not on thy
People, that they should be plagued. <hi>And another blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
fellow,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Robinson 25. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in his Prayer there, on their Fast-day,
said thus:</hi> O God, O God, many are the hands lift up against us,
but there is one God; it is thou they self, O Father, who doest us
more mischief then they all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for</hi> Preaching, <hi>observe the Doctrine of one</hi> Kendal

ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of
God? <hi>First, that by Kingdom of God, in this place was
meant</hi> the Kingdom of Christ upon Earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that
<hi>England</hi> was no true Church. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were Children of wrath.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> that at the day of Iudgment, Christ would give up
all power to his Father; and would himself become a Subject.</p>
               <p>And, such as did not <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> after this fashion,
were cavill'd withall, expell'd, or committed to Prison:
as one was by <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> (sent to <hi>Newgate</hi>) for singing
a <hi>Malignant Psalm.</hi> Another committed to that Prison
which they made of the Lord <hi>Peter</hi>'s House in <hi>Alders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>

Malignant Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed with some other particulars of their
<hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermons:</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> Preacher of St. <hi>Clements</hi>
without <hi>Temple-Barr,</hi> expostulated thus with God; <hi>O Lord,
when wilt thou take a Chair and sit amongst the House of Peers?</hi>
And <hi>when, O God, when, I say, wilt thou Vote amongst the
Honourable Commons? thine own Commons, who are so zealous
for thine Honour?</hi> And in his Sermon before the Earl of
<hi>Essex</hi> (then their General) on the Fast-day,<note n="e" place="margin">29. Sept. 1643.</note> he thus
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:48510:196"/>
exhorted the People, <hi>Beloved, can you forget the Souldiers?
I say the Souldiers, who have spent their blood for Christ, as
Christ did for them; even their own precious blood in God's cause
at <hi>Newbery.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Mr.</hi> Colman, <hi>in his Exhortation-Sermon to the
Army, for taking the</hi> Covenant, <hi>told them,</hi> That the
<hi>Covenant</hi> was the Parliament's Sword and Buckler. For when
(<hi>said he</hi>) the Cavaliers shall see you come Armed with a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
they will run, run, run from the presence of the Lord
of Hosts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the behalf of which <hi>Covenant</hi> Mr.</hi> Nye, <hi>in a set
Speech told the People,</hi> that as God did swear for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Men, and of Kingdoms: So Kingdoms must now
swear for the preservation, and salvation of Kingdoms, to establish,
a Saviour Iesus Christ in <hi>England. For this it was, that
one of the Lord</hi> Say<hi>'s Tenants (a Lay-Preacher</hi>
at <hi>Brouton</hi> near <hi>Banbury) cryed out in his Prayer,</hi>
we know O Lord, that <hi>Abraham</hi> made a Covenant, and <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> made a Covenant, and our Saviour made a Covenant;
but thy Parliaments Covenant is the greatest of all Covenants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This it was that ushered in the</hi> Scots, <hi>for whose Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
these their Preachers so much laboured; Mr.</hi> Bond
<hi>at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> telling them in the Pulpit;</hi> that they ought
to contribute and Pray, and to do all that they were able, to bring
in their Brethren of <hi>Scotland, for the setling of God's
cause.</hi> I say (<hi>quoth he</hi>) this is God's cause: and if our God
had any cause, this is it. And if this be not God's cause then
God is no God for me; but the Devil is got up into Heaven.</p>

               <p>And Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> (Collonel <hi>Purefoy</hi>'s Chaplain) said in

                  </hi> And <hi>Lorkyn,</hi> a seditious Lecturer

Provision for Dinner: and when the Clarke desired them

               <p>In a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>-Sermon Preacht before the Members
of Parliament 2. <hi>Apr. Anno</hi> 1646. by <hi>Ioseph Carril,</hi> one
of their Assembly of Divines, upon this Text; <hi>Iudges
Cap. 10. Vers. 11, 12. Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians?</hi>
He told his Auditory; <hi>Here is nothing but the bare name of
Deliverances, and seven in number; so many have you received
from me saith the Lord.</hi> As if we should write now; the
Battel of <hi>Kineton,,</hi> one; the Battel of <hi>Newbery,</hi> two;
the Battel of <hi>Chereton-down,</hi> three; at <hi>Marston-More,</hi>
four; at <hi>Navesby,</hi> five; at <hi>Langport,</hi> fix; at
<hi>Torington,</hi> seven; and the Disbanding of the late
Army in the West, which may go for many Victories.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cradock,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Nun-Eaton,</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi>
used this expression<note n="k" place="margin">Sunday 1. Aug. 1647.</note> in his Prayer; <hi>O Lord do not thou
stand a Newter; but take one side, that we may see which it is,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:48510:197"/>
that is thy cause.</hi> And, at a Fast<note n="l" place="margin">22. Dec. 1648.</note> kept by both Houses
of Parliament, at St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Westminster, <hi>Hugh
Peters,</hi> Preaching of bringing the Children out of Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Bondage, to which he parallell'd the state of this
Kingdom; to shew how they should be brought out of
this Bondage, he put his hands before his Eyes, and laid
down his Head for a space on the Cusheon; and then
pretended a <hi>Revelation;</hi> that it must be by extirpating of
Monarchy, hear, and in all other places.</p>
               <p>And now, to close up all, let us here some of Mr. <hi>Feake</hi>'s
expressions, Preaching at Black-Friers, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1653.
when our late great Masters were at Wars with the
Dutch.</p>
               <p>—But you'l say, the Dutch will recruit again,<note place="margin">Aug. 8.</note> and the
Princes of the World will assist them: for my part I do not see
one Prince or State that offers to help them: but if they should
all joyn, and lay their Crowns and Scepters together, it is that
Christ may cut off their Heads at a blow, and get himself the
more Honour. All the Angels in heaven cannot make peace
between Christ and the World. If the Devil, the Turk, and
the People, should think to compound with Christ, and say,
Thou Christ, thou shalt have so many Kingdoms, and let us
enjoy the rest quietly: Christ will never do it; he will have all
or none; he will either kill or be kill'd.</p>
               <p>—<hi>Again;</hi> I profess Saints we must go lay our heads together,
and consult what we shall ask God next, for he will give us
whatsoever we ask, and so he hath done these seven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi>
                  </hi> Aug. 11.—I will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(<hi>said he</hi>) that this Navy was made purposely for the
breaking of our Neighbours in pieces; and there an end: we
shall at last joyn together, and do such work for God, as was
never done in the World. We shall carry the Gospel with our
Navy up and down to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and afterwards we shall
gather home the <hi>Jews;</hi> out of the Isles first; for those of them
shall first be called, and the Ships of <hi>Tharsis</hi> shall do it.
Beloved what this <hi>Tharsis</hi> is, I have made a little search;
but I shall enquire farther. They it seems shall be the first
Active; and I am sure there is none in such forwardness as ours
at present. The late Parliament, they set their hands to the work,
then they job'd on again; did a little and then stood still again.
Now we have got a company of Men together, which are indeed
Godly Men; but they are Men of too narrow and low Spirits to do
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:48510:198"/>
Gods work. You see they have all this while been lifting at Tythes,
and cannot pluck them up for their lives: God himself must
be fain to put to his Hand.</p>
               <p>—We must agree together, to ask something new for Iesus
Christ; for we have enough for our selves already: we have
Pence enough; Prosperity enough, and enough of every thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Also at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi>
                  </hi> Aug. 29.—Divers of our
Friends will say, come let us sit still now, and we may have a
great deal of quiet, and calm: we shall enjoy our pleasant Orchards,
live upon our purchased revenues, and sit under our Vines, and
Fig-trees; only let us be content and stir no farther. Beloved,
do not let us listen to them; but tell them, if they can go no
farther, so 'tis: for our parts we have a farther word of God,
which burns within us like fire, and bids us go on still. We
did not at first believe for King's Lands; nor for a Mannour of
Deans and Chapters; but we believ'd that Iesus Christ should be
set up in his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi>
                  </hi> Sept. 5.—O Lord, when shall
we hear the sound of Christ's Horse-heels?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi>
                  </hi> Sept. 11.—Thou gavest a Cup
into the hand of <hi>England;</hi> and we drank of it. Then thou
carried'st it to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and they dronk of
it. Now thou hast carried it to <hi>Holland,</hi> and they are drinking
of it: Lord carry it also to <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to
<hi>Rome;</hi> and let it never be out of one or other of their hands,
till they drink, and be drunk, and spue; and fall, and never
rise any more:</p>
               <p>—Let us be Active against the Kings and Princes of the
Earth, those Limbs and Claws of the cruel Beast.</p>
               <p>In Order to the trayning up of more such Boutefeus;
soon after His Majesties Garrison of <hi>Oxford</hi> was delivered
up to the Parliaments General, divers of their chief Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were sent<note n="*" place="margin">Mense Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii <hi>An.</hi> 1646 Hist. &amp; Ant. Univer. <hi>Oxon</hi> p. 367. b.</note> down to that University, to instill the
Principles of Presbytery into the Students there; as also to
initiate them in such long winded Prayers before Sermon,
with the like Canting Terms, as are usually practised
by their own precise Gang. And, after these seasonable
Preparations, imployed<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p. 370. 371. &amp;c.</note> a number of confiding Persons
(part Clergy, part Lay) as Visitors of the several Colleges
and Halls there; with Authority to any five of them
to expell all those Masters and Fellows, which either
refused to take the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Negative
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:48510:198"/>
Oath,</hi> or to submit to that holy <hi>Discipline</hi> contained in their
new <hi>Directory</hi> for Worship: by which means they made a
clear riddance of a Multitude of <hi>Orthodox</hi> Men, whose Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Piety had worthily rendred them of high esteem
both here and in Foreign Parts.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 379. <hi>An.</hi> 1648.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The like did they in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Committing some
to strict Imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Of these Famous Preachers, it is not unworthy Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that divers of them were of the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi>
whom <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (the Parliament's General)
stiled <hi>the Chariots and Horse-Men of</hi> Israel.</p>
               <p>With the like Countenance also, their Preachers did
<hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> thus they did Write and Print; Witness
their Pamphlets justifying the <hi>Mortality of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Divorce,</hi> with many others of the like strain: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that the very <hi>Scots</hi> themselves began to cry out, as
is manifest from those Papers<note n="m" place="margin">Published by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Oct. 1645. pag.</hi> 20.</note> exhibited by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to the two Houses at <hi>Westminster:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—No Man (<hi>said they</hi>) can be so destitute of Sense and Reason,
as to think such an Anarchy and Confusion, as now prevails over the
Churches of this Kingdom, to be the Ordinance of God. No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
can be so void of knowledge and Faith, as to imagine such a
monstrous deformity to be the beauty and glory of the Kingdom
of Christ on Earth.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I shall add the Report of Mr. <hi>Thomas Edwards;</hi>
one of their own Ministers of the Gospel (as he stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
in his Epistle Dedicatory to the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then sitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> prefixed before his <hi>book</hi>
Intituled <hi>the Gangrena;</hi> containing a Catalogue of many
of the Errors, Heresies, Blasphemies, and pernicious practises
of the Sectaries of that time, vented and acted in <hi>England,</hi>
within the compass of 4 years; <hi>viz.</hi> from 1642. till 1646.</p>
               <p>I am one (saith he) who, out of choice and judgment have imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my self, with Wife, Children, Estate, and all that's dear to me, in
the same Ship with you, to sink and perish, or to come safe to Land
with you; and that in the most doubtful and difficult times: not
only early, in the first beginning of the War and Troubles, in a
Malignant place; among Courtiers, and those who were Servants,
and had Relation to the King, Queen and their Children; pleading
your Cause, justifying your Wars; satis fying many that scrupled.
But, when your affairs were at lowest, and the chance of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you; and some of the Grandees and Favourites of these
times, were packing up and ready to be gone; I was then highest
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:48510:199"/>
and most zealous for you; Preaching, Praying, stirring up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to stand for you, by going out in Person, lending of Money: in
the latter, going before them by Example. And as I have been your
Honours most devoted Servant, so am I still yours, and you cannot
easily lose me.</p>
               <p>Having given thus fair a Character of himself; let us
now hear him tell what a Blessed Reformation they had
in so short a time as four Years produced:</p>
               <p>—Things every day (<hi>saith he</hi>) grow worse and worse, you can
hardly conceive or imagin them so bad as they are. No kind of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
Heresie, Disorder, and Confusion, but it is found among us,
or coming in upon us. For we, instead of Reformation, are grown
from one extreme to another; fallen from <hi>Scylla</hi> to <hi>Charibdis;</hi>
from Popish Innovations, Superstitions, and prelatical Tyranny, to
damnable Heresies, horrid Blasphemies, Libertinisme, and fearful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
Our evils are not removed and cured, but only changed. One
disease and Devil hath left us, and another as bad is come in the
room. Yea, this last extremity into which we are fallen, is far more
high, violent and dangerous in many respects, &amp;c.—Have we not a
deformation and worse things come in upon us, than ever we had
before? were any of those Monsters heard of heretofore, which are
now Common among us, and denying the Scriptures, &amp;c.—You have
broken down the Images of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Apostles;
and we have those, who overthrow the Doctrine of the Trinity;
oppose the Divinity of Christ; speak evil of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and
slight the Apostles—You have cast out the Bishops and their Officers;
and we have many that cast down to the ground all Ministers, in all
the Reformed Churches. You have cast out Ceremonies in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the Cross, kneeling at the Lords Supper: And we have
many, who cast out the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
You have put down Saints Days; and we have many, who
make nothing at all of the Lords Day, and Fast-days.</p>
               <p>You have taken away the superfluous excessive maintenance of
Bishops and Deans; and we have many that take away, and
cry down the necessary maintenance of Ministers. In the Bishops
Days we had singing of Psalms taken away in some places,
conceived Prayer, and Preaching; and, in their room, Anthems,
stinted forms, and Reading brought in. And now we have
singing of Psalms spoken against, and cast out of some Churches.
Yea, all publick Prayer questioned, and all Ministerial Preaching
denied. In the Bishops time, Popish Innovations were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as bowing at Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now we have Anointing the
Sick with Oyl. Then we had Bishopping of Children, now we have
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:48510:199"/>
Bishopping of Men and Women, by strange laying on of Hands.

wherein God is to be Served and Worshipped, is accounted a kind
of</hi> Popery, <hi>and as proceeding from an Idolatrous Disposition,
in so much as time would soon bring to pass (if it were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted)
that God would be turned out of Churches into Barnes,

(said he, whispering to one or two of them) <hi>if you have
any thing left, 'tis your best course to Convey it away quickly;
for the Parliament hath Commanded me to take all I can carry, and
burn up the rest, before the King comes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These and the like, as by many Instances might be
made apparent, have been their Practises, in violating
the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> with the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of
the Subject, however Fair and Specious, their Promises
were otherwise, until they had got Power into their
hands, being at length not ashamed to discover their full
Intentions, by those <hi>Propositions,</hi> which they tendred to His
Majesty at <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon the 23d. of <hi>November,</hi> 1644.
And whereupon a <hi>Treaty</hi> was had at <hi>Uxbridge.</hi> Where
it was judiciously observ'd<note n="m" place="margin">A full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Passages concerning the Treaty. p. 153.</note> by his Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners;
<hi>That, after a War of near three Years, for which the
Defence of the</hi> Protestant Religion, the Liberty, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Subject, and the Priviledges of Parliament,
<hi>were made the cause and Grounds; in a Treaty of full twenty days;
nor indeed in the whole Propositions, upon which the Treaty should
be; there was nothing offered to be treated on, concerning the
Breach of any Law; or of the Liberty, or Property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or Priviledge of Parliament: but only Propositions for the
altering a Government Established by Law; and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of new Laws; by which all the old were or might be Cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
there being nothing insisted upon, on the part of his Majesties
Commissioners, which was not Laws; or denied by them, that the other
demanded as due by Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next and last particular,<note place="margin">Their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for which they made such
great Pretences, is the <hi>Priviledge of Parliaments.</hi> Having
therefore under that colour justified most of their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions; let us take notice how consonant to Justice,
Reason, or common Honesty, their Practices upon this
point have been.</p>
               <p>Did they not, soon after the beginning of that Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Parliament (without any president) found<note n="n" place="margin">11. Nov. 1640.</note> a <hi>Close-Committee,</hi>
consisting of eight persons,<note place="margin">Anno. 1641.</note> whereof no less
than seven were principal Contrivers of the ensuing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?
And in the business of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> was

not their Bill for his attainder, twice<note n="o" place="margin">19. Apr.</note> read and voted

taking notice of a Malignant Faction, which made Abortive
all their good Motions: Desiring that those Noble Worthies of
the House of Peers, who concurred with them, in their happy
Votes, might be earnestly desired to join with that Honourable
House, and to sit and Vote together, as one entire Body? <hi>And
professing,</hi> that unless some speedy Remedy were taken, for the
removing of all such Obstacles, as hindred the happy Progress of
their great endeavour, the Petitioners should not rest in quietness;
but should be forc'd to lay hold on the next Remedy, at hand, to
remove the Disturbers of their Peace. And (Want and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
breaking the Bounds of Modesty) not to leave any means
unessayed for their Relief: <hi>Adding;</hi> that the cry of the Poor
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:48510:204"/>
and Needy, was, that such persons who were the Obstacles of their
peace, and the hinderers of the happy proceedings of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
might be forthwith publickly declared, whose removal would
put a period to those Distractions.</p>
               <p>Which Petition, being brought up by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
unto the Lords at a conference; a Member of the

to joyn with them in their desire about the <hi>Militia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing;
<hi>That if their desire were not assented to; those Lords,
who were willing to concur, would find some means to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

end they might notifie it unto those which sent them.</hi>

               <p>To proceed: Was not the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Voted
<note n="c" place="margin">27. Jan.</note> by the Commons, <hi>an evil Councellor to his Majesty, one
of the Malignant-Party, and not fit to bear Office or place of

Charge against him;</hi> and all this for no other, than moving
in the House of Lords, that the Parliament might be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorn'd
for six Months. And Mr. <hi>Gamull</hi> (Burgess for the
City of <hi>Chester</hi>) told him, <hi>that if he left not the Town speedily,
he should be Committed to the Tower, or knockt on the head by the
Souldiers?</hi> And when an Order was reported, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the House, hath it not been, only, put to the
<hi>Question,</hi> without any debate thereon; and publickly
said, in the House, to those who have taken Exceptions
thereat; <hi>that they were only to Vote, and not to Dispute?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was not Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> Committed<note n="d" place="margin">4. Martij.</note> to the Tower,

Also Serjeant <hi>Hide</hi> Voted<note n="e" place="margin">4. Aug. 1642.</note> to be Expelled, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>Did they not Impeach, and Commit divers Lords to
the Tower, for not Concurring with them in these their
Irrational and most Unjust Doings? And, when it was
moved that they might be Bailed; was it not answered;
<note n="g" place="margin">4. Aug. 1643.</note> 
                  <hi>That there would be no Sitting for them if those Lords were
Released, and Restored to the freedom of their Votes again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when the Members of the House of Commons,
had upon a solemn Debate,<note n="h" place="margin">5. Aug. 1643.</note> agreed to join with the
Lords, in sending <hi>Propositions for Peace</hi> to his Majesty;
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:48510:205"/>
were there not Printed Papers, the next day, scattered in
the Streets, and fixed upon Posts in publick places, in the
City and Suburbs; <hi>requiring all Well-Affected persons to rise as
one Man, and to come to the House of Commons next Morning, for
that Twenty thousand</hi> Irish-<hi>Rebels were Landed?</hi> And was
not Direction and Information given in the Pulpits, by
their Seditious-Preachers; and in some of those Papers,
Exprest; <hi>that the Malignant Party had over-Voted the good;
and if not prevented there would be Peace?</hi> The <hi>Propositions</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">7. Aug.</note>
for Peace, (the Day before) being carried by twenty nine
Voices. Whereupon multitudes, by the Instigation of
Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> came, in a most tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with Threats and Menaces to divers of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses; and said, <hi>that their Petition tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Propositions, passed by the Lords for Peace; which, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
would be destructive to Religion, Laws, and Liberties:</hi>
many of them telling the Members, <hi>that if they had not a
good Answer, they would be there the next Day with double the
Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when it was moved,<note n="k" place="margin">2. Martij.</note> that the two Sir <hi>Iohn
Evelins</hi> should be Discharg'd from Prison (being Members
of the House) and thereupon the House dividing LXXI.
standing for their Enlargement, and LXV. against it;
were not divers called out of the Committee-Chamber,
who neither heard the Debate nor Vote; and because the
LXXI. Opposed their entrance; did not the LXV. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the Speaker to pronounce any Order therein. Lastly,
did not the Commons Vote<note n="l" place="margin">May. 1644.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Committee of both
Kingdoms should proceed as they did, for three Months longer;
though the Lords refused to consent thereto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many more Instances of this nature might be given,
but I shall for brevities sake pass them by, and descend to
some; where the Lords, after they had freely passed their
Votes, were, by the prevalent Party in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(contrary to all course and usage in Parliament)
constrain'd to yield unto what they had, upon free and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Debate, resolv'd against.</p>
               <p>In the Case of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Lords first Voted,<note n="m" place="margin">7. Junij. 1641.</note>
                  <hi>that they should retain their Voices in Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For taking the <hi>Protestation</hi> throughout the Kingdom, the
Lords first cast<note n="n" place="margin">30. July. 1641.</note> out the Order. And notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Declaration,</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">9. Sept. 1641.</note> for the due Observance
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:48510:205"/>
of the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> the Commons made and
set forth a contrary Order<note n="p" place="margin">28. Sept. 1641.</note> thereto; appointing it to
be dispersed and published in all the Churches throughout
the Kingdom. Likewise, though the Lords refused<note n="q" place="margin">25. Jan. 1641.</note>
to joyn with the Commons for Petitioning his Majesty
that the <hi>Cinque-Ports</hi> might be secured: Yet<note n="r" place="margin">2. Apr. 1642.</note> were they
afterwards by terror constrain'd thereto. So Likewise,
though they refused to join with them in their consent for
removing the King's Magazine from <hi>Hull;</hi> yet, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

the King had put down Bishops and Cathedrals at first, we
would have given him all their Lands: But should he do
it now, we would not give him any of their Revenues. For
we must have both Church-Lands and Delinquents Estates also;

cannot but take notice of a Memorable Accident;
First, That, whereas the <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi>-men, were
the first of all the Counties in this Kingdom, that came
in a Tumultuous manner to <hi>Westminster, 11 Ian.</hi>
1641. with a Petition, on the behalf of the Lord

<hi>Uxbridge,</hi> in great Numbers, for that purpose;
were by Authority of the Commissioners there, from

a Pattern of ours in <hi>England,</hi> as we
have just reason enough to conceive, that
the Contrivers of this Rebellion, did
borrow the Plott from thence. All the
main parts, and many of the Material
Circumstances, being the same in both: Only the Scene
is changed and the Actors divers.</p>
               <p>The full Story of that League, would require a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
having been written at large by several Authors of
note in sundry Languages; <hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>Thuanus</hi> in <hi>Latine;</hi> by
<hi>D'aubigny</hi> and others in <hi>French:</hi> But by none better than
<hi>Caterino D'avila</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> in that unparallell'd History of
the Civil-Wars of <hi>France:</hi> Out of whose relation especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I shall present to the Reader, a brief view of so much
as concerns our present purpose, without filling the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
with Attestations from other Authors, where they
concur with him: Aud but rarely making use of them
by way of Supplement.</p>
               <p>In the draught of this Parallel, I shall endeavour to
observe the same method as in the former: First laying
down the Original of that <hi>League:</hi> Then the manner, by
which the Faction grew to that heigth of greatness, as
they quite overtop'd and almost trampled upon the
Crown. What use they made of this Usurped Power,
quite contrary to their Pretences: And, lastly, how they
fell from their vast hopes, and failed of their Ambitious
ends. As also, by the way take notice of some such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Persons, and Circumstances, as may seem to have
the neerest Resemblance with these of our times.</p>
               <p>What hath been already observ'd of the main design of
our <hi>Covenanters; viz.</hi> That it was long a working under
ground, before it appeared in its true shape of <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
That the first Seeds of it were sown in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi>
time; grew up in K. <hi>Iames;</hi> and came to perfect ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in K. <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, is proportionably true of the
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:48510:212"/>
                  <hi>Holy-League.</hi> The first Platform of that, was laid in the
time of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, soon after the <hi>Reformation of
Religion</hi> got footing in <hi>France.</hi> It broke out in K. <hi>Henry</hi>
the third's time; and was, at last, suppressed by K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth: So that it infested the Reigns of three Kings,
no less than this of ours.</p>
               <p>The cheif pretended occasion of it, was the <hi>defence of
Religion;</hi>
which, the Ring-Leaders of that Faction, did
(if not conceive themselves, yet) labour to perswade
the People to be in danger of utter Ruine, and Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And, that, by reason of some Indulgence and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Davila.</hi> p. 75.</note> granted by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and the Queen
Mother, and continued by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, unto the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
or <hi>Protestants,</hi> who were as odious to them, as
<hi>Papists</hi> were with our Men: though, the truth was those
Princes did as intirely detest the Religion of <hi>Protestants,</hi>
as the most zealous among ours, can do the <hi>Papists:</hi> And
what they did in favour of them, was meerly to preserve
the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Before the <hi>League</hi> was fully hatch't, the State of that
Kingdom was not much unlike this of ours, before the
late Troubles. Some Grievances there were, which
waited upon it into the World. For besides the Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> which distasted the Zealots; the
<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 348.</note> greatness of some new Men at Court, bred an high
discontent in divers of the Nobility: And the heavy
Taxes,<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 349.</note> and Impositions upon the Common-People,
made them generally dissaffected with the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And this Variety of Malignant Humors rising
from several Springs, all met in the same Stream, and
bent their course to the same common end, Innovation,
and Subversion of the Establish't Government.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Parliament</hi> (for so I shall take leave to call the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Assembly of the three Estates in <hi>France,</hi> not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the modern use of the Word in that Country from
whence this Kingdom borrowed at first, the name and

thought to be a sure Remedy at a pinch for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etling the

been long intermitted in that Realm, and the Kings of

                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ib. p. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>that while they, who represent the whole Nation, are
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48510:213"/>
convened together with such Supream Power, the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in the mean time, remained little better than suspended.</hi> Yet,
upon a consultation had with a Council of Peers (like that
of ours at <hi>York</hi>) and a motion from them to that
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">Anno. 1560.</note>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> the second was content to call a Parliament
<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 51.</note> at <hi>Drleans,</hi> which was quietly Dissolved by his
Death, before the States had done any thing, but only
shew'd<note n="f" place="margin">Ib. p. 52.</note> their Teeth against the Protestants; taking
<note n="g" place="margin">Ib. p. 57.</note> a solemn Protestation for Defence of their Religion;
and by that excluding all others from any Vote in that
Assembly.</p>
               <p>By the like exigence was <hi>Henry</hi> the third driven to have
recourse to the like Remedy, which proved (indeed)
worse than the Disease: For after his Intimation of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to Commence at<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 324. 15. Nov. 1576.</note> 
                  <hi>Bloys,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
and his Allies, laid the Foundation of the <hi>League;</hi> who
being the most Popular and Powerful Subjects in the
Kingdome, sought<note n="i" place="margin">Ib. p. 325.</note> by that means <hi>to augment their own
greatness, and secure the State of Religion, which was so strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
twisted with their Interests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Duke, besides his Ambition, which prompted him
sufficiently to those Turbulent Undertakings, has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received some disgust at Court, (not much unlike that
of <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>) for the Keys of the Pallace
were taken<note n="k" place="margin">Ib. p. 71.</note> from him, and bestow'd upon the King
of <hi>Navarr.</hi> With which disgrace he was extreamly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and his Brother the Cardinal much more, though
they cunningly Dissembled, and made a shew as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubled them, but the Toleration of and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence
at <hi>Calvinisme;</hi> by that means veiling their own Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Private Interests, with an honest Cloak, and
colour of Religion. So, by little and little, the Factious
among the great ones were confounded with the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Religion; and instead of <hi>Male-Contents,</hi> and <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sards,</hi>
they put on the name of <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Huguenots;</hi>
Parties, which under colour of Piety, ministred so much
the more Pernicious Fewel to all the Succeeding Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and Troubles.</p>
               <p>The League was ushered in with <hi>Declarations, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,</hi>
and <hi>Protestations,</hi> to the same effect, and much in

his Majesties Service, the Publick Peace and Preservation

us to this Resolution, which we are constrained to put on;

Errors in the Kingdom; to extirpate Religion, and by little and
little to undermine the King's Authority, and totally alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
we can do no less in discharge of our Honours and
Consciences, than withstand the Sinister Designs of the Supream
Enemies of God, and his Majesty by a common <hi>Covenant</hi> and

               <p>The chief Heads of the League, to which they swore,
were either altogether, or in Proportion the same with
those in our <hi>English Covenants,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>1. To Establish<note n="n" place="margin">Ib. col. 830. Et Davila p. 327.</note> Religion, the Law and Service of God,

Roman-Church (there, as of the Protestant Reformed-Church
here.)</p>
               <p>2. As our Covenanters swore, in the second Article, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all <hi>Popery, Heresy,</hi> &amp;c. So did the <hi>Leaugers</hi> Renounce
<note n="o" place="margin">Ibid.</note> and abjure all Errors contrary to their Religion.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>As our Men, in the third Article, swore to preserve

of the Kingdom; and to preserve the King's Person
and Authority (but with a Reservation)</hi> in the Preservation

God and the World, their unfeigned desire to be bumbled for
them, and to amend their Lives in all Duties they owe to God and
Man; and each one to go before another in the example of a real
Conuersation; and likewise invite other Christian-Churches to
joyn in the same, or like Association and Covenant with them. <hi>So
did the Leaguers in the close of their Declaration,</hi> intreat

assist them in the Execution of so good and holy a work: Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
they will receive into their Association, all good Men, that have
a Zeal to the Honour of God and his Church, and to the Welfare
and Reputation of Religion. <hi>Concluding thus;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Seeing of necessity all our help must come from God, we intreat
all good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> to put themselves in good condition to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and be Reconciled to his Divine Majesty by a thorough
Reformation of their Lives, so to appease the Wrath of God, and
to call upon him with an upright Conscience, both in publick and
private Prayers, and Devotions; to the end that all our Actions
may be referred to the Honour of God and his Glory, who is the
Lord of Hosts, and from whom alone we look for strength, and
certain deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Parliament at <hi>Bloys,</hi> though at the first
meeting, it seem'd to concurr in the same intentions with
the King; yet the effect was nothing less: For it was an
Assembly packt up of Persons dissaffected to the present
Government; the</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ib. p. 335.</note> greatest part of the Commissioners of
Shires, being such as had underhand Subscribed the League, and
had given themselves up, to be guided by the Councils of the
Duke of <hi>Guise. Besides the Knights or Commissioners
of divers Counties, and the Burgesses of several Cities,
were either not returned, or neglected to come, or were
departed: And therefore the Prince of</hi> Conde, <hi>when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their Members were sent unto him, with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:48510:215"/>
in Writing, as from the States-general, or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he</hi> refused<note n="x" place="margin">Ib. p. 339.</note> to open the Letters, or to acknowledge
them to be a Parliament; affirming, that such a Congregation
as that, where the Commissioners of so many Cities, Shires, and
Counties were wanting; in which they went about to force Mens
Consciences, to Oppress and Extirpate the Total Line, and Violate
the Prerogative of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to comply with the
Humours of some Strangers, whose Hearts were set on Fire
with an unsupportable, and Pernicious Ambition, could by no
means be call'd a Parliament; being indeed nothing else but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
of a few Suborned Persons, corrupted by the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the publick Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we consider the quality of the Persons engaged in
that League, we shall find them much of the same make
with these of ours. They were principally of two much
different sorts;</hi> the first,<note n="y" place="margin">Ib. p. 329. &amp; 367.</note> for the most part, consisted of
Noblemen, and Persons of Quality; such as were ill satisfied
with the Power and greatness of the King's Dominion, and
could not endure to see themselves past by, in the disposal of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
and Court-Favours; and therefore sided with the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
partly out of discontent, and partly out of hopes of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thinking, that by putting down the present, that they should
raise their private Fortunes to a better condition; and at last ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to the height of their Desires.</p>
               <p>The second sort<note n="z" place="margin">Ib. p. 396.</note> whereof the League was Composed, were
Persons, who for Quality seemed to be much inferior to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
but for use and profit were not a whit below them. For
these were they that won the Cities, the common People, and the
Tradesmen, generally over all the Kingdom. These, for the most
part, were Men of a free and good nature, passionately affected
to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and most intestine haters of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots:</hi>
Some of them believing in good earnest, that their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was in danger of utter Ruine. Other desirous to see the
destruction of <hi>Heresy,</hi> did not only readily engage themselves in
the League in their own Persons, but contributed their utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to draw on the common People, and to win others to the
Faction. With these fell on (as a third sort) some of the long
Robe (Preachers and Lawyers) who, under colour of Religion,
did hide either their fickle and inconstant nature, or their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
or Covetous Desires of their own Greatness and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="607" facs="tcp:48510:215"/>
To which we may add a fourth sort of Men; which
were moved, either out of private Spleen against some
Court-Favourites; or were drawn in, to side with the
<hi>League</hi> meerly upon their fair Pretences; never dreaming
that their aimes were against the King or the Government.
With which bait some Wise Men were allured into the
snare; among whom <hi>Villeroy</hi> the chief Secretary of State
was one, and <hi>Brissonius</hi> Primier President of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris,</hi> another, the former entring himself
one of the <hi>League, out</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. p. 487.</note> 
                  <hi>of a private grudge to the Duke</hi>
D'Espernon, <hi>desired the Duke of</hi> Guise's <hi>Faction might prevail,
that</hi> Espernons <hi>might be abated; never imagining, nor could
be ever believe, that the League would ever attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King's Person, but only had an aim to cashiere his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and endeavour to extirpate the</hi> Huguenots. <hi>The later,</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 796.</note> 
                  <hi>though he had been at first a principal Instrument for the
League, fell off, when he perceived, that the ends of the Ring-leaders
were not so sincere for the publick good, as he at first had
fancied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And divers other there were (as there will be in all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
where great Men are engaged) who adhered to
that Party; not out of any ends, or Inclinations of their
own, but by reason<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 518.</note> of their Alliance with, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on the House of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> and other chief Men
of the <hi>League.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus laid the grounds of their <hi>League</hi> upon
these fair Pretences to gull the People, their means of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
it were such, as our Men have transcribed from
their Copy: Not any thing of moment having been used
here, which was wanting there, to increase their own,
and undermine the King's Power and Authority. They
had<note n="d" place="margin">Ib. p. 385.</note> their <hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> of dangerous <hi>Plots</hi>
against their Persons at home;<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 494.</note> of Designs to seize upon
the City of <hi>Paris;</hi> to overawe them by armed force,
and put an hundred of the chief to Death; of Practises
with Forrein Princes against them and their Religion; and
of suddain Invasion intended from abroad. They had
Reports broacht<note n="f" place="margin">Ib. p. 457.</note> upon on grounds and Tumults<note n="g" place="margin">Ib. p. 482. &amp; 367. 379.</note>
raised in the City, upon no other occasion than those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.
They had their <hi>Preachers (h</hi>) to amaze and fright
the People out of their Witts, by Strange and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:48510:216"/>

of such a tenor, as it will be no new thing to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate

               <p>They wounded the King's Honour, through the sides
of his Councellers; they stained the sincerity of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and Protestations in point of Religion; they
went about to supplant his just Power and Authority, by
their new and insolent demands (such as those of ours in
the <hi>Nineteen Propositions.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Whil'st<note n="l" place="margin">Ib. p. 329.</note> they seem'd to maintain his Authority,

yet, they thought fit to Petition the King, that for the

to make use of such Council as time should Minister un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to justify himself, than to stop the Progress of the
Confederates. And, when he was assured from all parts,
at the same time, of raising Forces, and frequent meetings
of Men in Arms, he did no more than set forth an Edict;
<note n="n" place="margin">8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Martij.</hi> 1685.</note> wherein, after the usual Preamble, he protested his
earnest desire of the Publick Tranquility; and, by all

which, perceiving, that some who were Enemies of their

prohibited all Levies, and gathering together of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
Commanding that their Leaders should be Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and Prosecuted according to Law. By which
he gained no more but this; <hi>viz.</hi> That by the continuing
of their Levies, it did then sufficiently appear who were
his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Leaguers</hi> get the Start of the King, in
their warlike Prepations; and it was long before he
could perswade himself to prepare for his Defence: But
being at last necessitated<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. p. 382.</note> to make other Provisions
(than Proclamations) more sutable to the exigency of the
times;<note place="margin">Compare this with his Majesties Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. 1642. Exact Coll. p. 510.</note> after much doubting, and deliberation, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to resist the force and practises of the <hi>League,</hi> as well
as he could, without any Intelligence or Assistance from
the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> hoping that he should be able of himself
to curb them. But scarcely had he begun to put this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
in Execution, than that he discovered the
weakness of his Councils, in that of his Forces.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Truery</hi> had raised for him Ten Thousand
<hi>Switzers:</hi> But the Counties of <hi>Burgundy, Champaine,</hi> and
<hi>Lyouns,</hi> being all possess'd by them of <hi>League,</hi> there
was no passing for them that way. The Count of <hi>Scom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
was sent to hire some <hi>German</hi>-Horse; but in his passage
thither, through those Counties, he was seized on and
Committed to Prison by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Nor did
the Kings business go on much better at home than abroad:
The Nobility divided, partly by reason of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and partly by antient Feuds, (newly divided by these
Dissentions,) came but slowly in to the King. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:48510:218"/>
generally dissaffected, did not concur to the relief of
his wants: The Revenues of the Crown, not only stopt

so as the Sinews of War were wanting on all sides
to the Kings Party. Those of the <hi>League</hi> therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
with what difficulties the King wrestled; began
with great earnestness to gather Forces, and to put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
the Plot they had laid long before.</p>
               <p>The King having, as yet, nothing to oppose them but
his Pen, was necessitated to imploy it, in vindication of
himself from those Imputations, which were thrown
upon his Government, and in their <hi>Manifesto's</hi> reflected
upon his Person. To which he publisht an Answer<note n="q" place="margin">Ib. p. 390.</note>
wherein, having first inform'd his People; that though
he had several times heretofore, both by his Letters and
Commands; admonished them, not to suffer themselves
to be perswaded or perverted by such as endeavoured to
raise Insurrections amongst them, and to draw them into
their Party; and, by so doing to turn them out of the
ways of Peace: And had also proferred and promised
Grace and Favour to all such as being already engaged,
should return to their Obedience, after they should truly
understand his Intentions: Nevertheless, with great grief
of Heart, perceiving; that notwithstanding his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Gracious Advertisment, some of his Subjects
did not forbear to engage themselves in that Faction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn into it by several Interests: But the most of
them purely transported and blinded with the fair and
specious Colours, which the Authors of those Seditions
put upon their Designs; he thought it a part of his Duty,
for the general benefit of all his Subjects, and in discharge
of his Conscience to God, and Honour to the World, to
oppose the clear light of the Truth to those Artifices of his
Adversaries: To the end that his Subjects, being guided
by the clearness of that Light, might in time, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Impediment, discern and know the grounds and
ends of those Troubles; and, by that means avoid the
Miseries and Calamities, both publick and private, which
were like to grow upon those Commotions.</p>

into his Heart of Countenancing Heresy in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in point of Justice and Defence of the Laws,
<hi>be shewed what he had done, since his coming to the Crown, in
favour of it; what good Laws and Constitutions he had made, and
how desirous he had been that they should be observed:</hi> But, if
any default were in the Execution of them, the blame
must rest upon his Officers, not upon him; whose parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
care<note n="u" place="margin">Ib. p. 393.</note> had been so great for the Rebuilding of

               <p>He likewise intreated all his Subjects, to open their
Eyes, and consider the dangerous Consequences of these
Wars, which would not be ended so soon as they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and not to stain their Loyalty, by suffring themselves
to be made Instruments of their Countries, ruine to their
Enemies advancement.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as touching the disposal of places of Honour,
and trust in the Kingdom, first he stood upon his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
that, as all his Predecessors, so he might freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such places upon whom he pleased, being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by any Law to make choice of one more than
another: Appealing to the People, how groundless
that Calumny was, when they might see those that
most complained, and were the Authors of those Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:48510:219"/>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Observe this rightly parallel'd in the Earls of <hi>Northumb.

               <p>Fourthly, for the Grievances of the People, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<note n="z" place="margin">Ib. p. 396.</note> he had already begun, and promised his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

               <p>Fifthly, for the secret Plots and Conspiracies, which
the Heads of the Faction pretended to be laid against their
Persons; for preventing whereof they said they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to take up Arms; his Majesties known Clemency
might sufficiently secure them from any on his part, who
was naturally so far from all desire of revenge, that no
Man living had ever the least cause to complain of him in
that respect, notwithstanding what ever Provocation he
had from any. But very many have had sufficient proof
of his natural Bounty, and Mercy: Therefore his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
prayed, and intreated the Heads of that Faction to
Disband their Forces; to relinquish their <hi>League,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their Duty and Loyalty; and so doing he promised
to receive them into his favour.</p>
               <p>But after the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Leaguers</hi> had for a long time
bandied Writing, one against the other, they so far incensed
<note n="a" place="margin">Ib. p. 397.</note> each other, that it was now full time, either to come to
Action, and not to multiply any more words. The<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 398</note> Forces
of the Kingdom, which adhered to the King were very
weak; for he had not time sufficient to ripen his Designs,
being prevented by the sagacity and forwardness of the

were divided; sometaking one part, some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
And those which stood with the Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
were very cold and slow, their Courages being much
daunted by the bold attempts of the Consederates: Nay
some of the King's own Party, and who had been highly
favoured and preferred by him, were revolted<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 399.</note> from
him to the <hi>League.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Was not his Majesty thus used by the Earls of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> the L <hi>Coventry</hi> and others?</note>
               </p>
               <p>But that which Afflicted the King above all, was his
feares of the City of <hi>Parts</hi> (a just Parallel of our <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
which was indeed the Head of the Kingdom; but
a Head so great and Powerful, that which way soever it
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:48510:220"/>
inclined, it was sure to turn the Scales. This Citty was
not only united with the general <hi>League,</hi> but had entred
into a particular <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> amongst themselves:
And, having secretly provided themselves of Arms, was
ready to revolt upon the first occasion; and if need were
to seize upon the Kings Person, which very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him: For, if he should stay in <hi>Paris,</hi> he could not
do it without great danger to himself, being liable to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
affront from the inconsiderable headiness of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
And if he should abandon it, it was sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</p>
               <p>To secure his stay there, he was therefore forced to
call<note n="d" place="margin">Ib.</note> all the Souldiers of his Ordinary Guard to their
Colours; and farther made choice of forty five Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in whom he could repose confidence, whom he
maintained at the charge of an hundred Crowns a Month,
besides their Expences at Court, to attend continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Person: Yet, for all this he lived in continual Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and Affliction of Mind, seeing himself upon
such an Head-strong Beast, as was not possible for him to
manage: Wherefore he endeavoured all fair means of
accommodation with the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> profering them all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
               <p>The Citty of <hi>Paris</hi> erected<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 437.</note> a new Council of <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi>
(as <hi>London</hi> new-moulded<note n="f" place="margin">In <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Anno.</hi> 1641.</note> theirs) which were
the most interested and affected to the <hi>League</hi> (according
to the number of Wards in that Citty) who were to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
all the affairs and dispose the minds of the People;
with whom were joined one of every Mistery in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who made their Addresses to, and received their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from the <hi>Sixteen;</hi> as well concerning the defence of
the City, and Service of the <hi>League,</hi> as to counterpiose
the Kings Designs.</p>
               <p>When there was no hopes of accommodation left
with the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> the King began<note n="g" place="margin">Ib. p. 457.</note> to raise Forces
too; and summon'd all the Nobility to assist him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he met no where with so much Opposition, as from
the Turbulent Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the <hi>Preachers</hi>
and Council of <hi>Sixteen</hi> never ceased to provoke and incense
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:48510:220"/>
the People, and raise frequent Tumults in the City, so as
the Magistrates was set light by, and trod under foot,
with danger of an open revolt, which those Men desired
and endeavoured. Nor did it stand with the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the King to chastise the Authors of those Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
for fear of ministring any occasion to the City of
revolting from him. Whereupon they Multiplyed their
Practises with much boldness, which had (doubtless)
arrived at that end, which the <hi>Leaguers</hi> designed, but that
the fear<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 447.</note> of the <hi>German</hi>-Army, and the Kings <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,</hi>
and <hi>Oath</hi> for defence of <hi>Religion against the</hi> Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
(which he had solemnly taken upon New-years day
1587.) did contain them within some bounds of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The King therefore, having<note n="i" place="margin">Ib. p.</note> with great Dexterity
and Moderation, many times stilled those Reports, which
had been raised on no grounds; being likewise heartily
vexed at the Ringleaders of those Tumults, but deeply
concealing his Passion, left<note n="k" place="margin">457.</note> the Lord <hi>Villaclere</hi> to be
Governour, and the Queen-Mother Regent in <hi>Paris;</hi>
and departed thence about the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1587.</p>
               <p>Thus was that King driven from <hi>Paris</hi> by the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</p>
               <p>The House of <hi>Lorrein</hi> (who were the prime Men in
the <hi>League</hi>) puft up with the Opinion of their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, forgot all Moderation, and spread their Sailes to vast
hopes; talked of nothing, but utter extirpation of the
<hi>Huguenots;</hi> of deposing the King, and thrusting him into
a Cloyster (as they found in Stories that King <hi>Chilperick,</hi>
had been served:) of expelling all Favourites from the
Court; sharing the great places of the Kingdom amongst
themselves, and Governing all <hi>France</hi> as they pleased.
And so high were they in their own Conceits, that their
Councils were not bounded, either by Justice, or Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
For supposing all things to be now in their own
hands, they imagined their Merit to be such, as they might
lawfully undertake, and their Power no less, as that they
might easily perform, any the highest and most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
atchievement what soever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>When all their Plots were now ripe, and they in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
for Execution; they took the very same course, and
upon the very same Grounds, as our Men did actuate their
Designs; which was (forsooth) by an <hi>Humble Petition.</hi>

For they agreed, that the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and other
Lords of the <hi>League,</hi> should not immediately set upon
the King with open force: But to make a shew, as if the
nature of the Affairs themselves, did carry them on to
their Designed end, they should present a Petition, which
should contain manydemands, very advantagious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and such as would necessitate the King to declare
himself to the full. For if he granted their Requests
without more ado, than they had their end, but if he
should hold off, and be unwilling, than he would give
them occasion to make use of their Armes; and to take
that from him by force, which he was not willing to part
with of his own accord.</p>
               <p>The chief Heads of their Petition (presented to the
King, by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>) after many Preambles and
Reasons couched together with a great deal of cunning,
were these; <hi>viz. That the King would cordially Ioyn with the</hi>

                  <hi>he would grant the Confederates

in the mean time to give occasion to the <hi>League,</hi> to rise in
Arms, and Prosecute their Designs, while Fortune smiled

Discourses, Satirical Verses, and feigned Stories,
wounding the Kings Honour. The <hi>Preachers</hi> likewise,
after their usual manner, but with more freedom, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the present State of things, filled the Peoples
Eares with new, strange, and miraculous Stories. Which

               <p>The<note n="p" place="margin">Ib. p. 483.</note> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> purposing to devive all the

<hi>Sixteen,</hi> that the City was at his Devotion, with Twenty
Thousand Armed Men, under Sixteen Commanders of
their several Companies, ready for any Imployment. But
not confiding in those Commanders, he thought fit to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the number, and sent them five Captains to regulate
and Command the Popular Arms; viz. <hi>Brissac, Boisdau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin,
Chamois, Escaroles,</hi> and Colonel St. <hi>Paul;</hi> with whom
was joined the Lord of <hi>Menevil,</hi> as the prime instrument
of the Plot.</p>
               <p>And, though the King, in his own Person, was a most
Rigid Opposer of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and none more Zealous
in his Religion than himself; yet did they defame him to

               <p>Touching the point of <hi>Placing</hi> and <hi>Displacing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors;</hi>

                     <hi>Davila.</hi> p. 492.</note> was the publick discourse of the <hi>Guisards</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
that the Kingdom could never be setled in Peace, nor
the Minds of true <hi>Catholicks</hi> at ease, so long as they saw
the Kings Person inviron'd with non-confiding Persons,
and of uncertain resolutions in point of Religion.</p>
               <p>The King made answer he was very willing to any
thing that might conduce to the settlement of Religion;
and that<note n="s" place="margin">Ib. p. 493.</note> he was heartily inclin'd to the Extirpation of
<hi>Huguenots;</hi> there being no Prince in <hi>Christendom,</hi> that
more hated, and desired the Suppression of <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
than himself. And, that for those about his Person, they
had never suggested to him any Councils to the contrary:

proved against his Ministers, that they had in any thing,
demeaned themselves with less Sincerity than they ought,
he would be ready to punish them accordingly, to the
quality of their Offence; but would not Banish them
from his Court to humour other Men.</p>
               <p>When the King, by reason of the Tumults in <hi>Paris,</hi>

which he pretended to be the Protector, or that he desired
to cloak all his Designs with the Mantle of Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
or that he intended nothing more but his own
safety, and Reformation of the Government; promising
to himself that all would fall into his Lap, by means of
his cunning Carriage; and that he needed not to make use

               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> failed of his Intentions upon
the Kings Person (by reason of his escape) and his Design
of obtaining from him, as his Prisoner, what Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he pleased, was by that means crushed, he bent<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 502.</note>
his thoughts to the securing himself of the Command of
the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> For, perceiving that he must now
go to War with the King; he knew very well, that he
could have no stronger Foundation, than the Power and
Assistance of the <hi>Parisians:</hi> Therefore to assure himself
of the City, he got into his Hands the <hi>Bastile,</hi> dispossessing
<hi>Testate,</hi> who held it formerly for the King, but was now
forc'd to surrender it into the hands of the People, who
instantly made the Duke Governour of it. The Duke
therefore, loosing no time, call'd the People together in
a Common-Council, and caused <hi>Hector Perose,</hi> provost
of the Merchants [a place answerable to that of Lord
Mayor of <hi>London</hi>] to be deposed, as a dependent on
the King; Committed him to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and made <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> seeing the King was got out of
the toyl, and that he could not bring his first Design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
endeavoured<note n="d" place="margin">Ib. p. 508.</note> to make it appear, that it was
done with his consent (the King's Escape) though it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his Inadvertence: Therefore, with many fair
words and plausible reasons, laid down in several Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
both to the King and People of <hi>France,</hi> he strove
to make them believe, that all his Actions had no other
aim, but the benefit of the Kingdom, Allegiance and
Obedience to the King, and Zeal to the publick good:
That the Tumults<note n="e" place="margin">Compare with this the <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the Members at <hi>Westminster</hi> in their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to his Majesty 26. <hi>Martij.</hi> 1642. Exact Coll. p. 123.</note> in <hi>Paris</hi> were occasion'd by the
fears of the People, without any consent of his: That
his Intentions were ever most Inclin'd to Loyalty, and all
due Obedience, desiring nothing, but that Evil Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
might be removed, and due care taken for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Religion. And though (says my Author) his
Actions were for the most part, quite contrary to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions;
yet the colour of <hi>Religion</hi> was so lively and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
he knowing so well how to demean himself, that
the People generally believed him still, a Loyal Subject
to the King; and that all he did was only out of Zeal to
<hi>Religion,</hi> and an Ardent desire for promoting the publick
good of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>When things were in this State, there followed the face
of an accommodation betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Leaguers;</hi>
and for the composing of all differences, another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was convened at <hi>Bloys 16. Oct.</hi> 1588. In the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<note n="f" place="margin">Ib. p. 118.</note> of Members to assist at it, though both parts
laboured to have such chosen, as were their own depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
yet those of the <hi>League</hi> prevailed by much above
the Kings Party: For the Commons being vexed with
their pressing Grievances (their end being mainly to shake
off that Burthen) did willingly adhere to the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who promised and professed an earnest desire of
easing the People of their unsupportable burthen by Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Contributions.</p>

In this Parliament all the States took a Solemn Oath
or <hi>Protestation,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Compare with this the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station framed at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster. 3 Maij.</hi> 1641.</note> for defence of <hi>Religion,</hi> with the

to be taken by all the Subjects of the Kingdom. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all which Obligations, whereby the <hi>Leagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
bound themselves to abandon their former Practises,
and to apply themselves to a sincere obedience of the
King: yet did they not remit any thing of their former
Machinations: For not only the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> aspired to
obtain the express Title of Lieutenant General (which he
could not before accomplish, though he had the Power)
but the rest ceased not to tamper with the States, that the
Government migt be reformed in such a manner, as that
the King should have no share left him in it, but the bare
name and shadow of a Prince; the whole Power to be
transferred to this Duke, and his Dependents of the
<hi>League.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay the very number of the States [which equaliz'd
ours in the House of Commons] engaging themselves in
the Interests of the Faction, did contend, and squable
for the same ends with them, without any regard of their
so many and Solemn Oaths, in evident contempt of the
Person, Name, and Majesty of the King.</p>
               <p>The<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. p. 523.</note> Commons in this Parliament, (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they had resolv'd upon a War with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
which must needs be expensive: Yet) demanded from the
King a moderation of Taxes, and diminution of new
Impositions; which [<hi>like that of Ship-money</hi>] amounted
to two Millions of Crowns, yearly; as also the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of many Offices erected about the Customes, and
the total abolishing of some other Grievances. They
declared the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> (who was next Heir to the
Crown) incapable of Inheriting; and Sollicited the King
to make a new Decree upon it, unto which they would
have him swear, as a Fundamental Law.</p>
               <p>After many other Plots and Practises in this Factious
Parliament; when business was now fully ripe, and the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> having sufficiently canvassed and prepared
the States, both in general, and particular: Grown now
secure and bold, upon confidence of former Experience,
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:48510:224"/>
he began to bring his Plot upon the Stage, of being made
Lieutenant-general, at the Request and by the Authority
of the Parliament, which was the last end of his present
hopes. But those hopes were quickly frustrate by His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Death.</p>
               <p>After which his Brother the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> took up
Arms to Prosecute that design of the <hi>League:</hi> And, though
the King wrote kind Letters to him; yet were they of no
force, to make him hearken to any Concord: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himself Head of the <hi>Holy Union,</hi> he was by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians</hi>
declared Lieutenant General, of the State and
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> with the same authority and power,
wich is naturally inherent in the King (abating only the
name) which Power was intended to continue, until the
States-General should think fit to alter it: Upon the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
whereof he entred 22. <hi>Febr.</hi> 1589 Having taken
a Solemn Oath to Protect and defend the <hi>Catholick</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
against all Persons whatsoever; to preserve the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
belonging to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> to defend the
Priviledges of the three Estates of Parliament, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
Nobility, and Commons; to cause the Laws and
Constitutions of the Realm to be observed; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power of the Courts of Justice.</p>
               <p>Having done this, he chose and setled the Council of
the Union [<hi>like a close Committee</hi>] consisting of fourty the
chief and most eminent Persons of the <hi>League,</hi> to manage
all the most Important Affairs with his Assistance; leaving
still the Government of the City of <hi>Paris</hi> with the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.
And, as our Men had their Committies in several
Counties, which received Directions from, and sent Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations

               <p>Nor hath scarce any act of Insolence been Commited
by our Men, in which they might not urge these for an

               <p>The King (upon like Motives as his Majesty Adjourn'd

and entertaining no Thoughts but of Peace and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
procured the Popes Legate to Interpose
for that end; promising to refer all difference to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Which when the Legate moved to the Duke of
<hi>Maine,</hi> he refused to hearken to it; alledging it to be but
a shift of the King to gain time, in regard he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at present unprovided and unarmed. All hopes of
accommodation therefore fayling; the King being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
that he had used all means possible on his part,
and that not without descending far below the honour of
his person, began to alter his Opinion: And, to the end
<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. p. 562.</note> he might not be surprized (without assistance) by the
Power of his Enemies; the urgency of his necessities
constraining him perforce to look about for some Supplies,
he began to hearken to an accord with the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
a Professed <hi>Protestant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="627" facs="tcp:48510:225"/>
Certain it is, that in his own Inclination, he was ever
averse from such an accord; his nature being incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with all Commerce with the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> But there
being an evident necessity,<note n="p" place="margin">Compare with this his Majesties Answer to the two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Full Relation</hi> &amp;c. p. 215.</note> that he could not then do
otherwise; all his Councillers, with one voice told him,
he must needs resolve and side with one Party, unless he
would stand alone in the midst of his Potent Enemies;
one on one side the <hi>Loyre,</hi> and the other on the other
side, having possess'd themselves of all.</p>
               <p>What Moneys, what Friends, what Armies, what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had he sufficient to grapple with such Factions at the
same time? Tis clear, which way soever he could turn
himself, he must have one Enemy before his Face, and
another behind his back: His Kingdom also being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and Forrein Princes likewise divided betwixt two
Religions; he (a new Example) should have both averse;
both Enemies to him, would he continue in this distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
without Forces, without Moneys. While one
side Invades one part; another side another part of the
Regal Authority.</p>
               <p>He is now, what he was always, affraid of, in the
midst of two Violent Torrents. He did as much as man
could do for Peace: He forgot his own Honour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
with the Seditious; and gave the Rebels and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers
of his Authority that satisfaction which they little
deserved. With unheard of Patience he endured all the
Injuries of the People, the Invectives of their Preachers,
the Villanous Insolencies of the Factious Commons, and
the bold Decrees of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> submitting his Royal
Majesty to the inordinate desires of the Reliques of the
<hi>Guises.</hi> He did that which never King before him would
have endured to have done. What could he do more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to please the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he would patiently wait, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
providing any defence,<note place="margin">Was not his Majesties Statua abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, both at the Old <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Winche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon his Person, as had been already done to his Statua's,

therefore, that he shew he hath the Heart of a Lyon; and,
making use of the King of <hi>Navarr's</hi> Assistance—<hi>de Inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48510:226"/>
himself sometimes, when Necessities were less pressing,
had made Peace with the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> Why should he not,
therefore, seek all just means to restrain the Seditious, to
recover his own Power; and now at last to restore Peace
and Rest to his Kingdom?</p>
               <p>Upon<note n="q" place="margin">Ib. p. 563.</note> this then followed several adverse <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the King's; justifying his own Proceedings. The

               </p>
               <p>After these Instigations of his Councillers, the King
beginning to incline to an accommodation with the King
of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the <hi>Huguenots:</hi> Though<note n="r" place="margin">Ib. p. 564.</note> all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
desired that he should not come to an accord with
them; yet, such was the obstinacy of the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi>
and the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> and such the State of the Realm, by
reason of the present Seditions, that none of them could
blame him, though they all abhorr'd it.</p>
               <p>Seeing<note n="s" place="margin">Ib. p. 565.</note> therefore, that of necessity he must take up
some resolution; and that his Affairs were in danger of
utter ruine, if he did not; he concluded a Truce for one
Year with the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> upon these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1. That the publick Exercise of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion
should be restored in all places under the Command of the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> without Exception.</p>
               <p>2. That the Clergy should be restored to their Means;
and the Prisoners which they had in their hands should
be set at Liberty.</p>
               <p>3. That the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> should be obliged to
serve him in Person, with four Thousand Foot and twelve
Hundred Horse, wheresoever he should be Commanded.</p>
               <p>4. That all Cities, Countries, and places of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should observe all the Laws and Constitutions of the
Kingdom, obey the Courts of Justice, and the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates;
and receive such Orders as the King had or
should hereafter give them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:48510:226"/>
On the other side it was agreed, that the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr</hi>
should have the City of <hi>Samur,</hi> and keep it as a
free pass for him, upon the River <hi>Loyre;</hi> but be bound
to yield it up again at the Kings Pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[How fully applicable is this to the Cessation made in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by his Majesty?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the King set forth a <hi>Declaration</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Ib. p. 567.</note> against
the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> and his Adherents, who had caused the
Cities to revolt, and were then up in Arms; intimating
to them; that if they did not return to their Obedience
within the space of XV. days, and forbear to trouble the
Realm by making Levies; as also not lay down Arms;
they should incurr the Crime of Rebellion, and all their
Goods be Confiscate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Which Writings were attended with Actions sutable:
[<hi>as his Majesty did set on foot his Commissions of Array</hi>] the King
granting out Commissions to several Governours in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Provinces, for making of Levies, and drawing the
People together in Arms. Nevertheless he still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Inclinations to Peace; and having<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Davilae</hi> p. 568.</note> excused the
Truce, which he was necessitated to make with the King
of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and promised to persevere constant in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Religion; he intreated the <hi>Pope's Nuncio</hi> once more
to trye the Mind of the Duke of <hi>Maine;</hi> and by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with him in Person, to labour him to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
in regard, that, neither by the Duke of <hi>Loreyne's</hi>
means (to whom he had Written) nor the Dutchess of
<hi>Nemurs,</hi> (who had been imploy'd to that purpose) he
could at all work upon him, to lend the least Ear to any
Treaty for Peace.</p>
               <p>And to make it evident to the World, how desirous
he was to be free'd from the necessity of an accord with
the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> he delivered to the Cardinal, a Paper,
Written with his own Hand, wherein was contained what
things he would be content to grant to them of the <hi>League:</hi>
                  <pb n="630" facs="tcp:48510:227"/>
Offring to make the Prince of <hi>Loreyne</hi> Governour of
<hi>Metz, Tul,</hi> and <hi>Uerdun;</hi> to Marry the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix
of <hi>Bullion,</hi> with the Cities of <hi>Games</hi> and <hi>Sedan</hi>
to the Count of <hi>Vaudemont.</hi> To the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> he
was content to yield the Government of the whole
Countrey of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with the nomination of all
under-Governours there; and that to pass to his Son after
him. To the young Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the Inheritance of
<hi>Champaine, St. Desir,</hi> and <hi>Rocroy,</hi> for Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Person; with Thirty Thousand Crowns a Year
of Ecclesiastical Revenue for one of his Brothers: To

the Duke <hi>D'Aumarle <hi>Saint-Esprit du Rae,</hi>
                  </hi> for his
security; To make his Brother General of the Foot,
with Twenty Thousand Franks a Year: To the Duke
of <hi>Elleboef,</hi> the Government of <hi>Poictiers.</hi> To these
and others, divers large pensions, and preferments; so
desirous was he to purchace his Peace, at any rate.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Which</hi> Propositions <hi>were not much unlike his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Instructions to his Commissioners, for the Treaty at <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and wrought as little with the Leaguers</hi>]</p>
               <p>But this Paper of the King's wrought nothing at all;
the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> meeting with the Legate, refusing
peremptorily to hearken to any Agreement; pretending
<note n="y" place="margin">Ib. p. 569.</note> that he could not accept of any Conditions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
calling all the Estates of the <hi>League,</hi> and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Family together, to have their Consent.
Which he said indeed, because he thought himself by
much, Superior in force to the King, and because both
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to assist him with Men and Money.</p>
               <p>The News of the Truce, which the King had made
with the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> no sooner arrived at <hi>Paris;</hi>
but 'tis incredible what Malice they thereupon conceiv'd
against him, and all his Followers; what exorbitant<note n="z" place="margin">Was not the like done by our Men against his Majesty for Assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Cessation in <hi>Ireland?</hi>
                  </note>
Demonstrations they made of it; even by their publick
Ordinances, prohibiting any Prayers to be used for him,
in the Service of the Church, as had been ever done for
all the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> which the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
many times, and <hi>Piety</hi> allows (particularly on <hi>Good-Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>)
even to Hereticks, Idolaters and Infidels. Nor is
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48510:227"/>
it possible to account the innumerable quantity of Libels,
Declarations, and Pamphlets, Printed and Published
against him, beyond all bounds of Reason and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the noise of Arms did soon drown that
of their Libels, and Seditious Sermons: And many
Battails were Fought, in which the King had the better,
and came Victorious before that proud City of <hi>Paris:</hi>
But, in the Seige of it, he was basely Murthered by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
Clement, a Dominican</hi> Fryer; 1. Aug. 1589.</p>
               <p>After this Untimely Death of that King (<hi>Henry</hi> the
3<hi>d.</hi>) the Crown of <hi>France</hi> with its Troubles, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the King of <hi>Navarr, Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th:</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acknowledged<note n="a" place="margin">Ib. p. 591.</note> by the Catholick Nobility, in the
Camp; they swore Allegiance to him; he mutually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 593.</note> to maintain and defend the <hi>Catholick Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Religion</hi>
to the utmost of his Power, and not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any alteration in it: And likewise to maintain [<hi>the
Priviledges of Parliament</hi>] the three Estates of <hi>France,</hi>
in their wonted Power, Priviledges, Immunities, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any prejudice or innovation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>But all this had little Operation on the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> they
persisting in their wonted Obstinacy and Rebellion,
though he omitted not any means to win them to peace
and reconcilement. For first he sent<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 596<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> unto them,
that <hi>Villeroy</hi> might come to Treat with him; but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.
Then he imploy'd a private Gentleman to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
to whom the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> would not give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but appointed that he should deliver his Message
to <hi>Villeroy:</hi> Which was, that the King had expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, to assure the Duke of his Majesties good
Inclinations to peace; as also to represent unto him how
necessary it was for the publick good; what great account
he made of the Dukes person; how much he desired to
make him his Friend; and to have him near at hand, that
he might afford him an honourable share in his favour, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his Condition. Likewise that the Duke might
then lay aside the vain hopes of seeing the King abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his Subjects, considering in what a good condition
he did at that time stand. Desiring therefore, that he
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:48510:228"/>

gave Commission to be made, was [<hi>in this somewhat more
civil than that of the Earl of</hi> Essex] that he had no private
Quarrel with the King, whom, for his own part, he did
highly Honour and Reverence; but his Religion, and his
Conscience would not suffer him to enter any Treaty with
him. <hi>For if</hi> (quoth he) <hi>my Deceased Brethren took up
Armes in the Kings Life time, upon a suspition of danger: Now
that the Necessity is more urgent, and the danger present, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lay down those Armes, which I have taken up, without sinning
against the Memory of my Deceased Brethren</hi> [Essex <hi>might have

Oath which I took [the</hi> Covenant <hi>forsooth</hi>] That I <hi>engaged
my Faith, and Consecrated my Life to the publick Cause, when I

at the Battail of <hi>Arches</hi> was forc't to retreat with loss,
though his Forces were Superior (by much) to the

               <p>Which success<note n="h" place="margin">Ib. p. 612.</note> in that Battail (upon the addition of

Multitude; especially the Ladies, seeing him come on
such a suddain, ready to assail that proud City; and at a
time, when they were perswaded he would have had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do to defend himself: Also; that in regard of
the weakness of his Forces, he would either by that
time have been subdued, or driven out of the Realm.
For the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> when he went against the King
at <hi>Diepe;</hi> by way of ostentation of his Forces before
the People, writ to <hi>Paris;</hi> that, <hi>within a few Days, he
would either bring the King Prisoner, or force him to flye into
<hi>England</hi> with shame enough.</hi> And now the City not
well provided, and out of hopes of relief, their Mindes
were full of Fears and Vexation. But, upon the Duke
of <hi>Mayne's</hi> Approach, the King rose from before <hi>Paris,</hi>
having first taken the Suburbs and sackt them.</p>

in the Kingdom, but was Imploy'd: Not a Pen but writ
in defence of the Reasons of one side or other; but with
so much Obstinacy of Mind in their Arguments; that it
was easy to discern, that the Arms of the Spirit, when
they are distorted and misused in divers manner, in the

and head of the Design (who, by the Authority of his
Person, Prudence of his Government, and experience in
Marshal-matters, bore the chief burthen of their Affairs)
conceiving that the reward and fruits of his Paines, did of
Justice belong to himself, projected therefore, either to
transfer the Crown upon himself, or upon some of his
House: But in case he could not obtain so much; then,
at least, to set it upon the Head of some such Prince, as
might totally and absolutely be beholding to him for it;
being resolv'd that the Kingdom should not be divided;
much less that it should fall into the Hands of a Forein
Prince.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (who, in the

the <hi>League,</hi> and had of late Years laid out two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>But the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> (who perceived well, that
the main strength of the Faction consisted in them; not
only in regard of the Multitude of their People, and
Power of the City; but by reason of their continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,

<pb n="635" facs="tcp:48510:229"/>

by reason of his want of Care, inclin'd to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

with fair Promises, and big Words, both in publick and
private, in order to their Assistance.</p>
               <p>On<note n="m" place="margin">Ib. p. 629.</note> the other side, the Nobility, which took part
with the <hi>League</hi> (in whose hands were the Arms and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Kingdom) were much averse from submitting
to the <hi>Spanish</hi>-Yoke, inclined to the Duke of <hi>Mayne;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
themselves to his Pleasure, to be guided by his
Authority. But, in this great distraction of the Kingdom,
divers of them were not without their own particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
And of such variety of Councils was the <hi>League</hi>
composed; that, by clashing with one another, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
the course of their Affairs, and abated the heat,
by which they first Conspired in that Band, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have no other end but Religion.</p>
               <p>The King, therefore, taking advantage of these their
Divisions, dismissed the Marquess of <hi>Belin</hi> upon his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role
(whom he had taken Prisoner at the Battel of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>)
with Commission, in his name, to proffer Peace
to the Duke of <hi>Mayne;</hi> and to exhort him, as a Prince of
an honest and moderate temper, not to assent to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Designs of Foreigners; but, freeing himself from
the base usage of the Vulgar, and cunning of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
that he would hearken to an honest and safe Peace;
whereupon,<note n="n" place="margin">Ib. p. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="636" facs="tcp:48510:230"/>When the Marquess made this overture to the Duke,
the Opinions of the Councillers about him, were much
divided; some favouring it; others declaming against it:
Telling how the War was founded upon the point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and therefore nothing must be done in it, without
the Popes Approbation: Also, that the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi>
being not absolute Prince of the <hi>League,</hi> but only the Head
of his Party, ought not to adventure upon such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Action, without the joynt consent of all those
that followed that Party, and all the Princes, that adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to, or favoured the <hi>League;</hi> who (if they should not
follow his deliberation) might choose another Head, and
he be left destitute of the support of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Party, to
the will of his Enemies. And, that this was but a trick
of the Kings, to work a diffidence in the Dukes Party, and
to sow Divisions and Suspitions amongst the Confederates,
though the King might promise Golden-Mountains, to
the end he might dissolve the Union of the <hi>League;</hi> yet
there was no security; but that so soon as he should be
Established King, in Peace, he would not observe the
least Tittle of his promises.</p>
               <p>The Duke, therefore, on the one side, by the disdain,
which he had conceived against the Inconstancy, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
of the Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the want of
Money to pay his Souldiers, was troubled much: But
above all, the Subtilty and surliness of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> vexed
him most; who having caused <hi>Seignior de la Mot,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Gravelin,</hi> to come out of <hi>Flanders</hi> with
their Forces, to the confines of the Kingdom; refused to
let him advance one Foot further, or to issue any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
for the maintenence of the War, unless the <hi>Catholick</hi>
King was first declared Protector of the Crown of
<hi>France;</hi> with Authority to dispose of the Principal
Dignities, as well Ecclesiastical as secular, which they
called marks of Justice; whereby he desired to have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Superiority over the <hi>League.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which demands seemed so Exorbitant unto him; so
prejudicial to the Crown, and so dishonest, that he could
not endure to think of them himself: Nor did he believe,
that any one Man of the Confederates, from the <hi>Parisians</hi>
downwards, would ever condescend to Decree them:
Knowing, that this were to put the Bridle into the King
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:48510:230"/>
of <hi>Spaine's</hi> hands, to let him carry all things to such ends,
as he pleased himself [<hi>Nor did the Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
sell their Assistance at a much cheaper rate, as is plainly to be seen
by their Treaty of the</hi> 29th. <hi>of</hi> November, 1643. For their
advance into <hi>England;</hi> and their second demands for their
managery of the Government of <hi>Ireland</hi>]</p>
               <p>But, on the other side, his Fears of being abandoned,
and left alone; his distrust of the Kings Sincerity in his
Promises, and the Antient grudge he bore to him; but
especially his hopes of getting the Crown for himself,
would not suffer him to hearken to those overtures, made
by the Marquess of <hi>Belin,</hi> whom he sent back to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
with some Ambiguous and General Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and cut off the Negotiation for any Accord.</p>

               <p>For<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. p. 662. &amp; 663.</note> the People of <hi>Paris</hi> were so far Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Zeal to the <hi>Cause,</hi> by reason of the continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations
from the Pulpits, that there could be no
Peace, or accommodation made, unless they would damn
their own Souls; that they were resolved to endure any
thing, rather than to hearken to an Accommodation: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as many, who had inconsiderately slipt a Word or
two out of their Mouths, saying, <hi>that Accommodation was
better than starving, and rather Peace than a Siege;</hi> were, in
the Rage and Fury of the People, either publickly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
and Executed; or without more ado, thrown
into the River, as damn'd Miscreants, Enemies of the

               <p>It is not unworthy Observation, what Artifices the

Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> drew out the Garrisons of
<hi>Meaux,</hi> Dreux, and <hi>Pontois;</hi> but was repulst by the Valour
of the Lords themselves, and their Families.</p>
               <p>President <hi>Janin</hi> was sent<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 733.</note> into <hi>Spain,</hi> to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
with the King of that Realm, in behalf of the
<hi>Leaguers,</hi> but return'd without any resolution: For it was
desired in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the War should move but a slow
pace; that the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> should not grow so much
in Credit and Authority with his Party.</p>
               <p>The<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. p. 740.</note> Council of the <hi>Sixteen</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> (to whom
the Preachers stuck close) which was at first the Basis and
Ground-work of the <hi>League;</hi> pretending to carry all
things according to their own liking, demeaned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with much partiality and Passion, proper to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
without any regard to preserve the Rights of the
Crown, or the Honour and Reputation of the <hi>French</hi>
Nation; their only Studies and whole Endeavours being
set upon such things, as might ruine the King, whom
they hated most perfectly, and extinguish both his Name,
and all the <hi>Huguenot</hi>-Party, so that they might put the
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48510:232"/>
Reins of Government into the hands of such Persons, as
would rule all things according to their Humours. But
the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> studying how to curb and moderate
their turbulent desires, instituted a <hi>Council of State,</hi> distinct
from that of the <hi>Sixteen,</hi> consisting of many Wise and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Men, to counterpoise and restrain the heady cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the other: Amongst which were <hi>Villeroy, Iannin,</hi>
&amp;c. Men not tainted with <hi>Spanish</hi> Practises, nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
Zeal of the Preachers; which kindled a great-
Heart-burning and emulation betwixt the Council of the
State, with the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Council of
the <hi>Sixteen,</hi> especially some of the Zealots amongst
them.</p>
               <p>Thus have we seen the main resemblance of the <hi>Holy-
League</hi> with this of ours, as to the Original and Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it; though in the ends of them, they did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
differ.</p>
               <p>Apparent it is, that the carriage of the <hi>Scotts</hi> here, was
the very same with that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there: Their
Pretences the same; <hi>viz. Religion, and Assisting their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
Their private ends the same, <hi>the advance of their
own greatness.</hi> Which were no sooner fully understood by
the <hi>French;</hi> but even those which were the Kings greatest
Enemies began to detest them; and chose rather to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the just Obedience of their King, than undergo the
<hi>Spanish</hi>-Yoke.</p>
               <p>For<note n="d" place="margin">Ib. p. 747.</note> when the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> were resolv'd
to send but small Forces into <hi>France,</hi> and to spin out
the Wars to their own least cost and most advantage:
Hoping, by that means, to obtain their ends upon the
<hi>French</hi> (who without their help, were not able to stand
against the Kings Forces) which were to procure the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Infanta Isabella</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to be declared Queen of
<hi>France,</hi> in a full Assembly of the States, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<note n="e" place="margin">Ib. p. 761.</note> to force the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> to call for that
purpose: The Duke perceiving it, began utterly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
them, complaining<note n="f" place="margin">Ib. p. 792. &amp; 851.</note> of their niggardly and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
assistance afforded to the <hi>League,</hi> and eager desires of
domineering, which had occasioned the loss of all their
former pains; and given the King opportunity of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:48510:233"/>
such strength, as that he was now Superior to them
both, in Reputation and Forces: (with much more bitter
Language to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadors) he underhand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Treat<note n="g" place="margin">Ib. p. 724.</note> of an accord with the King; yet remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing of his Violence, and pursuit of his Ambitious
ends; but calling an Assembly of the States at <hi>Paris,</hi>
declared<note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 811. &amp; 821.</note> himself fully against the King; and Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the new Election of another; hoping the Crown
might be conferr'd upon himself, for his great Actions in
the Wars,<note place="margin">Thus did <hi>Cromwell</hi> here.</note> none having merited more of the <hi>Cause.</hi> Yet
could he not prevail with those of his own Family; the
Dukes of <hi>Lorrein</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi> thinking as highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as he. And<note n="i" place="margin">Ib. p. 862.</note> when the matter came to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a <hi>Close Committee</hi> of the chief <hi>Leaguers,</hi> before some
select Delegates of the three Estates; the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi>
in a set Speech, full of Art and Eloqnence, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<note n="k" place="margin">Ib. p. 865.</note> the <hi>Infanta</hi> to their Election (a thing which the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Agents had before Practised<note n="l" place="margin">Ib. p. 837.</note> under hand) with
many large proffers of Honour and Reward to those of
the House of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> and other chief Agents of the
<hi>League.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Proposal sounded so strange in the Ears of the
<hi>French,</hi> generally; that<note n="m" place="margin">Ib. p. 161. &amp; 866.</note> the Bishop of <hi>Saintliz (Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rosa</hi>)
a Man of an harsh Temper and dogged Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
(which he had many Years Exercised against the
King and his Adherents) though a Fiery-Zealous <hi>Leaguer,</hi>
could not endure to hear with Patience; but instantly
said, <hi>he now saw the Kings Party was in the right of it; who
had always given out, that they of the <hi>League,</hi> did nothing but
veil their State-Interests with the Mask of Religion: Which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
himself and his Companions had ever laboured to consute
out of the Pulpits; and that now it grieved him to the Heart, to
see it confirm'd from the Mouths of the Embassadors themselves:</hi>
adding, <hi>that hereafter he should learn to know the Policies of
<hi>Spain</hi> to be no less than those of <hi>Navarr;</hi>
                  </hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Intreats them, for their Honours Sake, and Credit
of the <hi>Holy-Cause,</hi> to desist from all Thoughts of altering
the <hi>Fundamental,</hi> the <hi>Salique-Law</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Crown upon a Woman, and Submitting the
Kingdom to the Dominion of a Stranger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:48510:233"/>But this Proposal of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was resented<note n="n" place="margin">Ib. p. 867.</note>
with no less Indignation by most of the Members of the
State, than by the Bishop of <hi>Saintliz,</hi> who scorned that
Strangers should rule over them; as if they were, either
so base, as to make themselves instantly Slaves; or so
foolish as not to understand their own Interests. Above
all, they of the House of <hi>Lorrein</hi> were netled<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. p. 868.</note>
at it, who thought to have shared the Cake amongst themselves.
Yea, the very People of <hi>Paris,</hi> being wearied<note n="p" place="margin">Ib. p. 879.</note>
out with necessities and wants; and having tasted a little
of the Sweets of Peace (by means of a cessation<note n="q" place="margin">Ib. p. 845.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
during the time of the Treaty at <hi>Suren</hi>) did
impatiently desire an Accord with the King; and began
to threaten the States, unless they would hearken to an
Accommodation: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being now grown so
odious to the <hi>Parisians,</hi> as that their Embassadors could
not peep abroad in the Streets, but they were entertain'd
with Scoffs and Curses; though, but two Years before,
they were so high in their Books, and gracious in their
Eyes, that<note n="r" place="margin">Ib. p. 743.</note> they of <hi>Paris</hi> thought to have yielded
the City freely, to be under the Subjection of the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No sooner was this great Mystery of <hi>Spanish</hi> Policy
and Ambition revealed; and publickly made known
through the Kingdom, and that Assembly of States
(which was Call'd in Rebellion) Dissolv'd in Disorder;
but that the Cities, which formerly held for the <hi>League,</hi>
and Governours of the Garrisons made hast<note n="s" place="margin">Ib. p. 901.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
by their Obedience, to the King: <hi>Meaux</hi> led the
way; <hi>Peron, Pontois, Orliens, Bruges, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>Aix</hi> followed after; and <hi>Paris</hi> it self was
not long behind. <hi>Roan,</hi> and <hi>Amiens,</hi> and the rest
came flocking in, and were all received to Grace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore, when they saw their main
Project for the Crown thus to fayl, had thoughts to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse
themselves, by getting Possession of as many strong
places, upon the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> as they could,
either by Force or Fraud; <hi>La Fera,</hi> in <hi>Picardy,
Capella, Croisill,</hi> and <hi>Blavet</hi> in <hi>Brittany,</hi> and
<hi>Calais,</hi> they Surprized. By which means they had so
strengthen'd themselves, as that the Dukes of <hi>Guise</hi> and
<hi>Mayne</hi> (after they had made their Peace with the King)
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:48510:234"/>
and other Leaders of the <hi>League,</hi> were now content to
joyn their Forces, to beat them out as Enemies, whom
they had formerly call'd in as Friends.</p>
               <p>And surely, if our <hi>Covenanters</hi> had been as truly sensible
of the Honour of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and <hi>Scottish</hi>-Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as the <hi>French Leaguers</hi> were of theirs, they wanted not
as just Provocations on one side from the <hi>Scotts,</hi> and fair
Invitations on the other from the King to joyn with him,
in delivering this exhausted and bleeding Kingdom from
the Misery which it did at that time suffer; and from that
Slavery, which most good Men feared was at first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the <hi>Scotts;</hi> who had solemnly sworn<note n="t" place="margin">See their Solemn <hi>Leagus</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi>
                  </note> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
this late flourishing Church to the Tyranny of a <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish-Presbytery:</hi>
And, not content with that, demanded,
<note n="u" place="margin">See the full Relation of the Treaty at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> p. 209.</note> in effect the Supream Command of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be
put into their Hands: As also to have an equal<note n="x" place="margin">Ib. p. 206.</note> share
in the Government of <hi>England.</hi> Which Designs, of
that insolency in them, and dishonour to us, were such, as
our Fore-Fathers would not have endured the mention;
and at the Memory whereof, our Posterity will doubtless
blush.</p>
               <p>And to bring these their ends about, 'tis very well
known, that they made themselves Masters of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
Cities in this Kingdom, upon their own confines;
<hi>viz. <hi>Barwick, Newcastle,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Carlisle:</hi> Out of
which, and such other Footing as they had gained here,
how they were got, the Precedent Story doth sufficiently
manifest, whereof I shall not give any touch; that of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> departure out of <hi>France,</hi> having no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
therewith. For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> found, while he
was Fighting to gain the Neighbour Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi>
he had almost lost his own in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that neither his Forces, nor Moneys were sufficient
to maintain two such Expensive Wars at the same time:
And that he did not gain so much in <hi>France,</hi> but the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> by occasion of that diversion, got as much of
him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and therefore was willing to hearken
to a Treaty for Peace: And the <hi>French</hi> (whose Kingdom
was now miserably wasted by a long Civil War) not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to imbrace the motion. Whereupon a Peace was
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:48510:234"/>
concluded betwixt those two Crowns at <hi>Uervins</hi> upon
the second of <hi>May, Anno.</hi> 1598. Whereby the <hi>Spantard</hi>
was to restore all the Towns he had taken in the <hi>French</hi>
Dominion, and go away only with Bagg and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
               <p>It is not unworthy of Observation, that in all the
several Compositions, which the <hi>Leaguers</hi> made with
the King, upon their Reconcilement, and in all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Treaty at <hi>Uervins,</hi> for the general
Peace, there is not the least mention of <hi>Religion,</hi> or
Extirpation of Heresy, though that was the <hi>great
Cause,</hi> for which they ever pretended to take up Arms:
Only they were careful to preserve their secular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests;
and to secure their Persons and Estates upon as
good Terms as they could: A plain Evidence, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
was but the Stale; <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Preferments</hi> being
the Mark which they aimed at. Yet the <hi>Protestants,</hi>
whom they had devoted to Destruction in their <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>League,</hi>
fared in the end never the worse for it: For the
King was content to confirm and Republish in <hi>Anno.</hi>
1595, the same Edict in favour of them, which <hi>Henry</hi>
the third had granted in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1577. and which had
been the chief Eye-sore to the <hi>Papists,</hi> and a ground of
their <hi>League.</hi> Which Edict<note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>D'avila</hi> p. 943.</note> he caused to be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> where <hi>Coquilius,</hi> one
of the Judges, formerly a Violent <hi>Leaguer,</hi> was a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Instrument to further and facilitate the Publication,
and reception of it in the Parliament.</p>
               <p>And, and when the Kingdom had some Liberty to
Breath and Recover her Senses, even those that were
professed <hi>Papists,</hi> did not much repine at the Toleration
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and enlargement of their Priviledges by
the Edict of <hi>Nantz, <hi>Anno.</hi>
                  </hi> 1598. Which the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian

to the Reader—That the Common Peace
of France, Pressed and almost Oppressed with the
Tragical Impetuosities of Schisms and Divisions, made
every thing that was just, to be thought necessary, and all
that was profitable be esteemed just. So that, seeing the
torrent of <hi>Religion</hi> could not be stopt without a Breach in
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:48510:235"/>
the State; that the Disease was inveterate, and a hard
matter to remove what was so deeply setled: That
the Restauration of a Church, is the work of God,
as well as the Plantation: Men must be content to
do no more than they can, and leave the Triumph
and Conquest of Souls to the Wisdom of God, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forms and Reforms the Hearts of Men as he pleasech;
and gives the signal to many wandring Souls, to bring
them into the way of Salvation; it being not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Men to impose a necessity upon that, which
God hath left at Liberty, the <hi>Conscience,</hi> which should
be as free in a State as <hi>Thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, (going on) he shews, by the continued
Practice of former times, that such Princes, as were
well advised, never killed their Subjects to Convert
them; nor wasted their Dominions by War, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Consciences by the Sword; knowing, that
<hi>Religion</hi> is an Act of Union and Concord, and must
be planted by Instruction; whereas Wars are all for
Division and Destruction: And those, who, in these
later times, have mingled Heaven and Earth together,
to compell the Consciences of their Subjects to an
Unity in <hi>Religion,</hi> have, at last, been fayn to give
over, and let them alone; and to reject the advise of
those unskilful Physitians, who prescribe nothing but
<hi>Antimony,</hi> and Letting Bloud, for all Diseases. Then
he proves that the accord made with the <hi>Protestants,</hi>
was both just, necessary, and profitable. The whole
Discourse is not unworthy the consideration of our
times; but I shall not trouble the Reader with Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
farther.</p>
               <p>Having now dispatch't the <hi>Holy-League,</hi> and made
good (I hope) so much as I undertook; that it was,
for the most part, parallel to this of ours: One thing, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I have not insisted on; not knowing whether it
be convenient to particularize in it; namely the strange
Disasters, and Unfortunate ends, which befell many
Eminent Persons of that <hi>League.</hi> Like to which our
own Story hath afforded us some Examples already, and
Posterity may be able to observe more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="647" facs="tcp:48510:235"/>To say nothing of any that were Kill'd in those

               <p>It hath already been shew'd at full; that when the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> first took up Armes, and bound themselves
by Oathes against their King; the pretended grounds

but <hi>the Defence of the true Religion, the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,

cannot chuse but observe, how the Hand of God,

Prophecies, and their Promises into Predictions;
by fulfilling them all, though in) far different sence
from what they intended. By setling the <hi>True

of it; the <hi>Protestants</hi> of that Kingdom, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon that occasion obtain'd, and ever since
enjoyed greater Immunities, and a more free and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
course of the Profession of their Religion, than
ever they had before.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Laws,</hi> the Fundamental Laws of <hi>France</hi>
(to speak with the <hi>French</hi>-Man) the <hi>Salique-Laws,</hi>
touching the Succession of the Crown, and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Glorious Nobility, the Gallant Gentry, the Rich
Citizens, and the Secure Farmer had; when, by
siding with the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> they Exchanged their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and present Peace, which they enjoyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King's Protection, for the aiery hopes of
a greater Liberty; and, if not bettering, at least
securing their Estates. Did not the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of those Wars, so inure the Souldiers to a
Military course of Life, and the People to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
under <hi>Contributions,</hi> and <hi>Impositions,</hi> that the
former could never since be won to lay the Sword
out of his Hands; nor the latter get the Yoke
shaken off their Shoulders? Only the Scene is
somewhat altered; for whereas before, their
own Countrey was the Stage of the War; they
have now removed it to their Neighbours: And
the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by reason of their many
Victories and Successes, is now become justly formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to a great part of <hi>Europe;</hi> whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the <hi>Leaguers</hi> is fully verified, <hi>the King
is made Glorious;</hi> but how far they so intended;
is easy to imagine. And how the <hi>Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
in general, is enhaunted, and their <hi>Property</hi> Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht,
by these Glorious Atchievements of the King,
when their Yearly Taxes, for support of his Wars,
amount almost (if not altogether) to the value of
their Lands, let the <hi>French,</hi> if they have any cause,
make their boast.</p>
               <p>And the People of <hi>England</hi> may now see, how by
tracing them too far in the forbidden Paths of a conceited
<hi>Liberty,</hi> they not long since fell into the known Slavery
of the <hi>French</hi>-Pesant: A Misery, which some of them
felt but a little; when, for fear of it, they first Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be put into a <hi>Posture</hi> of <hi>Defence;</hi> but justly brought
upon themselves, by those undue Courses, which they
took to prevent it; God, in his Wisdom thinking it fit,
to punish this Nation by a real Slavery, unto some of their
own Fellow. Subjects, for fancying to themselves an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,
under their Lawful Sovereign, as a ground to
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:48510:237"/>
justify their Rebellion, when there was no cause for it.</p>
               <p>Wherfore I shall now Conclude, with the Words of
