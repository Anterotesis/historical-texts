            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THO' the Prevalence of those <hi>Vices,</hi> which the following <hi>Treatise</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to Correct, might be more than enough to justifie the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of it; and the <hi>Season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi> of the <hi>Attempt,</hi> be a sufficient Apology for the <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Performance:</hi> Yet having been Induced to Write upon this Subject by such a Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as, I think, cannot justly


<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:106438:3"/>
be excepted against; it may not be amiss, before I proceed to what I chiefly aim at in this <hi>Preface,</hi> to give some short Account, How I came to be Engaged in it.</p>
            <p>IT has been the great, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most singular, Care of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Government,</hi> to Provide, by its <hi>Municipal Laws,</hi> not only against <hi>False-Swearing;</hi> (a Vice in which the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Society</hi> are so apparently concern'd, that scarce any <hi>State</hi> has suffered it to go <hi>unpunish'd;</hi>) but even against <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vain-Swearing</hi> too: And which, because it does not so immediately affect Mens <hi>Civil Interests,</hi> I cannot tell whether any <hi>Laws,</hi> besides <hi>our own,</hi> have thought


<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:106438:3"/>
it their Business to meddle with it.</p>
            <p>HOW prudent such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, as this, is, even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Publick Welfare,</hi> can be doubted by none, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe it to be the <hi>Concern</hi> of <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>General Sense</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> in the Minds of Men; or have considered what a mighty <hi>Influence</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> in <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> has upon the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and of what Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it must therefore be to it, that Men should be kept under a very <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Reverend Esteem</hi> of it. There being nothing more certain, than that if once Men be allow'd to Profane an <hi>Oath</hi> by


<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:106438:4"/>
               <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vain Swearing;</hi> they will from thence be apt to go on, in a little while, to a farther <hi>Contempt</hi> of it: And so, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, arrive to an Unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness even for <hi>Perjury</hi> its self; as often as it shall be for their Interest to <hi>Forswear</hi> themselves; and they may hope to do it without the danger of a <hi>Present Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> for their Impiety.</p>
            <p>IT must therefore be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been not only a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but <hi>Politick Design</hi> too, of those <hi>great Men,</hi> whosoever they were, who by putting a Restraint upon <hi>Common-Swearing,</hi> first endeavour'd to raise an <hi>Oath</hi> to a Just <hi>Respect</hi> amongst us: And concluded, with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that


<pb n="v" facs="tcp:106438:4"/>
the best Way to cut off the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ground of <hi>False-Swearing,</hi> would be to make it <hi>Penal</hi> for Men to <hi>Swear at all;</hi> unless it were upon some <hi>great occasion,</hi> and when it was either <hi>absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> or (at least) <hi>very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> for them so to do.</p>
            <p>AND as I think it is for the <hi>Honour,</hi> as well as <hi>Benefit,</hi> of our <hi>Country;</hi> that our <hi>Civil-Laws</hi> have taken such Care in a Matter which has been generally neglected by most others: So I cannot but observe it to the Praise both of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Present Government;</hi> that of the <hi>Two Attempts</hi> that have been made, of this kind, among our selves; the <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>in 21</hi> Jac. <hi>I.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT because the best <hi>Laws</hi> signifie but very little, unless they be, withal, both <hi>generally made known,</hi> and <hi>duly observed:</hi> It has, therefore, been the Care of our <hi>Law-givers</hi> to shew their Prudence no less in their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the <hi>Publishing</hi> of this <hi>Law,</hi> than in the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> its self.

            <p>IT was upon the first Solemn <hi>Publication,</hi> at which I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, of this <hi>Law</hi> in that <hi>Church,</hi> in which it has pleased God to call me to Minister, that I composed the following <hi>Discourses;</hi> and embraced that Advantage, which the <hi>Publick Authority</hi> had so happily put into my hands, to lay open the <hi>Hainousness</hi> of a <hi>Vice,</hi> which had not some such Care been taken to <hi>Correct;</hi> it would, I fear, have been very difficult for us, by all our other Endeavours, ever to have put a <hi>stop</hi> to.</p>

of this <hi>nature,</hi> tho' the <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> be <hi>general,</hi> yet they must still be <hi>moderated</hi> with such <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations</hi> as both the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> its self <hi>requires,</hi> and the <hi>general Consent</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> agrees, ought to be put upon them.

place; <hi>viz.</hi> To rescue the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> from those <hi>Abuses</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> had made of it.

            </p>
            <p>BUT our <hi>Saviour</hi> was not content to restrain Men from the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Customary-Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> only; but, if I am not very much mistaken, did also farther aim at <hi>Another Corruption,</hi>


               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:106438:18"/>
very frequent among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and improved by them to very bad purposes; and that was, of <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> after some <hi>other manner,</hi> than by the <hi>Name of God only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS was indeed a very prevailing <hi>Practice</hi> not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> but among most <note n="*" place="margin">Homer. Il.

<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:106438:19"/>
               <hi>ordinary Occasion.</hi> And the Consequence of it was with <hi>them,</hi> as we are told it was with the <hi>Jews;</hi> That they fell, by this means, into a <hi>Customary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of <hi>Vain-Swearing;</hi> and often times accounted it no great Crime, even to <hi>forswear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is I know very confidently affirm'd by some, That it was no part of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Design to <hi>Abolish</hi> such <hi>Swearing;</hi> which they are still willing to favour, as <hi>innocent</hi> and allowable.

to <hi>Correct</hi> those <hi>Abuses</hi> which that People had introduced into this <hi>Practice,</hi> and to <hi>prevent</hi> Our <hi>falling</hi> into the <hi>like</hi> Hereafter: then, since this could no way so <hi>effectually</hi> be done, as by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding</hi> this <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Swearing Altogether,</hi> and that his <hi>Words</hi> Do Naturally invite Us to such a <hi>Construction;</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why we should not Rather Extend them to such a <hi>Sense,</hi> than put some kind of Violences upon them for the sake of a <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> if not <hi>plainly</hi>

            <p>IN the Prosecution of which <hi>Enquiry,</hi> I must here Once for All freely Confess, that I have


<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:106438:20"/>
not kept so Closely, to the <hi>Words</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as in the <hi>Other Particulars</hi> I took Care to Do. The Reason of which was, that I was willing, upon this Occasion, to Consider <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Several Sorts</hi> of <hi>Confirmation</hi> that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made Use of in Mens <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> with One Another, <hi>Under</hi> the <hi>Degree</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi>: And which being the Only Thing Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was here concern'd to <hi>Forbid,</hi> I thought that What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was <hi>Short</hi> of <hi>That,</hi> might, at least, be fairly <hi>Reduced</hi> to the <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE, indeed, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in my <hi>Reflections</hi> upon this Occasion, to shew, that not only the <hi>Design</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>


               <pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:106438:21"/>
did <hi>Extend</hi> to <hi>All these;</hi> but that his very <hi>Expressions</hi> Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might be so <hi>Interpeted,</hi> as to <hi>Comprehend</hi> the <hi>most</hi> of <hi>Them.</hi> And some very <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men</hi> there are, who have Accordingly Given us such an <hi>Account</hi> of Them. But as I will not make my self a <hi>Party</hi> in this <hi>Debate;</hi> so having fairly Represented the <hi>Grounds</hi> upon which they Go, and given them all the Strength that, I Conceive, They are Capable of; I shall leave it to Every One to Judge as he sees cause to Do. Only as to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Practice</hi> which I have drawn from my Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Point;</hi> those, I think, are <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Secure:</hi> And may,


<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:106438:21"/>
as such, be follow'd without any <hi>Danger,</hi> or <hi>Scruple,</hi> by Us.</p>
            <p>FROM the <hi>Direction</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> How we ought to <hi>Behave</hi> our selves in Our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> with <hi>One Another;</hi> I pass on to the <hi>Reason</hi> given by Him, Why we <hi>Ought not</hi> to <hi>proceed</hi> any <hi>Farther?</hi> Namely, That <hi>Whatsoever is more than These, Cometh of Evil.</hi> And of this I offer <hi>Two Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Both <hi>Good,</hi> and Both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently <hi>Agreeing</hi> with his <hi>Words,</hi> as they stand in the <hi>Original.</hi> And I thought it Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Me to Take <hi>Both,</hi> than to Prefer <hi>That</hi> which our Own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi> seem Rather to have <hi>Approved</hi> of: That so I might the

more clearly shew upon what <hi>just Grounds</hi> this <hi>Assertion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is founded; and what <hi>Good Reason</hi> He had to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us, to <hi>Manage</hi> our <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> according to Those <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> he had before Prescribed to Us.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus Gone thro' the <hi>Discourse</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> upon this <hi>Subject;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. v.</note> I Conclude all with <hi>Two</hi> farther <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> the better to <hi>Improve</hi> what I had before Offer'd, and to <hi>Reduce</hi> the <hi>Whole</hi> to <hi>Practice.</hi> In the <hi>Former</hi> of which, I En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>Causes</hi> of that Great <hi>Encrease</hi> which has, in these latter times, been made of Both the <hi>Sins</hi> forbidden by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>

on this <hi>Occasion; viz.</hi> Both of <hi>False,</hi> and of <hi>Vain-Swearing:</hi> And having done this, I, in the <hi>next place,</hi> take Occasion from thence to lay down such <hi>General Directions,</hi> as seem to be the most Proper, under Our present Circumstances, to <hi>Draw Men</hi> off from <hi>the Practice</hi> of them <hi>Both.</hi> And tho' Here, (as indeed throughout this Whole <hi>Treatise</hi>) I have endeavour'd to bring my <hi>Reflections</hi> into as <hi>Narrow a Compass as</hi> it was possible, without either falling into <hi>Obscurity</hi> on the One hand; or <hi>Omitting</hi> what was fit to be <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice</hi> of on the Other: Yet, I hope, I have laid down such <hi>General Rules,</hi> as being

carefully Applied, may suffice to serve the <hi>Necessities</hi> of the Most of those, who shall need either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> as to these Matters.</p>

what an <hi>Oath</hi> is, can make any doubt of: Namely, That he who Forswears himself, does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only in a most desperate manner * <hi>Affront</hi> the <hi>Majesty of God,</hi> and * <hi>Wound</hi> his <hi>own Soul</hi>; but does, moreover, * Render himself <hi>criminal</hi> towards his <hi>Neigbour</hi> also; and, as much as in him lies, * De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himself a <hi>Common Enemy</hi> to <hi>Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. FOR 1st: As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Majesty of God</hi>; What can strike more directly at that, than this <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Perjury?</hi> When a Man shall not only presume to <hi>Lie,</hi> and <hi>Cheat,</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> his <hi>Neighbour</hi>; but, the better to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish all this Wickedness, shall dare even to <hi>Appeal to God</hi> for his <hi>Integrity:</hi> And, by so doing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to intitule him, who is <hi>Truth</hi> its self, to a part in his Sin; as if he would approve of his Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and become, in some measure, Confederate with him in his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106438:46"/>22. THIS is the true <hi>Meaning</hi> of every <hi>Wilful Perjury:</hi> And then I need not say, what a Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Guilt and Impudence, there must needs be in it.</p>
               <p n="23">23. IF we consider the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Sin,</hi> with respect to Men, the least that can be said of it is this; That it is a <hi>wilful, deliberate, Imposition</hi> upon the <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of him to whom we <hi>swear:</hi> Which sure must be one of the <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,</hi> and most <hi>dis-ingenuous Practices</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p n="24">24. AND as for the <hi>Design</hi> of it; that is, usually, not at all less sinful, than the Means that are made use of for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Whilst the Person to whom we <hi>swear,</hi> is not only to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> but, by vertue of that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi> is to be injured in his <hi>Estate</hi>; his <hi>Reputation</hi>; nay or, it may be, to the loss of his very <hi>Life</hi> it self.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106438:46"/>25. AND this, God knows, were bad enough, were the <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>end</hi> here. But that it does not; It proceeds still farther: Whilst for the accomplishment of this vile purpose, the <hi>false swearer</hi> does not only not <hi>tremble</hi> at the <hi>thought</hi> of the <hi>Divine Justice</hi>; but <hi>flies</hi> in the very <hi>face</hi> of it; and <hi>recurrs</hi> to <hi>God</hi> both for the <hi>countenance</hi> of his <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,</hi> and for the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Lie,</hi> by which it is to be brought about.</p>
               <p n="26">26. NOW he who can be so hardy as to do this; must either <hi>not believe</hi> that there is <hi>any God at all</hi>; or he must disclaim his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of, and <hi>concern</hi> for, what is <hi>done here below:</hi> Or, if he confesses both these; he must then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to <hi>defie</hi> his <hi>Vengeance.</hi> For I cannot suppose any one to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of so far mistaking the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> as to think, that a God of <hi>Truth,</hi> will either endure to be made a <hi>Party</hi> to what is

                  <hi>false</hi>; or not <hi>avenge</hi> himself on that Man, who shall presume so to do.</p>
               <p n="27">27. SUCH therefore is the <hi>Malignity</hi> of this <hi>Sin,</hi> as it <hi>relates</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> Nor is it, 2dly, any less as it <hi>respects our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. FOR proof whereof I must observe, that in every <hi>Oath</hi> God is appeal'd unto, not only as a <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of what we <hi>say</hi>; but as a most just and powerful <hi>Judge</hi> too, to <hi>punish</hi> us for our <hi>falshood,</hi> if it be not.</p>
               <p n="29">29. THIS is so Essential to the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> that, without it, all the <hi>security</hi> of such an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> would be quite lost; and the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Swearing,</hi> overthrown. For what reason would any one have to <hi>believe</hi> another upon his <hi>Oath,</hi> more than upon his <hi>Bare Word</hi>; but that both he who <hi>swears,</hi> and he to <hi>whom</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> is <hi>made,</hi> do believe, that <hi>God</hi> is thereby made the <hi>Surety</hi> of what is spoken: And


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106438:47"/>
will avenge both Himself first, and then the Person whose <hi>Trust</hi> is, by this means, <hi>deceived</hi>; upon that Man, who shall be so presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as by <hi>swearing falsly,</hi> to abuse both?</p>
               <p n="30">30. NOW this being granted; and which, without destroying all the <hi>Benefit</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> cannot be <hi>deny'd</hi>; it must follow, That there is hardly any <hi>Sin</hi> by which a Man does so directly <hi>wound</hi> his <hi>own Soul,</hi> and <hi>cut</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self off from all the <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as by this. Because in this <hi>Sin,</hi> a Man gives up all claim to <hi>God's Mercy</hi>; nay more, desires <hi>God</hi> so to <hi>deal with him</hi> as what he says is <hi>true</hi>; that is, in other words, to <hi>damn</hi> him, if it be not. And what can he who has done this <hi>pretend</hi> to, or even <hi>hope</hi> for, at <hi>God's</hi> hands?

He will not hold him guiltless,</hi> that is, <hi>he will not</hi> forgive <hi>him:</hi> Will not <hi>treat</hi> him with that <hi>Favour</hi> he will <hi>do other sinners:</hi> But will look upon him as a <hi>guilty, condemn'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor</hi>; one whom his own Mouth hath convicted, and will punish him accordingly.</p>
               <p n="32">32. SUCH is the <hi>Danger</hi> to which every <hi>Perjury</hi> a Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, exposes his immortal <hi>Soul.</hi> And if we may estimate the <hi>Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness</hi> of any Sin, by the <hi>hatred</hi> which God bears to it; we must


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106438:48"/>
then conclude this to be one of the most <hi>grievous</hi> of any; as we are sure it is of all others, in a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, <hi>odious</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> of <hi>Our Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. I ADD, 3dly: That it is, above any other <hi>Sin,</hi> the most <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Mankind</hi>; as being, in its own nature, directly opposite to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34.

               <p n="35">35. BUT the Evil does not stop here; but often times affects the <hi>Publick,</hi> as well as violates Mens <hi>Private Rights.</hi> Such are all those <hi>Perjuries</hi> which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

in the <hi>Publick Administration</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi>; and by means of which, either <hi>Honest Men</hi> are <hi>Condemned</hi>; or <hi>Evil-doers</hi> are <hi>Acquitted</hi>; and the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> are made the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Vnrighteousness</hi>; and all the Ends of their Institution are rendred not only <hi>Vseless,</hi> but even <hi>Hurtful</hi> to the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

               <p n="37">37. AND that I thus prove: The <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Society,</hi> and without which no Affairs of Life

               <p n="38">38.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106438:53"/>
That an <hi>Oath</hi> being in its Own Nature nothing else but an <hi>Appeal</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> of what we say, must be Acknowleged, when <hi>Duly</hi> and <hi>Reverently taken,</hi> to have nothing <hi>Evil,</hi> or otherwise <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in it: but on the contrary, to be an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi>; and by which the Honour and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, are eminently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. Forasmuch as by <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Witness</hi> in <hi>all Places,</hi> and upon <hi>all</hi> suitable <hi>Occasions,</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Him to be <hi>Every where Present;</hi> To <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Observe all</hi> the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>; To be the <hi>Searcher</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi> In a word, To be most <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithful Himself</hi>; and a most <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Powerful Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of all <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> in <hi>Others.</hi> And by all this, We do evidently Declare and Magnifie his <hi>Divine Perfections</hi>; and shew to all the World what a Sense we have of his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106438:53"/>5.

               <p n="6">6.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106438:54"/>
that the greatest Affairs of Life are transacted; Mens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, determined; and Justice its self Upheld and Maintain'd. By This, Evil-doers are Convicted; Injuries are Redress'd; And Right is Administred. Thro' This, Men are enabled to Treat with Those whom they never saw before: Of whose Integrity they can have no Other Security; nor, Having This, do they desire any Better. In short; How great a Confusion, How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable a Mischief, the <hi>utter Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing</hi> of <hi>all Swearing,</hi> must bring to the Affairs of Mankind, this One Consideration may suffice to shew; that, (the Treachery and Distrust of Humane Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) it would almost utterly destroy all Confidence in One Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; would Dissolve Society, and lay the Ground of an Eternal Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Suspicion between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man and his Neighbour: and so bring in, in Good Earnest, that

               <p n="28">28. NOW that which yet more confirms to us the Reasonableness of this <hi>Interpretation,</hi> is, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, in the prosecution of this very Subject, plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains

his Discourse to the <hi>same Cases,</hi> in which the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to use those <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which he here mentions. <hi>But let your Communication,</hi> says he, <hi>be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.</hi> That is, in your <hi>Private Discourse</hi> and <hi>Affairs</hi> with one another; let it suffice you, instead of <hi>Swearing</hi> after the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> here reproved, barely to Affirm or Deny what you have to say: Or at the most to add some Innocent <hi>Asseveration</hi> to it, for the farther satisfaction of him to whom you speak; <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is more than this, cometh of evil.</hi>

we see the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Case before us, most notoriously did; who for that reason set up the <hi>lesser</hi> kind of <hi>Swearing</hi> here mentioned, that so they might both the more <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use</hi> it, and the more <hi>easily break thro'</hi> the <hi>Obligation of it:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Saviour</hi> resolved, at once, to prevent all future <hi>Corruption</hi> of this kind, by utterly <note n="*" place="margin">So <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> in Loc. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.</hi> Haer. xix. thus speaks of this passage: <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="40">40.

to be used, in order to the <hi>preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it: So am I apt to think, upon all these Accounts, that we ought to look upon our selves as yet more concern'd to Avoid <hi>such kind of Oaths,</hi> as far as it may be in our power so to do, rather than <hi>any others.</hi>

the Abstaining from those <hi>lesser Modes</hi> of <hi>Swearing</hi> here <hi>referr'd</hi> to; and, I believe, <hi>forbidden</hi> too by our <hi>Saviour:</hi> It may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd;</p>

               <p n="45">45.

               </p>
               <p n="34">34. NOW that I thus make out. The only Solid Reason that can be given why Men should ever <hi>Swear at all,</hi> is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its Usefulness, or rather Necessity, for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of what they say.

Were there no such thing as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> or <hi>Envy; Interest,</hi> or <hi>Design; Covetousness,</hi> or <hi>Injustice; Lying,</hi> or <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> known among us.

               </p>
               <p n="35">35.

               <p>For tho' this be a <hi>Sin</hi> which has neither any <hi>Pleasure,</hi> nor <hi>Profit,</hi> to recommend it; nor should Men therefore, one would think, be apt to be tempted to it: Yet alas! Experience shews us, that even <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>

               <p n="39">39. THIS is so just a Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it is, perhaps, the Only Account that can be given, How Men Come to <hi>Swear</hi> so <hi>Ordinarily,</hi> and upon <hi>such little Occasions,</hi> as they do: In such <hi>Cases,</hi> where there is neither any manner of <hi>need</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi> for the <hi>confirmation</hi> of what they <hi>speak</hi>; nor have they, often times, any such <hi>design</hi> in it.

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106438:84"/>40. SO easily are Men brought to <hi>Profane</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God!</hi> And such a Mischievous Influence has the Practice of <hi>Common-Swearing,</hi> begun at first by a few Profligate Men, had, to spread a General Contempt of the Divine Majesty over the Face of the Earth; and to weaken One of the most <hi>Sacred Bonds</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> that was ever given to Mankind.</p>
               <p n="41">41. AND this brings me to the next Ill-Effect, which this <hi>Customary Swearing</hi> has had, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the <hi>Foregoing:</hi> And that is,</p>
               <p>(2dly.) To take off from the <hi>Reverence</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and from that due Regard which ought to be had to it.</p>
               <p n="42">42. THAT <hi>Perjury</hi> is a Sin both too lightly Consider'd, and too commonly Practis'd among Us; is too plainly seen, and has,


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106438:85"/>
I believe, been too sensibly felt likewise, by many of us, to suffer us to make any doubt of it.

               <p n="43">43.

of a little more <hi>Solemnity</hi> to it?

An <hi>Oath</hi> is only terrible to a Young Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: To him who Considers what it is; and who has the Fear of God's Knowledge and Justice, still Vigorous upon his Mind. But to him who <hi>Swears</hi> every Hour that he lives; who Trafficks with it, and could not tell how to carry on his Business without it: Who <hi>Swears</hi> with as little Concern as he <hi>Talks</hi>; and <hi>Values</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> no more than he does a <hi>Common Lie:</hi> What can we expect but that as such a <hi>One's Regard</hi> to this <hi>Sacred Tie</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>small</hi>; so his <hi>Care</hi> to answer the <hi>End</hi> of it should be proportionably <hi>small</hi> too.</p>

as to be able to do this, what is there left to restrain them from a <hi>General State</hi> of <hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion?</hi> It is but proceeding upon the same <hi>Principles,</hi> and doing that in the <hi>Other Instances</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which they do in This: And why they should not do so, if ever their <hi>Passions</hi> or their <hi>Interests</hi> should prompt them to it, I cannot see; and we need not question but that they will go on accordingly.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Wherein an Enquiry is made into the <hi>Causes</hi> Both of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>False-Swearing,</hi> which so much Abounds in the World: And some <hi>Directions</hi> are Offer'd for the better <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> of <hi>Both</hi> of Them.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I HAVE now done with our <hi>Saviour's Discourse,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Point of <hi>Swearing</hi>; and might with that, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably enough concluded my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon <hi>This Subject.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are some things which I could not so well refer to any of those <hi>Heads</hi> I have before <hi>treated</hi> of; which yet, I conceive, may usefully be observed by us upon


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106438:88"/>
this Occasion: I shall chuse rather to put them together, a little out of place, than wholly to pass them by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. NOW the Summ of what I would farther propose, for finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this whole Subject, may be Reduced to these two General Heads:</p>
               <p>I<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> I will consider, How it comes to pass, that Men are so <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> almost upon <hi>Every Occasion</hi>; and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Venture, even to <hi>Forswear</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>And having given such an Account as may be necessary of this Matter, I will go on,</p>
               <p>II<hi rend="sup">dly,</hi> To Offer some particular <hi>Directions,</hi> for the better <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> and <hi>Prevention</hi> of <hi>Both</hi> those <hi>Evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:106438:89"/>3. AND, 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> Let us consider, How it comes to pass, that after all our <hi>Saviour</hi> has said to the contrary; yet we see Men, nevertheless, not only so <hi>Forward</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> almost upon every Occasion; but too often Venturing even to <hi>Forswear</hi> Themselves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IN the Prosecution of which Enquiry, it is not my Intention to make any laborious Search into the <hi>Causes</hi> of that <hi>Common-Swearing</hi> which has so <hi>Vniversally,</hi> almost, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi> in the <hi>World</hi>; and makes up a Great part of Mens <hi>Ordinary Discourse</hi> with one another. For tho' that be, without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, a very <hi>Grievous Sin,</hi> yet is it withal a very <hi>Vnaccountable</hi> One too. A <hi>Sin</hi> which Men commit to <hi>Serve</hi> no <hi>End</hi>; to <hi>Gratifie</hi> no <hi>Lust</hi>; to <hi>Carry</hi> on no <hi>Business by.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Profit</hi>; without <hi>Pleasure</hi>; I


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106438:89"/>
had almost said, and without <hi>Temptation</hi> too. In short; A <hi>Sin</hi> by which they <hi>Dishonour God,</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi> their own <hi>Souls,</hi> to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: but do the Work of the Devil, without that Common-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement which, in most other Cases, he allows wicked Men, to reward their doing of it. So that for ought I know, the <hi>Best Account</hi> that can be given, why Men ever fall into this <hi>Sin</hi> at all, is; That they have slipp'd into the <hi>Habit</hi> of it, they know not how: and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> has made it a <hi>Fashionable Vice.</hi> They look upon it as a <hi>Modish Way</hi> of <hi>Discourse</hi>; and think it would bring an Imputation upon their <hi>Breeding,</hi> if they should altogether Forbear it: And render their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation <hi>Flat,</hi> and <hi>Insipid</hi>; for want of that <hi>Profaneness,</hi> which indeed is, many times, the only thing that is remarkable in it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106438:90"/>5. BUT this is not that <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I am now concern'd for: Nor do we find that our <hi>Saviour</hi> has had any regard for such <hi>Sinners</hi> as these. If Men will run into <hi>Evil Habits</hi> without Need, it is but fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they should Perish without Pity: And not expect to be argued out of a <hi>Vice,</hi> which is so far from having any Shew of <hi>Reason</hi> to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie</hi> it; that it has not so much as any <hi>Temptation,</hi> that may serve to make an <hi>Excuse</hi> for it. The <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> I am now speaking of, is of another nature, and practised by a better sort of Men. By such as acknowledge the <hi>Obligation,</hi> tho' they do not sufficiently consider the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of an <hi>Oath:</hi> And for that reason allow themselves, on every little Occasion, to flee to the Use of it; as long as they do but take care not to <hi>confirm</hi> any thing, but what is <hi>true,</hi> by it. And whence it comes to pass, that so many, even among the higher rank of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106438:90"/>
are yet thus <hi>forward</hi> to <hi>Swear</hi>; is the first thing I proposed to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. AND here (1st.) It may be consider'd, that every one, who has any sense of Probity remaining in him, <hi>desires</hi> to be <hi>Believed</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in what he <hi>seriously Affirms</hi> or <hi>Denies:</hi> And cannot but think it very hard to be suspected of any <hi>Falseness</hi> and <hi>Vntruth</hi> in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</hi> Besides that, often times, it may be of Concern to him that he <hi>should</hi> be <hi>Believed:</hi> And to leave his Veracity in doubt, may prove not only to his Disgrace, but to his Damage also.</p>
               <p n="7">7. NOW <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are Two of the <hi>Dearest Things</hi> in the World to most Men; and the Love of which they can the most hardly overcome. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>these</hi> shall prompt a Man rather to <hi>confirm</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of what he speaks with an <hi>Oath,</hi> than to run the hazard of suffering in <hi>one,</hi>


                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106438:91"/>
or, it may be, in <hi>both</hi> of them; there had need be a deep sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and a very awful dread of an <hi>Oath</hi> indeed, rooted in a Man's Heart, to keep him from so doing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. LET us add to this, (2dly) That unreasonable <hi>Jealousie</hi> which abounds in Mankind towards each other; and moves them upon the least appearance of Reason; nay, and often-times without any; to <hi>suspect one another.</hi> Hence it is that if a <hi>Matter</hi> be but of never so little <hi>importance</hi>; if it be for a Man's <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> or <hi>disadvantage</hi>; for his <hi>pleasure,</hi> or <hi>trouble,</hi> to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of it: It is seldom known that they will be satisfied with the <hi>bare Word</hi> of him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it unto them; or with any thing less, than his <hi>Swearing</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of what he says. And if, out of <hi>Conscience</hi> to his <hi>Duty,</hi> and being <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>break</hi> in upon the <hi>Sacredness</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> he should


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106438:91"/>
chance to <hi>refuse</hi> so to do; it is great odds but he shall be <hi>urged</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi> to it: And hardly avoid the censure of <hi>speaking falsly</hi> from those, who having no respect for an <hi>Oath</hi> themselves, will not easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that another should have any higher regard to it; or refuse to <hi>Swear</hi> upon any other account than this, that he is conscious to himself that what he says is <hi>false</hi>; and therefore he dares not <hi>Swear</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are, even among the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort of Men, who by this means are betray'd into an undue Usage of an <hi>Oath:</hi> And chuse rather to <hi>Swear,</hi> when otherwise they would not do it, than to bear the <hi>Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of those to whom they speak, by a <hi>peremptory refusal</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. AGAIN (3dly) To Men who have either no <hi>true sense</hi> at all of <hi>Religion</hi> upon their <hi>Minds</hi>; or have not sufficiently consider'd the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and convinced


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106438:92"/>
themselves thereby how much the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is concern'd in our using of it; and how cautious we, therefore, ought to be, upon what Occasions we do <hi>Swear:</hi> The <hi>custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary forwardness</hi> which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of in most Men to recur to <hi>this way</hi> of <hi>confirming</hi> what they say, may be, and (I believe) has been, a great <hi>inducement,</hi> to the over-easie <hi>practice</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THERE are few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians so ignorant as not to know, that <hi>Perjury</hi> is a very <hi>hainous Sin,</hi> and such as may not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without the <hi>Peril</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But yet there may be many who are still to learn, that to <hi>Swear</hi> upon a <hi>small occasion,</hi> tho' a Man <hi>swears</hi> nothing but the <hi>truth,</hi> is of its self <hi>criminal</hi>; and, as such, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden</hi> in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Now such Persons as these, being sensible how usual it is for Men to do this, look no farther; but follow on as they see others go before them;


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106438:92"/>
nor feel any <hi>Remorse</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> for doing that, which they never understood had any great harm in it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. AND that which may possibly have contributed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in this practice is; that they see themselves call'd upon to <hi>Swear,</hi> so very <hi>often,</hi> not only in their <hi>own Private Concerns,</hi> but even by <hi>Publick Authority.</hi> For since <hi>Charity,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to think that nothing is done by <hi>that</hi> but upon the most <hi>mature deliberation</hi>; and we know how great a number of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good Men</hi> must concur to the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of a <hi>Law</hi> with us; whose <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> we <hi>cannot,</hi> and whose <hi>Piety</hi> we <hi>ought not</hi> to doubt of: It is but reasonable to conclude, that they had certainly a <hi>due Regard</hi> to the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>; and would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to <hi>Swear</hi> on any <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> in which they esteem'd it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106438:93"/>
                  <hi>unlawful,</hi> or <hi>unseemly</hi> for us to do it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. HOW far such Reasoning as this may have disposed some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Persons to <hi>Swear</hi> more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> and upon <hi>lesser occasions</hi> than they ought to do, I cannot tell: But I think it may deserve to be consider'd, Whether the <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>Cases</hi> wherein not our <hi>Laws</hi> only, but those of all other Countries, do <hi>oblige,</hi> or, at least, <hi>allow</hi> Men to <hi>Swear</hi>; may not have somewhat contributed to that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness</hi> of doing it, which we see and complain of in them, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions: And have disposed them to be more <hi>ready,</hi> than they ought to be, to <hi>recur</hi> to an <hi>Oath</hi> in such <hi>Cases,</hi> wherein there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> nor any <hi>Excuse</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> for their doing of it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I SHALL offer but one Account more of this Unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Readiness</hi> of Men to <hi>Swear</hi>;


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106438:93"/>
And that is (4thly) From the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal which some, of late, have made of <hi>All Swearing</hi> whatsoever: And in <hi>opposition</hi> to whose <hi>Errour,</hi> some may possibly have been so unwary as to run into the <hi>contrary Extreme</hi>; and to have concluded, that so far is it from being <hi>unlawful</hi> to <hi>Swear</hi> in <hi>any Case,</hi> that, rather, there is <hi>none</hi> so <hi>small</hi> in which they may not freely do it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. IT is the Infirmity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of more Warmth than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are always in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes:</hi> And think the only way to secure themselves from Error, is to fly as far from it as they can. Not considering that there may be as little <hi>Reason</hi> in <hi>one Extreme,</hi> as in <hi>another</hi>; and that, according to the old Remark, <hi>Truth,</hi> as well as <hi>Vertue,</hi> is seldom found in <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. THUS some out of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-eager Opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> have cast off <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; and for

fear of <hi>Superstition,</hi> would have all <hi>Decency</hi> thrown out of the <hi>Church.</hi> And I verily believe we had not seen at this day so much <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> among us, had not the <hi>detestation</hi> of some Mens <hi>Hypocritical Pretences</hi> to <hi>Godliness,</hi> first prompted on others to fly out into a <hi>Loosness</hi> of <hi>Living,</hi> and from thence into a <hi>Neglect</hi> of every thing that is <hi>Sacred.</hi> And how far this Vice of <hi>Common-Swearing</hi> may have gotten Grounds by the same Means, and have been improved too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest; I shall leave it to those who have consider'd, from what <hi>Time</hi> it has begun more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>prevail among us,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p n="16">16. SUCH therefore may, I suppose, have been the <hi>Causes</hi> of that <hi>Readiness</hi> which we find in Men to <hi>Swear,</hi> even upon the most <hi>common,</hi> and <hi>unjustifiable Occasions.</hi> But now, as for the other <hi>Sin</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that of <hi>Perjury</hi>; I can scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106438:95"/>
tell to what <hi>Cause</hi> to ascribe the little Concern which many shew of <hi>falling</hi> into <hi>that</hi>; because, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I can scarcely tell what <hi>Cause</hi> should be <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>harden</hi> their <hi>Consciences</hi> against it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. THAT the <hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>Swearing,</hi> and the <hi>little Occasions</hi> on which Men sometimes allow themselves in the <hi>Practice</hi> of it, may have very much taken off from their <hi>Reverence</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> I can easily believe; and by that means have disposed them to <hi>Swear</hi> more <hi>carelesly,</hi> and with <hi>lesser consideration</hi> than they ought to do.</p>
               <p n="18">18. THAT by their <hi>often</hi> and <hi>careless Swearing,</hi> they may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sometimes have incurr'd the Guilt of <hi>Perjury, unawares</hi>; and by that means have been unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made acquainted with it; I do not doubt.</p>
               <p n="19">19. BUT yet still, to <hi>Swear falsly,</hi> where a Man <hi>knows</hi> what he <hi>does</hi>; and <hi>deliberately Designs</hi> so <hi>to


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106438:96"/>
do</hi>; this adds so much not only to <hi>Common-Swearing,</hi> but even to an <hi>Vnwilling Perjury</hi> also; that a Man ought to become a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in Wickedness, before he can bring his Mind to it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. THIS therefore is a Sin which I can ascribe to no other <hi>Cause</hi> than that of a <hi>Profane Heart,</hi> and a <hi>Hardned Conscience.</hi> Whether it be that a Man falls into it through an <hi>absolute Infidelity</hi>; or that by a <hi>long, habitual Continuance</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> he is at last become <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> and is given up to be <hi>led Captive by Satan at his Will.</hi> For otherwise, <hi>Perjury</hi> is a Crime of so detestable a Nature, and which has so much of the <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> in it; that were there but any <hi>Spark</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the <hi>Soul,</hi> it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible a Man should ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to <hi>commit</hi> it: Or having <hi>once committed</hi> it, should be able to endure his own Torments; much


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106438:96"/>
less should ever return to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it again.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I SHALL therefore seek no farther for the <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>Sin</hi>; but shall confidently conclude, that the <hi>Habit</hi> of it can proceed from nothing less than an <hi>Vtter Dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God,</hi> and an <hi>Extinction</hi> of <hi>All Sense</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in the <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. WHICH being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; Let us now go on,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="23">23. AND, 1<hi rend="sup">st:</hi> For what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Point of <hi>Perjury</hi>; As I have now shewn, that a Man must be arrived to an Extraordinary Pitch of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> before he can <hi>allow</hi> himself in the <hi>commission</hi> of it; so I know no way there is to draw Men off from that, but only


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106438:97"/>
to <hi>awaken</hi> their <hi>Consciences,</hi> if it may be, to a serious <hi>Consideration</hi> of their <hi>Sins</hi>; and by that Means to bring them to a sincere <hi>Conversion</hi> from them.</p>
               <p n="24">24. INDEED could even Charity its self warrant us to think, that it were possible for Men to be so far deluded, as not to know <hi>False-Swearing,</hi> I do not say to be a <hi>Sin,</hi> but to be a most <hi>hainous</hi> and <hi>damnable Offence</hi>; such a <hi>Sin</hi> for which <hi>God</hi> has no <hi>Pity</hi>; and it may almost be question'd whether he will afford Men his <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Repentance</hi> of it; there might then be also some <hi>hope,</hi> that by a better <hi>Information</hi> of their <hi>Judgments,</hi> as to this Matter, they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be <hi>reclaimed</hi> from it.</p>
               <p n="25">25. BUT when such is the <hi>Notoriousness</hi> of this <hi>Crime,</hi> that 'tis impossible any one should fall into it without <hi>knowing</hi> that he does at the same time <hi>Defie God,</hi> and <hi>make</hi> a <hi>Mock</hi> of <hi>Damnation</hi>; we


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106438:97"/>
must conclude that 'tis in vain to hope by any <hi>particular Applications</hi> to <hi>Correct</hi> this <hi>Evil:</hi> And that we must resolve either to reduce such a Person to a <hi>general sense</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi>; or to leave him in the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> as well as under the <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>other sins.</hi>

And how little <hi>that Law</hi> has, of late Years, been either <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,</hi> or <hi>Executed,</hi> as it ought to have been; is a <hi>Reflection</hi> that may deserve the <hi>Consideration</hi> of many among us.</p>
               <p n="41">41. IN the mean time we all now know how that Ancient, and almost Antiquated <hi>Law,</hi> is not only <hi>Revived,</hi> but <hi>Improved</hi> too, in order to <hi>this End:</hi> And such Care taken, that if we would but heartily set our selves to it, I cannot but think we should soon put an end to a great part of that <hi>Prophane Swearing</hi> that has of late so scandalously prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us.</p>
               <p n="42">42. AND to engage us so to do, give me leave to say but this


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106438:103"/>
one thing; that for any of us to <hi>neglect</hi> our <hi>Duty</hi> in this <hi>Particular</hi>; is, in effect, to <hi>consent</hi> to every such <hi>Act,</hi> as we refuse to <hi>bring to light.</hi> It is to <hi>abet</hi> the <hi>taking of God's Name in vain:</hi> And then let us fear lest we share in the <hi>Punishment,</hi> as we do partake in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="43">43. BUT (6thly.) and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude these Reflections: As it is certain that nothing has more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Practice both of <hi>False-Swearing,</hi> and of <hi>Common-Swearing,</hi> among us, than the Want of that due <hi>Reverence</hi> Men ought to have of an <hi>Oath</hi>; so I know no way more likely to <hi>reclaim Men</hi> from the Practice of <hi>both,</hi> than to Endeavour, as far as may be, to Restore the Use of an <hi>Oath</hi> to its just <hi>Veneration</hi>; and to bring Men, if it be possible, to a more <hi>Sacred Esteem</hi> of it. And in order thereunto, as it is certainly the Duty of <hi>Private Persons,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Swear at all,</hi> but when some more than ordinary <hi>Occasion</hi> shall


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106438:103"/>
require their doing of it; so were it much to be wish'd, that the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that an <hi>Oath</hi> should never be <hi>imposed</hi> upon, nor <hi>required</hi> of any, but upon some <hi>greater Exigence</hi>; to be sure, more <hi>seldom</hi> than now it is. And that when it is required, such Care should be taken in <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string</hi> of it, as to Raise in Mens Minds a serious Consideration of what they are about: At least that it should be so done, as not to prompt them to a <hi>Dis-esteem</hi> of it; through an <hi>over-hasty,</hi> and <hi>irreverent Dispensing</hi> of this <hi>great Obligation.</hi>

And for <hi>Engagements</hi> to move every one of us to use our best Endeavour in the Accomplishment of so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> a <hi>Design</hi>; I shall only add thus much, to what I have already

But if by our <hi>Perjury</hi> we should chance not only to have <hi>abused</hi> the <hi>Majesty of God,</hi> but to have <hi>ruined</hi> our <hi>Neighbour</hi> too: Should we have <hi>Robb'd</hi> him of his <hi>Estate,</hi> his <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> or even of his very <hi>Life</hi> its self; and in none of all which we can make him any tolerable <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation:</hi> How can we ever hope that <hi>God</hi> will be <hi>reconciled</hi> to us; whilst we lie under such an utter Incapacity of ever making an <hi>amends</hi> to our <hi>Neighbour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="48">48. AND then, lastly; For the <hi>Interest</hi> which the <hi>Publick</hi> has in the <hi>Suppression</hi> of such <hi>Swearing</hi>; I have already shewn that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> are the great <hi>Bases</hi> on which

all <hi>Society</hi> is <hi>founded</hi>; and without which there could be no <hi>Peace,</hi> no <hi>Security,</hi> no <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> in the World.
