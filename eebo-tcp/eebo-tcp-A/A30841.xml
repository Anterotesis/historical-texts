         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Illustrious Princess,
MARY,
DUTCHESS OF
NORFOLK.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Tragedy of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> tho' forbidden
the Stage, has acted its Part almost as publick;
particularly, your Grace has been acquainted
with its Misfortune, having done It the Honour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it in Sheets, and because your Noble Father the Earl
of <hi>Peterborough</hi> (whose Name I shall never mention with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my greatest Zeal and Respect) has vouchsaft me the
Charity, to protect it against it's Enemies, and to stand
betwixt his Royal Highness and them; the worst of
which, and indeed the only Persons in their Stations, to do
me such an Injury, I have cause to believe, were they that
took the same Course, and with as much Reason, to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the Play of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which was the first that
got Them and Theirs Money and Reputation. I present it to
your Grace, with those few Alterations which his Royal
Highness, the best of Judges, was pleas'd to mark with
his own Hand, and I shou'd not have presum'd to put
it in Print, without following those most judicious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments,
with which He was pleas'd to consent to
the Acting of it; till the same evil Spirits, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or others (for I have heard, it has been protested,
This Play shou'd never be Acted, if they cou'd hinder
it) in contradiction to his Royal Highness's Pleasure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:50773:3"/>
it was in Favour to Me, incens'd the King
with a wrong Interpretation of the Scenes, or of the Story;
tho', I make no doubt, but his most Sacred Majesty,
by your Graces Means, when he considers what a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Loss it has been to an unfortunate and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and shall look on it in Print, but he will soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Loyalty of the Writing, and be of the same
Opinion with his Royal Brother, in permitting it to be
Acted. And now, Madam, after I have told my own
pitiful Tale, I am afraid to approach your Grace, least
it should be thought Design in me, as most Dedications
to Persons of your high Rank are branded with, and that
Flattery is the side-Wind or Byas that carries them, tho'
about, the surest Way to their Aim; but I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Thought of it, has embolden'd Me, that it
is Prophaneness, to think Nobility and Graces like Yours,
are of that Allay, which either can, or will be flatter'd;
for who dares imagine, when I am to speak to the Dutchess
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> (the next of Quality to the Royal Family, in
the three Kingdoms) that I can say enough of her admired
Character? You are joyn'd by Heaven, to a Prince, who is
the true Inheritor of all the Virtues and Greatness, as
well as the Blood of that Illustrious Duke, the Hero in
the Play; to say more, in whose Praise, is to repeat his
Character, that I have fill'd all the Scenes with; I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add this observation; Never Man was more brave, nor
more unfortunate, unhappy, that he dy'd for his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his Truth, and succouring the distrest, and happy
that he will have the Glory of it to Eternity; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his Joys, looks down from Heaven, and sees You in
his Princely Off-springs Arms, a Reward, that only can
exceed his Injuries; since from those chast Embraces, he
hopes will proceed a Race of Successors, that will make
<pb facs="tcp:50773:3"/>
the noblest and best of Houses flourish, whilst the Stars
shine, or the World lasts. You are such an early Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Wit, that like young <hi>Alexander,</hi> you travell'd o're,
and conquer'd all that rare World, sooner, and in a lesser
time, than others have learn'd their Mother Tongue, as if
it were inspir'd, not study'd; and as Heaven, tho' it be
Heaven, wou'd not be admir'd, nor perspicuous to Mens
Eyes, unless the Sun were in it, to attract the Sight; so
the Divine Power has given you so many excellent Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to adorn your other Parts, that whosoever sees so
glorious a Fabrick without, may be sure to find a richer
Furniture within; You are the only Person too, who
having so large a Portion of both, yet envy not the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them in others. Hail then Monarchess of
Wit and Beauty! (For all that have, or pretend to either,
are your Subjects) be pleas'd to accept of this Poem, it is
your Tribute, and though it be mean, 'tis like the poor
Womans Mite, It is my All, and best of Essays in this
Kind; yet, were it sure to survive as many years as <hi>Homers</hi>
Works, your Graces Name prefixt, will be the only Soul
that's moving in it, or can make the Pages deathless. I
dare say no more, for fear I shou'd commit more Faults,
but humbly beg leave to withdraw as Pilgrims from their
Shrine, to make a zealous and constant Repetition of this
to my self in private, with my Prayers for your eternal
Happiness, which shall ever be the Theme and Wishes of,</p>
