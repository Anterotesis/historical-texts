            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶The proheme of syr Thomas
Elyot knyghte.</head>
            <p>GOd, vnto whome all
mens hartis be opened,
and the wyll of manne
speakethe, is my wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that to the desire of
knowlege, whervnto I haue hither
to ben euer of my nature disposed / I
haue ioyned a constant intent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
therby to my natural countrey:
Whervnto acordyng to the sentence
of Tully, we be most specially bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Wherfore after that I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the more parte of my lyfe in
perusynge diligently euery auncient
warke, that I mought come by / ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greke or latine, conteyninge any
parte of philosophie necessary to the
institution of mans lyfe in vertue, I
haue endeuored my selfe to set forth
such part of my studie as I thought
mought be profitable to them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:671:3"/>
shulde happen to rede or here it.
But diuers men rather scornyng my
benefite than receyuing it thankfully
doo shewe them selfes offended (as
they say) with my strange termes.</p>
            <p>Other finding in my bokis the thing
dispreysed / whiche they do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende
in vsynge it. Lyke a galde horse abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
no playsters be alwaye gnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge
and kyckynge at suche exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and sentences as they do feele
sharpe or do byte them / accomptyng
to be in me no lyttell presumption,
that I wylle in notynge other mens
vices correct Magnificat, sens other
moche wyser men and better lerned
than I, doo forbeare to wryte any
thynge. And whiche is warse than
all this: Some wyll maliciously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
or coniecte that I wryte to the
intent to rebuke some perticuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone
couaytinge to brynge my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and afterward me into the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation
of some man in auctorytie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:671:3"/>
Thus vnthankfully is my benefyte
receyued / my good wyll consumed,
and all my labours deuoured. Such
is of some menne the nature serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
that lappyng swete mylke they
conuerte hit forthe with in to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to distroy hym of whose libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
they late had receyued it. How
incomparable be these men vnlyke
to the most excellent prince our most
dere soueraygne lorde? whose most
royall persone I hartily beseche god
to preserue in longe life and honour.
His highnesse benignely receyuynge
my boke / whiche I named the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
in the redynge therof sone
perceyued that I intended to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Englyshe tongue, wherby
men shulde as well expresse more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
the thynge that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in theyr hartis (wherfore lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guage
was ordeyned) hauynge wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
apte for the pourpose: as also
interprete out of greke, latyn / or any
<pb facs="tcp:671:4"/>
other tonge into Englysshe, as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently / 
as out of any one of the said
tongues into an other. His grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
perceyued / that through out the
boke there was no terme new made
by me of a latine or frenche worde,
but it is there declared so playnly by
one mene or other to a diligent reder
that no sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is therby made derke
or harde to be vnderstande. Ne the
sharpe and quycke sentences, or the
rounde and playne examples set out
in the versis of Claudiane the poete
in the seconde boke / or in the chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Affablitie, Beneuolence, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence / 
and of the diuersitie of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers / 
and in dyuers other places / in
any parte offended his hyghnes: but
(as hit was by credible persones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
vnto me) his grace not onely
toke hit in the better parte, but also
with princely wordes ful of maiestie
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded my dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / simplicite &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in that I spared none astate in
<pb facs="tcp:671:4"/>
the rebukynge of vice: which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
full of very nobilite brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my remembraunce the vertuous
Emperour Antonine, called for his
wysdom Antonine the philosopher,
who on a tyme herynge that there
was in the Citie of Rome a playne &amp;
rude persone / whiche alwaye spake
in the rebuke of all men, and neuer
praised any man: he sent to hym / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirynge
that he wolde come and
speke with hym. And whan he was
come, the Emperour had these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
vnto hym. My frende / wherin
haue I euer offended the? The felow
therwith soore abasshed answered
in this wise. Sir your hyghnes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
offended me, that I am ware of.
Than art thou (sayd the Emperour)
an vncourtoyse subiecte, that thou
haste so longe dissembled with me,
not tellyng vnto me my faultes.</p>
            <p>And after the Emperoure reteyned
hym styll gyuyng vnto hym dowble
<pb facs="tcp:671:5"/>
wages / commaundynge hym to vse
his olde libertie. And whan dyuers
men meruayled therat, he affirmed
openly, that princis vices were soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
espied by other men tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them
selfes: and that there was moche
more difficultie in remembring them
of their vice or lack, than in extolling
and commendynge their vertues.</p>
            <p>So well dyd this mooste noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
consider, that his exaumple
mought be more profitable vnto the
publyke weale of the citie, than any
other thynge in his persone or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>¶In lyke wise our moste dere soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne
lorde perfectly knew that no
writar ought to be blamed, whiche
wryteth neyther for hope of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rewarde / nor for any priuate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
or malyce, but onely of ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
zele towarde good occupation and
vertu. Perdie man is not so yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med
in grace, that he can not do syn.
<pb facs="tcp:671:5"/>
And I suppose no prince thynkethe
hym selfe to be exempte from morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
And for as moche as he shall
haue mo occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to fall, he ought to
haue the moo frendes or the more
instruction to warne hym. And as
for my parte I eftesones do protest,
that in no boke of mi making I haue
intended to touche more one manne
than an nother. For there be Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos
in Spayne as wel as in Grece,
Pasquilles in Englande as welle as
in Rome, Dionises in Germanye as
welle as in Sicile, Harpocrates in
France as wel as in Aegipt, Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
in Scotlande as well as in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,
Platos be fewe, and them I
doubte where to fynde. And if men
wyll seke for them in Englande / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
I sette in other places, I can nat
lette them. I knowe well ynowghe
dyuers do delyte to haue theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the facion of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
and that whiche is mooste
<pb facs="tcp:671:6"/>
playne is vnplesant: but yet it doth
happen sometyme that one man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
in auctorytie or fauour of his
prince, beinge sene to weare somme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
of the old facion: for the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
therof it is taken vp ageine with
many good felowes. What I doo
meane euery wyse man perceyueth.
Touchynge the title of my boke, I
considered that wisedome is spoken
of, moch more than vsed. For wher
in it resteth fewe menne be sure. The
commune opinion is into thre partis
deuided. One sayeth it is in moche
lernynge and knowledge. An other
affirmeth / that they whiche do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducte
the affayres of greatte prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
or countrayes, be onely wyse
men. Nay saythe the thyrde, he is
wysest that leste dothe meddle, and
can sytte quietly at home and tourne
a crabbe, and looke onely vnto his
owne busynesse. Nowe they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be of the fyrste oppinion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
<pb facs="tcp:671:6"/>
at varyance. For somme doo
chiefly extoll the study of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it is rayson) but while they
do wrest it to agree with theyr wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
ambition, or vayne glory, of the
mooste noble and deuoute lernynge,
they doo endeuor them to make hit
seruile and full of contention. Some
do preferre the studie of the lawes
of this realme, callynge it the onely
studye of the publyke weale. But a
great noumbre of persones, whiche
haue consumed in sute more thanne
the value of that, that they used for,
in theyr angre do cal it a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.
All thoughe vndoubtedly
the verye selfe lawe trewely prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised / 
passeth the lawes of all other
countrayes. In thynkynge on these
sondrye opynyons, I happened
for my recreacyon to reede in the
booke of Laertius the lyfe of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and beholdynge the aunswere
that he made to kynge Dyonyse,
<pb facs="tcp:671:7"/>
at the fyrste syghte it semed to me to
be very dissolute and lackyng the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>destie
that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to a philosopher:
but whan I had better examined it,
therein appered that whiche is best
worthy to be called wysedome.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to exercyse my wytre, and
to auoyde Idelnes, I toke my penne
and assayde / Howe in expressyng my
conceyte I mought profyte to them,
whiche without disdayne or enuye
wolde often tymes reade it. If any
man wyll thinke the boke to be very
longe, let hym consyder, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of wysedome can not be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared. All be hit of them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be well wyllinge it is soone ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
in good faythe sooner thanne
Primero or Gleeke: Suche is the
straunge propretie of that excellent
counnynge, that it is sooner lerned,
than taught, and better by a mannes
rayson than by an instructour.</p>
            <p>Finally if the reders of my warkis,
<pb facs="tcp:671:7"/>
by the noble example of our mooste
dere soueraygne lorde do iustly and
louyngely interprete my labours, I
durynge the residue of my lyfe wyll
nowe and than sette forthe suche
frutes of my study profitable (as I
trust) vnto this my countray. And le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge
malycious reders with their
incurable fury, I wyll say vnto god
the wordes of the Catholike Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in the booke of Sapience:<note place="margin">Sap<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 15.</note> To
knowe the good lorde is perfecte
Iustice / And to knowe thy Iustyce
and vertue is the very roote of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalite:
And therin is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
that is very wysedome.</p>

Well, though there were some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

for sens thou departiddest from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
I haue ben twise in the poynt to
haue died / and also twise solde for a

mayst with good rayson say, that I
am well founden, that haue bene so
often in perile to be loste. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menly
men do calle hym lost, which
despayreth of his lyfe / or of a free
man is made a slaue. But whither
that opinion be true or no, we shall

               <p>I do not a litle

For whan I went from kinge Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise,

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:671:10"/>
Moreouer he regarded nothynge
that was spoken, except it were by
thy sentence approued. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
as sone as he was out of his
bedde Plato was sent for. Vneth
Dion and Aristomenes coulde gette
of hym one houre in the daye / that
thou moughtist teache them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towardely gentilmen such part
of Philosophie as they desyred to
lerne. Finally for the incomparable
fauour that the kynge bare to the,
thou were had in the courte almoste
in as moche reuerence as the kinges
owne person. And whan thou pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siddest
by, noble men &amp; other of the
kinges household / wold rise quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; as a storme had falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,

<pb facs="tcp:671:11"/>
of other men, of whome there was
a great noumbre, which had / some

               <speaker>PLA.</speaker>
               <p>Thou sayest trouth
Aristippus / &amp; that perceiue I more
clerely now, than I did before those
thinges hapned vnto me. But now
wyll I recite the my storie.</p>
               <p>¶Sone after that thou haddist op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
licence of the king to go vnto
Athenes / he becam wonderful stour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
in so moche as no man mought
blame any thing / wherin he delited:
nor prayse any thinge, whiche was
contrary to that / that he vsed. And
that sobre and gentyll maner in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
sondry opinions raisoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hym / whereto of a custome he
was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to prouoke the &amp; me, was
laide aparte / and supposinge that by
heringe of sondry philosophers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and raison, he him selfe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:671:11"/>
to a more perfect knowledge
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other that spake vnto hym,
began to haue all other men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte.
And as it were Iupyter / 
who (as Homere saythe) with a
wynke made all heuen to shake / he
wold with a terrible countenaunce
so visage them / whome he knewe
wold speake theyr opinions freely,
that they shulde dreede to saye any
thinge / which they knewe shulde be
contrary vnto his appetite. Not
withstandynge on a tyme he willed
me to declare in his presence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of a kynge, and howe moch he
excelled and was aboue the astate of
any other person: which request I
gladly herde / thinkinge to haue had
good oportunitie to warne hym of
his blyndenes and foly. Therfore
I began to commende the perfect y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or fygure of god, which was
manifest in the astate of a king, who
ruled hym selfe and his people for
<pb facs="tcp:671:12"/>
the vniuersal weale of them al. And
whan I had described his auctorite
and preeminence by the excellency of
his vertues: prouinge that nothyng
moughte be amended, but by that
whiche surmounted or was better
than it whiche was to be corrected / 
as vice by vertu, falshode by truthe,
wrong by Iustice, foly by wisedom,
ignoraunce by lernynge / and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lyke. Afterward I studiousely
dyd sette out a Tyraunte in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre
colours, who attendeth to his
owne priuate commoditie.</p>
               <p>¶Here at kynge Dionise frowned
and became angry. And interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
my wordes sayd vnto me:</p>
               <p>This is a tale of old fooles / that can
not be otherwyse occupied. And I
aunswered agayne, that those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of his / sauored of Tyranny.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>ARI.</speaker>
               <p>I meruaile Plato that thou
spakest, so vnavisedly: I do meane,
sens thou knewest wel inough kinge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:671:12"/>
Dionise nature and disposicion / that
thou perceuinge hym to be meued,
woldest so sodaynly imbrayde hym
of his wordes so despitefully.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>PL.</speaker>
               <p>Well as for that / we shal raison ther
of hereafter. Finally I was wel aui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
what I wolde speke: but nowe
wyl I tell furth my tale, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afterward to me.</p>
               <p>¶Syr, the kynge beinge inflamed
with fury / furthwith wolde haue
slaine me. But beinge intreated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
by Dion and Aristome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
he withdrewe his sentence / not
withstandynge to the intente that
he wolde be auenged, he gaue me to
Polidis / who was thanne Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
sente to hym from the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians.
Who hadde me with
hym to Aegina, and there solde me.
Nowe a littell before there was an
ordinaunce made in that Countray,
that if any man of Athenes came in
to that Ile, he shulde immediately
<pb facs="tcp:671:13"/>
lose his hedde: whiche ordinaunce
was made by Charmander thanne
beinge capitayne of that countray / 
who espieng me / and knowing who
I was, caused me to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and brought vnto the place of
Iudgement / requiringe that on me
his sayd ordinaunce mought be put
in execution. Whervnto I made no
defence, but takynge myne aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
paciently, and contemning deth
as it became me / I abode my Iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
At the last one, eyther in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite / 
or of purpose to saue therby
my lyfe, spekinge openly and with a
loude voyce, sayde to Charmander
and the Iudges: The ordinaunce if
it be well perceyued, is made again
men of Athenes: but Plato (that is
here) is a philosopher. Which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
as it hapned / were well taken &amp;
lawghed at of all them that were
present. And therewith they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
me of the sayde penaltie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:671:13"/>
All be hit for the hostilitie that was
than betwene them &amp; Athenes they
wolde not lette me freely departe,
but decreed that I shulde efte soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
be solde. There hapned to be at
that time Aniceris, which dwelleth
at Cyrenas / a man well lerned, who
payed for me. xx. li. and furthwith
deliuering to me his seruant, whom
thou beholdist here, hath sent me as
thou seest home to my contray: The
garmentes that I weare, he that
boughte me of Polidis toke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one
of his slaues / and gaue them vnto
me, whan he hadde taken from me
myne apparaile that I brought out
of Sicile: whiche as thou knowest
was right honest and competent.</p>
               <p>Not withstandinge neither the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
of king Dionise, nor the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
decree of the Aeginites mought
remoue my courage from vertu and
truthe / no more than the twise sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
of me, nor this vile habite of a
<pb facs="tcp:671:14"/>
slaue or bondman may chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge mine
astate or condicion.</p>
               <p>¶But nowe Aristippus I wyll an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
the to that / wherein thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to blame me of imprudence or
litenes: sayinge, thou meruay leste
that I wolde speake so vnauisedly / 
sens I knewe the nature of kynge
Dionise and his disposition. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brist
thou not, that my comminge in
to Sicile was to beholde the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
mountaines / which do sende
out of the toppes of them great fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of fyre and smoke, &amp; to inserche
out the naturall causis therof? And
that all though the kynge sent often
tymes for me / yet wolde I not come
vnto hym, for as moche as thrugh
all Grece he was named a Tiraunt.
At the laste he sente vnto me Dion / 
which is a man as thou knowest of
honour and grauitie almost incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable:
who said vnto me that the
kynge was incredibly meued with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:671:14"/>
desyre to se me, for the greatte fame
(as he affirmed) of wisedome and
knowledge / all thoughe I my
selfe knowe no suche thyng / to be in
me. And moreouer the same Dion
shewed me, that he supposed moch
profite shuld happen to the royalme
of Sicile by our metynge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication / 
the kinge presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdynge
and herynge in me that,
wherof he hathe so great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that is to saye (as I moughte
vse Dions worde) vertue and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

thou shuldest not be moch

being caused by the obiect or lette of

Lykewise as a thicke &amp; great cloude

               <p>Thou speakest not

cause / Ignoraunce in any of the sayd
artes or sciences doeth not make the
diuersitie that we nowe speake of.</p>
               <p>For if it shuld so do / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who so euer

it shuld folowe that he were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt,

as moche as without any instructor

losse of any thing / can perfectli make
waxe / hony, silke and copwebbes:
whiche no man can do like, nor by
none inuention canne attayne to the

And as for the bee and the spynner,
who so euer studiously do beholde
their warke / he shall se therin suche

the bee / at whose industry thou

the hiue is broken: he knoweth not

taketh his hony combes, &amp; putteth
hym out of his lodgyng, wheron he

               <p>Nor the spainell that is so ialouse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

because thou sayest so Plato / I haue

in myne opinion / by the translation

from a man to a beast, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
estsones vnto a man agayne: It
may be wel vnderstand in this wise.
That men beinge in the state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency

the soule hauinge the hole preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it
happen that the appetites and desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of the body so moch do increase,
that they haue the hole possession
of the body / and that the affections
of the soule, that is to saye / vertues

the lyfe becommeth beastely: than
loke in what beastes the sayde appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites

may be sayd hathe his soule in that

and wanton, in such a horse as thou
spakest of while ere. A cruel man or
Tyraunt in to a tigre or lion, a glot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

if one man happen to be possessed of
many vices / than is his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
more dyuers / and as I mought saye

thynge is more in them thanne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
Which beinge a thing beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

the soule recouereth her myght / and

which thou hast spoken.</p>
               <p>¶Fyrst if thou remembre thy selfe,
thou woldest not denie, but that
wisedome was knowledge. After
warde thou grauntiddest also, that
Ignoraunce was none other thynge
but lacke of knowlege, whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that Ignoraunce could be no
wisedome. And than dyddest thou
raison / that the diuersitie betwene
man and beast was onely ignorance.
And that Ignoraunce dyddest thou
suppose to be the lacke of knowlege
of them selfes / and other in the diuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sitie
of theyr kyndes. This was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well gathered of the, in myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
And the raison that folowed
by the example that thou dyddeste
putte of thy horse / the bee / and the
spaynell, was not vnfitte to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if thou woldest haue abyden
well by it. But by our mery digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in to Pythagoras regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / 
thou were brought from that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / 
<pb facs="tcp:671:40"/>
soner than thou shuldest haue
ben: whiche hapned vnto the / as it
doeth euer to them, whiche lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the / do folowe the concupiscence
and pleasaunt affectes of the body.
For lyke as they be vnstable, so the
folowers &amp; louers of them be euer in
constant: as well in their opinions
as in their actes. But if thou being
sometyme the herer of Socrates as
well as I was, haddest folowed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
his doctrine / accordyng as he
spake it / and also practised it by his
example of lyuyng / and haddest not
as a truant pycked out of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
suche matter as thou suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siddest
mought only maynteine thy
sensuall appetite / thou shuldest haue
perceyued what thou thy selfe had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
mente, whiche thou doest not
nowe / it varieth so moche from thy
profession. And peraduenture the
knowledge that we nowe seke for,
shuld neuer haue comen betwene vs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:671:40"/>
two in question. But it shulde haue
suffised to haue told to the, what I
sayde to kynge Dionise, and howe
he delte with me. And thou shuldest
sone haue iuged / if he had according
to mi merites intreted me. But now
Aristippus to thintent thou mayste
take some comforte of the sedes of
Socrates doctrine / which remayne
in the, but they wyll not springe / in
suche wyse as thou mayste see them / 
except I do water them with my de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>claration.
¶Fyrst remembre that
of all that whiche bereth the name
of a thynge / there be two kyndes,
one hath no bodye &amp; is euer stedfast
and permanent / the other hath a bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy,
but it is euer moueable &amp; vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein,
The first, bicause it may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
only / it is called intelligible.
The second, bicause it may be felt by
sensis it is called Sensible. The way
to know the fyrste is called raison, &amp;
the knowlege therof is namid vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.
<pb facs="tcp:671:41"/>
The way to know the. ii. is
called Sense or feling / the knowlege
therof is named Perceiuinge. More
ouer of that which is called Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
there is the fyrst &amp; the seconde.
In the fyrste is that portion of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
whiche is in man, wherby he
is made to the image and similitude
of god. In the other be noumbres
and figures. Of this beastes haue
no parte, neyther of the fyrste nor
yet of the seconde: of the fyrst I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thou wylte graunt me, and as
for the seconde experience wyl proue
it? for I dare saye / thou neuer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of beastes / that coude skylle of

               <p>And though an ape or other
lyke beaste / seme in takynge of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to obserue an ordre, as it were
in nombrynge / yet if it be well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered / 
it shall appere that it is by an
imagination ingendred of custome,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:671:41"/>
and not by nombrynge. I haue sene
a man, whiche was borne blynde,
and vsed to be ladde to thre or foure
houses in the citie, whiche hath ben
a great distance a sondre, at the laste
by custome hathe knowen so well
where they stode / that without any
man or dogge leadynge, or any man
tellynge hym / he hath gone directly
vnto them. Wherat fyrste I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
with many other, and whan
I communed with hym, I haue per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued
that he neuer obserued nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,
but that onely custome had set
the distance of the places in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
Like may be spoken of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
For that wherby beastes do
discerne one thinge from an other / is
not vnderstandynge / that is to saye
though they discerne in quantite the
more from the lasse, yet they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not, as rounde, quadraunt / 
or triangle / or in other lyke fygure:
but the simulacre or ymage / wherby
<pb facs="tcp:671:42"/>
they pecyue the sayd diuersite / is one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
by custome, formed &amp; imprinted in
the principal se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se, which is the hart.
And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing selfe is remoued
out of sight / that impression that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
is called imagination / who
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittith it forthwith vnto memori,
which vndouted is not only in men
but also in bestis, for thei discerne the
tyme present and that which is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but the tyme to com they know
not, &amp; Memory is onely of the time
passed. And therfore the bestes that
thou spakest of / doo perceiue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of thynges by imagination &amp;
Memorie, conceiuynge &amp; reteyninge
in the harte, whiche is the principall
sense or fountain of senses, the image
of the thynge that is sensible. And
therby the dogge perceyuethe his
mayster / &amp; fetcheth his gloue / which
he hath ben before taught for to do / 
&amp; goeth to the places where he hath
sene his maister bene a littell before.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:671:42"/>
But that he knoweth not whether
his maister be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a horse / Plato
or Demosthenes, a philosopher or
an oratour, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inough. For
although my dogge had abyden ten
yeres continually with me, and had
herde me euerye daye speake of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes / 
&amp; name hym an oratour / 
and herd the call me euery day Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

he wolde strayt brynge it vnto

the soule by the excludyng of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge

               <p>And than by the examples that I
haue rehersed / my conclusion in decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration
of prouidence is good &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
For if thou thynkest, that I
shulde haue proued those thynges
to haue ben so absolutely good / that
they mought not be to ani respect il,
than thou lackest that naturall wyt,
whiche all this whyle I supposed
hadde ben in the. For I wolde haue
thought that thou haddest knowen,
that nothynge is in this worlde so

As by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to declare it more plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly:
doest thou remembre Aristippus,

               <p>Ye I do reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre that

               <speaker>PLA.</speaker>
               <p>Nowe marke well A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.
The Oxe, which tilleth the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de,
beareth befe / wherwith man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryshed / 
&amp; his hyde serueth to make
shoen to saue mens feete from colde
and other anoyance. The shepe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
wolle to cladde with the body
of manne commodiously. And his
fleshe is good to be eaten / and where
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:671:70"/>
he lackethe puissaunce to drawe the
ploughe or the wayne / in stede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he goinge and lyinge on the lande
with his ordure and pysse / com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
the grounde, and maketh it
fertile and able to bere ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of corn.
Wherfore these two be sette in one
degree in the lyne of order. The
horse and all other beastes / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be lyke to that kynde, wylle
drawe or carye. And also their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
wylle serue to that pourpose / 
that the oxe hyde doeth. But theyr
fleshe is not apte to be eaten of men.
Wherfore they be a degree vnder
the other: And soo consequentely
all thynges as they be profytable
more or lasse vnto man / if he doo vse
them, so be they hygher or lower in
degree in the sayde lyne of order.</p>
               <p>And yf an Oxe or a shepe haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
flesshe on hym and sweete, he
is named therfore a good oxe or a
good shepe. If a horse or a mule wyl
<pb facs="tcp:671:71"/>
beare a great waight, &amp; go far iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayes,
he is named a good horse or
a good mule. And although a man
aduisedly or vnaduisedly doo eate
more beoffe or mutton than his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make
wyll beare, and therwith is
sicke / the oxe or the shepe ought not
therfore to be called ylle. Nor if a
man take awaye thy money or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes / 
and laye it on thyne owne
horse or mule, and carye hit awaye
with hym: this letteth not, but that
thy horse or mule shall be called styll
good. But if thou wylte ryde by
poste on thyne oxe / or thy shepe, or
roste thy horse or thy mule to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
with thy frendes, to those pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
thou canste nat calle any of
them good. For they be out of their
propre degrees or placis in the lyne
of order: and therfore they be nowe
ylle. Semblably if in to thy potage / 
wherwith thou intendest to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished / 
thou doest cause to be putte
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:671:71"/>
suche herbes as do serue for violent

or malowes / or couerest it with
the leues of letis or beetis: these her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
or trees so vsed doo ceasse to be
good, and may to these pourposes
be nowe called yll. So there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
that is perfectly good but
god onely / and all other thynges the
nerre they approche towarde his
similitude / the more doo they drawe
to that perfection / and the higher be
they in the lyne of order / wherof I
spake at the begynnynge.</p>
               <p>¶This that I haue nowe sayd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristippus,
if thou dost wel reuolue in

And that was affirmed bi the in the

thou compellest me to assent alwaye

excepte vnto that knowlege, wherin
is wysedome, he ioyneth operation:
but for what pourpose I praye the

               <p>Arte thou so dulle
wytted Aristip. that all this whyle
thou doest not perceyue hit? Perdie
the occasion of all our long raisoning
dydde ryse of that / that I assayed
to proue that if I were a wyse man
in dede / myn answere to kynge Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyse
<pb facs="tcp:671:100"/>
declared me to be so, accordinge
to his expectation. And therfore fyrst
as rayson was / I soughte for wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
And in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
to be in man onely, and not in
beastes: &amp; that it was in knowlege
of hym selfe and other. And that
knowlege was in this wise declarid.
First to know his owne preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and dignitie ouer al other creatures,
hir was remembred that he was of
bodye and soule, wherby he was
man, and was made to the image &amp;
similitude of god, and that all other
creatures were made onely for him
and to his vse principally. The sayd
similitude was expressed to be in the
soule as well for that it is visible and
immortal / as also in vnderstandyng,
whereby she hath souerayntie and
rule in the bodye, as god hath ouer
all vniuersally. Moreouer that the
sences / affectes / and wylle, be he
seruauntes and minystres: whiche
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:671:100"/>
if she do kepe in suche obedience and
order / as she receyued them, she shal
euer remayne in authorytie. But if
she lette them to haue more libertie
than perteyneth to them, that is to
say / to delyte in thynges whiche be
corruptible, they wyll than conspire
and rebelle agayne vnderstandynge,
and driue him from the soule / &amp; than
shulde man be transformed frome
the image of god vntyl a brute beest / 
beinge gouerned and ruled onely by
sensis. ¶The seconde parte
of the saide knowlege was opened
bi the discription of the goodnes and
prouidence of god. In describynge
his goodnes, was declared his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war,
his perfection / and loue that he
hath vnto man / as vnto his chylde
more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> natural. In settyng out his
ꝓuide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appered his i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scrutable wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome / 
magnificence / prudence, &amp; poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie
in his wonderfull order / wherin
were his creatures in their sondrye
<pb facs="tcp:671:101"/>
degrees hygher or lower, as they
dydde participate in goodnes more
or lasse. In the toppe wherof aboue
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l other, Man was sette nexte vnto
god, from whom order proceded.</p>
               <p>Moreouer by the sayde prouidence
hir was declared, that nothynge ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nge
his place in order / shewed to

And laste of all it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in a fewe sentences, that aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
was sent by god vnto a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor iniustly or cruelly, but for a good

and dignitie / by suche maner

               <p>¶Nowe Aristippus reuoluyng all
this in thy mynde / whiche in a short
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:671:101"/>
Epilogation I haue endeuoured my
selfe to reduce vnto thy reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance,
Consyder well bothe me and kynge
Dionise / as we were at that tyme,
whan we were togither. Thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
well that from the tyme that I
was.xx.yeres old I alway co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued
disciple of Socrates, vntyll that he
dyed. Who (as thou knowist) the
answere of god determyned to be of
al mortall men the wysest. And that
whiche I lerned of hym was wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
whiche as he euer affirmed
was included in these two wordes,
Knowe thy selfe. And by that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
(as thou mayste remembre) he
abated the presumption of dyuers,
whiche supposed them selfe to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
wyse men. Also reuoked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that were dissolute and resolued
into vice, and made them to ensue
vertue. And by his exaumple of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
he prouoked men to contemne
fortune, and to haue onely vertue in
<pb facs="tcp:671:102"/>
reuerence. And also therby, laste of
all, whan he was iniustely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to deth he constantly and ioyful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
susteyned to haue the mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dissolued / that the soule mought
be at reste and haue her immortal re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde.
whiche exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple giuen of hym
was the corroboration of al his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine / 
and no lasse part of lerning vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
his scolers, but rather moch more
than his ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or lessons.
Imagine Aristippus, that I was so
studious and industrious aboute the
said lerninge / that I moste curiously
&amp; (as I mought say) superstitiously
obseruid euery poynt of the said do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And that therfore all men in
Grece, and also kinge Dionyse had
conceyued of me an opinion, that I
was a wise man. And that the same
kynge sente for me, onely to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(as I sayde at the begynnynge)
to see and here / whether I were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to his expectation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:671:102"/>
¶Consider also on the other parte,
that my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into Sicile / was nar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ro
serue kinge Dionise, or to receyue
by hym any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie / but onely to
augmente wisedome by addition of
knowledge. And that he desired to
haue me with him for the cause that
I before haue rehersid. wherfore it
semith that he had nede of that, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
by seinge &amp; hering of me / he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to knowe, that is to saye wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For no man couayteth that
thynge, whiche he all redy hath / or
wherof in his owne opinion he hath
no nede. Now I knew partly by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon
report / partly by thinformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Dion / which is a iuste man &amp; an ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest / 
that kinge Dionise was a Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
that is to sai co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men to that dignite bi
vsurpacion and violence, and not by
iuste succession or lefull election. Also
that he was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of quicke &amp; subtile
wit, but therwith he was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sensuall, vnstable, &amp; wandring in
<pb facs="tcp:671:103"/>
sondrye affections. Delytinge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
in voluptuous pleasures, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tyme in gatheryng of great tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and rychesse, oftentymes resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into a bestly rage and vengeable
crueltie / Aboute the publicke weale
of his countraye alwaye remysse, in
his owne desyres studious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
And all this I perceyued very
well or I spake to hym any thynge.
Onely I exercised my selfe with the
Aristippus, Dion, and other, in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
part of Philosophy as mought
induce you vnto the layd knowlege,
wherof I haue spoken, approuynge
alwaye my doctrine with the forme
of liuyng by the example of my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Socrates: Abydynge oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to speake, which mought ryse of
some speciall demande of kyng Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise.
In the meane time to suche lyte
questions and problemes as he dyd
pourpose, concernynge naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses / 
Rhetorike / or poetry / or of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:671:103"/>
dueties and maners of priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons / 
I resolued them so as he helde
hym contented / and delyted not a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in the forme of my raysonyng.</p>
               <p>At the laste (as I haue tolde to the
at the begynnynge) he required me
to declare openly, the state and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
of a kynge / whiche ruled
ouer other. Therat I reioyced, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to haue founde the oportunitie
to speake that I so longe loked for.
And than forthe with I consydered
that the sentence, whiche I shulde
pronounce, shulde eyther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende
and approue me for a wyse man / as
I was supposed to be: or els co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
that opinion that kyng Dionise and
other had of me / as false and vntru,
I declarynge my selfe vnworthy to
haue it. I remembred also, that lyke
as ignorance and knowlege / or ylle
and good maye neuer accorde: no
more may falsehoode and truthe be
ioyned in one. And what so euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
<pb facs="tcp:671:104"/>
other wyse than it is in dede,
it is other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truthe: and that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is not truthe muste nedes be fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod.
More ouer as truthe is good / 
so falshod is yl. wherfore what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truthe, can nat be in
a wise man, who by the consent of al
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is good. Hauing styl in my mind
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / I described a kinge,
not ꝑcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as he wold haue had me / 
but as truth &amp; the trust that he had i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled me. Therfore bi the said
knowlege, of the which we so longe
haue disputed / I set out &amp; expressed
suche a man, in whom the soule had
intiere &amp; ful auctorite ouer the sensis,
&amp; alway kept the affectis in due rule
&amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, folowyng only the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle
of Vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; by that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce
was moste like vnto god.
This man I called a kyng / although
he had no more in his possession tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
had Crates the Theban. And if that
suche one were by the free consent of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:671:104"/>
the people / chosen or receyued to be
a principal ruler and gouernour / go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in like maner as he doth
him selfe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he a gret king or Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour / 
&amp; to be had in reuerence &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor
aboue any mortal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sauyng to
god that excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t honor, that is due
to the creator &amp; first cause of al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
Not only for the preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
him bi a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent / but also for
as moch as by his knowlege / exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple / 
&amp; authorite the people shal dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
of him an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable profite &amp;
benefit / being allured &amp; prouoked by
him to set their soules in the sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
&amp; authorite, as they mai also be
ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, &amp; be euer like vnto god. More
ouer this kynge by that knowledge
that he hath of hym self, he also kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth
other men: for by the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whiche procedeth of their affectes / 
he perceyueth howe farre they be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moued
from their right place in the
lyne of order / that is to say, leauyng
<pb facs="tcp:671:105"/>
knowlege and rayson / wherby they
were in the highest toppe of the lyne / 
they descende to the places of brute
beastes by participatyng with them
in sensuall appetites. And than wyll
he endeuour hym selfe by all good
meanes to restore them agayne (if
he maye) to theyr propre place in
Ordre.</p>
               <p>¶Also suche a kynge stablysshed in
the sayde knowledge, can neuer be
deceyued by his moste pernicious or
mischeuous ennemyes / whiche be
flatterers and glosers, by whome
princis be deuoured alyue / and their
soules vtterly consumed with moste
mortall pestilence, wherwith their
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis and people be also in perile
to be loste &amp; destroyed. For as sone
as either in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailes / or in their

order of liuing / he by the said know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege

them / and by auoydinge their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie

               <p>¶Finally to the intente that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
