            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLESIASTES xi. 9.</bibl>
               <q>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy
heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and
walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the
sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for
all these things God will bring thee into
judgment.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF <hi>Solomon</hi> had said, <hi>Rejoyce not, O young
man, in thy Youth, neither let thy heart
chear thee in the days of thy Youth; walk
not in the way of thine heart, nor in the
sight of thine eyes; for know thou, that for all
these things God will bring thee into Iudgment,</hi>
the Sense had been so easie and plain, that
there had been no Appearance of Difficulty
in reconciling one part with the other: For
the whole had been look'd upon but as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and seasonable Admonition to such
who by the Heats of Youth, and Strength of
Inclination, and Allurements of the World,
are too apt to be transported with the Love
of Sensual Pleasures. And this had been very
becoming the Wise Man towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of his Book, wherein he had not onely
before set forth the several Vanities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97976:3"/>
Life; but so soon after, bids Men
<hi>Remember their Creatour in the days of their
Youth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>while the evil days come not, nor the
years draw nigh of which they shall say they have
no pleasure in them. i. e.</hi> in the days wherein
they are most apt to <hi>walk in the way of their
hearts, and in the sight of their eyes.</hi> For he
knew very well, that nothing is so powerfull
a Check and Restraint upon mens inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Sin, as the serious consideration of
that God that gave them their Beings, and
will bring them to an Account for their
Actions.</p>
            <p>But how then comes he in this Verse to
seem rather to give a Permission to Young
men in the time of Youth to indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their mirth and vanity? <hi>Rejoyce, O
young man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in thy Youth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Some think that the Wise Man onely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
and Exposes them for their Folly in so
doing; but that seems not agreeable with
the grave and serious advice which follows.
And we find nothing like <hi>Irony</hi> or <hi>Sarcasm</hi> in
any part of the foregoing Book; for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
it with a Tragical Exclamation against
the vanities of humane life;<note place="margin">Ch. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities: all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97976:3"/>
is vanity.</hi> And he pursues his Argument by
a particular induction of the most tempting
and pleasing vanities of Life; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all sorts of Sensual delights;<note place="margin">Ch. 2. 1.</note> as <hi>Mirth</hi> and
<hi>Iollity</hi> in the first place,<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> then <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi>
fine <hi>Palaces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> curious <hi>Vineyards, Gardens</hi> and
<hi>Pools,</hi> a great Retinue, and, which was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to maintain all this,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Abundance of Silver
and Gold.</hi> But what a melancholy reflection
doth he make on all these Pleasures of Life?
<hi>Then I looked on all the works that my hands
had wrought,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and on the labour that I had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to doe; and behold all was vanity and
vexation of spirit.</hi> What incouragement then
could the Wise Man, after so much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the World, give to Young men here
in the Text, to <hi>Rejoyce in the days of their
Youth, and to walk in the way of their hearts,
and in the sight of their eyes?</hi> i. e. to pursue
<hi>Vanity,</hi> and to lay the Foundation for greater
<hi>vexation of Spirit,</hi> when they come to reflect
on their own Follies.</p>
            <p>What then is the meaning of these words?
For this, we are to observe, that the Preacher
having declared his own main Scope and
Design in the beginning and conclusion of
his Book, brings in sometimes the different
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97976:4"/>
senses which mankind are apt to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Happiness of Life. And that is
the reason that we meet with such different
Expressions concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In one place it is said,<note place="margin">Ch. 8. 15.</note> that</hi> there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing under the Sun, than to eat and drink
and to be merry; <hi>but in another, he saith,</hi>
Sorrow is better than laughter,<note place="margin">Ch. 7. 3.</note> and by the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In one place he saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 9. 2.</note> All things come alike
to all, there is one event to the righteous and
to the wicked:<note place="margin">Ch. 8. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>But in another,</hi> That it shall
be well with them that fear the Lord, but it
shall not be well with the wicked.</p>
            <p>How can such Passages as these be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
if we look on them as expressing the
sense of the same Person? But if we allow
them to be the different notions of two sorts
of Men in this World, they are easie to be
understood, although not to be reconciled.
And the one sort is of those who place all
Happiness in this Life, without regard to
Religion or Vertue, or another World; and
the other of those, who look on this Life
onely as a Passage to Another; and that all
Persons ought to behave themselves here, so
as conduces most to their Happiness hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97976:4"/>
And according to these different <hi>Schemes,</hi>
we have in the words of the Text two very
different sorts of Counsel and Advice to
Young men.</p>
            <p>I. The first proceeds upon the Supposition
that all the Happiness of Man lies in this
Life, and in the Enjoyment of the Sensual
Pleasures of it; <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy
Youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days
of thy Youth; and walk in the way of thy heart,
and in the sight of thy eyes.</hi> We have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rule here given but <hi>the sight of the eye,
and the way of the heart;</hi> i. e. outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and inward Inclination; and these
are the beloved Rules of the most Sensual
and Voluptuous persons, and they judge of
Happiness onely by the pursuit of them.
Here is nothing mention'd of <hi>Reason or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
or a regard to Vertue in the Restraint
of Natural Inclinations: Nay, here is nothing
of that Severity which <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself
thought necessary towards the maintaining
of a pleasant state of Life; which he granted
could never be done without some restraint
of Mens Appetites and Inclinations to the
Pleasures of Sense; and it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97976:5"/>
that <hi>Solomon</hi> should give Young men
greater Liberty than the corruptest Moralists
did. Therefore I cannot look upon these
words as a <hi>Permission</hi> for them to doe what
is here expressed; but as a full Description
of that method of Living, which the jolly
and voluptuous Corrupters of Youth would
instruct them in, <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in
thy Youth, and let thine heart chear thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>II. We have here the most Powerfull
Check and Restraint laid upon all these Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Inclinations of Youth. <hi>But know thou
that for all these things God will bring thee to
Iudgment.</hi> Which Words are the Wise
Man's <hi>Correction</hi> of the foregoing <hi>Liberty,</hi> or
the Curb which Reason and Religion give to
the pursuit of Natural Inclinations, wherein
every Word hath its force, and ought to
make a deep impression upon us: For,</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>Know thou:</hi> Thine is not then the
same case with Creatures that have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
they are not capable of any
Check from themselves, having no Law of
Reason or Conscience within them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
or govern their Sensual Desires; but
God hath given thee not meerly a Brutal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97976:5"/>
Appetite, but a Rational Soul, capable of
understanding the differences of Good and
Evil, and the Reasons why some things which
appear Pleasant are very disagreeing to the
Principles of Humane Nature; <hi>i. e.</hi> to that
Order, Decency, Modesty, and Regularity,
which the more elevated frame and capacity
of Mankind do require.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>For all these things;</hi> as light and vain
as you esteem them, as soon as they are over
and forgotten by you, as secretly and closely
as they are committed, as much as you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to palliate and excuse them, yet
but <hi>for all these things God will certainly bring
thee into Iudgment.</hi> Therefore you have all
the reason in the world to consider what
you doe,<note place="margin">Ch. 12. 14.</note> since <hi>every thing will be brought to
judgment, whether it be good or evil,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
concludes this Book. Which shews the
great Regard God hath to the Good or Evil
of our Actions; and if the great Judge of
the World hath so, certainly we ought to
have it, and never think our selves at liberty
to doe what we please, in gratifying our
Lusts, and pursuing our Natural Inclinations
to Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97976:6"/>
(3.) <hi>God will doe it.</hi> If there were no
<hi>God</hi> to call thee to an account, yet there are
some Actions of Vertue so agreeable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and some Vices so loathsome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that there would be sufficient cause
for them to love the one and to abhor the
other. If we could suppose such a frame of
things and such sorts of Beings as we now
see, and no God to make them, (which is
most Absurd and Unreasonable,) yet we must
suppose these Beings to have Natures and
Properties distinct from each other; so that
we could not imagine Men to become Beasts,
and therefore they must not act like them,
but preserve that <hi>Decorum</hi> or Agreeableness in
their Actions which is suitable to the peculiar
Excellencies of Humane Nature. And there
are some Sins so much below the Dignity
thereof, that no Circumstances, no Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
can make them fitting for Mankind
to commit them; which shews that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Good and Evil is no Arbitrary thing,
but is founded in the very frame of our
Beings, and in the Respects we owe to our
selves and to one another. And since there
is an Infinite and Supreme Being which hath
Absolute Power and Command over us, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97976:6"/>
gives us both our Beings and the Comforts
of our Lives, it is most Absurd to suppose
it not to be a fault to hate his Goodness, or
to despise his Mercy; or to slight his Power,
and to contemn his Authority: For in all
these there is something repugnant to the
common sense of Mankind, and to all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of true Honour and Justice. And
there are such common Principles of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
arising from our necessary Relation to
God and each other, which are of so clear
and convincing Evidence, that every one
that considers them will grant that Wicked
Men may as well go about to dispute their
Beings as their Sins; and may as easily prove
that they are not, but onely appear to be,
as that no Actions are really Evil, but only
by false Glasses appear so to be. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
vain men may deceive themselves, <hi>God
will not be mocked;</hi> for he not onely sees and
knows all our Actions, but he will bring us
to an Account for them.</p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>God will bring thee into Iudgment.</hi> It
is a dreadfull consideration to a Sinner, that
God knows all his false steps, all his secret
Sins, all his Falshood and Dissimulation with
God and Men: And there is nothing which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97976:7"/>
men of Art and Design hate more, than to
be discover'd and found out in all their
double and deceitfull dealings; but to have
these not onely privately discover'd, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and laid open to the view of the
World; and not onely so, but to have every
Circumstance examin'd, and every Action
scanned, and that by the great Judge of all
the World, whom nothing can escape, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can deceive, nothing can withstand;
whose Justice is inflexible, whose Knowledge
is incomprehensible, whose Power is irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible,
and whose Vengeance is insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
This we cannot but imagine must strike
an awe and terrour into the Minds of Men,
when they are pursuing the Pleasures of Sin,
that <hi>for all these things God will bring them into
judgment.</hi> But notwithstanding these and
many other Expressions to the same purpose
in Scripture, wherein <hi>God</hi> hath declared that
he will certainly <hi>Iudge the World in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
at the Great Day;<note place="margin">Act. 7. 31.</note> that <hi>the Secrets of
all hearts shall then be disclosed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> that <hi>we must
all appear before the Iudgment-seat of Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10</note>
and that <hi>God will render to every man according
to his Deeds:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6.</note> And notwithstanding it is a
thing in it self very reasonable, from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97976:7"/>
consideration of God's Justice and Providence,
and the Nature and Consequences of Good
and Evil Actions; yet the generality of
Mankind go on as secure and careless as if
there were no such thing, or that they ought
not to be concerned about it. Therefore I
shall not spend time in the Proof of that
which I take for granted you all believe,
and I am sure have Reason so to doe; but
I shall enquire into these things which are
most Practical and therefore proper for our
Consideration at this Time.</p>
            <p>(1.) How a matter of so great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as <hi>a Iudgment to come</hi> makes so little
Impression on the Minds of the generality of
Mankind, who profess to believe it.</p>
            <p>(2.) By what means the consideration of
a Future Judgment may have a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on all our Minds.</p>
            <p>(1.) How a thing of so great Importance
as <hi>God's bringing us into Iudgment</hi> comes to
make so little Impression on the Minds of
the generality of those who profess to believe
it, when we are so tender and sensible of
small things with Respect to this World.</p>
            <p>For Resolving this, we must consider, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97976:8"/>
there is a great Difference between the Not
Disbelieving Doctrinal Points of Faith, and
the Practical Improvement of them in our
Minds; without which, they remain there
but as general and confused Notions. Thus
too many who abhor being thought Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
live as if there were no God; not, that
they deny or dispute his Being or Attributes,
but they have no Regard to them in the
last Dictates of their Minds, or in the Course
of their Actions. To go about to prove
such things to be true they look on as lost
labour, for they do not question them; but
there is another thing then which we are to
give an Account of, <hi>viz.</hi> how it comes to
pass, that so great and so weighty Doctrines,
being received and allowed to be true, make
so little Impression on the generality of
Mankind; especially this of the Day of
Judgment; of which these seem to be the
main Reasons.</p>
            <p>(1.) Mens Impatience of Considering
great and weighty things at a Distance, which
cannot affect and move our Senses.</p>
            <p>(2.) The bewitching and stupifying Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Present and Sensual Pleasures; which
draw off the Mind from greater things, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97976:8"/>
weaken all the Impressions they make upon
us.</p>
            <p>(3.) A General Presumption upon God's
Mercy towards Mankind on the Account of
the Frailty of Humane Nature, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the severity of his Threatnings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>(1.) I begin with <hi>Mens Impatience of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We flatter and please our selves with the
thoughts that we are <hi>Intelligent</hi> and <hi>Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Beings,</hi> when, it may be, <hi>Considering</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to matters of greatest consequence)
is one of the things which Mankind have the
greatest Aversion to. For generally, they love
to go no farther than the Outsides and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of things, and have their Minds
wholly possessed with false and flattering
Imaginations, having neither Truth nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
in them. And those who account
themselves of better Breeding than others,
are often more imposed upon than others in
this way. The Pomp and Grandeur of the
World, the Gaity and Splendour of Living
strikes their Fancies with such vehement Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
that scarce any thing else gets into
their Minds, or sinks deep into them. There
are many other things that seem to stand
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97976:9"/>
fair in their Opinion at some times, but it
is as they are thought Serviceable to World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Greatness and Honour.</p>
            <p>This, after all the Instructions of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
the Declamations of Heathen and
Christian Orators, and the far more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Arguments of the Wisest and Best of
Men, recorded in Holy Scripture, is still
the great <hi>Idol</hi> of Mankind, which they serve
and worship with the truest and warmest
Devotion. All other things, how great and
weighty soever in themselves, yet are really
look'd on by them as a sort of Metaphysical
Abstracted Notions of things Invisible and
Immaterial, quite out of the reach of their
Imagination, which may serve for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement
of some, and the Affrightment of
others, and the Entertainment of Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Minds; but, how to raise themselves
in the World, to appear Great, and have
many Dependents; to pursue and carry on
their own Interests (though without regard
to Justice and Honesty) these they account
Great and Noble things, and fit to employ
their Minds upon. But alas! How much
are such imposed upon by meer <hi>Shews</hi> and
<hi>Appearances</hi> of things, which are really what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97976:9"/>
God made them, but are not what we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
them to be! There are, no doubt, real
Conveniencies of Life in Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Ease, and Plenty, or else they
could never be esteemed Blessings, nor could
we have reason to thank God for them; but
there is a great difference between the Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of things for our present <hi>use,</hi> and for
our <hi>happiness; i. e.</hi> when we make them our
End, and do not employ them in order to a
farther End. But it is good Advice of S. <hi>Paul,
Vsing the World as not abusing it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 31.</note> 
               <hi>for the
Fashion of this World passeth away:</hi> it <hi>passes</hi>
like a Ship under Sail, while the generality
of Mankind, like Passengers, lie asleep in it.
Sometimes when Storms arise, or Waves
cross them, they seem to be awake, and to
look about them, and to think whither they
are going; but those thoughts being uneasie
to them, they lie down again, and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
they know not whither. But still it is
but <hi>the Fashion of this World;</hi> a meer Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip,
wherein there is great Variety but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Satisfaction, the Shew far out-doing the
Substance. When the Devil shewed Christ
<hi>the Kingdoms of the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and the Glory of
them,</hi> the highest Mountain could afford but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97976:10"/>
a small Prospect of them, but as some think
he caused a Representation in the Air of the
most tempting Splendour and Glories of
them. And this was the truest Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, by glorious Appearances and
bewitching Shews. But unless there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Humane Nature which makes it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt to be deceived by such things, it were
strange the Devil should think to prevail on
our Saviour by them. We pity those who
travelling in the Night are deceived by <hi>false
Fires</hi> and <hi>shining Meteors,</hi> and follow them
into Bogs and Precipices; but the case of
such is so much worse who are deluded by
the Deceitfull Vanities of this World to their
own Destruction.</p>
            <p>And can there be any greater Argument
of the want of Consideration, than for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to suffer themselves to be so easily and
so fatally cheated? It is a Wise Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Nat. Ausc.</hi> l. 7. c. 4. n. 15.</note> that <hi>True Knowledge and
Wisedom lies most in settling and fixing the
Mind.</hi> For it is not the subtlety and fineness
of Thoughts, not the quickness and sharpness
of Apprehension, not the close and mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Deductions of Reason which make a
Wise Man, but the having a calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97976:10"/>
Temper of Mind, the subduing our
Passions, and governing our Actions with
respect to our Chief End. And in order to
this, <hi>Consideration</hi> is absolutely necessary;
without which that which is nearest to us,
and offers it self first to our Choice, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon us. And here lies the main Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to perswade Mankind to choose a far
greater Happiness at a Distance and Invisible,
before a present Enjoyment of things we are
constantly conversant with, and have made
an early Impression upon us. But still we
say, that it is nothing but <hi>Mens Impatience
of Considering,</hi> which makes them have so
little Regard to another Life. For if they
would but lay both Worlds in the Balance
one against the other, they would soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the wonderfull Folly of preferring that
which this World accounts Happiness before
that which is offered to our Choice in another.
For let us make all the fair and reasonable
Allowances that may be, as to our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Appetites, and Circumstances in this
World; as to the Distance, Obscurity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibleness
of the Joys of another
World; yet every considering man that regards
true Happiness will be sure to chuse that which
is to come. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97976:11"/>
(1.) Supposing the Happiness were Equal,
yet there is no proportion in the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of them; and a considering Man will
be sure to choose a Happiness that can never
have an End, before one that may be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
lost in a moment; and can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be enjoyed but for a little time, if
there were any certainty at all in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</p>
            <p>(2.) The more any have considered, the
more they have repented placing too much
of their Happiness here, because Reason and
Experience shews them the Folly of it. But the
more they have considered, the better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Minds of Good Men are in placing
their Happiness above; where alone that
Good is to be found which can make us truly
Happy, and is to be enjoyed in that Fulness,
that Purity, that Certainty which makes it
fit for the wisest and most considering Men
to prefer above a present Happiness, if it
were to be enjoyed on Earth.</p>
            <p>(3.) He that looks after a Future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth not thereby lose any of the Real
Conveniencies of Humane Life; but he that
places his Happiness here, cannot find it in
this World, and is sure to be miserable in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97976:11"/>
another: And this makes a very considerable
Difference in the Choice. Indeed, if God
made it absolutely necessary in order to Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Happiness for us to forgoe all the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pleasures and Innocent Delights of this
Life, the terms would be much harder, and
hardly possible to Humane Nature. For, if
all Pleasures of Sense must be renounced, we
must not see the pleasing varieties of Nature,
nor hear the melodious sound of Birds, nor
tast the Meat when we are hungry, nor drink
when we are thirsty; for there is really grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pleasure of Sense when Nature craves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Sustenance, than what the most vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
<hi>Epicurean</hi> enjoys in all his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
first to raise his Appetite, and then
to please it: For what is most natural and
necessary is the most Delightfull; every thing
of <hi>Force</hi> must have something <hi>Vneasie</hi> in it.
But God hath not dealt thus hardly with
Mankind; He allows us all the reasonable
Desires of Nature, and hath onely forbid us
what is unreasonable and unnecessary. And
upon the forbearance of what is so, joyned
with our entire dependence upon himself for
it,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> (which the Scripture calls <hi>Faith working by
Love,</hi>) he hath made the Gracious Offer of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97976:12"/>
Eternal Happiness. It is true, in Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cases of Persecution he requires more,
but then he proposes Extraordinary Rewards
to make abundant Recompence for them;
but in the common and ordinary Case of
Mankind, he requires no more than our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
those Excesses in Pleasing our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
which Nature and Reason condemn.
And those who consider, cannot but see how
unreasonable it is to place their Happiness in
forbidden Pleasures; and to think that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can make them happy, but what God
hath declared shall make them miserable.
It is a strange Crossness in our Desires, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can please them but what displeases God.
It were no hard task to shew, that God forbids
nothing but what is really repugnant to our
Well-being here; and how then can any such
thing as Happiness be hoped for in such
things? And when a man ventures being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
for ever, for what can never make
him Happy here, if he had his full Liberty
to pursue his Desires; he shews how far he is
from acting like a wise, rational, considering
Being. So that Impatience of Considering is
one great Reason why the thoughts of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come make so little Impression on
Mens Minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97976:12"/>
(2.) The Second Reason is <hi>the Bewitching
and Stupifying Nature of Sensual Pleasures.</hi>
The <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philosophers, who managed
the <hi>Theory</hi> of Pleasure with the greatest Art,
so as it might look like a proper happiness
for Mankind, found Two things absolutely
necessary in order to it.</p>
            <p>(1.) The Retrenching all inordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<hi>viz.</hi> such as had more Pain following
them, than there was Pleasure in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Removing the Fears of another
World out of Mens Minds. For as long as
these sunk into their Minds, they must rob
them of that inward Tranquillity, without
which it were a vain thing so much as to
talk of Happiness. But it was impossible, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Grounds, to doe either of these. For,</p>
            <p>(1.) It is unreasonable to suppose that the
Happiness of our present Life should consist
in the Enjoyment of Pleasure, and yet the
Pleasure of Opinion to be taken away, since
the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi> is the far greatest part
of the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of Life; and that which is as
much valued and esteemed by all those who
place their Happiness in Pleasure. If it were
all to be reduced to that which lies in satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97976:13"/>
the necessary Desires of Nature, then such
as have just enough for that, are far more
happy than the Rich and Voluptuous, because
they have less Pains and Care. But if any
allowance be made to the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Fancy</hi>
and <hi>Opinion,</hi> then no stop can be given to
inordinate Desires. For, who can set bounds
to Fancy, or lay a reasonable Restraint upon
Desires, if the Differences of Good and Evil
be taken away? As they must be, if meer
Pleasure and Pain be to be regarded in our
Actions.</p>
            <p>(2.) As to the other, the Methods they
used to remove all Fears of another World
were weak and trifling, and they had no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in Point of <hi>Argument,</hi> but what the
Ignorance and Folly of the Idolatrous part
of Mankind at that time gave them. But
there is a far greater advantage in point of
<hi>Interest,</hi> which makes men of Sensual Lives
very willing to be rid of the Fears of another
Life. And a willing mind goes a great way
in believing or not believing. Those who
place their Happiness in eating and drinking
well (as they call it) and other Sensual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
which can never be enjoyed when
htis Life is ended, have but a melancholy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97976:13"/>
Prospect into another World; for they are
shut out from the very possibility of being
happy in their own Sense, (unless they would
believe the Eastern Impostour;) but when
they once come to apprehend that there is
no Pleasure to make them happy but what
is seated in the Body, they are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that when that dies, there is an end of
all, for their Imaginations can reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the true Reason is, they have laid
Reason and Conscience asleep so long, that
it is very hard to awaken them; their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of good and Evil are like the confused
Apprehensions of Men half awake; they see
enough to perplex but not enough to satisfie
them. And when their Fears grow upon
them, they have not the Heart and Courage
to Examine them, whether they be Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or not; but rather choose to return to
their former <hi>Opiates,</hi> than undergo the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of an Effectual Cure by a hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and <hi>coming to themselves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15. 17.</note> as the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Son in the Parable did, when his Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had brought him to Consideration. We
do not know what had become of him, if
he had been wise and frugal in his Pleasures;
if he had taken care of a good stock and a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97976:14"/>
plentifull Subsistence; but he first came to
be pinched with want, before he was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to Repent. But we have in Scripture
a more remarkable Instance of the Stupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nature of Sensual Pleasures; and that
was in <hi>David</hi> after his Sins of Adultery and
Murther. It is a Wonder, how a Man of
such a tender Conscience in other things,
should continue so long under the Guilt of
these Enormities, without being awakened
to Repentance: Did he not know these to
be great Sins? And did not his Conscience
charge him with the Guilt of them? How
came he then to need a Prophet to be sent
to him, and to deal so plainly with him, as to
tell him <hi>Thou art the Man?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 7.</note> But this is a
plain Evidence, how much the Pleasures of
Sin are apt to stupifie Mens Consciences so
far, that unless God by his Grace be pleased
to awaken them thoroughly, they never
come to a sincere and hearty Repentance.
<hi>David</hi> saw nothing more as to the Guilt of
his Sins, when he penn'd his <hi>51st Psalm,</hi>
than his own Reason and Natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might inform him before; but he had
quite another Sense of his Sins then; his
<hi>Heart was broken</hi> and his Soul <hi>wounded</hi> under
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97976:14"/>
the Apprehension of God's Displeasure; and
this makes him pray so earnestly and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
to God for the Pardon of his
Sins. And if it were thus in the case of a
Man otherwise <hi>after God's own heart, i.e.</hi>
afraid of offending him, and carefull to
please him; what may we imagine it to be
in those who in the time of Youth <hi>walk in the
way of their hearts, and in the sight of their
eyes: i. e.</hi> allowing themselves in all Sensual
Inclinations, and pursuing Carnal Delights
so far till they have lost all Sense of God and
another World; and such as these, nothing
but the Powerfull Influences of Divine Grace
can awaken and recover.</p>
            <p>(3.) The Third Reason is, <hi>A General Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
upon God's Mercy.</hi> The first thing
which Sinners, in the Heat of their Youth,
and Pursuit of their Lusts, aim at, is to
think as little as may be of what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or what will be the Consequence of
their Actions. For every thought of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
is very uneasie to them, and every
thought of God is much more so; therefore
they drive away all such thoughts by one
means or other, by Sleep, Diversion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and such Publick Entertainments, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97976:15"/>
rather heighten and inflame their Vices than
correct them.</p>
            <p>If all this will not doe, but there will be
some Melancholy Hours, wherein Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
begins to rouse it self, and to awaken
the Sinner to some Sense of his Folly; then
he is ready to hearken with Pleasure to any
Raileries against <hi>Religion and Morality;</hi> and
admires the Wit of any one who dares say a
bold and sharp thing against the Wisdom
of all Ages, and of the best Men in them.
And one or two such Sayings, without Proof,
are cried up as far beyond the best Rules of
Morality, or the Evidence of natural and
revealed Religion. Any Sceptical Disputes
are sufficient Demonstrations to them; and
the most unreasonable Cavils against Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are embraced, because against the thing
they hate; and even a Jest against the Day
of Judgment shall signifie more with them,
than the strongest Arguments in the World
to prove it. The true Reason is, they love
their Vices, and hate every thing which makes
them uneasie to them; and nothing doth
more so, than the thoughts of a Judgment
to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:97976:15"/>
But suppose after all, the terrible and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Expressions of Scripture concerning
the Day of Judgment, joyned with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the thing, do make such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on their Minds that they cannot
wholly shake off the Fears and Apprehensions
of it, then their last endeavour is to mitigate
and lessen them, from a <hi>General Presumption
of God's Mercifull Nature;</hi> and therefore they
are willing to suppose, that however God, to
keep the World in awe, hath threatned them
with the dreadfull Severities of the Great Day,
yet as a tender Father who threatens his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
Son, in order to reclaim him, with no
less than Disinheriting him for ever; yet
when it comes to Execution he may Relent,
not from his Sons Deserts, but his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion;
so they hope, or believe, (or are
willing to doe so) that God at the Great Day
will not proceed according to the rigour
which he hath threatned to use. And to
comfort themselves in these hopes they find
out all possible Extenuations of their Sins:
<hi rend="margQuotes">If we, say they, had been created purely
intellectual Beings, free from this load of
Flesh, and the Inclinations which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to it, then it had been more reasonable
to have called us to a strict Account for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97976:16"/>
Action of our Lives; for then every
Inclination to Evil must have come from
our Minds; but now our Bodies corrupt
and draw them aside; and the Inclinations
to Evil grow faster than our Reason,
which should check and restrain them.
And when those Inclinations are strongest,
Men have not that Judgment which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the Government of unruly Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So that the very frame of humane
Nature seems to plead for Sins committed
in the Heat and Violence of Youth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
such is the Strictness and Purity of
the Law of God, and so great the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Disability, the Ignorance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency
of Mankind, that if God will
make no Allowance for humane Frailty,
who can stand before his Tribunal? And,
if any Allowance be made for Sins of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
there are so many Abatements to
be made for Sins committed through sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Passion, through Mistake, through the
unavoidable Impotency of humane Nature
in this degenerate Condition, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of that Day is not much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the utmost of the Sinners Plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Severity of the Day of Judgment;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97976:16"/>
But, to shew how faulty it is, I shall offer
these Considerations;</p>
            <p>1. That God will certainly <hi>Iudge the World
in Righteousness;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 31.</note> and therefore none shall have
Cause to complain of the Harshness or Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Proceedings. For, this <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is not the Rigour of Justice, but that
Equity which hath a Regard to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Actions, and the Abatement and
Extenuation of Faults which arise from them.</p>
            <p>2. None shall suffer at that Day, but for
their wilfull Impenitency, and obstinate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Sin. For, this is not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the Mercifull Nature of God,
to forgive Repenting Sinners; but it is one
of the great Designs of the Gospel to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Mankind of it by the highest Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
even by the Death and Resurrection of
the Son of God, and all the Miracles wrought
in Confirmation of it, and of the Truth of
his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>3. There are several Degrees of Wilfulness
and Obstinacy, and Mens Judgment shall be
according to them. Some Mens Capacities,
Opportunities and Helps have very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
others; some have broken through
stronger Convictions and more powerfull
Assistences of Grace than others; some have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97976:17"/>
had more early Instructions, more frequent
Warnings, more obliging Favours from
Heaven than others. And as it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that Persons suffer for their Obstinate
Continuance in Sin, so that they should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
according to the Degrees and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it.</p>
            <p>(4.) It is not unjust Severity in God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Men of that Happiness which they
have wilfully refused; and to condemn them
to that Misery which their Sins have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Hath not God made the most conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
Offer of Mercy and Salvation, that
it is possible for Creatures to expect from
him, after so many and great Provocations?
Could Heaven stoop lower than it hath done
to vile and ungratefull Sinners? When the
Son of God came down from Heaven on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to reconcile God and Man together;
When the Spirit of God warns and excites
their minds to the Consideration of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Welfare; When <hi>the Messengers of this
Reconciliation are to woo and intreat and
beseech Sinners in Christ's stead, as though
God did beseech them by them, that they
would be reconciled to God;</hi> When the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Goodness and Long-suffering of
God</hi> is exercised so much on purpose <hi>to lead
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97976:17"/>
them to Repentance;</hi> When God instead of
perfect Obedience, is willing to pardon and
pass by so many Offences, if they truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of them, and to receive them still into
his Favour and Mercy; When after all this
men do rather prefer the present Pleasures of
Sin, before all that happiness which God so
freely offers, is it any Injustice in him to suffer
them for ever to be deprived of that which
they so wilfully, so ungratefully, so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
refused? And supposing the Souls of
Men to subsist in another World free from all
those Clouds of Errour and Mistake, and the
false Notions they are deceived by here, as
well as all the Diversions and Pleasures of this
Life, it is not to be imagined, but they must
for-ever suffer an intolerable Anguish within
(called,<note place="margin">Mark 9. 44.</note> 
               <hi>A Worm that never dyes, and a Fire
that never goes out,</hi>) from the Reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Folly. What Vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this God may inflict, we now know not,
(may none of us ever know it!) but we are
sure it will never exceed the proportion and
desert of their Sins. Which is sufficient to
clear the Justice of God in his Proceedings
with Mankind in the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>2. It remains now onely to shew by what
means God's bringing us to Judgment may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97976:18"/>
make a deeper Impression upon our Minds;
By considering th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se two things;</p>
            <p>1. That our not considering it will not
make our condition b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter, but much worse.</p>
            <p>2. That our Considering it is the best
means to prevent the evil Consequences of it.</p>
            <p>(1.) Our not considering it will not make
our Condition better. There were great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
indeed <hi>to walk in the way of our hearts,
and in the sight of our eyes,</hi> and never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves with what will happen at the
great Day, if the putting it out of our Heads
would make our Accounts the easier when it
comes. But alas! Whether we think of it
or no, the Account runs on, and we must
answer to every particular at last; and how
unprovided shall we be, if we spend no time
here in examining, stating and clearing of
them as far as we are able. It is a mighty
Priviledge we have by the Gospel, that God
allows us to clear our Accounts with him in
this World;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> 
               <hi>For, if we would judge our selves
we shall not be judged: i.e.</hi> If we call our selves
to a strict Account for our Actions; if we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
heartily and sincerely of our Sins; if we
seek earnestly to God for Mercy; if we have
<hi>our Consciences cleansed by the Blood of Christ</hi>
from the pollution of our Sins, then we may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97976:18"/>
with Joy and Peace in our Minds think of
the Great Day of Recompence. But if we
never enter into our Selves, to search and
examine our own Actions, never look into
the Habits of our own Minds, nor charge
our selves with the Guilt of the Sins we have
committed, how can we ever hope to escape
the Scrutiny or avoid the Severity of that
Day? For our Account continually increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by our neglect of it, and the burden of
God's Wrath must be so much heavier when
we have taken no care to lessen it, but <hi>after
our hardness and impenitent hearts have onely
treasured up wrath against the day of wrath.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Our considering that God will bring
us to Judgment is the best means to prevent
the evil Consequences of it. For, although
we cannot hope to plead Innocency; yet,
(which is next in point of Wisdom) this is
the most effectual Motive to bring us to
Repentance: And that which makes us Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
makes us to grow Wise in time, and to
lay <hi>a good Foundation for Eternal Life.</hi> There
are many Arguments to induce us to it in
the Folly and Shame of our Sins; the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Reflection and Reformation; the
Instances of it and Exhortations to it recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Scripture; but there is none more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97976:19"/>
sensible and which touches Men more in
point of Interest and Concernment than this
of <hi>a Iudgment to come.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Must I then, saith
a Penitent Sinner, give a strict Account to
God of all the evil Actions of my Life,
and suffer according to the Desert of them
if I die in Impenitency? How much doth
it then concern me to Repent betimes, to
Repent in good earnest, to Repent while
there is hopes of Mercy! Away then all
ye deceitfull Vanities of this wicked World,
ye have too long deceived and seduced
me: what will all this vain shew, this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Seducer, this impertinent Outside of the
World signifie, when I must be stript of
all, and stand guilty and accused by my
own Conscience before the Judgment-Seat
of Christ? Oh! how wretched shall I be,
if my Conscience condemns me before the
Sentence of the Judge! Therefore, I
am resolved to prevent the Judgment of
that Day; I will accuse, judge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
my self; nay, I will proceed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
as to all the vitious Habits and
corrupt Inclinations within me. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I cannot wholly <hi>mortifie</hi> them, yet
I will <hi>crucifie</hi> them; <hi>i. e.</hi> nail them to the
Cross, and allow them no longer Liberty;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97976:19"/>
and albeit they may struggle for a time,
yet I will never give way to their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over me any more; that so Death and
Judgment may find me prepared, if not
with unspotted Innocency, yet with hearty
and sincere Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all; let the Consideration of
this Day of <hi>Iudgment to come</hi> enter deep into
our Minds, and awaken us out of our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy
and Security. We are very apt to
put off unpleasing things from time to time,
and to pass away our time here as easily as
may be. But this is no part of Wisdom,
and we shall extremely blame our selves for
it one time or other. The best we can do
now, is to recover what is past by Repentance,
and to set our selves to the making up our
Accounts with God in this World: For, we
are all walking on the brink of Eternity, and
know not how soon we may drop into it.
But what Eternal Horrour and Confusion
must follow us, if we go on to slight the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
he still affords us of making our
Peace with him who is to be our Judge?
May God therefore of his Mercy awaken us
all to a timely and serious Repentance, and
then <hi>our Iniquities shall not be our Ruine.</hi>
