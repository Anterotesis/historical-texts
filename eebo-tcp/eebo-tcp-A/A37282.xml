         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yea ſo to pity him, as effectually to relieve him.</p>
            <p>In the year of our Lord 1648 <hi>Octob. 21. Richard Dawſon</hi>
Gentleman, then reſiding in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Capacity of a Graſier, had at one time, forcibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him 267 Oxen, which were all driven into the Caſtle
of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> by ſome who pretended themſelves Souldiers of
that place, and there came to the poſſeſſion of one <hi>Roger
Portington,</hi> the Governour denying, that he had any thing to
do with them, when <hi>Dawſon</hi> (owner of the Cattle,) demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them of him; but ſent him to <hi>Portington,</hi> to treat with him
concerning them, being (as he affirmed) wholly in his power,
and withall required <hi>Portington</hi> to roſtore them to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> but
he refuſed to return them, or any part of them, uſing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating
expreſſion, to the owners face, <hi>That would he give</hi>
100 l. <hi>for ten of the worst, he ſhould not have them;</hi> with which
most rugged anſwer, <hi>Dawſon</hi> being juſtly provoked, (as well
as exaſperated by his great loſſe) in the year 1649, he brought
his Action of Trover and Converſion againſt <hi>Portington,</hi> which
being tryed by <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> at <hi>Guild Hall,</hi> in the year 1650. the
Plantiff recovered againſt the Defendant <hi>Portington,</hi> (with coſts
of Suit) <hi>1297l. 13s. 4d.</hi> according to which verdict, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was entred, and <hi>Dawſon</hi> had granted him a Writ of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
thereupon.</p>
            <p>A man would now have thought that the Plantiff had not
been far from his mony, having able bail for bringing forth the
Body of the Defendant, and him a man of ſufficient eſtate to
ſatisfie a greater debt; But the ſequel of this diſcourſe will
make it moſt evident, that as our Laws have been, and are in the
Execution of them ſtill abuſed, there is no Caſe, ſo notoriouſly
corrupt and injuſt; but meeting with a ſuitable Conſcience,
joyned with ability of Purſe, he may be provided with Lawyers,
who for the ſake of gain, will maintain and defend the ſame, in
deſpight of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:31601:4"/>
For this <hi>Portington</hi> to diſcharge his Bayl, rendred himſelf
Priſoner to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> where <hi>Dawſon</hi> charged him in
Execution, upon the ſore-recited Judgement, and there he to this
time continues a Priſoner, although for many years he hath
been, and ſtill is at large, dwelling at his own houſe in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
to the defrauding, and great dammage, of the injured
Creditor, who can look upon ſuch actions, no otherwiſe than
Cheats, however ſeemingly backt with Colour of Law; But of
this I ſhall have cauſe given to ſpeak more fully hereafter in this
diſcourſe: I will now come to ſhew by what vexatious trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
the Condemned Defendant, hath for ten years moleſted
the greatly ſuffering Plantiff, by which he hath been put to ſo
much coſt, (beſides moleſtation,) that he had better have been
himſelf Condemned in as much more money, and clearly loſt
his debt, then recovered againſt the Defendant that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of <hi>1297l. 13s. 4d.</hi> For to avoid payment thereof, the
Defendant <hi>Portington</hi> hath not only himſelf endeavoured, but
combined with others, to bring <hi>Dawſon</hi> to ruine, and hath ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it, ſo far as tedious Law-Suits, and Impriſonments could
do the ſame, to the Expence and Dammage of him the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Plantiff, more than <hi>8000l.</hi> which he can make appear;
and this by ſuch monſtrous courſes of Villany, as can ſcarce be
believed, but that the Plantiff can by many Records make out
the ſame.</p>
            <p>His firſt vexatious Dog-trick was, when that invention of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Hall</hi>
was hatched, for the relief (as was pretended) of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
and Debtors: To theſe Commiſſioners <hi>Portington</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
himſelf by Petition, which was granted, and <hi>Dawſon</hi>
Summoned thereupon, to have the Caſe heard by them, who
inſtead of relieving the Creditor, ordered only a rehearng of
the Cauſe before themſelves, to which order (patience perforce)
<hi>Dawſon</hi> ſubmitted; but the event proved neither relief to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,
or Debtor; for that Court after hearing the Cauſe, and
with mature deliberation weighing the merits thereof on both
ſides, diſmiſt <hi>Portingtons</hi> Petition, which cooled his hopes and
expectation of relief; and for the Creditor <hi>Dawſon,</hi> all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
was, that after the expence of <hi>200l.</hi> in that ſecond hearing
and Tryal, (ſeveral of his Witneſſes living 200 miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
beſides other ways of great charge and coſt) he had only
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31601:4"/>
his former Judgement confirmed, and yet as far from his mony
as before.</p>
            <p>This Dog-trick failing, <hi>Portington</hi> was ſoon provided with
another, which was, to Petition the uſurper <hi>Oliver</hi> for relief
againſt ſo due a debt doubly now confirmed by two Tryals; in
which Petition (being on Record, and the Copy of it in <hi>Dawſons</hi>
hands, to be ſhewed any that deſire ſatisfaction therein,) <hi>Porting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
(to his praiſe be it ſpoken) who would by all means be
thought a Cordial Royaliſt, did baſely, and perfidiouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Supreme Legiſlative Power to be in that bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;
betraying both his Conſcience, and the Cauſe he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to maintain, with deſign only to cheat his Creditor <hi>Dawſon</hi>
of a juſt debt, ſo injuriouſly detained. The Uſurper, in anſwer
to his Petition, ordered ſeveral references: In attendance upon
which, the Creditor was put to a new charge of <hi>100l.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
the Priſoner finding as little relief, as he before had at
<hi>Salters-Hall</hi> (that is none at all) not do I believe he ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
relief from either, only uſed theſe delatory means, if
not to defraud, at leaſt to retard his Creditor from getting,
what by Law he had recovered; and by multiplying expenſive
proceedings (although illegal) to weary him out, and tire his
patience, ſeeing more monies dayly thrown away after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
of which he could now have but little hopes, to receive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Principal, Intereſt, or Coſts of Suit.</p>
            <p>Yet for all theſe diſappointments, he is not weary; but ſince
his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, preſented his Petition againſt
<hi>Dawſon</hi> in the Upper Houſe of Parliament, where the Lords
after ſeveral hearings, thought no relief fit to be granted in the
Caſe, wherein the Law had no leſſe than twice had its full, and
due courſe; however, his reſtleſſe ſpirit hath lately prompted
to him another poor ſhift, and that is, to bring an <hi>Audita quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
in which he pretends an acquittance by the Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
although he hath been a Priſoner in Execution (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
now above ten years ſince he was firſt charged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, although I call him a Priſoner, yet (thanks to good

            <p>And ſo at preſent I ſhall leave my firſt Cuſtomer of this kind,

            <p>In the year of our Lord 1656. <hi>Novemb. 11. Dawſon</hi> being
then in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had occaſion to make uſe of three hundred
pounds for the manageing of his Trade, which he offered to
repay in <hi>London</hi> by Exchange nine days after; which Sum, one
<hi>Phillip Read,</hi> an Attorney in the Court of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to furniſh him with all, in two dayes time, provided
<hi>Dawſon</hi> would give him a Warrant to an Attorney to confeſſe a
Judgement to him for five hundred pounds, (with a Defeaſance,
for nine dayes) for his better ſecurity of the payment of the
ſaid <hi>300l.</hi> which <hi>Dawſon</hi> conſented to, Signed and Sealed a
Warrant, and <hi>Read</hi> alſo Signed and Sealed the foreſaid Defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
annexed thereto, which being delivered mutually by both
parties; <hi>Dawſon</hi> came at the time appointed, (<hi>viz.</hi>) two dayes
after, to receive the <hi>300l.</hi> according to agreement, but could
have no more paid him then <hi>158l.</hi> which was repayed by <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
to <hi>Read,</hi> and his appointment in <hi>London</hi> by the time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and allowed in the Defeaſance, (yea in truth two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
with 15 pounds more, which was lent by him to <hi>Read,</hi>
to be repaid upon demand; upon which payment <hi>Dawſon</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for his Warrant of Attorney, which <hi>Read</hi> at that time put
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31601:5"/>
off with this excuſe, That he had forgot, and left it at his houſe
in the Country, promiſing the delivery of it as ſoon as he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Norfolk;</hi> but not performing his word, <hi>Dawſon</hi> made
ſeveral times other demands of the ſaid Warrant, but had for
anſwer, It was loſt: Yet before ſeveral perſons of Repute and
Credit, <hi>Read</hi> acknowledged himſelf fully ſatisfied by <hi>Dawſon,</hi>
and nothing to remain due to him from the ſame. However,
<hi>Sept. 12, 1657. Read</hi> having privately, without the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or ſuſpition of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> entred that Judgement, took out
Execution upon it, againſt the goods of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and by virtue
thereof did levy in the County of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to the value of <hi>700l.</hi>
and after ſent one <hi>Thomas Hide</hi> into <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> who by
his order, without Writ of Execution, or any other Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
but his direction, took away 47 fat Bullocks, worth <hi>200l.</hi>
and ſold them; nor content with this, he in the ſame year and
month, in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at a place called <hi>Wallpool</hi> in
<hi>Marſhland,</hi> did by Colour of the ſaid Execution, ſeize of the
proper goods of the ſaid <hi>Dawſon, viz.</hi> Hay (in Stacks and
Reecks) to the value of <hi>500l.</hi> which though he had no power
to condemn and diſpoſe of, yet he detained by colour of his
own Execution, till he could, and did procure one <hi>Robert Dun</hi>
by a pretended Execution to Levy the ſame, and ſell it.</p>
            <p>Upon which illegal abuſe, <hi>Dawſon</hi> made complaint to the
then judges of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> (in thoſe dayes called the <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Bench</hi>) by whoſe order, <hi>Read</hi> was committed Priſoner in
the Cuſtody of Sir <hi>John Lenthall;</hi> but by favour of ſome of his
Fraternity, forthwith had his Liberty, which he imployed ſo
well, that before the end of the ſame Term, he procured one
<hi>Diſney</hi> to commit wilful perjury, with intent to overthrow
<hi>Dawſon</hi> in his moſt juſt cauſe, he when <hi>Read</hi> firſt moved to
him that he ſhould make ſuch an Oath, replyed, <hi>Maſter I know
no ſuch thing,</hi> who then ſwore by his Maker, that unleſſe he
would make that Oath, as he directed him, he was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
ſo partly by importunity, partly by promiſes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the ſaid <hi>Diſney</hi> deſperately to ſwear againſt his own
knowledge,; Whereupon <hi>Dawſon</hi> endicted <hi>Diſney</hi> for this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and this Maſter for ſubornation thereto, ſince which
<hi>Diſney</hi>'s Conſcience accuſing him, he hath confeſt to ſeveral
perſons of worth and repute, that his Maſter <hi>Read</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31601:6"/>
permit him to be at reſt, till he had perſwaded him, to make
Oath of ſuch things, of which he had not the leaſt knowledge.</p>
            <p>For which Cauſe in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term 1658. <hi>Dawſon</hi> filed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> againſt <hi>Read,</hi> (who did, and ſtill
doth practiſe there as an Attorney) upon the Caſe, in a ſpecial
Action, which the firſt of <hi>July</hi> he brought to a Tryal, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>700l.</hi> dammage, beſides coſts of Suit, <hi>18l.</hi> for which the
following <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term he had Judgement, and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
granted thereupon, againſt the perſon of <hi>Read,</hi> which Writ
being delivered to the Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> the buſineſſe was ſo
jugled between them, that although <hi>Read</hi> was often in the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
Company, yet he was not taken in Execution, nor would
the Sheriff at the inſtance of <hi>Dawſon</hi> return the Writ, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Terms, and at laſt returned a <hi>non eſt inventus</hi> thereupon,
when <hi>Read</hi> during the time of detaining this Writ, without Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
or Return, had embroyled <hi>Dawſon</hi> in a tedious and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
Chancery Suit, which becauſe of its Exemplary Injuſtice,
and Corruption, diſcovered in the manageing thereof, ſhall be
particularly here ſet down.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Dawſon</hi> had got againſt <hi>Read</hi> this Judgement,
and Execution; the Defendant ſues for relief in Chancery, and
ſerves <hi>Dawſon</hi> with a <hi>Subpaena</hi> to that purpoſe, and proceeds the
Vacation following to examine witneſſes, and by favour with
the Maſter of the Rolls (<hi>William Lenthall</hi>) procures the cauſe
to be forthwith ſet down for a hearing in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term (ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then following) 1659. which Term being adjourned, the
Cauſe was again ſet down for hearing at the Rolls, the <hi>9th.</hi> of
<hi>June</hi> following, where as ſoon as it was opened by <hi>Reads</hi>
Counſel, <hi>Lenthall</hi> (the Conſciencious Maſter of the Rolls) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and in ſeeming familiar friendſhip told him, he
would make a bargain with him, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>Read</hi> ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two dayes pay him Four hundred pounds, and the differences
between them made up, and fully ended thereupon, to whom
<hi>Dawſon</hi> replyed, his debt was <hi>718l.</hi> in recovery of which it had
coſt him no leſſe then <hi>500l.</hi> When <hi>Lenthall</hi> ſaw that this bait
would not allure <hi>Dawſon</hi> to bite at it, who had ſufficient for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
experience of his corrupt baſeneſſe, and diſſembling villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
(as before the Cloſe of this diſcourſe ſhall be diſcovered in
another caſe,) he then demanded of <hi>Reads</hi> Counſel, if they
could produce any Preſidents, where relief in Equity, had been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31601:6"/>
granted, in the like caſe after recovery, Judgement, and Writ
for Execution, who replyed, there were ſeveral Preſidents, upon
which anſwer, <hi>Lenthall</hi> put off the hearing till the <hi>18th.</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of the ſame month, againſt which time he willed them to
have thoſe preſidents in readineſſe, and then he would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Cauſe; but in the mean time tyed up <hi>Dawſon</hi> not to
take <hi>Read</hi> in Execution: the appointed day for hearing being
come, upon reading the firſt preſident, <hi>Lenthall</hi> told them
plainly, it made not at all for, but againſt them; but he had
ſince the laſt hearing, Conſidered of the Cauſe on his pillow,
and ſo forthwith, without farther hearing Counſel on either
ſide, ordered them to go to a new Tryal at Law, after which
he would reſerve the Equity to himſelf; but in the mean time
<hi>Read</hi> ſhould not be taken in Execution, with which orders
<hi>Dawſon</hi> being much agrieved, Petitioned the then Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Great Seal (as they were called) complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the great injuſtice he ſuffred thereby; in anſwer to which
Petition, they granted him a rehearing before them, upon
which, Counſel having ſpoken on both ſides, they diſmiſt <hi>Reads</hi>
Bill, and diſcharged the ſeveral orders made by the Maſter of
the Rolls, with coſts to be taxt by a Maſter of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which
were accordingly taxed at an hundred marks; Whereupon Sir
<hi>John Lenthall</hi> (one of the Rebel <hi>Olivers</hi> mock Knights) Son to
the Maſter of the Rolls, being at that time a Member of that
thing, then called a Parliament, ſeeing <hi>Read</hi> thus left to the
Law, (notwithſtanding his honeſt Fathers devices to obſtruct
the ſame) gives him his protection during the ſitting of that
Convention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Read</hi> finding himſelf thus countenanced, by the Maſter of the
Rolls and his Son, (for which as himſelf confeſſeth, it coſt him
three hundred pounds thinks he is now armed <hi>Capape,</hi> for any
villany, and having a prodigiouſly villanous wit, goes thorow
ſtitch to the purpoſe, and thus performs it. Firſt he perſwades
and prevails with one <hi>Robert Dun,</hi> that he might make uſe of
his name, (at his own charge and coſts) to confeſſe, and enter
a Judgement againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi> for the Sum of <hi>350l.</hi> upon which
grant. <hi>Read</hi> as repreſenting the perſon, and taking upon him
the name of <hi>Richard Dawſon,</hi> forged the foreſaid Warrant of
Attorney, Subſcribes and Seals it, as if himſelf had been the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31601:7"/>
perſon of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and then delivers it to the uſe of <hi>Robert Dun,</hi>
having witneſſes in readineſſe, (who upon examination affirm
that they knew neither the perſons of <hi>Read</hi> or <hi>Dawſon</hi>) to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to the delivery thereof as the Act and Deed of <hi>Dawſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Warrant ſo given by himſelf, he procured a
Judgement to be entred, and Execution taken out, and levyed
on the Goods of <hi>Dawſon</hi> in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where by a
Combination between him and the Sheriff, with his under Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
(who knew very well the Judgement to be grounded upon
a forged Warrant of Attorney before the Execution of the
Writ,) <hi>1000l.</hi> worth of Goods were ſeized and ſold, yet valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but at <hi>150l.</hi> which Goods ſo under valued, were bought by
one <hi>John Prat,</hi> whom <hi>Read</hi> procured to buy them upon a joynt
account, between them both.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>1000l.</hi> being thus ſwallowed up between theſe two
devourers, and the Execution ſtill unſatisfied more than one
half; in the next place, <hi>Read</hi> ſues forth a Commiſſion of
Bankruptſhip againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi> in the name of <hi>Dun,</hi> for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable
remainder of the pretended Execution; to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, he pickt up Commiſſioners of his own Confederates,
who in a very ſhort time after the Commiſſion came to their
hands, declared <hi>Dawſon</hi> a Bankrupt, and diſcharged <hi>Read</hi> from
payment of any monyes to him, no other pretence of Debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought before theſe Commiſſioners to prove this Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> but only the forged Warrant for Judgement, as
is before at large recited, and teſtified by thoſe very witneſſes
who were preſent at the Sealing and Delivering that Warrant of
Attorney, who depoſed that <hi>Read</hi> (whom then they had no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
knowledge of) Subſcribed, Sealed, and Delivered it, in
the name and counterfeiting the Perſon of <hi>Dawſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things being thus corruptly and unjuſtly carryed, <hi>Dawſon</hi> to
prevent (if poſſible) the ruine, which he ſaw inevitably hanging
over the heads of himſelf and Family, unleſſe ſuch villanies
were redreſſed, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 1659. made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
before the Judges of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> of the fore-recited
horrible Forgery of <hi>Read</hi> in his name, as alſo of falſe witneſſes,
which were ſuborned by him, and in readineſſe to ſwear that
<hi>Dawſon</hi> was the very perſon, who Signed and Sealed the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Attorney, to the uſe of <hi>Dun;</hi> upon which complaint the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31601:7"/>
Court, referred, the matter of fact in the Caſe to the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mr. <hi>Herne</hi> Secondary of the ſame Court, who upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of <hi>Dun,</hi> and ſeveral other witneſſes, found that no
monyes were due from <hi>Dawſon</hi> to him; but on the contrary, <hi>Dun</hi>
was indebted to <hi>Dawſon</hi> in the Sum of <hi>400l.</hi> due upon Bond,
who had a general releaſe from him under Hand and Seal, before
the forging that Warrant of Attorney, (by <hi>Read,</hi> in his name)
nor did ever <hi>Dawſon</hi> deal with him ſince, as he hath confeſſed in
the hearing of ſeveral perſons; To make which more evident,
<hi>Dawſon</hi> hath now from <hi>Dun</hi> a Judgement upon Record, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by himſelf, for that ſame debt of <hi>400l.</hi> then due when
this forgery was committed, <hi>Dun</hi> having moreover confeſſed
on his Oath, that <hi>Read</hi> to acquit himſelf of the Judgement for
<hi>718l.</hi> and 100 Marks Coſts, did Sollicite him to conſent to, and
own this forgery, and ſuing forth the Statute of Bankruptſhip
againſt <hi>Dawſon</hi> thereupon.</p>
            <p>Mr, <hi>Herne</hi> having carefully ſifted the whole truth of the Caſe,
made thereof a juſt report to the Court, who thereupon order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Tryal at Law, and the rule was, that this Tryal ſhould be
(according to the Election of <hi>Dawſon</hi>) at the next Aſſizes in
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> or <hi>Suffolk,</hi> upon a feigned Action, whether the
Warrant of Attorney were the Act and Deed of <hi>Dawſon</hi> or no,
which if upon tryal, the Jurors ſhould find in the affirmative,
then the monyes in the Sheriffs hand (made of the goods levied
in Execution) to be delivered to <hi>Dun,</hi> but if they ſhould
find in the Negative, then the Judgement to be vacated, and
the moneys reſtored to <hi>Dawſon; Dawſon</hi> upon this order mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Tryal might be either in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
where the Forgery was committed, becauſe at ſo great diſtance,
Knights of the poſt might ſtand for ſubſtantial witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Yet in this he was overborne by the Court, and the Tryal
ordered in one of thoſe two Counties, who becauſe he could
have it no better, choſe of two Evils the leaſt, and had his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
at <hi>Bury St. Edmonds,</hi> at the Aſſizes holden <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. 1660.
for the County of <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Read</hi> making Cock-ſure of the Tryal to goe on his ſide, being
at ſuch a diſtance, carries down the Record, and with it Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
that knew how to ſwear home; <hi>Dawſon</hi> alſo knowing
the juſtice of his Cauſe, fearing the other ſhould neglect it,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31601:8"/>
(though Defendant) he alſo carried the Record with him, to
tryal, in caſe <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Dun</hi> ſhould not; So two Juryes
were Impannelled, one on the Plaintiffes, another on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
ſcore; And although <hi>Dawſon</hi> might have juſt cauſe to
fear the packing of a Jury, on the behalf of <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Dun,</hi>
whom his former experience had taught him, to be notoriouſly
villanous, yet truſting to the righteouſneſſe of his Cauſe, rather
than contend, was content to loſe the benefit of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and proceed to tryal by their Jury.</p>
            <p>Who being ſworn upon the Caſe between <hi>Dun</hi> and <hi>Dawſon,
Read</hi> who was at the charge of that Tryal, and carrying the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
out of <hi>London,</hi> as hath been ſince confeſſed upon Oath,
by the Plaintiff <hi>Dun,</hi> and ſeveral other witneſſes, and may be
concluded by this undenyable Circumſtance, that <hi>Read</hi> gave
Ten thouſand pound ſecurity, to the Warden of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> to
whom <hi>Dun</hi> was then a priſoner, to have him perſonally preſent
at the Tryal to own the ſame, yet this <hi>Read</hi> appears as one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the behalf of <hi>Dun,</hi> and ſwore that Warrant of Attorney
was a true Warrant, and Signed and Sealed by <hi>Dawſon</hi> to <hi>Dun,</hi>
for <hi>220l.</hi> which <hi>Dawſon</hi> owed him, although in truth <hi>Read</hi>
did himſelf Forge, Sign, and Seal that Warrant, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid, and alſo made appear by Oath upon Record.</p>
            <p>Having thus led the Dance, he next produceth another wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
like himſelf, to confirm his teſtimony, who went by the
name of <hi>William Holmes</hi> (which name alſo, was ſo ſubſcribed
to the Warrant of Attorney) but that perſon being dead, this
Counterfeit ſwears poſitively, that he was the ſame <hi>William
Holmes,</hi> who ſubſcribed his Hand to that Warrant of Attorney,
which he upon Oath ſaid, was Signed, Sealed, and Delivered by
that ſame <hi>Richard Dawſon,</hi> who was then Defendant in that
Cauſe; But it was diſcovered in Court, that this pretended
<hi>William Holmes,</hi> was indeed <hi>Iſaack Harding</hi> a Scrivener, now,
and for thirty years laſt paſt dwelling in <hi>Swan-Alley</hi> near <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born-Bridge,</hi>
and was hired by <hi>Read</hi> for the Sum of <hi>45s.</hi> paid
him in hand by his appointment, beſides what was promiſed
him afterward, to make that deſperate Oath, which he knew to
be falſe in every Circumſtance of it.</p>
            <p>Now how God was pleaſed to diſcover the falſhood and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of theſe Villains, whoſe feared Conſciences durſt atteſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31601:8"/>
his Divine Majeſty ſo ſolemnly, yet ſo falſely, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
to declare briefly.</p>
            <p>In the time of the hatching, and proſecuting the afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Villany againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi> one <hi>Thomas Gunning,</hi> was by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Dun</hi> perſwaded to goe to a certain perſon, unknown (but
only to the Procurers and Abbetters of the intended Cheat)
to make demand of <hi>220l.</hi> of him (as if he had been <hi>Richard
Dawſon</hi>) which ſum he was to pay unto him upon Defeaſance
of a Warrant of Attorney, to confeſſe a Judgement for <hi>350l.</hi>
which <hi>Dun</hi> told <hi>Gunning, Richard Dawſon</hi> had Signed and Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that Party to whom he ſent him, was the ſame perſon;
<hi>Gunning</hi> (at that time not knowing <hi>Dawſon</hi>) made demand
accordingly; That Counterfeit perſon owning the name of
<hi>Richard Dawſon,</hi> promiſed payment of the Sum demanded in a
Weeks time; Of which demand, and an anſwer thereto returned,
by the ſuppoſed <hi>Richard Dawſon, Gunning</hi> (being perſwaded
by <hi>Dun</hi>) made <hi>Affidavit:</hi> The true <hi>Dawſon</hi> hearing this news,
ſo ſtrange to him, teſtified upon Oath, was alarum'd thereby to
look about, and being Authorized by an Order, to bring in this
Deponent <hi>Gunning,</hi> to ſee if he would make good his Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the whole Plot was in part diſcovered, for ſeeing the true
<hi>Richard Dawſon</hi> in preſence, he not only upon his Oath denied
him to be the ſame, of whom he made the aforeſaid demand of
<hi>220l.</hi> (who then profeſſed himſelf to be the ſame Party)
but alſo Depoſed, that <hi>Dun</hi> in the name of <hi>Read,</hi> had offered
him <hi>40l.</hi> to ſwear that Warrant of Atorney to be the Act
and Deed of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and bringing him to <hi>Read</hi>'s Chamber in
<hi>Davids-Inne,</hi> there <hi>Read</hi> himſelf proffered him (in Caſe he
would ſo make Oath) to maintain him at his Country-Houſe,
furniſh him with a good Horſe, and give him forty pounds in
money, as is at large declared in the Depoſition of <hi>Thomas
Gunning,</hi> before the Right Honourable Juſtice <hi>Mallet,</hi> taken
<hi>July</hi> 27. 1660.</p>
            <p>This firſt light in ſhort time (with Gods bleſſing) diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the whole deſign; For afterward, <hi>Richard Ramſey</hi> one of the
witneſſes to that Warrant of Attorney, being Subpaena'd by
<hi>Read,</hi> four dayes before the Tryal at <hi>Bury</hi> Aſſizes, at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in <hi>Davids-Inne,</hi> to be witneſs in the Caſe between <hi>Dun</hi> and
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> there <hi>Read</hi> proffer'd him five pound in hand, to ſwear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31601:9"/>
that the Defendant <hi>Dawſon</hi> did Sign, Seal, and deliver that
Warrant of Attorney, to the uſe of <hi>Dun,</hi> he when he came in
Court ingeniouſly related the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was preſent at
ſigning, and ſealing that Warrant of Attorney, and ſubſcribed
his Mark as a Witneſs thereto, but then knew not either <hi>Dun</hi>
or <hi>Dawſon,</hi> but ſince knowing both, he on his Oath affirmed,
<hi>Dawſon</hi> not to be preſent at that time, but <hi>Read</hi> was the very
perſon who ſigned, ſealed, and delivered it in the name of <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
he alſo upon Oath declared the proffer of five pound in
hand, made him by <hi>Read,</hi> in caſe he would ſwear as was before
related; alſo, that then, and ſeveral other times, he ſaw <hi>Read</hi>
give <hi>Dun</hi> money to proſecute the ſaid Suit of Forgery, and that
<hi>Jacob Wrag,</hi> Clerk to <hi>Read,</hi> told him after the Tryal, that had
not he been at <hi>Bury</hi> Aſſizes, his Maſter <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Dun,</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> by the evidence of <hi>Iſaac Harding,</hi> who
there ſwore by the name of <hi>William Holmes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which <hi>William Holmes</hi> being then dead, on his death bed did
declare, that he was ſollicited, but was not witneſs to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Attorney againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi> to <hi>Dun,</hi> yet his name was
ſubſcribed, his perſon and hand counterfeited; and though at
the Tryal he were dead, yet <hi>Harding,</hi> who as a Scrivener had
atteſted ſeveral Leaſes, and Deeds, (for above thirty years
ſpace) by the name of <hi>Iſaac Harding,</hi> for the ſum of forty
five ſhillings, paid in hand, (beſides what was afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed)
he deſperately ſwore what he knew to be falſe, under
the counterfeit name of <hi>William Holmes,</hi> whoſe name and hand,
was at firſt only forged, as before was ſaid.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſed God to defeat the Devices of theſe two mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
deſperate Villains, and to diſcover their forgeries, ſo
that the old perjured Wretch, that ſwore by a diſguiſed name,
got nothing by his counterfeiting, and forſwearing himſelf, not
thoſe who employed him, but a bare detection of their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to the confuſion of themſelves, and the amazement of the
hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dawſon</hi> having this ground to work upon, proceeds to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of <hi>Dun</hi> whoſe Conſcience beginning to relent, had
compelled him to acknowledge what he had acted againſt him,
to ſeveral of his acquaintance; which he hearing of, procured
his examination before the Right Honourable Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31601:9"/>
               <hi>Foſter, Nov.</hi> 26, 1660. who there upon Oath confeſſed,
that the Warrant for Judgement to an Atturney, and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Bankruptſhip, ſued forth thereupon, were both carried
on in his name, by the inſtant importunity of <hi>Read,</hi> and at his
Coſts and Charge, with deſign only to defraud <hi>Dawſon</hi> of the
<hi>718l.</hi> Judgement recovered by him againſt <hi>Read</hi> and the Coſts
taxed in Chancery upon the diſmiſſion of his Bill, by the
Lords Commiſſioners, and that he did verily believe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
who ſat upon the Statute taken out in his name, did
declare <hi>Dawſon</hi> a Bankrupt, under their hands and ſeals, only
at the requeſt, and importunate deſire of <hi>Read.</hi> He alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
upon his Oath, <hi>Reads</hi> ſuborning <hi>Iſaack Harding,</hi> to
ſwear at <hi>Bury</hi> Aſſizes, under the falſe borrowed name of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Holmes,</hi> that he ſaw the Warrant of Attorney, which was
made to <hi>Dun,</hi> for <hi>350l.</hi> ſigned, and ſealed, by that very <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
who appeared Defendant in that Caſe in the Court, for
which Oath ſo to be made, <hi>Read</hi> gave him forty five ſhillings in
hand; Likewiſe, that by the Confeſſion of <hi>Read,</hi> as well as the
information of divers credible perſons, he was aſſured, that <hi>Read</hi>
was often in company with the Under-Sheriffe of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that very time, he had a Writ of Execution againſt him, (at
the Suit of <hi>Dawſon</hi>) for a Judgement of <hi>718l.</hi> recovered by law.
And laſtly, that one <hi>Jacob Wrag</hi> (Servant to <hi>Read</hi>) came to
him (the Deponent) in his Maſters name, to deſire him not
to diſcover any of theſe things before mentioned, and for ſo
doing, he would be careful for him, and not ſuffer him to
want.</p>
            <p>Thus, at length was made a compleat diſcovery of all the
windings and turnings of theſe Serpentine Monſters in Villany,
one of them, in whoſe name, and by whoſe induſtry (in great
meaſure) things were thus corruply (or rather helliſhly) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
upon his Oath diſcovering himſelf, and accuſing, and ſo
branding his wicked partner, with a black note of infamy, not to
be wiped off by all the cunning he, or his accurſed Tutor in theſe
Forgeries, Perjuries, and ſubornation to perjury, can find out,
or invent. To God the true Author of this diſcovery, be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the ſole praiſe, and glory thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral chief heads of the teſtimonies of theſe three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents,
I thought fit here to ſet down with what perſpicuity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31601:10"/>
and brevity I could, (not ſwerving in the leaſt from the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and meaning of the Affidavits themſelves) which are at
large upon Record, taken before Honourable Perſons, as was
before touched in each of them; the name of the Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the Judge, before whom taken, being particulary remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
in giving their teſtimonies in brief, for the Readers fuller
ſatisfaction, and further confirmation.</p>
            <p>To which I might adde many more of the like Kind, thirty
ſeveral at leaſt, but that I here account needleſſe, ſince in the
mouth of two or three witneſſes, each thing in controverſy, is,
and ought to be confirmed, and here we have not only witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but (<hi>ipſos fatentes reos</hi>) the perſons concerned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
(either ignorantly or knowingly, drawn in thereto,) upon
Oath confeſſing againſt both themſelves, and one another,
which is a teſtimony as firm as can be deſired or expected.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſpeak a little more particularly to the Statute of
Bankruptſhip, ſued forth by <hi>Read</hi> in the name of <hi>Dun</hi> againſt
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> and firmed by Commiſſioners pickt, and packt for the
ſame purpoſe, only to diſcharge <hi>Read</hi> from paying any monies
to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> whoſe juſt debt, upon a legal recovery was upward
of <hi>800l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For taking forth, and granting, or affirming the ſame, <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
brought his action againſt <hi>Read,</hi> and thoſe Commiſſioners,
his Confederates; and upon Tryal in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1660. recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them <hi>500l.</hi> notwithſtanding which, upon an <hi>Affidavit</hi> of
<hi>Reads,</hi> read openly in the Court, at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made to have a ſecond hearing, which was had by the
conſent of both Plantiff and Defendants the <hi>Hillary</hi> Term fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
where <hi>Read</hi> (according to his old wont) procured in
readineſſe four ſeveral witneſſes, to ſwear <hi>Dawſon</hi> a real Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
(<hi>viz.) Thomas Wigge,</hi> one of Honeſt Sir <hi>John Lenthalls</hi>
Engineers, a villain ſo notorious in that kind, that if in any
Caſe, (where he is well paid) his Evidence come ſhort, (that
is) be not ſworn home enough, blame the Lawyer that gave
him not better and larger inſtructions, and not him, who wants
only to be informed, what manner of Oath will ſerve turn;
then as for performance, let him alone for one. The ſecond <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
Wragge,</hi> ſervant to <hi>Read,</hi> one who had learned ſo much of
his Maſters qualities, that no wiſe man can truſt his Word, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31601:10"/>
believe his Oath; the third <hi>Robert Coghill,</hi> a neighbour to <hi>Read,</hi>
who by this hopeful beginning, gives great aſſurance, what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Knight of the Poſt he may prove in time, if he continue the
acquaintance, and follow the direction of <hi>Read;</hi> the laſt, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Adamſon</hi> formerly a Clerk to <hi>Read,</hi> who it ſeems ſtill
wants his help at a dead lift, (knowing his abilities) though
at preſent he hath left his Service: Theſe four, being pre-inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
could (if occaſion had required) have ſworn any man
of dealing, in <hi>England</hi> a Bankrupt; for to give them their due,
in their depoſitions, there wanted nothing but Truth, Malice
enough, and Formality ſufficient, with a home ſhot to reach
the mark aimed at by <hi>Read,</hi> their Tutor, who put cruel words
of falſehood into their mouths, and told them what manner of
Oaths would ſerve his turn, and they accordingly ſwore as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly,
deſperately, and reſolutely againſt the Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of their innocent Neighbour, whom ſome of them
knew not, others very little; all of them, knew certainly that
what they ſwore againſt him, was abſolutely falſe, and ſo God
by his providence hath plainly ſince diſcover'd it to be, to the
great ſhame of thoſe poor perjured wretches; but moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of that Monſter, who ſuborned them to doe it, as he had
done others often before.</p>
            <p>For which wilful perjury (palpably now detected) theſe four
abovenamed, ſtand indicted at the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> by
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> who doubts not, but to have them brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne,
and Exemplary puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thus have I in brief decyphred out to you, a great Monſter
in villany, as in a Landskip, given you a large volume of Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
contracted into an Epitome, a ſhort narrative of what to his
coſt and trouble, <hi>Dawſon</hi> (who hath ſtill been the ſufferer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto)
hath felt for theſe many years, to the ruine almoſt of
his Wife, Children, and Family, and whoſe Caſe or Lot may
it not be next? nay who can eſcape for future? if ſuch Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
be countenanced, as they will be if not prohibited, and
ſeverely puniſhed to the terror of others? It is reported of a
Bravoe, that he would vauntingly boaſt, how he had at his
beck ready an hundred to ſwear for him, an hundred to fight
for him, and an hundred more to ſupply him with money.</p>
            <p>The thing, (though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot affirm the number) is moſt true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31601:11"/>
of this <hi>Read;</hi> who as for ſwearers, hath made his boaſts, that
he is ſo provided with a ſtock of them, as never to fail in any
Caſe, and that his manner of dealing with ſuch Knights of the
Poſt, is ſuitable to that of the Dutch before a Sea-fight, with
their Marriners, <hi>viz.</hi> to give them 20 or 30 glaſſes of Sack,
juſt before they come upon their Oaths, then (quoth he) they
are fit to ſerve my turn, and ſwear reſolutely, bravely, and
boldly, without making the leaſt ſcruple of any thing that is told
them makes abſolutely for the good of the Cauſe depending,
to have it ſworn either thus, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And for fighting (or rather maintaining his quarrel,) 'twould
make a man bleſſe himſelf to ſee prodigious Villains ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
before one that mannageth a Cauſe as juſt as Juſtice it ſelf,
(having been ſo often determined juſt, by the reiterated Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Common-Law, Commiſſioners for Equity; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
How did the honeſt Maſter of the Rolls (Speaker to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Rump) endeavour to entrap <hi>Dawſon</hi> in favour of <hi>Read?</hi>
How was <hi>Read</hi> with great charge, brought into a Priſon, where
he deſerved to lye till death, yet (<hi>Preſto be gone Sir</hi>) diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
forthwith? and <hi>Dawſon</hi> brought in upon a large Scroll of
Fob'd Actions, to keep the other, and ſuch as he procured to
commit Perjury wilfully and maliciouſly, from Condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?
How ready was the Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to Execute a
Writ upon a forged Warrant for Judgement, againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi>
and yet knew it to be ſo, (uſing this expreſſion, He would Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
1000 the like, if they were brought to him, and Goods
of <hi>Dawſons</hi> to be found in his Balywick;) yet how loth, nay ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unwilling to Execute a true Writ, upon a Judgement,
juſtly recovered, in Court, (after the diſcovery of a pack of
Roguery) againſt <hi>Read;</hi> though oft in his Company, nor would
be perſwaded to make return of the ſame, till <hi>Reads</hi> Cockatriſe
Eggs of Villany were hatched? How have the Gaolers, and their
fetting dogs, complyed with this perjured Monſter and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
to ruine one in defence of the other? <hi>Portington</hi> a
Condemned Debtor to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and Priſoner to Sir <hi>John Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall</hi>
in Execution, having liberty to chooſe whether he would
live in reſtraint or no; and <hi>Read</hi> caſt into Priſon, for Perjury,
and Subornation thereto, Forgery, perſonating other men,
and taking upon him their names, not without great coſt and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31601:11"/>
charge to the Plaintiff, yet he in ſhort time, let out, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Bayl, though <hi>Dawſon</hi> wrongfully impriſoned upon
feigned, falſe Actions, maliciouſly brought againſt him, to
hinder his proſecuting theſe ſo abominable Villains, hath not
liberty to remain in one priſon; but is toſt (like a Curr in a
blanket) from Gaol to Gaol, to a vaſt expence of monyes, nor
without danger to his perſon, being this preſent Term, removed
from the <hi>Fleet</hi> (where he was ſo happy, as to be free from
groſſe incivilities,) to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> where the Keeper Sir
<hi>John Lenthall,</hi> for a baſe bribe, hath injuſtly (yet much like
himſelf, and his Brother, the <hi>Quondam</hi> Ravenous Maſter of the
Rolls) ſuffered <hi>Portington,</hi> a Priſoner in Execution, at his Suit,
to have free liberty, theſe many years, to the defrauding his
greatly oppreſſed Creditor, and his extraordinary dammage;
and is now become a deadly Enemy to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> becauſe he Sues
him for an Eſcape.</p>
            <p>I might be large here, but that I ſtudy and muſt affect brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
In a word then to cloſe this ſad diſcourſe concerning this
bad Subject, I wiſh only that the effect and tendency of ſuch
practiſes would be ſeriouſly weighed, which is no other than
the total ſubverſion of all our Laws, and deſtruction of civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy;
for if all that is recovered by legal proceſſe, may be ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,
and detained from the Plantiff, and Coſts multiplyed
by vexatious after hearings, his Eſtate pluckt away violently, by
forged Judgements, and theſe proved true and real by wilfull
perjury, till the party thus wronged hath not monyes left him
to proſecute ſuch injuries, or to make a motion in Court, yet
when this is diſcovered, and openly made to appear, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
doing the wrong, be not curbed, and diſcountenanced, what
hopes can an honeſt man have for future in a juſt and righteous
Cauſe, well then may we cry out with the Philoſopher, <hi>fiat
Juſtitia, aut ruet Coelum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Willingly could I now throw aſide my pen, but that more
injuries compel me to a farther complaint: From relating the
Villanies of an Attorney; I would next proceed to match him
with a pair of as great Villains as himſelf, in his own profeſſion,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Sollicitor and a Counſellor, which three, if the Devi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had
a Cauſe to be proſecuted, he could not be better fitted with a
leaſh of Lawyers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:31601:12"/>
But before I come to a ſurvey of their Villanous actings, I ſhall
relate a ſhort particular Caſe, which for ought I know hath no
relation to any of the reſt, but was carried on by the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Maſter of the Rolles, and a Kinſman of his (as very an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man as himſelf) to the Dammage of <hi>Dawſon</hi> at the leaſt
<hi>2000l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the year 1649. <hi>Dawſon</hi> Commenced a Suit with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
Binkes</hi> a <hi>Graſier,</hi> for a great ſumme of money, which he
injuriouſly detained from him, and by Law recovered <hi>805l.</hi>
and had Judgment entered for the ſame, <hi>Binkes</hi> brings his Bill
for relief in Chancery, whereupon after a tedious Suit, and
great Expences (the Commiſſioners for examination of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
ſitting above a hundred and eighty miles from <hi>London,</hi>)
at laſt the cauſe came to hearing, before the honeſt Speaker
<hi>William Lenthal,</hi> at the Rolls, who perſwaded <hi>Dawſon</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the matter to a perſon whom he ſhould name, promiſing
to name an honeſt indifferent man, a ſtranger to both their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and the Cauſe; but ſcorning to be as good as his word,
nominated a Kinſman of his own, by name <hi>John Nabbs,</hi> whoſe
Son was Sollicitor in that Cauſe againſt <hi>Dawſon for Binks,</hi> and
pleaded it before his Father ſo effectually, that <hi>Nabbs</hi> gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Judgment of <hi>805l.</hi> from <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and moreover, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him to pay <hi>44l. 4s. 6d.</hi> coſts to <hi>Binks,</hi> a ſtrange order,
which could not be expected otherwiſe, conſidering how it was
brought forth, for neither <hi>Dawſon,</hi> or any friend of his for him,
was preſent or heard, but only <hi>Binks</hi> and ſuch who ſpake on his
ſide, the chief of whom was <hi>Nabbs</hi> Son, a Sollicitor retained
by <hi>Binks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was the Judgment only given away, but <hi>Dawſon</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to acknowledge ſatisfaction for the ſame upon Record,
which he refuſing, appealed to the then Lords Commiſſioners,
<hi>Liſle,</hi> &amp;c. who without proofs or allegations, ordered <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
to be committed Priſoner to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> until he ſubmitted
to perform the order of <hi>Nabbs,</hi> whom the Maſter of the Rolls
had impowered to hear, and finally determine that Cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
appeal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nabbs</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Dawſon</hi> queſtioned his decretal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in a moſt unjuſt revenge, further ordered <hi>180l.</hi> more to
be paid to <hi>Binks</hi> for coſts, which payment <hi>Dawſon</hi> refuſing, a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31601:12"/>
Serjeant at Armes was commanded to ſeize and impriſon
him, till he did acknowledge ſatisfaction on the Judgment for
<hi>805l.</hi> pay the firſt <hi>44l. 4s. 6d.</hi> and the other <hi>180l.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for Coſts, and give a general Releaſe, never more to
queſtion <hi>Binks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the injuſtice of <hi>Nabbs</hi> decree may eaſily be evinced, for
that the Maſter of the Rolls, before <hi>Dawſon</hi> conſented to the
reference, proffer'd to give him by decree, <hi>380l.</hi> (taking the
rule of thoſe Conſciencious Jurors, who at a venture hang half,
and ſave half,) which <hi>Dawſon</hi> refuſing as unjuſt, and too much
damnifying him, at laſt conſented to a reference, where ſuch a
Referre was appointed by <hi>Lenthal,</hi> who gave not only the
judgement away wholly, but above <hi>200l.</hi> more, for imaginary
coſts, refuſing to hear any teſtimony on <hi>Dawſons</hi> ſide, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
binding him up to his determination, upon pain of
impriſonment, to avoid which, <hi>Dawſon</hi> was a long time hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from County to County, by the Officers of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and
at laſt finding ſuch a fugitive life, to tend to his abſolute ruine,
he was enforced to ſubmit to this monſtrous piece of injuſtice,
not ſeeing then any hopes of remedy. <hi>Lenthal</hi> being a man ſo
powerful, and <hi>Nabbs</hi> ſupported by him, that not to yield to
them then, ſignified nothing elſe but preſent ruine, they being
able to cruſh at their pleaſure whom they liſted.</p>
            <p>He that knows the manner of dealing of the Maſter of the
Rolls, may give a ſhrewd gueſſe at what it coſt <hi>Binkes</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
this piece of injuſtice, who thriv'd ſo well upon it, that
he who then was viſibly reſponſible for ſuch a debt trebled, is
now as far from being maſter of a tithe of ſuch a ſumme, as he
was then from honeſty; from whence may be concluded unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably,
that at the long runne, honeſt dealing will prove the
beſt policy.</p>
            <p>And now I am at leiſure to take notice of, and lay open the
injuries wherewith I have been, and ſtill am oppreſſed, by the
procurement of two Lawyers, a Counſellour, and a Sollicitor,
Brothers in Profeſſion, Name, and Villainy, <hi>Francis Lutterel,</hi>
and <hi>Edward Lutterel,</hi> who both write themſelves of <hi>Grayes-Inne,</hi>
but their practiſes have been ſo baſely foul, and groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupt, as may juſtly be the ſhame of all the Innes of Court,
which I hope will ſhortly ſpue out ſuch, (I will not ſay Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,

becauſe they are Lawyers) but who are the ſcorn and
ſhame of the long Robe.</p>

            <p>He as I ſaid being employed by <hi>Dawſon</hi> as a Sollicitor, was

ſtood made up in Stacks, in which time the graſs upon the Land,
was (for feeding Cattle) worth at leaſt threeſcore pound or

Luttrel</hi> the Counſellor, with the Scedule of <hi>Dawſons</hi> Debts annexed
to the Deed, which <hi>Edward Luttrel</hi> upon receipt of this Deed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to diſcharge, and for ever to acquit <hi>Dawſon</hi> from, and every
part of them, then and there aſſuming, and faithfully engaging his
promiſe to pay to <hi>Dawſon 500l.</hi> over and above the Debts; This
Deed was made <hi>July</hi> 25. 1659. as by it and the Scedule doth more
at large appear. <hi>Edward</hi> having gotten this Eſtate in his hands, began
to ſlight <hi>Dawſon,</hi> bidding him pay his Debts himſelf, nor did he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſatisfie them as he had ingaged, nor pay to <hi>Dawſon</hi> one penny,
according to his Aſſumption, and faithful promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dawſon</hi> being thus deluded, and unworthily dealt with, addreſſeth
himſelf to the Counſellor (<hi>Francis Luttrel</hi>) who had promiſed, and
undertaken to him, that his Brother <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould fully perform
and make good his promiſe, or he in default of him would himſelf
make it good, but he was ſo far from performing what he promiſed,
that he threatned <hi>Dawſon,</hi> that in caſe he ſued or moleſted him upon

him, one Groat, the Counſellor his Brother would furniſh him
with a <hi>1000l.</hi> to ſpend in Law.</p>
            <p>From which time both the <hi>Luttrels,</hi> have moſt maliciouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined

<hi>Dawſon</hi> to make over the Eſtate unto him.</p>
            <p>Which by his own words and Confeſſion, as is teſtified upon Oath
by one of his acquaintance, was worth more than <hi>1000l.</hi> and made
over to him upon that Conſideration, that he ſhould firſt of all pay
Debts, to which he agreed, and promiſed the ſame, but ſaid he
would neither do it, nor give <hi>Dawſon</hi> an account of his Eſtate, of
which Intention, being demanded the reaſon, gave this, that he had
got into his hands the whole by which <hi>Dawſon</hi> intended, or was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

would keep himſelf but honeſt, he would keep him poor enough;

which and the like falſe ſuggeſtions, <hi>Dawſon</hi> was tied up by Injunction
and Orders not to proceed at Common Law, till the Cauſe were
heard in the Court of Chancery, where when <hi>Dawſon</hi> preferred his
Croſs-bill of Complaint, expecting to have the merits of his Cauſe
heard by the Right Honourable the Lord Chancellor; In ſtead of
Anſwer, he had an old Outlawry, long before reverſed, and ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
pleaded in Bar to his Complaint, to diſprove which, coſt the
ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> much money, beſides great trouble and delay of time;
To adde to whoſe incumbrance, and if poſſible to make him for ever
uncapable to proſecute thoſe oppreſſing betrayers of his peace, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
hath cauſed to be ſued againſt him moſt of thoſe Debts which he
had engaged to diſcharge and pay, yet keeps his Eſtate without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
therefore, or account thereof given to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> pretending
it was formally made over to him only in truſt, which truſt he hath
made good with a vengance; But in truth the Goods were abſolutely
ſold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Deed of bargain and ſale delivered to him (<hi>bonâ fide</hi>)
upon which he received them, took them into his poſſeſſion, ſold as
much of them as according to his own words would ſerve his turn,
and then complied with <hi>Read</hi> to ſeize the reſt (as <hi>Dawſons</hi> goods)
which he upon abſolute ſale, aud delivery, had enjoyed and poſſeſſed
for many months together, with the Land which <hi>Dawſon</hi> made over
to him, for the full time of his Leaſes therein, without moleſtation
of <hi>Read, Dun,</hi> or any other, and had them alſo ſix months in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after the time was expired, which <hi>Dawſon</hi> made over to him by
vertue of his Leaſes.</p>
            <p>Yea when <hi>Dawſon</hi> after the Sale and Delivery (being with him in
<hi>Norfolk</hi>) adviſed him to the ſelling of the Hay, in which he had more
inſight then <hi>Luttrell;</hi> he bad him meddle with his own buſineſs, for
he had nothing to do there with either the Goods or Ground, which
were ſold and made over to him; And after that, when <hi>Dawſon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he did not pay thoſe debts, he deſired of him, that he
would either ſell the Goods, and make payment, or reſign them to
ſome other, who would give ſecurity, to indemnifie him, (the
ſaid <hi>Luttrell,</hi>) as to his ingagement of paying debts; but he replyed,
the Goods were his own, which he would neither reſign, nor ſell,
but when he ſaw his own time. Nor was he aſhamed to boaſt, that
he had met with ſuch a bargain from <hi>Dawſon,</hi> that he would put
<hi>500l.</hi> into his own purſe thereby, which it were ſtrange if he could
do any other way, than by cheating him of the whole, and that was the
courſe he took, in which he was incouraged and ſupported by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

And ſuitable to the dealing of him, in this Caſe of Hay and Leaſes
of Land, was another trick of knavery put upon <hi>Richard</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi>
about the ſale of a Coach, which coſting <hi>Richard 40. l.</hi> he ſold it to
<hi>Luttrell</hi> for <hi>30l.</hi> by a Deed of Sale, which <hi>30l.</hi> he the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi>

aſſume and promiſe to make; upon which only conſideration, the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Luttrell</hi> who ordered the Deed to be made, accepted of this

<hi>Dawſon</hi> of the Debt of five pounds, though ſince the Coach is ſold by
<hi>Edward,</hi> and the money for it received, and ſpent, <hi>Francis</hi> makes
new demand of the money from <hi>Dawſon, Edward</hi> refuſing to pay
either his Brother <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Richard Norwich,</hi> but when ſued
for this Debt of thirty pounds by <hi>Dawſon,</hi> he firſt by <hi>Levata querela,</hi>
removed it into the Mayors Court, where by his Bill, he pretended
himſelf only a Truſtee for the Coach, as before he was for the Hay,
though ſuch truſts ſo diſcharged, will ſhortly bring him to be truſted
by none.</p>
            <p>For theſe have been his continual Subterfuges, firſt to pretend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a truſt in <hi>Dawſons</hi> Goods, that he might have colour to ſue for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
in Chancery, and there in ſtead of making anſwer material to the
Cauſe depending, to plead old reverſed Outlawryes in Bar, ſo that at
once <hi>Dawſon</hi> is tied up from his legal courſe of proceeding (by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions)
and debarred in Chancery to proſecute thoſe his Bills,
till he hath with great coſt and trouble diſproved the pretended Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawryes
to be in force, of which <hi>Luttrel</hi> hath made his brags to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of his Companions, as is by ſome of them teſtified upon Oath,
and alſo upon Record.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it argue a mind as bad as bad may be, but by
compliance with the Clerks of Chancery, this <hi>Luttrel</hi> hath not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
penned his own Orders, which have been entred down accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own words (as can be proved againſt him undeniably)
upon which advantage it is not to be wondred at, that <hi>Dawſon</hi> is ſtill
the ſufferer, when his Enemies profell, are in effect the Contrivers

Now how ſad the Caſe of <hi>Dawſon</hi> is, may be collected briefly, if
we conſider his preſent Condition, and compare it with what he was
formerly, one who dealt for at leaſt 20000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> Rented in
Land (for feeding of Cattle, and for Hay) 900 <hi>l.</hi> annually, and by
Gods bleſſing upon his Endeavours, had by his Induſtry gotten ſuch
an Eſtate, by which He and his Family lived comfortably and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
whoſe Credit would have paſt without ſcruple for 3. or 4.
thouſand pounds: now to find him a Priſoner, his Eſtate pluckt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from him by Knavery, Injuſtice, Perjury, and Subornation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Forgery, and Counterfeiting his Name and Perſon, by which
means he is damnified at the leaſt 8000 <hi>l.</hi> beſides what by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
in this time he might have got thereby, in his way of dealing,
for want of which money (although he hath made legal recovery of
the greateſt part of it) he hath Contracted ſome Debts, which he
is unable to ſatisfie, unleſs he might have his due from others, one of
which Debts due to him upon Judgement (if paid) would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
every real Creditor that could juſtly make demand of moneys
from him.</p>
            <p>But in ſtead of payment, theſe honeſt Debtors to <hi>Dawſon,</hi> have all
combined together in a mutual engagement never to diſcharge one
Farthing, yet are men of able Eſtates, <hi>Portington</hi> a man reſponſible,
detaining 1297 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d.</hi> for above 12. years, and putting <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

Warrant of Attorney (which was ſatisfied) and 500 <hi>l.</hi> againſt him,
and other his Confederates, for Dammages ſuſtained by a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Bankruptſhip, ſued out againſt <hi>Dawſon,</hi> upon a forged War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

boaſts that (rather than pay a Groat) he will rot in priſon, though
he hath at command ſeveral thouſand pounds to maintain him, which
with his Land he will ſo make over to Feoffees in truſt, that the
Plaintiff ſhall never get penny, not know how to find his Eſtate:
And although at another time he took away a thouſand pounds
worth of the Goods of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> upon a forged Judgment; In diſprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, and diſcovering the Forgery, Perjury, and Subornation
to Perjury, committed therein, it coſt <hi>Dawſon</hi> ſeveral hundred
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31601:16"/>
pounds, and though the order of Court were, that upon diſproving
that Warrant to be real, the Goods levied in Execution ſhould be
returned to the Owner of the ſame, yet he hath not yet received
nor can get the leaſt ſatisfaction therefore; Nor will the Sheriff of
<hi>Norfolk</hi> make return of that Writ of Execution, upon which he took
away the Goods of <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and ſold them almoſt two years ſince;
To which oppreſſions may be added the giving away a Judgement of
805 <hi>l.</hi> recovered againſt <hi>Binks,</hi> by <hi>Nabbs,</hi> upon Commiſſion granted
him by <hi>Lenthal,</hi> then Maſter of the Rolles, to hear and determine
that Cauſe without appeal, which he determined without hearing
<hi>Dawſon,</hi> or any Witneſſe, Counſellor, or Sollicitor in his behalf,
giving away moreover, beſides the Debt, 200 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards for
Coſts.</p>
            <p>And laſtly <hi>Edward Luttrell</hi> upon pretence of ſecuring <hi>Dawſon</hi> from
the like future plots of <hi>Read,</hi> and his complices, with promiſe (as hath
been related) of paying <hi>Dawſons</hi> real Debts, and bringing an overplus
into his purſe, for the maintenance of him, his Wife, and Family,
hath cheated him of all he had left, his Brother and he now comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſqueeze <hi>Dawſon,</hi> and bring him to utter ruine, (a bad requital of the
many years kindneſſes ſhewed by <hi>Richard</hi> to <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he kept
from ſtarving) who now if it lay in his power would ſtarve him and
his.</p>
            <p>And that the falſehood and baſeneſſe of theſe two Brothers in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
may be made more evident, beſides the ingratitude of <hi>Edward,</hi>

               </hi>) includes all that can be ſpoken evil concerning any perſon;
it will not be amiſs to hint in brief, the remarkable honeſty of the
Counſellor <hi>Francis,</hi> who being ſummoned by <hi>Richard</hi> at the Tryal
between him and his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> concerning the Debt of thirty
pounds, due upon Sale of a Coach, at which Deed of Sale, <hi>Francis</hi> was
preſent, and ordred the making thereof, and thereupon accepted 5 <hi>l.</hi>
from his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> which was due to him from <hi>Dawſon,</hi> yet
he againſt his own Conſcience and Knowledge, ſwore that the Deed
was there made fraudulently, for the defrauding of ſome Creditors,
which <hi>Edward</hi> upon a former Deed of Sale (of Hay and Leaſes of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture

to diſcharge, yet <hi>Francis</hi> upon Oath declared, that to Evade thoſe

preſent in Court, bleſſed themſelves to hear him ſo ſwear, the Judge
telling him openly, that Oath could not be true, or if it were, it
would argue himſelf to be a very Knave: not long after which Tryal
the Coach was ſold, and the mony ſhar'd, but not a penny paid either
to <hi>Dawſon</hi> or his Order. Now what Juſtice can be expected againſt
ſuch perſons, that can, and dare ſo ſwear, let the World Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this only a failing at that preſent in the Counſellor
<hi>Francis,</hi> but according to the relation of his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> to
<hi>Dawſon</hi> (in the hearing of ſeveral perſons,) <hi>Francis</hi> the Counſellor,
made offer to him (the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi>) of 300 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p>HAving thus, with as much brevity as I could, related my great
grievances, under which I have long groaned, and for remedy
whereof I have tryed many wayes (for divers years) both in Law and
Equity; But by reaſon of the Corruption of former times, the power, and
number of my Adverſaries, and mine own inability (at length) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
them in a Legal Courſe, being reduced by theſe long oppreſſures, to
great ſtreights, and at preſent a Priſoner, loaded with many Malicious
Forged Actions, to hinder my Liberty, upon reaſonable ſecurity ſuch as
my preſent conditition will afford me to procure.</p>
            <p>Some of my Creditors by the instigation of <hi>Read, Portington,</hi> and the

Execution thereupon, only to hinder my going abroad without charge of

Chamber-rent and Outgoing Fees) amounting to at leaſt 10 or 12 <hi>s.</hi>
each day, is ſo great a burthen, that while I am ſo Confined, or have
Liberty at ſuch rates, I can expect nothing but utter ruine to my ſelf, and
all that are neerly related, and dear unto me.</p>

ruined and deſtroyed, and ſeveral fellow-Priſoners I meet with daily,
oppreſſed by the ſame courſes of injuſtice, falſe Oaths, counterfeit War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for confeſſing Judgments, falſe Actions, under which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which wayes of unjust vexation, together with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
unreaſonable charges which (through the corruption of times)
now accompany impriſonment, many are reduced to that extremity that
they want for the conveniences of life, much more unable are they, by any

            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen; You are your ſelves the fathers of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whom God long preſerve and bleſſe; Howbeit none of you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to them a future immunity from the like miſeries, unleſſe this
<hi>Cockatrice</hi>-Egge of corruption and injuſtice be cruſhed, which no foot,
but ſuch a foot of Authority can do. Theſe unjust vexatious, Law Suits,
or rather Law Cheats, bringing ſweet gain to very many, who though
they will not openly defend, yet will connive at ſuch practiſes, ſo lucrife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and beneficial to themſelves, and their dependants.</p>
            <p>But conſidering there is legal profit ſufficient, allowed to all honeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Juſtice, and what comes in this way, is ſqueezed out of the heart
blood of his Majesties most faithful Subjects, thouſands of whom have
been ruined in their Eſtates, Credit, or both, by ſuch illegal proceedings.
My caſe alſo being ſo groſſely and fouly exemplary, that it cauſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
in all who hear it: I doubt not, but that your Honours and
Wiſdomes will think of a way of relief, as for all the like oppreſſures in
general, ſo for your moſt humble Supplicant in particular, that we may
have cauſe (from our hearts) to bleſſe God for the happy change of
times, when our bowels ſhall be refreſhed, our miſeries conſidered, and
out unjuſt vexatious oppreſſures relieved, by your power, prudence, and
justice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not dare to preſcribe any means to ſo grave, wiſe, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Council, but with all humble ſubmiſſion expect and wait for ſuch a
remedy as ſhall appear meet to your judicious breaſts, praying the great
God (who ſits in your Aſſembly,) ſo to aſſiſt you with his bleſſing
from above, that you may your ſelves become a bleſſing to this Kingdome,
a Sanctuary to the diſtreſſed, a defence againſt wrongs and injuſtice, and
a refreſhment in particular, to</p>
