            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>TIs ten dayes ſince ſhe dy'd, and though I ſlept,</l>
               <l>Her ſolemne obſequies even then I kept:</l>
               <l>Although I wore no blacks, colours for ſorrow,</l>
               <l>Which graceleſſe ſons and widows too oft borrow,</l>
               <l>Who think their fathers liv'd too long and mourn</l>
               <l>For that, or perhaps fear they ſhould return,</l>
               <l>I cannot (as the wilder Iriſh uſe)</l>
               <l>Or ſcreeke or houle, and ſo their dead abuſe;</l>
               <l>I can ſcarce weep, but I can ſigh my part,</l>
               <l>And keepe a ſolemne Funerall in my heart:</l>
               <l>Sighs do but caſe the ſpleen, and teares the brain,</l>
               <l>As clouds are eas'd by thunder and by raine.</l>
               <l>I beg no caſe, nor do I crave reliefe,</l>
               <l>My ſoule is happyeſt when I hug the griefe:</l>
               <l>My ſoul looks upward then to her above,</l>
               <l>And to its proper center ſeems to move,</l>
               <l>Admit her fair, chaſte, noble, young,</l>
               <l>And fit for marriage, ſhould I therefore wrong</l>
               <l>My faith and hope? nay, for theſe love her leſſe,</l>
               <l>Or ſeem to doubt or feare her happineſſe?</l>
               <l>When I ſuch ſweet angelick creatures ſee,</l>
               <l>I think how happy ſuch fair ſouls muſt be,</l>
               <l>When they refin'd and purifi'd ſhall riſe,</l>
               <l>How glorious then will ſhee be in our eyes?</l>
               <l>As when the corne into the earth we throw,</l>
               <l>Such do our bodies by corruption grow;</l>
               <l>But when they riſe, our bodies ſhall appear</l>
               <l>More glorious then the corn in its full eare:</l>
               <l>Admit us changed, yet we muſt be try'd,</l>
               <l>By flames of fire as gold is purifi'd,</l>
               <l>For my faith teaches me all in this world</l>
               <l>Shall into Gods calcining pot be hurl'd,</l>
               <l>And turn'd into a Calx, from which ſhall riſe</l>
               <l>Another world, too glorious for our eyes,</l>
               <l>As now they are, for were they not refin'd,</l>
               <l>Its glory (like the Sun) would ſtrike us blinde.</l>
               <l>Till that time, ſay, which is it thou can'ſt ſee</l>
               <l>Which truly can deſerve a ſmile from thee?</l>
               <l>Save onely this, that death thou need'ſt not feare</l>
               <l>If thou could'ſt either live or dye like her.</l>
               <l>Nay, thou ſo far from feare of death ſhould'ſt be</l>
               <l>Thy eyes (like <hi>Stephens)</hi> would thy Redeemer ſee</l>
               <l>Sitting upon his Throne of glory, and</l>
               <l>The ſacred Legions round about him ſtand;</l>
