            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It would be fitting before we enter upon the Evidence, to give ſome account, why (among ſo many Offenders, ſome of them of greater Quality than <hi>William Staley)</hi> we choſe firſt to bring this man to Tryal. It is not unknown to any man that lives in <hi>England,</hi> what a Diſcovery there hath been of horrid and damnable Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King's Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion. There are a ſort of men in the World, that endeavour what they can to cry down this Diſcovery, as that it was altogether Suppoſitious, and a Fable. It is true, ſome are ſo charitable as to think the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> might endeavour to promote the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, but that they ſhould have a Deſign againſt the Kings Perſon is a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But they ſhall be convinced by the Tryal of this man, that there was ſuch a Deſign, ſeeing the Priſoner even ſince the Diſcovery of this deviliſh Plot, and after ſo many have been impriſoned for it, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a Treaſonable mind, and a Trayterous attempt againſt the King's Perſon; the clear Evidence of which, is his ſpeaking thoſe words with which in the Indictment he is charged. This Priſoner by Religion is a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> he calls himſelf ſo; in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> he is a Papiſt: and finding that ſince this Plot was diſcovered, his trading decay'd, (being one that was a Banker for the <hi>Catholicks)</hi> he grew enraged that their Money was called ſo faſt for, and being in the company of one <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi> a Foreigner, at a <hi>Cook's</hi> ſhop, he takes notice of the diſcovery of the Plot, (being a very great well-wiſher to it) and enters into a great Paſſion, and ſpake theſe words of the King: <hi>That he was a great He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, and the greateſt Rogue in the World</hi>; then holding up his hand, he clapt it upon his Heart, and ſaid, <hi>I would with this hand kill him my ſelf.</hi> Theſe words were heard by two Gentlemen that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſpoken in <hi>French.</hi>

in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Staley</hi> then ſaid twice over, <hi>The King was a grand Heretick,</hi> making this Demonſtration, with his hand upon his Breaſt, and ſtampt five or ſix times with his Foot in great Fury. The old man <hi>Bartholomew Fromante,</hi> his Friend, ſaid, <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>was a Tormentor of the People of God,</hi> and he anſwered again, <hi>The King of</hi> England, and repeated it again in a great Fury, <hi>the King of</hi> England <hi>is a great Heretick and the greateſt Rogue in the World; there's the Heart,</hi> (ſtriking his hand on his Breaſt) <hi>and here's the Hand that would kill him my ſelf, and</hi> he ſaid further, <hi>the King and Parliament think all is over, but the Rogues are miſtaken.</hi>

                  <head>Lord Chief Juſtice his Speech.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>THe Statute hath been read, which was made ſince the King came in, for the preſervation of his perſon, and during his life: the Parliament thought it reaſonable, even to make deſperate words to be Treaſon, although there was no other thing but words, that is, ſuch words, as if the thing had been done would be Treaſon, the ſpeaking it is Treaſon. When we come to obſerve the manner of this ſpeaking, methinks there is no great difficulty to ſatisfie the Jury that they were ſpoke adviſedly and maliciouſly. They were in a publick houſe, and by accident heard: they concealed them not a moment, and not from the man that did not underſtand <hi>French.</hi> To hear a man ſay in a great paſſion, that his King was a Heretick, and the greateſt Rogue in the world, and that he would kill him, to write down the words preſently, they ſlept not upon it, they found out who he was, the next day they came to attach him: they kept him, for what? till they could get a Conſtable. So that here is nothing doubtful either in the circumſtance or ſubſtance of his Caſe: ſo that you cannot have a plainer proof in the World then there is in this. For my own part, when it is in the Caſe of a man's life, I would not have any compliance with the rumors or diſorder of times that ſhould be an evidence againſt him, but would have a verdict depend upon the Witneſſes, that ſwear the fact down right upon him. You and we all are ſenſible of the great difficulties and hazards that is now both againſt the Kings perſon, and againſt all Proteſtants, and our Religion too, which will hadly maintain it's ſelf, when they have deſtroyed the men; but let 'em know, that many thouſands will loſe their Religion with their lives, for we will not be Papiſts, let the Juſuits preſs what they will (who are the foundations of all this miſchief) in making proſelites, by telling them, do what wickedneſs you will it's no ſin, but we can ſave you, and if you omit what we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we can damn you. This they will not own when it comes to be an objection and penal upon them, but they will never get the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to declare he hath not a power to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate what he calls a Heretick, King, and if he does, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49375:6"/>
is not diſcharged from his obedience, they would do great ſervice to their Papiſt friends, if they could obtain ſuch an Edict. They print, preach, diſpute, and maintain otherwiſe, and thereby lead people to their own deſtruction and the deſtructions of others. Excuſe me, if <hi>I</hi> am a little warm, when perils are ſo many, their Murthers ſo ſecret, that we cannot diſcover the murther of that Gentleman, whom we all knew ſo well; when things are tranſacted ſo cloſly, and our King in ſo great danger, and Religion at ſtake. Tis better to be warm here than in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi> But that the man might have juſtice done him, he hath had his Witneſſes, and might have had this old Man, if he had named him to Mr. <hi>Richardſon:</hi> and to ſhew what fair play he has had, Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> tells you the old Man hath been examined upon Oath, and offers him the Copy of his Examination to uſe, but he thinks not fit to uſe it for his defence, therefore nothing is ſmothered The offence you have heard in words plain enough, unleſs the ſence is perverted by Jeſuitical cunning and equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beſt part of their learning and honeſty. They ſwear it expreſly, <hi>That the King was a Heretick and the greateſt Rogue in the World, and here's the heart and hand, that he would kill him himſelf</hi>; and hath and can have no other ſignification. The Statute ſaith <hi>Adviſedly</hi> and <hi>Maliciouſly.</hi> The manner of ſpeaking, and the words ſpoke, prove both: When a Papiſt once hath made a Man a Heretique, there is no ſcruple to murther him. Whoever is not of their Perſwaſion are Hereticks, and who ever are Hereticks may be murthered, if the Pope commands it, for which they may become Saints in Heaven; this is that they have practiſed. If there had been nothing of this in this Kingdome, or other parts of the World, it would be a hard thing to impoſe it upon them, but they ought not to complain, when ſo many inſtances are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Therefore diſcharge your Conſciences as you ought to do; if guilty let him take the reward of his Crime, and you ſhall do well to begin with this man, for perchance it may be a terrour to the reſt. Vnleſs they think they can be ſaved by dying in the Roman Faith, tho with ſuch pernicious and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous words and deſignes as theſe are; let ſuch go to Heaven by themſelves, <hi>I</hi> hope, <hi>I</hi> ſhall never go to that Heaven, where Men are made Saints for killing Kings.</q>
