         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ARGUMENTS, Inviting all Faithfull Marriners to ingage cheerefully in <hi>Englands</hi> Honourable and Juſt Cauſe, againſt the Iriſh Rebells and their Adherents, now Robbing at Sea, and about to Invade this NATION</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW my brave Blades, my Brethren and Seamen, if ever, now is the time for you to ſtand to your tackle: The great and glorious God of Heaven calls you forth to bring you to honour and purchaſe, for you are to fight the Lords battell by Sea, as your Brethren in the Army have done by Land, and you have as much cauſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect happy and ſpeedy ſucceſſe as they, for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The cauſe you fight for is the ſame, though the Element be changed, and God is Lord of the waters as well as of the Land, being Lord of all Hoſts, and God you know hath owned the Cauſe by many ſignall Victories</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Perſons againſt whom you are to fight, are of the ſame ſtampe, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Plunderers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and Iriſh Rebels, and among them ſuch as have beene already conquered by your Friends, and being let goe upon their words, not any more to moleſt this Nation, doe now moſt baſely and perfidiouſly break their Parrolls, and ſome of them being Engliſh men, and of Engliſh extractions, doe Vypour like, endeavour to teare out the very Bowels of their Mother, and therefore God cannot in juſtice bleſſe them, but being a moſt juſt God, commands you now to goe and ſcourge them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Obſerve their baſeneſſe and treachery, how they take all, aſwell Friends as Foes, honeſt Merchants, trading for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys good, and to get a poore Living by much hazard, are by their depredations ſpoyled, and them and their Families thereby expoſed to ruine; nay, and many of them too, as Malignant as themſelves; ſo that you may ſee their reſolution is to make all Fiſh that comes to Net with them, and if they preſume to doe ſuch out-rages now, when as they have but a little power, what will they not doe if they Conquer you.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Conſider, that the Nation unto which ſuch wicked Imps are joyned, is not onely a Barbarous, but a bloody people, witneſſe their unparrallell'd butcheries of hundreds, of thouſands, ſome few yeares paſt, of poore Proteſtants, Men, Women, and Infants, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred by them in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the cry of whoſe Innocent blood is got into Heaven, and hath prevailed with God to move the hearts of his ſons, the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> with much compaſſion to goe forth in glorious Fleets (the like whereof <hi>England</hi> never yet ſet out) to take vengeance on thoſe Murtherers and Traytors, and to procure unto your ſelves and your poſterities, eternall Fame and Glory.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Take notice that your enemie is dying already, and does as dying men doe, take hold of any thing for preſervation, any twig, any Nation, <hi>French, Spaniſh, Iriſh,</hi> though Atheiſts, Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe be the broken Reeds on which they leane, by which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their loſt and forlorne condition.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Ponder ſeriouſly, what is like to become of you and yours, in caſe ſuch wretches ſhould prevaile, who are like to be your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: what a mixture of vatlets are to have dominion over you; really, no people under the Sun would be ſuch ſlaves as you would be unto theſe Caniballs:</p>
            <p>And now I have ſhewne you your enemies, a generation moſt horrid, moſt deformed, enough to raiſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in any, but a Female heart, to pull downe, ſubdue, and vanquiſh, ſuch vile creatures: Ile now ſhew you your Friends who are in Conjunction with you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Heaven and all the powers therein, the Almighty God, even the Lord Jeſus, at whoſe very word onely, Armies fall backward; a God Omnipotent, Omniſcient, who can take away the courages of your enemies, and give animoſities to you.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A Parliament that have continually advanced your wages, endeavoured to make you a free people, that you and yours may live cheerfully, who hath eaſed you of Councell-Tables, High Commiſſion Courts, Star Chambers, Monopolies, and Tyrannie; whereby your comforts increaſe, and ſorrows decreaſe, a Parliament, who watching night and day, that you may ſleep, who take all the care that you may have all eaſe, the freeſt Parliament that ever <hi>England</hi> had, now freely Voting the ſame righteous things, they would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, had they not been over Voted by a corrupted Party; ſo farre from being a ſelfe-ſeeking Parliament, that they lend vaſt ſums of money out of their private Eſtates, to carry on the Worke, leaſt it ſhould miſcarry, and all for youre welfare: That after the Conqueſt, when you ſhall returne each with a prize or two, you may ſit downe with joy, recounting the great things God hath wrought by you, and for you, and that by the wiſe dome and direction of this Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">III. You have all the godly of the Land who night and day poure forth their prayers to God, to ruine your enemies, and to bleſſe and protect you, and to proſper this very deſigne in hand, and therefore you have ſtrong, nay aſſured hopes of Victory.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. You have the Lawes of God, Nature, and Nations, on your ſide, all teaching and requiring to defend your own, and to protect the Innocent, to relieve the oppreſſed Brethren.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Laſtly, you have a glorious and Victorious Army, vigilant to defend the Land, in caſe of Invaſion or Inſurrection at home, while you are preſerving the honour of the Seas abroad, who are ſo forward to manifeſt their former love to their Country, that in caſe you need and have a mind to it, will venture their perſons with you at Sea, as ſome of you have bravely done with them on Shoare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By all that hath been ſayd, it ſeems to me, that Heaven and Earth conſpire to Crown your heads with Lawrels, and to fil your hearts with courage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Enemy braggs that you intend baſely to betray your truſt, and to adhere to them; But they are of their Father, who was a Lyer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; we know you are confiding men, therefore we truſt you with all our ſtrength and wealth, we have had experience of your paſt fidelity at Goree, where you did ſomething, and much more would have done, had others actions jumpt with your deſires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now laying aſide the thought of your Enemies, not worthy your remembrance, recollect the dignity of your Aſſociats, a good Cauſe, an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, a faithfull Parliament, a Victorious Army, all the godly in the Common-wealth, and the Lawes of God, Nature, and Nations, and then ſee what an heap of arguments you have, able to bring courage into the hearts of Cowards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If you will be valiant, you will be happy, if you will neglect your duties, God will ſtirre up others (a little Gideons Army) to performe the, buſineſſe: God never wanted Inſtruments to doe his worke: but bleſſed be God you have meanes enough, if you doe not truſt too much in them, which ſin of all things you muſt beware of, and put your confidence in him who then will protect you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More might be ſayd, but more were loſſe of time, now 'tis a time for action; methinks I ſee your forward ſteps advance for Service, each to out-ſayle his Fellow, I feare each Line ſeemes to retard your paſſage, therefore Ile ſay no more, but wiſh your proſperous gales, a flying Enemy, or a ſubmitting one: God's gone before you, follow cloſe, the Chaſe will be ſucceſſefull, All's your owne.</p>
