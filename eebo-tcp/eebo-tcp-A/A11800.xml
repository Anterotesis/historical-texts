            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that is the hard and extreme meaſure which the Merchant Aduenturers here ſetled, meet with in their Staple commodity. Concerning which if there be not order preſently taken, to giue them contentment, in ſome good and indifferent manner, but that they be forced to ſeeke courſes for reliefe of themſelues by their Petitions and Complaints to his Maieſtie (whereabout I heare they are meditating) a worſe buſineſſe then that of Eaſt <hi>Indya</hi> will breake forth to trouble both States, and alien hearts from each other.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is nothing of more moment (in humane conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) for the advancement of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then the ſupportance, fauoure, and protection of potent Princes and States, who are or ought to be <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing Fathers</hi> and <hi>nurſeing Mothers</hi> to this end: ſoe there is nothing of more moment to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Kingdome of <hi>greate Brittanie</hi> and the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> to be ſuch (ſince the cheefe butthen and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this worke lies vpon their shoulders) then to vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te themſelues in perfect amitie togither. The enemye both to our Religion and State ſeemes to obſerue this better then our ſelues; ſince they haue vſed all endeau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to make breaches betwixt vs, and to keepe vs off from each other at an vnprofitable diſtance, where the force of our cold amitie could haue no powrefull effect to aſſiſt each other, or oppoſe them. They haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very farre to thir end, eſpecially vpon that part where they had leaſt hope, and where they imployde the leaſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17484:3"/>
force of their witt, I meane vpon the Netherlandish ſide where jelouſie (to ſee vs treate with the enemye) hath cauſed many people in the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> to behaue themſelues towards vs, as Coy Dames vſe to doe, who thinke to winne their louers to more longing, by rude tricks of vnkindenes.</p>
            <p>I intend not to repeate the particulars, leaſt I should be thought, rather to reuiue old quarrells by renueing there memorie, then to ſtop farther breaches by burying all fomer iniuries in obliuion. Yet I muſt ſay, that if they should thinke, wee put vp thoſe affronts offered to our Nation in Groenlant and the eaſt Indyes, eyther out of feare of their ſtrength, or our owne weakenes, they should iniurie vs no leſſe in the conceit, then they haue done in the act. Religion only hath bownd our hands, and wee are ſatisfied that the <hi>State</hi> doth diſclame it, and caſt it vpon priuate perſons; otherwiſe wee were as well able to ſcourge them, as to defend them from ſcourging. It were an ingratefull part in them, whilſt wee indanger our ſelues by houlding vp theire chinnes, to keepe them from ſincking, that they s'hould with their heeles kick vs vnder water. But becauſe wee beleeve and know, that theſe wronges proceede not from the State, but from ſuch perſons (for the moſt part on both ſides) as loue Mammon better then Chriſt, and count gaine the only godlyneſs, therefore wee are not apt to heare or beleeue all that is ſuggeſted, nor to ſee all that is true, but to hope and promiſe our ſelues better vſe for the future; ſince they knowe and muſt confeſs, that neyther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not the proudeſt or potenteſt Nation vpon earth, can vpon equall terms (without politick ſurpriſall) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues to beate vs and be our Maſters; nor dare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17484:3"/>
(without manifeſt advantage) prouoke vs to the triall.</p>
            <p>But ſince humor hath beene ſoe ſtird vpon both ſides, that Prudence and moderation hath had enough to doe to keepe vs from breaking out into blowes, it was a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke of wiſedome in their State to ſeeke to ſtop the gap, and a gratious worke of our prudent prince to giue them audience (notwithſtanding the contrarie noiſe which buz'd about his eares) and to renue that ancient league betwixt vs, which was like to breake into enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The foole hardy can charge hotly and ingage a State in warre, it muſt be the wiſe and aduiſed who only know how to make an honorable retreite. It is fit vpon both ſides, that now this league is renued, wee should be more carefull hereafter to preſerue it, then heeretofore wee haue beene. And to indeere the merrit of our State in this reſpect, it is fit to touch vpon ſome particulars whereby our Kindenes to them may be diſcerned, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to beget reciprocall kindenes in them toward vs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerue firſt wee were the parties wronged, and they the wrongers: yet they ſtood ſtifly out and ſought no reconcilement, till wee vnderhand, ſeeing their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, both inticed them to ſeeke, and aſſured them to finde what they ſought. Heerein, being their ſuperiors in force, wee shewed our ſelues not to be their inferiors in wiſedome, which the wiſeſt amongſt them will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, though the weake will not ſee it, but attri, bute all to our duty; as if they ouer-reached vs in wit, when it is only wee that ouer-reach them in Kindenes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve the motion of the whole body of the State in Parliament, the concurrance of <hi>Nobles, Clergie,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> in this caſe of theirs; their humble earneſt and vnanimous ſutite to his Majeſtie for this end, their ſpeedy

                  </gap>eing the tyme of the Treatyes for the Marriage with Spaine, and the reſtitution of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which in this Parliament haue beene cleerely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couverd and layed open vnto vs, and withalll, what hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aduice, with one conſent and voyce, wee haue giuen vnto your Maieſtie, to diſſolue thoſe Treatyes which your Maieſtie hath beene gratiouſly pleaſed, to our exceeding joy and comfort, fully to yeeld vnto, and accordingly haue made your publique declaration for the reall and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſſolution of them, by meanes where of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie may be happilie ingaged in a ſudden warre: wee in all humbleneſſe moſt ready and willing to giue vnto your Maieſtie, and the whole world, an ample, teſtimonie of our dutifull affectons, and ſincere intentions to aſſiſt yow therein, For the maintenance of that warre that may heere vpon enſue, and more particularly for the defence of this your <hi>Realme of England,</hi> the ſecureing of your <hi>Kingdome of Ireland,</hi> the aſſiſtance of your Neighbours, the <hi>States of the vnited Provinces,</hi> and other your Majeſties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17484:4"/>
friends and allies, And for the ſetting foorth of your <hi>Royal Nauie,</hi> wee haue reſolued to giue for the preſent the greateſt ayde which euer was granted in Parliament, to be leiued in ſo short-à tyme: And therefore wee doe humbly beſeech your Maieſtie, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus yow ſee in the body of our Lawe the State of the vnited Provinces is ſpecially nominated, and ranged in vnion with his Maieſties Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the gift limited for the defence eſpecially of thoſe three. Which, though ſelfconceited eyes ouerſee, yet is argues much reſpect and loue; neyther doe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they haue giuen or receiued the like acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before to or from any other State; nor can wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely finde in Hiſtorie the like interchange of loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt forteigne people, recorded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerue the moſt excellent <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes and extraordinarie diligence to accomplish this worke; I dare not ſay, whatſoeuer I thinke, that the whole frame was firſt of his compoſure, but I am ſure he was a principall Agent in the happy concluſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerue his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> how readely and gladly he gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when it cam to the vpshot: ſoe that he ſeemed to hold off before for politique reſpectes;</p>
            <p>Firſt, to beget a feeleing in our friends of their owne eſtate, who did not, in his Maieſties judgement, ſeeme ſenſible enough, for a long tyme, eyther of their owne danger, or of this his royall fauoure and benefite.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to make his owne ſubiectes the more eager and earneſt by the delay, and ſo giue them tyme to debate the buſineſſe, to vnderſtand the charitie and vtilitie of the worke, and to open their purſes the wider.</p>
            <p>Thirdly to ſecure the Enemye by this meanes, till all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17484:5"/>
were ready, that ſo wee might reflect vpon them, by a thinne and ſlight shadow the open and groſſe iniuryes they had done vs before, vnder the couerture of treatyes and truſt. Now for the better vnderſtanding of his Maieſties minde, in all pointes proportionable to this deſcription, I haue inſerted his <hi>privy Counſels letter</hi> to the <hi>Lords Lifetenants of Sheeres</hi> in England, for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtinge of the <hi>Earls and Commanders</hi> in rayſeing men within their ſeuerall Countyes, and that by his Majeſties ſpeciall direction, for the ayde of the <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFter our harty commendations to your good Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hippes, whereas the States Generall of the united Provinces haue by theyr Ambaſſadors humbly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited his Maieſtie as wel to renewe the anciant defenſiue league betweene his Kingdomes and their Provinces, as alſo to permit them for the better confirmation thereof, to rayſe ſome good number of voluntary ſouldiers within his Dominions, to be imployed in theyr ſervice in theſe hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous times, when the Emperour, and the Romish Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique league are preparing, and drawinge downe towards theyr Countreyes, divers great and threatniug Troopes to joyne with thoſe Armies, that allreadie lye vpon theyr frontiers, ready to take the firſt opportunitie of advantage againſt them. And that his Majestie in a conſtant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of the good amitie and correſpondentie with thoſe Provinces, hath treated, and concluded a league vvith theyr Ambaſſadors, and giuen way and permisſion for the rayſinge of ſix thouſand voluntary ſouldiers for theyr ſervice and asſiſtance, for theyr better ſtrength, and defence againſt thoſe forces of the Emperour, and Romishe Catholique

Many of theſe haue the wit and grace to come ouer well pronided, as their parents ſend them ont: others will not leaue England till their Mony be ſpent, their clothes worne out, and then ashamed, <hi>with the prodigall,</hi> to returne home for new ſupplyes, they come ouer into theſe parts ragged (as wee ſee) a shame to their <hi>parents</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi> Others leaue their trades, and runne from their Maſters; and this is the true canſe of theſe <hi>ragged</hi> and <hi>naked regiments,</hi> where you may ſee <hi>good bodyes of Men,</hi> very <hi>ill apparrelled.</hi> And by theſe ofſcoureings, men Geſs at the pouerty of our State, forgetting they come, <hi>though naked,</hi> from the <hi>land of Broad-cloth,</hi> and that this raggednes of theirs, in ſo rich a Countrie, is one euident note that they are <hi>made</hi> and <hi>marked out,</hi> for the warres.

            <p>And <hi>firſt for my owne Nation,</hi> I deſire they would not bee <hi>too iealous, captious,</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in takeing vnkindnes where none is offerd. Some perſons haue the trick to pinne their intereſts and particular ſpleenes vpon the publique ſleeue: and ſo what they haue felt or do feele in priuate, muſt needes bee a generall greeuance: but wee muſt be wiſe and wary, not to ſuffer quarrells which may fall betwixt particulars, to troble or diſturbe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall peace; whilſt wee ſee thoſe iniuryes are not backt by authoritie, and made vniverſall and nationall.</p>
            <p>And if wee muſt not ſuffer real actions to diſturbe our affections, much leſſe should wee permit wordes to do it, eſpecially euill words from ſuch perſons as haue not yet learned to ſpeake well.</p>
            <p>It is true that Ladyes and gentlewoemen paſſing the ſtreets iu ſtrange habits, do often penance amongſt the ruder ſort, (as appeared by that moſt vnciuill and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demeanoure vſed lately towards an English Lady in Amſterdam who deſired to ſee the Cittie, and ſuppoſed all gouvernements to be as ciuill as Londen) but we muſt conſider the ſame ſet of people would wonder aſmuch at a Parrat or Poppiniay. It is true alſo that men of all rankes meete often amongſt boyes words of reproch; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that wee cannot altogither cleere our owne in ſome rude places from that barbariſme, what should ſuch words of ſcorne ſpued from ſuch mouthes moue vs?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17484:10"/>
Since indeede it is our glory to be thoſe English Dogs, that haue holpen the Shepheards to chaſe from hence the Spanish Wolues, who elſe would haue worryed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe ſilly Lambes, but the harmeles and innocent Sheepe, their Fathers. Let not this ſtirre the courage of a Man to fury, but pitty and ſcorne; as Lyons vſe to walke with contempt amongſt barkeing whelpes, whoſe shrill notes are muſick, whilſt the Puppies bite not. Aſſuredly theſe boyes would, and doe too often, vſe their Parents thus; they know no better; they neuer learned a leſſon of obedience, much leſſe of gratefullnes, to honor thoſe in duty who defend them in loue, and often fauours them as the Pellicane doth her younge, whome in extremetie, she foſters and cherisheth with her owne blood.</p>
            <p>It wilbe imputed a folly to me to touch this, but I haue ſeene ſome touched with it. It often falls out that men who affect honor, as it is the ſouldiars ayme, are more offended with reproches and ſcornes then actual iniuryes. And if it were not ſo, theſe ſpirits would not ſell their flesh and blood ſo cheape, farre vnder the rate of beefe, or mutton, veale, or porke, nor would they indure heate and cold, and hunger and thirſt, when ſeruants (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueing more wages) will not, but that there is an ayer of praiſe and hope which they (Camelion like) feede vpon, and it kills their hearts to heare this blowne away by a ſtinkeing breath with diſgracefull language. It were eaſie for them by any honeſt trade or courſe of life to liue well in their owne Countryes, for meere neceſſitie doth not bring them ouer hither, as if wee wanted meate and drinke in England, France or Scotland, but eyther they are brought hither to be punished for their idlenes, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not at home doe a little eaſie worke for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17484:11"/>
great wages, are forced heere, as in a houſe of correction, to do great worke, yea the hardeſt of all (to ouercome manie wants, and difficulties, themſelues, and others) for little wages: Or elſe, being men made and marked out for the warres, they ſeeke and deſire this kinde of life, and would choſe it amongſt all others as the moſt honorable, though they had nothing for their laboure, but the oportunity and lawfull authority, to erchange knocks freely. For they deale for honor, as marchants for proffit; and they ſtampe in flesh and blood, as the other mint in gold and ſiluer. Now then the firſt ſort meeteing diſgracefull words meets but his deſert, it is part of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be reproched and reuiled: but this latter, who is only couetous of honor, takes it ill, to haue this counterfeit coine of diſgrace, put vpon him in ſtead of currant money. But I would not haue any of theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort looke ſo lowe to ſtoope to ſuch pettie praiſe, nor contrarilie once caſt their eye aſide to theſe ſonnes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, children of Bethell, who would mock Elizeus if he came amonge them with a bald head or a ſtrange habit, Nay rather I would haue them doe all good they can for the generall State of theſe Countries, with reſpect of thoſe good people who are mixed amonge the wicked, and mourne for the abhominations which are done in the Land. Deare Countrimen, you that be at home in peace, pay your monyes freely for the ſupportance and defence of theſe, pray for them with vnfained faith; and you, worthyes, that are heere, fight for them with vndaunted reſolution, and, if neede bee, dye for them with comfort and cheerefulnes euen as for your owne Countrye; ſince, as I haue manifeſted, the warre is the ſame though a little farther remoued, and beſides that it is alſo a religious

            <p>Againe I am to exhort my Countrimen, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder the name of greate Brittaines, to shew themſelues as ſtrong being now vnited, as they haue shewne the mſelues heeretofore being diuided.

            <p>Laſtly I deſire &amp; exhort with all earneſtnes that they would be carefull to ſerue the vnited Provinces faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not to deceaue them in the leaſt reſpect: whilſt therein they <hi>ſerue</hi> or <hi>deceiue</hi> their owne <hi>Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> with whoſe monyes they are payde, and shall reape <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>honor</hi> or <hi>shame and obloqui</hi> of their friends at their returne home according as they behaue themſelues in theſe imployments abroade.</p>
            <p>And now haueing done with our owne, I am in moſt humble manner, to preſent theſe petitions follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing which I haue learned from the obſeruation of my Countrimen to the conſiderations of my ſuperiors in theſe parts, in whoſe power it is to redreſſe the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities thereby to declare, that they prize vs, as wee doe them.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17484:12"/>
               <hi>Sollicitours,</hi> who eate them vp by lewish vſurie in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable manner, Soe as I haue heard diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable Commanders ſay, it is almoſt impoſſible for an Officer to liue (though neuer ſo meanely and modeſtly) vpon his meanes, except he deceiued the State or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diar; Since moſt of his owne meanes is ſwallowed vp by the ſollicitor. O that it would enter into the heart of thoſe prudent Lordes, to take a courſe for better payment, that the Captaines might not haue iuſt occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, nor Coloure to ſeeke shifts by curſed <hi>atteſtations,</hi> there by to deceaue the <hi>Country of bodyes,</hi> and themſelues <hi>of ſoules.</hi> Then your Companyes would be fuller, and the officer would ſerue with better <hi>courage,</hi> becauſe <hi>with better conſcience.</hi> Yea then, if <hi>deceite should be vſed or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,</hi> none would pitty the guilty delinquent, though he were made an publique example and ſpectacle of <hi>fraude,</hi> vnworthy his profeſſion. I ſay <hi>vnworthie his profesſion,</hi> for I know, whatſoeuer othermen vainely thinke, that a <hi>reall lye</hi> is more dishonorable (though cuſtome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie cloudes it) then a <hi>verball,</hi> which is ſo haynous to the eare and reputation of a ſouldier.</p>
            <p>But I heare an obiection againſt this ſuite, which I dare not mention without craueing pardon aforehand, and this it is, as they ſay, God knowes the truth of it; <hi>That if Sollicitors were diſcharged and better payment made, then diuers of the Natiues should looſe excellent offices, the Generall State let goe a faire improuement, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe great perſons could not put their monyes out to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie vpon ſuch vnreaſonable conditious.</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this profitable ſinne, can barre the doore againſt iuſt reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though the inſolencie of the Solicitors would perſwade me to beleeue it; who preſumeing, as it ſeemes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17484:12"/>
and as the ſucceſſe shewes, vpon ſupportance, dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the greateſt Commanders and vſe them as ſeruants not like Maſters by whome they liue. Sometyme Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors haue beene put vpon Captaynes by force, and they authorized to take from the Captaynes ordinance the beſt part of his meanes though the ſolicitor neuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him a penie of mony aforehand, but becauſe he contracted with his Predeceſſor; Soe that if a cunning Companion who hath a little ſpare monie can inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelfe into the boſome of a needy or negligent Commander, and ſupplyeing his preſeut wants, faſten a peece of mony vpon him, and procure from him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate contract, for his life only, let it be neuer ſo vnreaſonable, yet his ſucceſſor muſt continue it, and make it good, nay, perhaps increaſe it out of his meanes; and ſo ſucceſſiiuely from generation to generation, if the wars should continue it would continue like a rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vpon the Captaine or campanie; whereby it cometh to paſſe, that though a Captayne, who venters life and all for the State, hath but a terme of life in his Captaineship; Yet the ſollicitor, for layeing out a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two hundred pownd, hath halfe the Captaynes meanes, and a perpetuitie in that halfe, though he doe nothing for the State but helpe to vndoe it. Beſides though theſe perſons be taken on, that the ſouldiar may haue ſound pay, for which the Captayne payes ſoundly, as I haue partly shewed, yet their payment is ſoe bad, that there are few Captaynes (I might ſay ſafely, none) put haue iuſt cauſe to complaine, if their iuſt complaints might be heard and redreſſed.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the vnequall condition of the perſons and the odd and diſreſpectiue carriage of the tyme towards them, that the Captaine contracting with the ſolicitor,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17484:13"/>
is bownd for his part, and the ſolicitor is his owne iudge, and carues himſelfe what amendes he liſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth out of the Captaynes meanes: but the ſolicitor, contracting with the Captaine, is notwithſtanding looſe for his part, or as good as looſe, ſince he cares notfor keepeing his day, but often puts the Captaine to borrow, and pawne his credit and clothes vpon intereſt for payment of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, when notwithſtanding he payes vſe to the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for aduanceing it aforehand; Nay ſay the Captaine forbeares it a moneth or two (as ſometyme it falls out) yet he payes vſe for it, and the ſollicitor will not abate a ſtiuer, though the one looſeth and the other gaines by this meanes, a dooble vſe.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a gaines made to the ſolicitor by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of light money, which he knowes the Captayne muſt be forced to put away, cannot keepe to change; with many other groſſe and intollerable abuſes of which I haue heard Captaynes complaine, and which crye out (for the with-houlding of the labourors due is a cryeing <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 4.</note>ſinne) eyther to the State for redreſſe or to God for jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. I ſee what account David made of his worthies and ſouldiars, and how pretious their blood was in his fight, when refuſeing to drinke of the water they fetched for him with perill of their lines, Hee powred it out to the Lord and ſayde <hi>My God forbid it me that I ſhonld doe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Chro.</note>
               <hi>this thing; Shall I drinke the blood of theſe men that haue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">11. 18.</note>
               <hi>put their liues in ieopardie? for with the ieopardie of their liues they brought it, therefore he would not drinke.</hi> I wish that all ſolicitors and vſurers would conſider this ſtorie well, and then they wonld not (except they were right Nabals) make it their dayly trade to drinke vp, nay to be drunke with the blood of ſuch men, and that whilſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17484:13"/>
they are watching that theſe may drinke the ſafer, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ſafeguard of that mony, whoſe vſe eates them vp to the bare bones. But if theſe lewes and bloodſuckers will not conſider it, yet it concernes Dauid and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of this State to looke to it better, and to their care and conſcience I commend it. For if this be not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as it shewes inward corruption and putrifaction, ripe for diſſolution, ſo it may, at one tyme or other, by one meanes or other, put the State to ſtraights and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, did not the auxiliarie Bandes take care for it, to defend it, and reſpect it, as their owne Countrie. Which care of theirs appeared the laſt yeere, at the comming out of that Placat, which gaue them, generally ſo much diſcontent, and that in the inſtant when they expected the Enemy. Which had beene a fit tyme and occaſion to tempt them to mutinee, but that faith, h onor, and religion reſtrayned them; yea ſuch a tyme; as would haue occaſioned ſome Nations then to crye for gelt and reformation, or alſo to lay downe their armes. Whereas then, all theſe troopes, both British, and French, did nobly and loyally reſolue, not to diſpute the point before the fight, but firſt to fight, and ſo to diſpute the point againſt the Enemye with the edge of their anger and points of their ſwords, that they might by their deſerts moue the States to repeale their act, and to shew they meritted augmentation by way of largeſſe, rather then abatement or abridgement, by way of defalcation; which they would intimate by humble petition, without diſputation, after the ſeruice was done and the Enemye gone off, and not before. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution they generally followed, whereby they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued dne conſideration, and I doubt not in tyme but they shall finde it. They are Tyrants and not Fathers of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17484:14"/>
Commonwealth, who take occaſion to be euill, from the goodnes of their people; ſo that the better the ſubiect or inferior is, the worſe the ſuperior shews himſelfe to bee; and the more he is content for peace, and quiet, and conſcience, to ſuffer, the more the other puts vpon him and forceth him beyond his ſtrength to beare and ſuffer. <hi>It shall not be ſoe amongſt you,</hi> (ſaith our ſauiour to his Diſciples) I hope the illuſtrious Lords are our ſauiours Diſciples alſo, and I am ſure then, <hi>It shall not be ſoe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly I beſeech the State to conſider whether or no it be fit to vindicate the honor of our king, State and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the King and Queene of Bohemia, from the baſe aſperſions caſt vpon them, by rumor and lyeing multitude, in the point of their preſent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For I know the Common people beleeue, and giue it out, for a manifeſt truth, as men that will beleeue no better, how that royall Payer with their Princely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, lye heere at the charge of this State, and that exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are layde vpon the people to mainetayne them in that humble condition wherein they liue, which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be farre too meane for the dignitie of ſuch perſons,) yet in the vulgar eye it ſeemes therefore to be to haughtie, becauſe they think it comes out of their purſe, and to proceed from their beggarly beneuolence.</p>
            <p>This falſehood is bred and nourished by the Spanish faction, who would do worſe then ſlander them if they could, and doe this to make the Countrie hate them, and thereby to prouoke the people for their ſake, to mutinee and riſe againſt the preſent gouernement of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lords, as if they were the occaſion of this cauſeles and needles cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge, by harboring theſe diſtreſſed Princes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17484:14"/>
in their Dominions.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of this was one of the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues which cauſed me firſt to put penn to paper in this ſubiect; becauſe I ſaw the honor of my King, Countrie, and of theſe Princes traduced and toſt vp and downe by lewde lyeing, and ignorant tongues. For, in ſtead of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this State with their aboade heere (as theſe fellowes faine and giue out) they are euery way helpefull to it, ſpending therein many thowſand pownds ſtarling by the yeere, and cauſeing much to be ſpent, all which comes out of England into theſe parts. And I preſent it to the conſideration of my ſuperiors, whether it were fit, for all their honors, and ſafetyes, to crye this off, or to make the truth of it ſome way publiquely knowne, that the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mouthes of men may in this reſpect be cloſed, and that the people may know they beare no burthen but their owne, yea that wee alſo doe helpe them, out of loue, to carry part of that, which belongs to them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beare, out of duty to God and their Country.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I humbly preſent this motion to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my ſuperiors, whether they thinke it fit or no, for the conſolidation of this league, and for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perpetual amitie betwixt both Nations, to equall vs, if not with their owne, at leaſt with the cheefe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, who ſerue them as wee doe; ſince wee haue beene, are, and are like to bee, as good ſtudds and props to this State, as they or any of them haue beene, are, or can bee. Let not the aduantage of language make a ſtricter band, then that of hearts and hands. If their tongues goe before ours, our hearts and hands goe in front with them, and haue euer done ſo, to do this State ſeruice. Neither ſpeake I this to diſparage them or any of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17484:15"/>
them; It is no diſparagement for the beſt of them, to march with vs; Neither ſpeake I this to detract from their deſeruings, but by compariſon of theirs to ſet off our owne (which hath beene nothing inferior to theirs) and ſo to beget equall reſpect for equall merrit in all ranckes and degrees.</p>
            <p>Fourthly I preſent to the wiſe conſideration of my ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, whether they thinke it fit or no, that in both the Indyes and all other places of trade or fishing, their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſtraightly commanded carefully to mainetaine pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; that they ſell not our loue for a little lucre, nor inuade our ſimple truſt and innocent ſecuritie, with fraude or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, vpon baſe aduantages of tyme, and odds of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or the like circumſtances of trecherie and iniurie; which, as they may be shadowed with the cloake of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo they may ſerue our Enemyes, (who ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide vs,) as shaddowes to accuſe the vnited Provinces of iniuſtice, and thereby to incenſe our State to ſodaine rage and sharpe reuenge againſt them as againſt perfidious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And I could therefore wish that if any should dare to diſobay the Edicts of the State published for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, they may be perſued as publique Enemyes, who by their practiſe teſtifie the treaſon of their hearts, whilſt they endeauoure to giue diſtaſte to our State, thereby to breake the loue and league betwixt Great Brittanie and the vnited Provinces, that ſo their Troian Horſe or Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Iennet may come in at the breach.</p>
            <p>Fiftly I would heere ſpeake of honors and rewards to be propounded for the ſouldiar of all ſorts and degrees, but that I am afraide to be laught at for my labor, or if not ſo, yet to be anſwered with that Common Error which goes currant for an axiome of State, <hi>That Commonweales</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17484:15"/>
               <hi>are incapable of this power to conferre honors.</hi> I ſee amongſt the Romans, ſeuerall rewards and honors of all ſorts, diſtributed freely and conſtantly to the beſt deſeruers. Thereby to incourage all of euery ranck, high and low, the witty and valiant, in their ſeuerall kindes, to do their beſt, and to aduenture for the publique good. Titles, honors, lands, immunities, wreathes, chaines, ornaments, places in the theater, with diuers other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and laſtly ſtatues and triumphes were appointed for the well deſeruing ſouldiar. And it is to be obſerued, that whereas the Legionarie bands (which were natiues) had ſiluer chaines, the Auxiliarie (which were ſtrangers) had gould chaines to encourage them, and to binde them to the State by benefits, as the others were bownd by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall loue and duty. But it may be obiected that theſe honors conferd by the Romane Commonwealth were acknowledged by reaſon of the Monarchie, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as vniuerſally, as the Romane command and power it ſelfe, which tutched almoſt the worlds circumference: but it is not ſo with petty Commonweales, whoſe acts ſeeme therefore to be priuate, and to be contained in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row liſtes. And this is true, nor would I therefore deſire for the wel deſerueing ſouldiar any honor or preuiledge but a publique acknowledgment and reſpect within the Vnited Prouinces or whereſoeuer they haue power or command: this they haue power to confer, as wee ſee the State of Ireland gaue the title of King to H. 8. by act of parliament, who before was written Lord of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land only; and what the States could giue would ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently content the ſouldiar, deſirons of honor, and binde them the rather to the place and ſeruice, whilſt they should there haue that due reuerence and acknowledgement,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17484:16"/>
which in other places they should not finde but vpon remouall looſe. And for ought I ſee the Honors conferd by abſolute Princes, are of force no farther then their owne forces carry them and giue them life and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as wee ſee in the Emperiall Courts, who will not be acknowledged for ſuch in greate Brittaine, and ſurely Sir Robert Dudly, what State or ſtile ſo euer he walkes vnder in Florence, muſt in England, if euer he returne, vaile bonnet, and teturne to his English titles.</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore, had a worthy Commander, after long and good ſeruice, ſome publique acknowledgement of his merrit; ſome title, or note of honor, ſome preuiledge or extraordinarye reſpect and allowance (thought it went no farther then within the limits and command of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prouinces) yet it would animate and ſtirre vp noble ſpirits to excellent actions and entreprizes through emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And had a priuate ſouldiar, after long and good ſeruice, the leaſt acknowledgement of his worth, were it but immunitie from the exciſe, increaſe of meanes, or any other preuiledge it would incourage a poore man to ſerue brauely. But to ſell his <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> for <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>cheeſe,</hi> to ſpend his <hi>luſtie youth</hi> euen till he ariue at a maymed and ſickly old age, for ſo much meanes as will only keepe ſoule and body togither; in a miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and (which is worſt of all) if he liues in the wars 20 or 30 yeeres, neuer to haue hope of due and orderly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, but to ſee euery youth daunce frog-leape ouer his back, this is that which quencheth the courage of all honorable vndertakeing, and is the only cauſe ſoe little is performed vpon the politique and powerfull Enemy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly I humbly deſire all Readers <hi>of both nations high and Low,</hi> to pardon me and to accept of my good will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17484:16"/>
which aymed heerein to do good. Eſpecially I ſeeke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the illuſtrious Lords and Gouernors of this State who may thinke me too peremptorie, plaine, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, in ſome paſages of diſcourſe, and in the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I haue made. But when they shall vnderſtand I haue ſuffered for their ſake from mine owne Nation, and haue beene taken and chalenged as a Man too much their owne and partiall vpon their ſide for what I haue done, ſpoken, and written; they will, perhaps the ſooner inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my excuſe, and the better beare my plainenes and bouldnes. And for thoſe of myne owne Nation who haue thought me to vilifie our owne and to honor this people too much, I let them know that I haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what the truth and the neceſſitie of the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. For when I meete a diſcontented Countriman of mine owne, who ſeekes to eaſe his priuare ſpleene, and to reuenge his particular quarrell, by inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the publique State of theſe Prouinces, then as one that vnderſtands how much it concernes all our welfares (eſpecially for point of Religion) to be well conceited of each other, and to ſtand togither in firme friendship, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that many fractures should make the ioynt vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidable, and not knowing with what heart and intent thoſe obiections are made, nor how powerfully that ſcattered breath may worke, (whilſt I ſee thin vapors, gathering and vniteing by degrees, breake out at laſt into boiſterous ſtormes and bluſtering windes) I doe what I can to oppoſe theſe in the beginning, and that perhaps with a little too much violence, contending for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of theſe parts.</p>
            <p>But againe when I meete with an obſtinate and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent ſpirit of theſe Conntryes, arrogateing all to their
<pb facs="tcp:17484:17"/>
owne worth, ſlighting our King and Kingdome, and ſeemeing to rely vpon other Princes in their opinion more potent: then indignation lets looſe the reynes of my affection, and reaſon accompaines and ſeconds them as farre as she is able, to let ſuch blind Braggadochies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne what they are able to doe for themſelues, what wee haue done for them, and how (whatſoeuer they ſay and would faine make men bleleeue) they cannot rely with that aſſurance vpon any popish Nation, as they may v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, for all our ſeemeing ouerſenes; Nay that there is no Nation vnder the ſunne that can be ſo profitable and helpefull to them as that of greate Brittanie. Which they may eaſely ſee who obſerue the ſituation and ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of both, and conſider that all France, though farre more potent at Land, could not haue afforded vs equall aſſiſtance to that which theſe Countries, (then weake in compariſon of what they are) brought vs in 88 by Sea. Nor can all France (though they were our ſuperiors in ſtrength, as yet no triall by battell hath giuen them the aſſurance) ſo ſupply their wants and ſecond their warres offenſiue and defenſiue by Land and Sea as wee can doe. Thus incountring with English aduerſaries, I shew my ſelfe a plaine dealeing Dutchman; and incountring the Dutch, I shew my ſelfe what I am, a true hearted English man; But heere where I ſpeake freely I declare impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I haue knowne, or heard vpon both parts; what greeuances ought to be remoued, what cautions ought to be obſerued, what diligence ought to be vſed on both ſides, to ſettle and make ſtrong this old league renued, in conſeruation whereof the liberty of both States, yea of all Chriſtendome, yea of Chriſtianity it ſelfe in ſome ſort, conſiſteth. The wrack of Religion is that which is aymed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17484:17"/>
at, is that which I feare; and were it not for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I would ſtudy, and should ſoone finde the way, to be a polititian alſo. Now I haue ſayd nothing with a purpoſe to ouervalue out preſent ayde (I haue ſpoken aſmuch of theirs) or to vpbraide this State with ingratitude, or as a man that grutched at what wee giue and thought it too much (I wish it much more) or as one that imagined the wiſemen of theſe Lands did not ſee all this, and more too, without my light; farre be this folly from me: Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my intention is to let the common man ſee this, who will not vnderſtand it, or at leaſt acknowledge it; That when he ſees the truth, he may make better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of vsthen he vſeth to doe. For I muſt tell them for concluſion, that our Commons &amp; the State generally, for religions ſake principally, is ready to drop their money and their blood freely for this Nation: only the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our State holds vs back becauſe they ſee vs too forward, and know well, that what is proffered is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and what is too common, cloyes. Soe all the Remoraes and rubs theſe men finde in their affaires with vs is from this ground. Whereas on the contrary they are the Commons of the vnited Provinces who ſlight our people, doe vs all the wronge at home and abroade, where they can take any aduantage againſt vs, and giue vs and our State all the diſguſts they receiue. This I beleeue proceedes principally from that irreligious or ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture, which is amongſt them, who eyther cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the reſt that are truly religious and true patriots, or at leaſt, by their multitudes, ſo ouerſway the good, that they cannot doe, for vs and themſelues, as they would. And for this cauſe. Their State and Stateſmen yea the illuſtrious Lordes themſelues are forced by authoritie and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17484:18"/>
power to reſtraine them from euill, and on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfes, to doe vs all the good they can. Soe you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that with vs the generall currant runns ſtrongly in fauour of theſe Prouinces, particulars only oppoſe it for polecie or perhaps ſome for poperie; but in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prouinces the generall currant runs ſtrongly againſt vs, and therefore their State or ſome particular perſons of it, ashamed of the common folly, indeauor to mend it. I make a queſtion if this people were in peace as we are, and wee in warre as they are, whether or no their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people would as willingly and readely offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their monyes for vs, and preſſe the States for permiſſion, as wee offer our ſelues and our monyes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them, and preſſe our ſuperiors by ſuites, intreaties, and humble petitions, to giue vs leaue to aſſiſt them. I am perſwaded, thoſe that grutch and repine, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe which is raiſed for their owne inſtant and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie defenſe, would grutch farre more to doe it for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But it hath not beene long ſo, their forefathers who with their blood bought their preſent libettie, were of an other minde. And thoſe Popelings, Libertines, and Sectaries amongſt them who are now all ſick for change, would, if the Lord should ſo plague them as to giue them their heartes deſire (which I conſtantly hope, and heartely pray for the ſake of the faithfull which are amongſt them, that he will not) ſoone finde the difference of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when in ſtead of Fathers, and Brethren, and Sonnes, and Kinsfolke, and a Prince of their owne election, yea ſuch a Prince, ſuch a Generall, as neuer Nation met with a more moderate, affable, prudent, diligent, watchfull, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, prouident, and in all reſpects one more fit for them: in ſteade of ſuch, I ſay, they should haue Strangers,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17484:18"/>
and Tyrants ſet ouer them, who haue shown heretofore, and would shew againe, if they had meanes, that (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we foolishly perſwade our ſelues to the contrarie) they neither reſpect Law, nor Promiſe, nor Oath; nor make difference of Religion, or Sexe, or Perſon; but ſeeke onely ſatisfaction of their Libidinous, Ambitious, Cruell, and Couetous deſires.</p>
            <p>This I thought good briefly to intimate, that, if it be poſſible, we may receiue reciprocall kindneſſe from this Nation generally; and then they need not doubt no more then we our ſelues doe, but that, where his Maieſtie ſends this yeere ſixe thouſand Foot for their ayd, the next yeere (if they should need, as I hope they shall not, pray they may not) a Royall Armie will, in the name of God and our King, command the inſulting and incroching Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to ſtand backe, and giue vp, what he hath vniuſtly ſwallowed, and what he shall neuer digeſt to doe him good, but which may proue as fatall to his entended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as that Flesh was to the Eagle, which she ſnatched from the Altar, to the firing of her owne neaſt.</p>
            <p>And this out of queſtion we with them should effect, without reliance vpon other vncertaine Leagues, if we would ſeriouſly vnite our Forces by Land and by Sea, and follow that footing which God hath lately giuen this Nation in the Weſt <hi>Indyes.</hi> But of this there is little hope whilſt thoſe fatall quarrells in the Eaſt <hi>Indyes</hi> lye feſtering betwixt vs in blood vnappeaſed, and no ſuch reall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is giuen, as may witneſſe the impartiall Iuſtice and neceſſitie of the cauſe if true (which with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giues great occaſion of ſuſpition) or teſtifie by execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the delinquents (if they be found to couer treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and murther vnder the apparance of Iuſtice) that they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17484:19"/>
will not hazard the loſle of his Maieſties protection, and our loues, for the liues of a few Libertines; becauſe they loue vs for ſome thing elſe beſides their owne profit, and will shew the world it is not true which their Enemies ſlanderouſly giue out, <hi>That they know no God but Gaine, no Religion but Reaſon of State, no Heauen but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, and no Friend but themſelues.</hi> For our parts we shew our ſelues to be Subiects of ſuch a Soueraigne, as loues no mans perſon ſo well to make vs loue or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his ſinne. If they haue dealt treacherouſly, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them for our Countreymen, and can be as well content to ſee them ſuffer worthely, as Pyrates and other offendors who are put to death as publique Enemies to all Nations. But if ours be Innocent, and this cryme be rayſed by policie to ſupplant them from thoſe parts as is ſuggeſted, then we hope and expect a ſeuere example shal be made vpon thoſe Diuels, who to the end they may do euill, and ſatisfie their cruelties (which they exerciſe euer where they are Maſters) doe not forbeare euen to accuſe the Innocent, as Satan did Iuſt <hi>Iob.</hi> But ſparing to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this on either ſide, till we ſee the cauſe cleared by ſeuere, ſtrickt, and impartiall examination, which we hope for and expect, we pray God to bleſſe and proſper this League of Loue begun, and to conuert or confound all that wish the contrarie.</p>
