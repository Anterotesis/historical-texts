            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached at S. Laurence-Jewry, <hi>APRIL</hi> the 7th. 1691.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>1 TIM. I. 15.</bibl>
                  <p>This is a faithfull saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF these Words were to be understood without any Restriction or Limitation <hi>that Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners,</hi> they would overthrow the great Design of the Gospel, and make its Excellent Precepts Useless and Ineffectual. For, to what purpose should men be put upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Practise of Repentance, Mortification and a continued Course of a Holy Life, if the meer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sinners</hi> did sufficiently qualifie them for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This indeed would be thought a Doctrine <hi>worthy of all Acceptation</hi> by the <hi>greatest Sinners</hi>; but


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62248:3"/>
it could not be <hi>a faithfull saying,</hi> being not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able either to the Nature of God, or Revelation of his Will by <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such <hi>Sinners</hi> as himself had been; <hi>i. e.</hi> such as had been great Sinners, but had truely and sincerely repented. <hi>Of whom I am chief.</hi> What then? Must we look on him as the Standard and Measure of such <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> whom <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> came to save? What will then become of all those who have been Sinners of a higher Rank than ever he was? It's true in the Verses before the Text, he sets out his Sins, as a humble Penitent is wont to do, with the worst Colours and deepest Aggravations,<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor, and injurious</hi>; but yet he adds, <hi>that he obtained Mercy because he did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, in unbelief.</hi> How then is S. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Chief of Sinners?</hi> Are Sins of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Mistake</hi> the greatest of Sins, for which Christ died? Is there no <hi>Expiation</hi> for any other by <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> What will become then of all such who sin against Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conscience, and not <hi>in Ignorance and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief?</hi> Can none of these hope for Mercy by <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> although they do truely Repent? But <hi>the Blood of Christ</hi> is said elsewhere <hi>to cleanse us from all Sin</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> not, while we continue in them, but if we repent and forsake them.<note place="margin">Ch. 2. v. 2.</note> And <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is said <hi>to be a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62248:3"/>
this Expression of S. <hi>Paul</hi> notes his great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and deep Sense of his own Sins; but doth not exclude others from the hopes of Pardon whose Sins have other Aggravations than his had. For, if we leave out the last words as peculiar to his Case, yet the other contain in them a true Proposition and of the greatest Importance to Mankind; <hi>This is a faithfull saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, you may say, is a matter out of all doubt among all such who hope for Salvation by <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>; for all are agreed, that one way or other we are to be <hi>saved by him.</hi> But there is great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty as to the Way of <hi>saving sinners</hi> by <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>; whether by <hi>the Doctrine and Example of the Man Christ Jesus, by the Power he attained through his Sufferings</hi>; Or, <hi>by the Eternal Son of God's assuming our Nature, and suffering in our stead in order to the Reconciling God to us and making a Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> These are two very different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> or Notions of <hi>Christ's coming to save Sinners</hi>; and the former seems more Easie to be understood and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and the other seems to have Insuperable Difficulties in point of Reason; and to run our Religion into <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which expose our Faith and make Christianity appear Contemptible to Men of Sense and Understanding. Is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much better to embrace such a Scheme of it,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62248:4"/>
as will have the least Objection against it, that so Men of Reason may not be tempted to Infidelity, and Men of Superstition may not under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Mysteries</hi> bring in the most Absurd and Unreasonable Doctrines?</p>
            <p>These are plausible Insinuations, and would be apt to prevail on considering Mens minds, if they were to form and make a Religion that might be most accommodated to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> of the Age they live in. And truely no Men (by their own Authority) can pretend to a Right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose on others any <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> or any such things which are above their Capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. But that is not our Case; for we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to believe and receive <hi>Christianity</hi> as a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>; and God (we say) may require from us the belief of what we may not be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, especially if it relates to Himself, or such things which are Consequent upon the Union of the Divine and Human Nature. Therefore our business is to consider, whether any such things be contained in that <hi>Revelation</hi> which we all own; and if they be, we are bound to believe them, although we are not able to comprehend them.</p>
            <p>Now here are two Remarkable <hi>Characters</hi> in these Words, by which we may examin these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Hypotheses</hi> concerning the way of <hi>Salvation by Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62248:4"/>I. <hi>It is a faithfull saying,</hi> and therefore must be contained in that Revelation which God hath made concerning our Salvation by Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>It is worthy of all Acceptation; i. e.</hi> most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and beneficial to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Now by these two I shall proceed in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them.
<list>
                  <item>I. Which is most agreeable to the Revealed Will of God.</item>
                  <item>II. Which doth offer fairest for the Benefit and Advantage of Mankind.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Which is most, agreeable to the Revealed Will of God. For that we are sure is the most <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full saying</hi>; since Men of Wit and Reason may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, but God cannot. When the Apostles first preached this Doctrine to the World, they were not bound to believe what they affirmed to be <hi>a faithfull saying</hi> till they gave sufficient Evidence of their Authority from God, by the wonderfull Assistance of the Holy Ghost. But now this <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full saying</hi> is contained in the Books of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> by which we are to judge of the Truth of all <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrines. And when two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Senses of Places of Scripture are offer'd, we are to consider, which is most Reasonable to be preferr'd. And herein we are allow'd to Exercise


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62248:5"/>
our Reason as much as we please; and the more we do so, the sooner we shall come to Satisfaction in this matter.</p>
            <p>Now according to Reason we may judge that Sense to be preferr'd,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Which is most plain and easie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the most received Sense of Words; not that which is forced and intricate, or which puts improper and <hi>metaphorical</hi> Senses upon Words which are commonly taken in other Senses; especially when it is no Sacramental thing, which in its own Nature is Figurative.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That which suits most with the Scope and Design not only of the particular Places, but of the whole <hi>New Testament</hi>; which is, to magnifie God and to depress Man; to set forth, the Infinite Love and Condescension of God <hi>in giving his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins</hi>; to set up the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of one <hi>true God</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Creatures</hi>; to Represent and Declare the mighty Advantages Mankind receive by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That which hath been generally received in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> to be the Sense of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For, we are certain, this was always look'd on as a matter of great Concernment to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and they had as great Capacity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Sense of the Apostles; and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church had greater Helps for knowing it


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62248:5"/>
than others at so much greater Distance. And therefore the Sense is not to be taken from modern <hi>Inventions,</hi> or <hi>Criticisms,</hi> or pretences to <hi>Revelation</hi>; but that which was at first deliver'd to the <hi>Christian Church</hi> and hath been since received and embraced by it in the several Ages; and hath been most strenuously asserted, when it hath met with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as founded on <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That which best agrees with the <hi>Characters</hi> of those Persons from whom we receive the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith; and those are <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> and his <hi>holy Apostles.</hi> For, if their <hi>Authority</hi> be lost, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is gone; and their Authority depends upon their <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and Care to inform the World aright in matters of so great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) I begin with the Character which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles give of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> himself; which is, that he was a Person of the greatest Humility and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, that he did not assume to himself that which he might justly have done. For let the Words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be understood either as to the <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Dignity</hi> of Christ, it is certain that they must imply thus much, that when <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was here on Earth, he was not of a vain assuming hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that he did not boast of himself, nor mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his own Greatness, but was contented to be


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62248:6"/>
look'd on as other Men; although he had at that time far greater and Diviner Excellency in him than the World would believe. Less than this, cannot be made of those Words of the Apostle, <hi>Who being in the form of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>he thought it not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, but made himself of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and took upon him the form of a Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being the <hi>Character</hi> given of him let us consider what he doth affirm concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For although he was far from drawing the People after him, by setting forth his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet upon just Occasions, when the <hi>Jews</hi> contested with him, he did Assert such things, which must favour of Vanity and Ostentation, or else must imply that he was the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For, all Mankind are agreed that the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Ambition lies in Affecting Divine Honour, or for a meer Man to be thought a <hi>God.</hi> How severely did God punish <hi>Herod</hi> for being pleased with the Peoples folly in crying out, <hi>the Voice of God and not of Man?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 12.22.</note> And therefore he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have born with such positive Assertions and such repeated Defences of his being <hi>the Son of God</hi> in such a manner as implied his being so from Eternity. This in his Disputes with the <hi>Jews</hi> he Affirms several times,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>that he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> not in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> but in a proper Sense, as appears by those words,<note place="margin">38.50.58.62.</note> 
               <hi>What and if ye shall see

            </p>
            <p>But here arises a Difficulty, which deserves to be consider'd; <hi>i. e.</hi> 
               <q>If there were nothing in the Christian Doctrine, but the Way of <hi>Saving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> by the Doctrine and Example of Christ, there would be little Objection to be made to it; since the obtaining Eternal Life is certainly the best thing can be proposed to Mankind, and the Precepts of Christ are Divine and Spiritual, Plain and Easie to be Understood, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Reason of Mankind; but many other things are imposed on Men as necessary to be believed concerning <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> as to his <hi>Divinity, Incarnation,</hi> and the <hi>Hypostatical Union</hi> of both Natures, which perplex and confound our Understandings; and yet these things are not only deliver'd as <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>the Christian Faith</hi>; but the Belief of them is required as necessary to the Salvation of Sinners; whereas, if they are Revealed they are no longer <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and if they are not Revealed, how come they to be made Articles of Faith? The Scripture knows of no


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62248:8"/>
other <hi>Mysteries of Faith</hi> but such as were hidden before the Revelation of them, but since they are Revealed they are plain and open to all mens Capacities; and therefore it is a great Injury to the Plainness and Simplicity of the Gospel to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such incomprehensible Mysteries, as Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Articles of Faith; and it is Abusing the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Mankind, to make such things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believed, which are impossible to be understood. But those who have ever loved to Deceive and Abuse the rest of the World, have been always fond of the Name of <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and therefore all such things are to be suspected, which come under that Name. For, all such Points which will not bear Examination, must be wrapt up and Reverenced under the Name of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> that is, of things to be swallow'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being understood. <hi>But the Scripture never calls that a Mystery which is Incomprehensible in it self,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the main force of the Objection, which I shall endeavour to remove by shewing,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That God may justly require from us in general, the Belief of what we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That which way soever the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Christ</hi> be explained, there will be something of that Nature found in it;


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62248:9"/>
and that those who reject the Mysteries of Faith run into greater Difficulties than those who assert them.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That no more is required as a Necessary Article of Faith than what is plainly and clearly Revealed.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That God may justly require from us in general, the Belief of what we cannot comprehend. It is to very little purpose to enquire whether the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> be applied to such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctrines, whose Substance is Revealed, but the manner of them is incomprehensible by us; for why may not we make use of such a Word whereby to express things truely revealed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Comprehension? We are certain the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> is used for things far less difficult and abstruse; and why may it not then be fitly applied to such matters, which are founded on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, but yet are too deep for us to go to the bottom of them? Are there not <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Arts, <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Nature, <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Providence? And what Absurdity is there to call those <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which in some Measure are known, but in much greater unknown to us? Although therefore in the Language of Scripture it be granted, that the word <hi>Mystery</hi> is most frequently applied, <hi>to things before hidden, but now revealed,</hi> yet there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity in calling that a <hi>Mystery,</hi> which being


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62248:9"/>
revealed, hath yet something in it which our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings cannot reach to. But it is meer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing to insist on a Word, if the Thing it self be granted. The chief thing therefore to be done is, to shew that God may require from us the belief of such things which are incomprehensible by us. For, <hi>God</hi> may require any thing from us, which it is reasonable for us to do; if it be then reasonable for us to give Assent where the manner of what <hi>God</hi> hath revealed is not comprehended, then <hi>God</hi> may certainly require it from us. Hath not God revealed to us that <hi>in six days he made Heaven and Earth and all that is therein?</hi> But is it not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for us to believe this, unless we are able to comprehend the manner of <hi>God</hi>'s production of things? Here we have something revealed and that plainly enough, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God created all things,</hi> and yet, here is a <hi>Mystery</hi> remaining as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it. Hath not God plainly revealed that there shall be a <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead? and must we think it unreasonable to believe it, till we are able to comprehend all the changes of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Matter from the <hi>Creation</hi> to the General <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection?</hi> But it is said <hi>that there is no Contradiction in this, but there is in the Mystery of the Trinity and Incarnation.</hi>

The <hi>Atheists</hi> may as well say, <hi>Infinite Power</hi>


               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62248:10"/>
is a <hi>Monstrous Contradiction</hi>; and <hi>God's Immensity</hi> and his other unsearchable Perfections are <hi>Monstrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes</hi> and <hi>Contradictions.</hi> Will Men never learn to distinguish between <hi>Numbers</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Things?</hi> For <hi>three</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in <hi>Numbers</hi>; but whether an Infinite Nature can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it self to three <hi>different Subsistences</hi> without such a <hi>Division</hi> as is among Created Beings, must not be determin'd by bare <hi>Numbers,</hi> but by the Absolute <hi>Perfections</hi> of the Divine Nature; which must be owned to be above our Comprehension.</p>
            <p>For let us examin some of those <hi>Perfections</hi> which are most clearly revealed and we shall find this true. The <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly reveals, that <hi>God</hi> is from <hi>everlasting to everlasting</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 90.2. Revel. 1.4. c. 11. v. 17.</note>

We know that either God must have been for ever, or it is impossible he ever should be; for if he should come into Being when he was not, he must have some Cause of his


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62248:10"/>
Being; and that which was the first Cause would be God. But, if he was for ever he must be from himself; and what Notion or Conception can we have in our Minds concerning it? And yet, <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> men can take no Advantage from hence; because their own most absurd <hi>Hypothesis</hi> hath the very same Difficulty in it. For something must have been for ever. And it is far more Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to suppose it of an Infinite and Eternal Mind, which hath Wisdom and Power and Goodness to give Being to other things, than of dull, stupid and sensless Matter, which could never move it self, nor give Being to any thing besides. Here we have therefore a thing which must be owned by all; and yet such a thing which can be conceived by none. Which shews the narrowness and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Understandings, and how unfit they are to be the Measures of the Possibilities of things. <hi>Vain men would be wise</hi>; they would fain go to the very bottom of things, when alas! they scarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the very Surface of them. They will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Religion; and yet every thing is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to them. They cry out of <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and yet there is not a Spire of Grass but is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to them; they will bear with nothing in <hi>Religion</hi> which they cannot comprehend, and yet there is scarce any thing in the World which they can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62248:11"/>
But above other things the <hi>Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> even those which are most Absolute and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary are above their Reach. For let such Men try their Imaginations about God's <hi>Eternity,</hi> not meerly how he should be from himself, but how God should coexist with all the Differences of Times and yet there be no Succession in his own Being. I do not say there is such Difficulty to conceive a Rock standing still when the Waves run by it; or the <hi>Gnomon</hi> of a Dial when the Shadow passes from one Figure to another; because these are gross un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active things; but the Difficulty is far greater where the Being is Perfect and always Active. For, where there is Succession there is a passing out of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such a duration into being in it; which is not consistent with the Absolute Perfection of the Divine Nature. And therefore God must be all at once what he is, without any Respect to the Difference of Time past, present or to come. From whence <hi>Eternity</hi> was defined by <hi>Boethius</hi> to <hi>be a perfect and complete Possession all at once of everlasting Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Consol. l. 3.</note> But how can we form any Conception in our Minds of that being all at once, which hath such different Acts as must be measur'd by a long Succession of Time? As, the Creating and Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Frame of the World; the Promising and Sending the <hi>Messias</hi>; the Declaring and Executing a general Judgment; how can these things be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62248:11"/>
with a Permanent Instant, or a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being without Succession? For, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us in this Case, as to God's Eternity, to form a clear and distinct <hi>Idea</hi> in our Mind, of that which both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> convince us must be. The most we can make of our Conception of it is, that God hath neither Beginning of Being, nor End of Days; but that he always was and always must be. And this is rather a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Conclusion from Reason and Scripture, than any distinct Notion or Conception of Eternity in our Minds. From whence it evidently follows, that God may reveal something to us, which we are bound to believe, and yet after that Revelation the Manner of it may be incomprehensible by us, and consequently a <hi>Mystery</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>Hath not God Revealed to us in <hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his own Nature? That <hi>he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and therefore will <hi>be worshipp'd in Spirit and in Truth</hi>; For,<note place="margin">S. Joh. 4.24.</note> that is a true Reason why Spiritual Worship should be most agreeable to him. Now, if we could have a clear, distinct positive Notion in our minds of God's Spiritual Nature, we might then pretend that there is nothing <hi>mysterious</hi> in this, since it is revealed.</p>
            <p>But let such men Examin their own thoughts about this matter; and try, whether the utmost they can attain to, be not something <hi>Negative,</hi> viz.


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62248:12"/>
because great Absurdities would follow if we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted any thing <hi>Corporeal</hi> to God; for, then he must be compounded of Parts, and so he may be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; then he must be confined to a certain place, and not every-where present; he cannot have the Power of Acting and Self-Determining which a a meer Body hath not. For the clearest Notion we can have of <hi>Body,</hi> is, that it is made up of some things as parts of it, which may be separated from each other, and is confined to a certain place, and hath no Power to Move or Act from it self. But some of these men who cry down <hi>Mysteries</hi> and magnifie Reason, to shew how slender their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Reason are, have asserted a <hi>Corporeal God,</hi> with <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> It was indeed, well thought of by those who would make <hi>a Man</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> to bring <hi>God</hi> down as near to <hi>Man</hi> as might be. But how to Reconcile the Notion of a Body with Infinite Perfections, is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to me, and far above my Comprehension. But if it be no <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to such Men, they must either deny God's Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfections or shew how a bodily Shape can be capable of them. But some men can confound <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite, Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit, God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and yet are for no <hi>Mysteries</hi>; whereas these things are farther from our Reach and Comprehension, than any of those Doctrines which they find fault with. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62248:12"/>If we believe <hi>Prophesie,</hi> we must believe <hi>Gods fore-knowledge of future Events:</hi> For, how could they be fore-told if he did not fore-know them? And if he did fore-know those which he did fore-tell, then it was either because those only were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him which is inconsistent with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections; or that he doth fore-know all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Events and only thought fitting to Reveal these: But how can they Solve the Difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Divine Prescience?</hi> Is there no <hi>Mystery</hi> in this?

                  <hi>Socin.</hi> Prael. c. 11.</note> as a thing above his Comprehension? Because nothing can be fore-known but what hath a certain Cause, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if evil Actions be fore-told God must be the Cause of them, and Men will not be free Agents in them. And yet it is most certain, that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ by the Wickedness of Men, were fore-told. What then? Must we make God the Author of Sin? God forbid. Will the righteous Judge of all the Earth, punish Mankind for his own Acts, which they could not avoid?

            <p>I shall not now insist on any more of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Attributes of God, but only in general I desire to know, whether they believe them to be <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>infinite?</hi> If to be <hi>finite,</hi> then they must have certain bounds and limits which they cannot exceed; and that must either be from the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Nature, or from a Superiour Cause, both which are repugnant to the very Being of God.

Religion. <q>For, say they, <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Mystery</hi> in its own Nature; not this or that, or the other Religion; but <hi>they are all alike,</hi> all is <hi>Mystery</hi>; and that is but another Name for <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.</hi> What were the <hi>Heathen Mysteries</hi> but tricks of <hi>Priest-Craft</hi>; and such are maintained and kept up in all kinds of Religion. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these men, who talk against <hi>Mysteries</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand themselves, they must in pursuance of their Principles reject <hi>one God,</hi> as well as <hi>three Persons</hi>; For, as long as they believe an Infinite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Being, it is Nonsense to reject any other Doctrine, which relates to an <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> because it is <hi>Incomprehensible.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But yet these very Men, who seem to pursue the Consequence of this Principle to the utmost, must assert something more incomprehensible than the <hi>Being of God.</hi> For, I appeal to any man of common Understanding, whether it be not more agreeable to Reason to suppose Works of Skill, Beauty and Order to be the Effects of a Wise and Intelligent Being, than of Blind Chance and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Necessity; whether it be not more agreeable to the Sense of Mankind to suppose an Infinite and Eternal Mind endued with all possible Perfections to be the Maker of this visible World; than, that it should start out from it self, without Contrivance, without Order, without Cause? Certainly such


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62248:14"/>
men have no Reason to find fault with the <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion</hi> because they are <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> since there is nothing so Absurd and Incomprehensible, as their darling <hi>Hypothesis</hi>; And, there is nothing which can make it prevail, but to suppose Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be as Dull and Insensible as the first <hi>Chaos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have shewn that it is not unreasonable for <hi>God</hi> to require from us the Belief of something which we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) I now come to consider, whether those who are so afraid of <hi>incomprehensible Mysteries</hi> in our <hi>Faith,</hi> have made it so much more easie in the Way they have taken. And notwithstanding all the Hectoring talk against <hi>Mysteries</hi> and things incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible in Religion, I find more insuperable Difficulties in point of Reason in their Way than in ours. As for instance,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is a more Reasonable thing to suppose something <hi>Mysterious</hi> in the Eternal Son of God's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Father before the World was made by him</hi>; (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> expresses it in the beginning of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel) than in supposing that although <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> were born six Months before <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; that yet Christ was in Dignity before him. What a wonderfull <hi>Mystery</hi> is this? Can Men have the Face to cry down <hi>Mysteries</hi> in deep Speculations, and matters of a high and abstruse Nature, when they make such <hi>Mysteries</hi> of plain and easie things?


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62248:14"/>
And suppose the <hi>Evangelist</hi> in profound Language and lofty Expressions to prove a thing, which was never disputed, <hi>viz.</hi> that although <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> were born six Months after <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet he was in Dignity before him? Yet this was a <hi>Mystery,</hi> which, as I remember, <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> glories in that his Uncle <hi>Laelius</hi> obtained by Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is a more Reasonable thing to suppose that a <hi>Divine Person</hi> should assume human Nature, and so the <hi>Word to be made Flesh</hi>; than to say, that an Attribute of God, his <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>made Flesh,</hi> which is a <hi>Mystery</hi> beyond all Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; There may be some Difficulties in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the other, but this is a thing beyond all Conception or Imagination; For an <hi>Accident</hi> to be made a <hi>Substance</hi> is as absurd, as to imagin it to <hi>subsist</hi> without one.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is more Reasonable to suppose that the Son of God should <hi>come down from Heaven</hi> and take our Nature upon him, than that a man should be rapt up into Heaven, that it might be said that he came down from thence. For in the former Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition we have many other places of Scripture to support it, which speak of his <hi>being with God,</hi> and <hi>having Glory with him before the World was</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is nothing for the other, but only that it is necessary to make some tolerable Sense of those words.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62248:15"/>(4.) It is more Reasonable to believe that <hi>God</hi> should become <hi>Man</hi> by taking our Nature upon him, than that <hi>Man</hi> should become <hi>God.</hi> For in the former, there is nothing but the Difficulty of conceiving the Manner of the Union, which we all grant to be so between Soul and Body; but in the other there is a Repugnancy in the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a <hi>Created God,</hi> of an <hi>Eternal Son of Adam,</hi> of <hi>Omnipotent Infirmity,</hi> of an <hi>Infinite finite Being.</hi> In the former Case, an <hi>Infinite</hi> is united to a <hi>Finite;</hi> but in the other a <hi>Finite</hi> becomes <hi>Infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) It is more Reasonable to believe that <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> should suffer as he did <hi>for our sakes</hi> than <hi>for his own.</hi> We are all agreed that the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> were far beyond any thing he deserved at <hi>God</hi>'s hands; but what Account then is to be given of them? We say that he made himself a voluntary Sacrifice for Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Sins of Mankind; and so there was a great and noble End designed, and no Injury done to a willing Mind; and the <hi>Scripture</hi> as plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses this, as it can do in Words. But others deny this, and make him to suffer as one wholly Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; for what Cause? To make the most Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Persons as apprehensive of Suffering as the most Guilty; and the most righteous God to put no difference between them, with Respect to Suffering?</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) It is more Reasonable to suppose such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension in the Son of <hi>God</hi> to take upon him the


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62248:15"/>
Form of a Servant for our Advantage; than that a <hi>meer Man</hi> should be Exalted to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which belongs only <hi>to God.</hi> For, on the one side, there is nothing but what is agreeable to the Divine Nature, viz. <hi>Infinite Love</hi> and <hi>Condescension</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> to Mankind; on the other, there is the greatest Design of <hi>Self-Exaltation</hi> that ever was in <hi>Human Nature,</hi> viz. for a <hi>meer Man</hi> to have the most <hi>Essential Attributes</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable Honour</hi> which belongs to <hi>God.</hi> And whether of these two is more agreeable to the Spirit and Design of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, let any man of understanding judge. For as it is evident, that the great Intention of it is to magnifie the wonderfull Love of God in the sending of his Son; so it is as plain that one great End of the Christian Doctrine was to take Mankind off from giving Divine Worship to Creatures; and can we then suppose that at the same time it should set up the <hi>Worship</hi> of a <hi>meer Man</hi> with all the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> which belongs to <hi>God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is to me an <hi>incomprehensible Mystery</hi> indeed, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that is implied in the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation.</hi> For it Subverts the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Design of Christianity as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>Idolatry</hi> then in being; it lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for introducing it into the World again; for since the Distance between God and his Creatures is taken away, in the matter of Worship, there is


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62248:16"/>
nothing left but the Declaration of his Will; which doth not exclude more <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> but upon this Ground, that the <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> is the Foundation of that of <hi>Intercession.</hi> And it is far more easie for us to suppose there may be some things too hard for us to understand in the Mystery of our <hi>Redemption by Jesus Christ,</hi> than that at the same time it should be both <hi>a Duty</hi> and <hi>a Sin</hi> to worship any but the <hi>true God</hi> with proper Divine Worship. For if it be Idolatry to give it to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it is a great Sin; for so the Scripture still accounts it; but if we are bound to give it to Christ who is but a Creature, then that which in it self is a Sin, is now become a Necessary Duty; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Natural Differences of Good and Evil, and makes <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be a meer <hi>Arbitrary</hi> thing. And I take it for granted, that in Matters of Religion, <hi>Moral</hi> Difficulties are more to be regarded than <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi>; because Religion was far more designed for a Rule of our Actions, than for the Satisfaction of our Curiosity. And upon due Examination we shall find that there is no such frightfull Appearances of Difficulties in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as there is in giving <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to a <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ought to be observed, that those very Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are supposed to exclude Christ from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>true God</hi>;<note place="margin">S. Joh. 17.3.</note> must, if they have any force, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.6.</note> For they are spoken


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62248:16"/>
of God as the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Worship</hi>; but if he be not excluded from <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> then neither is he from being the <hi>true God</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Socin.</hi> ad <hi>Eutrop.</hi> p 96 c. <hi>Wick.</hi> c. 11. <hi>Catech. Racov.</hi> p. 65.</note> which they grant he is <hi>by Office</hi> but not <hi>by Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a <hi>God by Office</hi> who is not so <hi>by Nature</hi> is a new and <hi>incomprehensible Mystery.</hi> A <hi>Mystery hidden from Ages and Generations</hi> as to the Church of God; but not <hi>made known by the Gospel of his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is such a kind of <hi>Mystery</hi> as the <hi>Heathen</hi> Priests had, who had <hi>Gods many and Lords many,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>i. e.</hi> many <hi>by Office</hi> although but one <hi>by Nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.5.</note> But if the Christian Religion had owned <hi>one God by Nature</hi> and only <hi>one by Office,</hi> the Heathens had been to blame chiefly in the Number of their Gods by <hi>Office,</hi> and not in the divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which they gave to them. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> blames the Heathens for <hi>doing Service to them which by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are no Gods</hi>; not for doing it without Divine Authority,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.8.</note> nor for mistaking the Person who was God by Office, but in giving Divine Worship to them who <hi>by Nature were no Gods</hi>; which he would never have said, if by the Christian Doctrine, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship were to be given to one who was not <hi>God by Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these are indeed <hi>incomprehensible Mysteries</hi> how a Man by Nature can be a God <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truely</hi> by <hi>Office</hi>; how the Incommunicable Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Nature can be communicated


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62248:17"/>
to a Creature; how God should <hi>give his Glory to another,</hi> and by his own Command require that to be given to a Creature, which himself had abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbidden to be given to any besides himself. It is said by a famous <hi>Iesuit</hi> (I will not say how agreeably to their own <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> about Divine Worship) <hi>that the Command of God cannot make him worthy of Divine Worship,</hi>

                  <hi>Smiglec.</hi> de Divin. Verb. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn. Nat. p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>who without such a Command is not worthy of it. And it is very absurd to say, that he that is unworthy of it without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, can become worthy by it; for it makes God to command Divine Honour to be given to one who cannot deserve it.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But after all the Invectives of these Enemies to <hi>Mysteries,</hi> we do not make that which we say is <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> to be a <hi>Necessary Article of Faith</hi> as it is <hi>Incomprehensible</hi>; but we do assert that what is <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> as to the <hi>Manner,</hi> may be a <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article</hi> as far as it is plainly Revealed. As in the Instances I have already mentioned of the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Resurrection of the Dead</hi>; would they in earnest have Men turn <hi>Infidels</hi> as to these things till they are able to comprehend all the difficulties which relate to them? If not, why should this suggestion be allow'd as to the <hi>Mysteries</hi> which relate to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> If it be said, <hi>the Case is


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62248:17"/>
not alike for those are clearly Revealed and these are not</hi>; this brings it to the true and proper Issue of this matter, and if we do not prove a <hi>clear Revelation,</hi> we do not assert their being <hi>Necessary Articles of Faith</hi>; but my present business was only to take off this Objection that the <hi>Mysteries</hi> were Incomprehensible and therefore not to be received by us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And so I come to the second Way, by which, we are to Examin the several Senses of <hi>Christ Jesus coming to save Sinners:</hi> Which of them tends more to the Benefit and Advantage of Mankind; or which is <hi>more worthy of all Acceptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that will appear by considering these things;
<list>
                  <item>(1.) Which tends most to the raising our <hi>Esteem</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(2.) Which tends most to the begetting in us a greater <hi>Hatred of Sin.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As to the raising in us a greater <hi>Esteem</hi> and <hi>Love of Christ.</hi> We are certain that the Infinite Love and Condescension of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62248:18"/>
easie, but I am certain they have extremely lessen'd the Argument for our <hi>Love, viz.</hi> the Apprehensions of the wonderfull Love and Condescension of Christ in coming into the World <hi>to save Sinners.</hi> And yet this is the great Argument of the New Testament to perswade Mankind to the <hi>Love of God</hi> and of his Son:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. This is indeed a mighty Argument of Love, if by <hi>the only begotten Son</hi> be meant the Eternal Son of God, <hi>who came down from Heaven,</hi> as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks just before;<note place="margin">v. 13.</note> but if no more be meant but only that God made a <hi>meer Man</hi> to be his Son, and after he had preached a while here on Earth and was ill used and crucified by his own People, he Exalted him to be <hi>God</hi> and gave him Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Honours; this were an Argument of great Love to the Person of Christ, but not to the rest of Mankind. But <hi>Gods Love</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> is magnified with Respect to <hi>the World</hi> in the sending of his Son. <hi>In this was manifested,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the Love of God towards us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>because that God sent his only begotten Son into the World that we should live through him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Sins.</hi> The great Love we still see is <hi>towards us, i. e.</hi> towards Mankind, but according to the other Sense it must have been, Herein was the Love of God manifested to his Son, that for his


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62248:18"/>
Sufferings he exalted him above all Creatures. <hi>He that spared not his own Son,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> 
               <hi>but deliver'd him up for us all.</hi> If he were the <hi>Eternal Son of God</hi> who came to suffer for us, there is a mighty force and <hi>Emphasis</hi> in this Expression, and very apt to raise our Admiration and our Love; But what <hi>not sparing his own Son</hi> is there, if nothing were meant but that he designed by Sufferings to Exalt him? For <hi>not Sparing him</hi> supposes an Antecedent Relation of the highest Kindness, but the other is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing extraordinary Kindness for the sake of his Sufferings. Therefore, the Argument for the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is taken from what his <hi>Son</hi> was, when he deliver'd him up for us all; he was his <hi>own Son</hi>; not by <hi>Adoption</hi> as others are; S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls him,<note place="margin">John 1.14. ch. 3. v. 16. Luk. 3.22.</note> his <hi>only begotten Son</hi>; and God himself, <hi>his beloved Son</hi> in the Voice from Heaven; and this before his Sufferings, immediately after his Baptism, when as yet, there was nothing extraordinary done by him, as to the great Design of his coming. Which shews, that there was an Antecedent Relation between him and the Father; and that therein the Love of God and of Christ was manifested, that being the <hi>only begotten Son of the Father,</hi> he should take our Nature upon him and for our sakes do and suffer what he did. This is indeed an Argument great enough to raise our Admiration, to excite our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to inflame our Affections; but how flat


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62248:19"/>
and low doth it appear, when it comes to no more than this, that there was a <hi>Man,</hi> whom, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sufferings, <hi>God</hi> raised from the dead and made him a <hi>God by Office?</hi> Doth this carry any such Argument in it for our Esteem and Love and Devotion to him as the other doth upon the most serious Consideration of it?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Which tends most to beget in us a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hatred of Sin.</hi> For that is so contrary to the Way of our <hi>Salvation</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that what tends most to our <hi>Hatred</hi> of it, must conduce most to our Happiness; and therefore be <hi>most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all Acceptation.</hi> It is agreed on all hands, that <hi>Christ</hi> did suffer very much both in his Mind and in his Body. In his Mind, when it is said, <hi>that he was troubled in Spirit</hi>;<note place="margin">Joh. 13.21. Matt. 26.37, 38.</note> that <hi>he began to be sorrowfull and very heavy</hi>; and soon after, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowfull, even unto death.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Mark 14.33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>that he was in an Agony</hi>; wherein he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>prayed more earnestly, but his sweat was as it were great Drops of Blood falling to the Ground.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22.44</note> What made this Amazement, and dreadfull Agony in the mind of the most innocent Person in the World? Was it meerly the Fear of the Pains of Death which he was to undergo? That is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, considering the Assurance which he had of so glorious a Reward so soon following after; when so many Martyrs endured such exquisite


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62248:19"/>
Torments for his sake without any such Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance or Consternation. But the Apostles give us another Account of it. S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> saith he, was <hi>to bear our Sins in his own body on the tree</hi>; that <hi>Christ suffer'd for Sins, the just for the unjust.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.18.</note> S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> 
               <hi>that God made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi> Hereby we understand how so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a Person came to suffer; <hi>he stood in our Stead; he was made Sin for us</hi>; and therefore was to be treated as a Sinner; and to suffer that on our Account, which he could not deserve on his own. If he suffer'd on his own Account, this were the way to fill our Minds with perplexity concerning the Justice of Providence with Respect to his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the most innocent and holy Persons in this World; If he suffer'd on our Account, then we have the Benefit of his Sufferings, and therein we see how displeasing to God sin is, when even his own Son suffer'd so much by taking the guilt of our Sins upon him. And what can tend more to the begetting in us a due hatred of sin, than to consider, what <hi>Christ</hi> himself suffer'd on the Account of it? What can make us have more dreadfull thoughts of it, than that the great and mercifull God, when he designed <hi>to Save sinners,</hi> yet would have his own Son to become <hi>a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the Sins of Mankind?</hi> And unless we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62248:20"/>
this, we must put force upon the plainest Expressions of <hi>Scripture</hi>; and make <hi>Christ</hi> to suffer meerly to shew God's Power over a most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Person, and his Will and Pleasure to inflict the most severe Punishment without any Respect to Guilt. And surely such a Notion of <hi>God,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>worthy of all Acceptation.</hi>

Which tends most to strengthen our <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Salvation by Christ Jesus.</hi> If we believe that he suffer'd for our Sins, then we have great Reason to hope for the Forgiveness of them; although they have been many and great, if we sincerely Repent; because the most prevailing Argument for Despair will be removed; which is taken from the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi> and his declared <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Displeasure</hi> against <hi>Sinners.</hi> If God be so much in earnest displeased with the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and his Justice be concerned in the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sinners, how can they ever hope to escape, unless there be a way for his Displeasure to be removed, and his Justice to be satisfied? And this the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us is done by <hi>Christ,</hi> who died that he might be a <hi>Sacrifice of Atonement</hi> to <hi>Reconcile us to God by his Death</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10. 2 Cor. 5.19. Heb. 9.15.</note> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirms. And by this means, we may have strong Consolation from the Hopes of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Sins. Whereas, if this be taken away, either Men must believe that <hi>God</hi> was not in

earnest displeased with the Sins of Mankind; which must exceedingly lessen our Esteem of the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Iustice of God</hi>; or if he were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, that he laid aside this Displeasure, without any <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Expiation.</hi> And so, as many as look on <hi>God's Iustice</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> as necessary and essential Attributes of God, will be in danger of sinking into the Depths of Despair, as often as they Reflect seriously on the Guilt of their Sins. But on the other side, if we believe that while we were <hi>Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son</hi>; then we may <hi>have Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>; and have Reason to believe that there will be <hi>no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ Jesus</hi> by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith and sincere Repentance; then they may with Comfort look up to God as a Reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through <hi>Jesus Christ our Mediator</hi>; then they may with inward Satisfaction look beyond the Grave, and stedfastly hope for that Salvation which Christ purchased on Earth and will at last bestow on all such as Love and Obey him. To which God of his Infinite Mercy bring us all through <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> For, <hi>This is a faithfull Saying and worthy of all Acceptation, that he came into the World to save Sinners.</hi>
