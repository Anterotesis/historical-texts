            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firſt, for that I haue been thereunto requeſted, by certaine godly and valiant Captaines and Ship-maſters, with whom being on the ſpaniſh ſeas, vnder the conduct of the moſt noble Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> that they might with better confidence call vpon God, I laboured ſundrie times, as well by priuate conference, as alſo in my publick Sermons ſo often and ſo farre forth as my text would giue mee occaſion.

ſpeeches of many, which haue not ſtickt to affirme, that theſe my voyages vpon the ſeas haue beene ſome blot and diſcredite to the doctrine which is or ſhall by me bee deliuered vpon the land.

            <p>Conſider then I pray thee what enemie thou doeſt encounter with when thou goeſt againſt the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard: Firſt, he is, as ye haue heard before, an Idolater, a pillar and prop of Antichriſt, an open enemie to the fayth of Chriſt and a profeſſed patron of truce brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, falſhood and diſloyalty. He is alſo a greedy tyrant of vnſatiable couetouſnes, that ſeeketh nothing elſe but to ſwallow vp euen the whole worlde. When the Soueraigne dignity in the low countries was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our moſt Chriſtian Prince franckly and freely, her Grace refuſed it, being contented with thoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which God, and blood, and nature hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon her: but this monſter of <hi>Spaine</hi> is neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: <hi>Nauarre, Naples,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> will not ſerue, but he muſt gripe in alſo the Low countries, and deuoure vp all their auncient liberties. The Lowe countries will not content him, but he muſt plucke in alſo <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. Portugall</hi> is nothing to him vnles he may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>France,</hi> and then alſo he gapeth for <hi>England.</hi> But I hope that as the Larke being mounted to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt doth ſodainly fall downe, and as the tyde when the water is at the furtheſt hath his recourſe backe againe: So the Lord wil now graunt to his ſwelling pride ſuch a time of downe-fall, that as ſwiftly he ſhall fal away as euer he mounted vp. He pretendeth the Catholike faith to be the ground of all his warres: but that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as the Italians ſpeake, <hi>Coprire con legiadro mantello iniquiſſimi diſſegni,</hi> with a fayre cloake to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moſt filthy pretences. Did the Earles of <hi>Eghmont</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12873:21"/>
and <hi>Horne</hi> finde any fauour in the Low countries for that they were Romiſh Catholikes? Were they not put to death bearing croſſes in their hands and ſhriuen of the Prieſt? Haue the Portingales now any fauour for that they profeſſe the ſame fayth with the King? No truly, they are made the miſerableſt ſlaues in al the whole world. If the poorer ſorte of them bee taken captiues abroad, he wil not giue a half-penie for their ranſome. He will part with great ſummes for a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, but with nothing at all for a Portingale. As for the Nobler and richer ſorte hee ſuffereth them to bee murdered and ſpoyled at home. Hee is content to be king of them, and to receiue the kingly reuenewes: but he will in no caſe haue any kingly care of them. He ſuffereth the Spaniards to come daylie amongſt them to abuſe their wiues and daughters, that their children may be doubtfull: and indeede doth ſeeke nothing elſe but to bring the ſame vpon them which hee hath brought vpon <hi>Naples</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other places where he hath ſet in foote, that is, vtterly to diſpeople them, to murder and make hauock both of Nobles and Commons, and vtterly to make an ende of them, that they ſhuld be no more a people vpon earth. They pretend Religion till they can preuaile: but as ſoone as they come to beare rule, all their doings declare what was the marke that they chiefly aymed at. I know the miſcreants of the Popiſh crew doe terme the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our moſt gracious Soueraigne, to be bloodie &amp; cruel, for that ſundry (as they ſay) Catholikes haue bin at ſeuerall times put to death ſince the continuance of her Maieſties raigne. But there is none, vnleſſe he bee
<pb facs="tcp:12873:21"/>
wilfully blind, but muſt needs confeſſe, that their abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of her Maieſties ſubiects from all loyalty and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance, their practiſing of ſecret conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Realm, &amp; their withdrawing of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Prince, whom God &amp; blood, and the law hath ſet ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to giue it to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine prelate a Prieſt of Rome, were ſuch dangerous treaſons as might in no wiſe be ſpared. And yet of the authors and procurers of ſuch haynous trecheries, to ſome her Grace hath giuen their lands to remaine to their poſteritie: to ſome alſo their liues, when they haue deſerued a thouſand deaths, with ſuch mercy &amp; clemencie as was neuer heard of in Prince before. Her lenitie in gouernement hath not only bin milde, but euen mildeneſſe it ſelfe: the Lord grant that her dayes may bee as the dayes of heauen, and the Lord giue grace to thoſe her rebellious ſubiects, once duely, and to their bettering to conſider the kinde and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful mercies of ſo louing and gracious a Soueraigne. The enemie may mutter what he will, of tyrannie &amp; cruelty, to obſcure this her mildenes in gouernement, but the beames of her glory in this vertue doe ſhine ſo bright, that no cloud of euil ſpeeches can ouerwhelme or darken them. As the fame of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for wiſedom is ſpred as far as with it ſhe is worthy to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern, that is, ouer the whole earth &amp; as alſo for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all the languages of Chriſtians and good lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, ſhe is, and may be a mirror to all Princes or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: ſo likewiſe for mercie and clemencie, ſhe is, and maugre the deſpight of all ſlaunderous ſpeeches, muſt

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Moſt mercifull God and gracious father, we humbly praiſe thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name for all thy vnſpeakeable mercies, which of thy bountifull goodnes thou haſt hitherto vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to beſtow vpon vs thy poore and vnworthie ſeruants, as well on our ſoules as on our bodies: and namely, for that thou haſt not onely allotted vnto vs thus to be daylie ſuſtained by a lawfull voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreeable to thy bleſſed ordinance, but alſo doeſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully preſerue vs in the ſame from all thoſe dangers which in thy iudgement thou mighteſt iuſtly lay vpon vs, and into which others of our brethren oftentimes haue fallen. O Lord we haue heard of, and partly ſeene and knowne of diuers whom thou haſt ſuffered to be ouerwhelmed with tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous winds in the gulfes of the outragious ſeas: others pinched with extreame famine and penurie: others taken captiues &amp; led to moſt miſerable thraldome: others brought to their end by loathſome diſeaſes and ſundrie kindes of death. We acknowledge, O Lord, that our ſinnes are as huge as theirs, and our iniquities as grieuous. Thoſe <hi>Galilaeans</hi> whoſe blood <hi>Pilate</hi> ſpilt, and thoſe eighteene on whom the tower of <hi>Silo</hi> fell, were not greater ſinners then the reſt in Iſrael: and thoſe on whom in our time thou haſt ſhewed thy heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeeing that we haue followed them and ouertaken
<pb facs="tcp:12873:27"/>
them in their ſinnes, we had deſerued rather to haue been made examples vnto them then they vnto vs. But it is thy mercie, good Lord, thus to ſpare vs, &amp; to giue vs a larger time of repentance. We confeſſe our ſelues, O bleſſed father, to be vnworthie the leaſt of all thy benefites, if we conſider our owne deſeruings: we haue ſo manifold waies tranſgreſſed thy moſt holy commandements by our vncleane thoughts, by our vngodly words, by our vnrighteous deedes, that wee are not onely become worthie to be depriued of all thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious benefites and bleſſings: but alſo we haue deſerued to haue all thy iudgements in full meaſure to be powred vpon vs, not onely in this world, but alſo in the world to come. But O Lord, we appeale to thy throne of mercie, beſeeching thee to looke vpon vs, not as we are in our ſelues polluted &amp; ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſinne and wickedneſſe: but to behold vs in the face and perſon and obedience of thy deare ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, accepting his death and paſſion as a full recompence for all our tranſgreſſions. Good Lord clothe vs with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ingraft vs truely as liuely members of his bodie, and for his ſake continue all thy mercies and louing kindnes, which ſo many waies we haue taſted of from our tender youth vntil this preſent day. O Lord increaſe our faith daylie more and more: grant that we may be fully perſwaded of thine eternal election, that thou good Lord of thy infinite fauour &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes haſt elected and choſen vs to be ſaued before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was layd: giue vs that applying faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may be aſſured that we are of the number of them for whom Chriſt dyed vpon the Croſſe: giue vs that iuſtifying faith, whereby thy ſpirit may ſpeake comfortably to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that all our ſinnes are forgiuen vnto vs: giue vs that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyng faith, which may bring forth all good fruites of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement of life and true repentance. O Lord pardon our huge &amp; grieuous ſinnes which we haue heretofore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted agaynſt thy diuine Maieſtie: let our former wickednes be no hinderance to thy mercie. Lord remember not the iniquities and offences of our youth, but according to thy mercie think
<pb facs="tcp:12873:27"/>
vpon vs in thy great goodnes. Remember not how vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full we haue been vnto thee for thy manifold preſeruations and benefites all the courſe of our life. Thou haſt been rich in mercie towards vs, but we haue been poore in thankfulnes to thee agayne. Lord pardon all our former vnthankfulnes, and make vs daylie more and more thankfull, not onely in word, but alſo in holines of life, that we neuer be found to be of the number of thoſe which confeſſe thee with their mouth, but denie thee with their workes. In all our affayres of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward warfare, Lord grant vs grace eſpecially to be zelous in our inward combate agaynſt ſinne and wickedneſſe, that we may mortifie the roote of our carnall and corrupt affections, that we may haue the true ſtrife of the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, wraſtling agaynſt all ſinnes, but eſpecially agaynſt thoſe whereunto we finde our ſelues moſt inclined. Ayd vs good Lord eſpecially in our ſpiritual battaile againſt the world, the fleſh and the diuell: put vpon vs the ſword-girdle of truth &amp; the breaſtplate of righteouſnes. Arme vs with the ſhield of faith, wherby we may que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch al the fierie darts of the wicked, and ſo deliuer to vs and guide in vs the ſword of thy ſpirit, that we may ouercome and triumph by the blood of the Lambe, and the word of his teſtament. And for as much as the euents of our eſtate and vocation are ſundrie and variable, O Lord we pray thee ſo gouerne vs with thy good grace, that in all our trauailes we may ioyfully ſay, Thy will be done and not ours: that neither our proſperitie doe cauſe vs to forget thee, nor aduerſitie doe prouoke vs to murmur agaynſt thee, that with contented mindes we may caſt all our care on thee: for thou careſt for vs, that in troubles we may aſſure our ſelues that thou doeſt not plague vs as a iudge, but correct vs as a father, and that in euery good ſucceſſe we may humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee the author and giuer thereof, and neuer lift vp ourſelues to accompt it the worke of our owne hands. We that thus goe downe in ſhippes, and occupie our buſines in great waters, doe daylie ſee thy manifold workes and thy wonders in the deepe, how thou lifteſt vp the waues of the
<pb facs="tcp:12873:28"/>

Lord graunt vs alwaies to make true vſe of theſe thy creatures, that wee may learne thereby to acknowledge thy Maieſtie, to reuerence thy power, to feare thy iudgements, and to truſt in thy mercies. Thou haſt promiſed that thoſe which crie vnto thee in their trouble, thou wilt deliuer them from their diſtreſſe,<note place="margin">

Thou onely art he that commandeth both the windes and the ſeas: Lord ſo gouerne them both in theſe our attempts againſt the profeſſed enemies of thy truth, as may be moſt for the glory of thy name, for the benefit of thy Church, for the good and welfare of our natiue ſoyle, and for the ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and honour of our moſt gracious Soueraigne. Bleſſe our labours, proſper our voyage, let thy enemies ſo fall before vs, as that thou maiſt haue all the praiſe, and we all the comfort. Teach our hands to warre and our fingers to fight: couer our head in the day of battaile: giue vs thy holy angels to aſsiſt vs: grant vs to be true and faithfull amongſt our ſelues, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thoſe whom thou haſt placed ouer vs, &amp; couragious againſt thy enemies: hold thy holy hand ouer vs, ſanctifie our affections, that we may not ſo much ſeeke our ſelues, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe that ſeruice which may be moſt agreeable to thy holy will, and moſt for the proſperous eſtate of our Prince and Countrey, whom we beſeech thee, O Lord, to bleſſe and protect now and euer. We know, O Lord, that the obtaining of victorie doth not conſiſt in number of men; it is all one with thee to ſaue with many, or with no power: in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thy trueth we goe againſt the open vpholders and ſworne vaſſals of Antichriſt, good Lord let not thy aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries preuaile againſt vs, let not the wicked ſay, where is now their God? Strike a terror into the enemies: let the ſhield de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them: confound that proud and haughtie power of that <hi>Haman,</hi> that doth ſo inſolently oppoſe it ſelfe againſt the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt. Goe before our armie, good Lord, and be our buckler and ſhield to defend vs from all daungers

both of bodie and ſoule. Lord remember thy wonted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and louing kindnes which haue been euer of old, and for thy Churches ſake, euen for that remnant which thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, let it be thy mercifull pleaſure to bleſſe our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours: grant vs to repoſe our truſt and confidence ſtedfaſtly vpon the experience of thy power and goodneſſe: giue vs ſuch aſſurance of faith, and ſuch continuance in true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that we being thy children, and our lamps of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance alwaies burning, death may neuer be ſodaine vnto vs: and when it ſhall be thy good will to take vs out of this vale of miſerie, be it in or out of thoſe battailes which to our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doe appertaine, we beſeech thee, O Lord, that our ſoules may ſo fight a good fight, and finiſh their courſe with ioy, that they may be partakers of the crowne of euerlaſting tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the world to come.
