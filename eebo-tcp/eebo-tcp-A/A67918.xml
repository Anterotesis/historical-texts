            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ASTROLOGICAL APHORISMS</hi> used in the Resolution of <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Questions;</hi> with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great use in going to War, taking Journeys, erecting Buildings, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and reduced them into such a plain and easie Language and Method, as will suit with a very mean Capacity: not for Gain, Profit, nor Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
<pb facs="tcp:113895:3"/>
(for those things I never desired, nor sought after) but out of an earnest desire to benefit my own Country-men, (who do very much want English Tracts of this nature) to advance this kinde of Learning, to serve and assist those that are Learners and Students in this so admirable, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an Art and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and to stir up more active Pens to a publishing things of this nature, at
<pb facs="tcp:113895:4"/>
this time, now this kinde of Learning is so much vilist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reproached, by a company of men that are both ignorant and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who like the Fox in the Fable, that discommended the Grapes, because he could not reach them; so these despise Learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot attain unto it.</p>
            <p>But the Reproaches of the Ignorant I shall not value, nor shall I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:113895:4"/>
but that the Ingenious will make a good Construction of these my Labours, (which will very much encourage me to proceed in my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded works in this kind) but if not, I had rather have the Reproofs of the Wise, then the Applause of Fools.</p>

                  <p>THe heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shews forth his handy-work.</p>
                  <p>The heavens hold forth the glory of God in a threefold maner:</p>
                  <p>By their Creation, Preservation, Operation.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Creation, by Mighty Power.</item>
                     <item>Preservation; by Infinite Wisdom.</item>
                     <item>Operation, in manifold Vertues, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Harmony.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The heavens declare the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> by
<pb facs="tcp:113895:26"/>
their Creation, being produced to a being from nothing: which is so great a work, both too high for Intelligences and Angels. So the heavens themselves, simply considered, declare and manifest the glory of God by their Creation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the second, their Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they depend immediately upon God: for every creature, both spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, barely considered in it self, tends to <hi>Ad non</hi> a not being. And the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esse. lencies a creature hath, the greater Providence it requires for its conservation; as a Horse needs a less Providence then an Angel, because an Angel hath more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies then a Horse. Now the heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God mightily in this respect, because it requires a wonderful hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to conserve them in that harmony they are in.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the third, the heavens wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully declare the glory of God, by their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual operation; whence come so many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and changes of times; Spring, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Harvest, Winter, Cold, Heat, Rain, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

and Fishes; all these, and many more, too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to relate, come from the influence of the heavens, and wonderfully set forth the glory of God in creating such creatures with such wonderful influences.</p>
                  <p>All second causes act in the vertue of the first cause, and the first cause suspends their operations when he pleaseth, bringing an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect immediately of himself.</p>
                  <p>Concerning these second causes, and the concourse and operation of the heavens, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned men have written, That the effects do not fall out necessarily, but contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: <hi>Ptol. in centiloqu. Judicia quae tibi trado, sunt inter necessarium &amp; possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so the <hi>Sun</hi> signifies cleerness, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> cloudiness; because <hi>Sol</hi> is exalted, and <hi>Saturn</hi> cast down in <hi>Aries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also <hi>Jupiter</hi> is exalted, and <hi>Mars</hi> is cast down in <hi>Cancer; Jupiter</hi> signifies justice, <hi>Mars</hi> deceit.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Venus</hi> signifies singing and mirth, <hi>Mercury</hi> Philosophy, and other Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>And so the Planets have their several
<pb facs="tcp:113895:27"/>
operations in the Signes, and also by their Conjunctions and Aspects, from which, happy Elections may be made for diverse bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, part of which is our present scope.</p>

                     <p>The general Significator is the Planet which hath most dignities in the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or in the Conjunction or Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Sun and Moon, if it were neer at hand, or in the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> if that were also newly past.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:113895:54"/>
I shall insert one Example for this, and so conclude.</p>
                     <p>A certain man came to an Artist about a Question, without revealing one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but onely the general, what he came about.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:113895:55"/>
First, he viewed the Lady of the Ascendent, from whom she was separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that was from the Sun, who is Lord of the eleventh house, and is in the fourth: by that, he knew the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was about something which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which was signified by the fourth house; <hi>viz.</hi> either his father, or his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But because the Moon is separated from the Lord of the seventh, which is the house of women, he knew it was his mother he came to enquire about. And because the Moon is in the house of Journeys, he knew it was about some Journey his mother was about to take; which is aggravated by her being dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Mercury</hi> in the third house.</p>
                     <p>And because <hi>Venus</hi> is opposite to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the tenth house, he said she was going to the King.</p>
                     <p>But because both of them are Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, and in Opposition, and <hi>Venus</hi> in the fall of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he said the King would frown upon her at the first; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because the Moon is received by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> Lord of the twelfth house.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:113895:55"/>
Yet because <hi>Jupiter</hi> is a Fortune, in his exaltation, in an Angle, free from the beams of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> he said he would hear her, at last; also, because the Moon disposeth <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and is in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Signe.</p>
                     <p>This was all true.</p>
