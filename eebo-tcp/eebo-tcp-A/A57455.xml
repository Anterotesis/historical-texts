            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fight began, the Dutch throwing over-board a great
many of their heaviest Goods to lighten them, twenty
of their Merchant-men carrying from twenty to forty
Guns apiece they made serviceable by sending men
aboard them in the night, so that there was as good as
twenty eight Men of War, notwithstanding this our
five Ships maintained a fight with them till night,
and run through and through them, at which time
there came to our assistance three Ships more, <hi>viz.</hi>

commanded by Captain <hi>Towlis,</hi> the <hi>Success</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

early the Fight began again and continued all that
day, about noon Captain <hi>John Holmes</hi> borded their
Rear-Admirall, its name was <hi>S. Patrick</hi> formerly an
English Ship, but our Seamen being too eager of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35619:3"/>
prise neglected to stop the leak she being much shatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and torn, in a short time she sunk down; about
the Evening we took five of their richest Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and had undoubtedly taken the rest had not the
night parted us, and a very fresh gale of wind rising
in the night, gave then an oportunity of getting
away: The whole Fight was managed with a great
deal of Courage and gallantry on our part, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the number of our Ships and the great number of
the Dutch full man'd, for they had at least fifteen
hundred Spanish Soldiers abord that was going to
the service of the Neitherland, it may be accounted
as remarkable a Victory as ere was obtained in the
British Seas.</p>
            <p>The loss of the Dutch was very considerable, not
only as to the loss of Men, but of Goods thrown over
board, there was at least fifty Bayles of Silk taken
up by our Vessels, who went off from this Port the
next Day, besides what Goods sunk to the bottom.
The five Ships taken are loaden chiefly with several
sorts of rich Silks, and other Turkish Commodities:
in their Reer-Admiral was sunk abundance of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Silver, that was sent from Spain to pay of their
Souldiers in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> They had killed in their
Reer-Admiral before she sunk (by acknowledgement
of some of the Ships Company) above one hundred
and fifty persons, and very many wounded: And it is
thought that they could not lose less than a thousand
men in this Engagemen. Since this His Majesty hath
been pleased to set forth His Declaration shewing the
Reasons that doth induce him to wage War with that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35619:4"/>
Ingrateful and Insolent people the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who not
above eighty years since was the <hi>Poor Distressed States,</hi>
and were ready to lie down at our Feet for reliefe;
these we succoured, which now, like a viperous Brood,
would fly in the faces of those that gave them a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But their Ingratitude we do not doubt will be
sufficiently scourged, and they be brought again to
acknowledge their Keepers and Preservers of their
Lives and Liberties, when His Majesties Royal Fleet
united shall meet them, which will consist of above
Eighty Saile, commanded by his Royal Highness in
person; and may well claime the Title of the <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

Country which never was in greater danger, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besieged on all sides with Enemies, viz. with the
French, the Prince Elector of <hi>Coloigne,</hi> the Bishop of
