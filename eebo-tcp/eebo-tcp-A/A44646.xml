            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere is none more sensible than I am, how great a Charity the most Ingenious may need, that expose their private Wit to a publick Judgment; since the same Phancy from whence the Thoughts proceed, must probably be kind to its own Issue: This renders Men no perfecter Judges of their own Writings, than Fathers are of their own Children; who find out that Wit in them which another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerns not, and see not those Errors which are evident to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd. Nor is this self-kindness more fatal to Men in their Writings, than in their Actions; every Man being a greater Flatterer to himself than he knows how to be to another; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were impossible that things of such distant Natures shou'd find their own Authors so equally kind in their affections to them, and Men so different in Parts and Virtues, should rest equally contented in their own Opinions.</p>
            <p>This Apprehension, added to that greater which I have of my own Weakness, may I hope incline the Reader to believe me, when I assure him that these Follies were made publick as much against my Inclination as Judgment: But being pursu'd with so many Sollicitations of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Herringman</hi>'s, and having receiv'd Civilities from him, if it were possible, exceeding his Importunities; I at last yielded to prefer that which he believ'd his Interest, before that which I apprehended my own Disadvantage: Considering withal, That he might pretend it would be a real Loss to him, and could be but an imaginary Prejudice to me; since things of this nature, though never so excellent or never so mean, have seldom prov'd the Foundation of Mens new-built Fortunes, or the Ruine of their old; it being the Fate of Poetry, though of no other good Parts, to be wholly separated from Interest; and there are few that know me but will easily believe I am not much concern'd in an unprofitable Reputation. This clear account I have given the
<pb facs="tcp:50420:3"/>
Reader of this seeming Contradiction, to offer that to the World which I dislike my self; and in all things I have no greater an ambition than to be believ'd a Person that would rather be unkind to my self, than ungrateful to others.</p>
            <p>I have made this excuse for my self, I offer none for my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but freely leave the Reader to condemn that which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd my Sentence already. Yet I shall presume to say something in the justification of our Nation's Plays, though not of my own; since in my Judgment, without being partial to my Country, I do really prefer our Plays as much before any other Nations, as I do the best of ours before my own.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Stage-Entertainments have differ'd in all Ages; and as it has encreas'd in use, it has enlarg'd it self in business: The general manner of Plays among the Ancients we find in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tragedies for serious Subjects, and in <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> for the Comical; in which latter we see some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Plots, though certainly short of what we have seen in some of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Johnson</hi>'s Plays; and for their Wit, especially <hi>Plautus,</hi> I suppose it suited much better in those days than it would do in ours; for were their Plays strictly Translated, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented on our Stage, they would hardly bring as many Audiences as they have now Admirers.</p>
            <p>The serious Plays were anciently compos'd of <hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Chorus's,</hi> where all things are related, but no matter of Fact presented on the Stage: This Pattern the <hi>French</hi> do at this time nearly follow, only leaving out the <hi>Chorus,</hi> making up their Plays with almost entire and discoursive Scenes, presenting the business in Relations: This way has very much affected some of our Nation, who possibly believe well of it more upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that what the <hi>French</hi> do, ought to be a Fashion, than upon the Reason of the thing.</p>
            <p>It is first necessary to consider why probably the Compositions of the Ancients, especially in their serious Plays, were after this manner; and it will be found, that the Subjects they commonly chose drove them upon the necessity, which were usually the most known Stories and Fables: Accordingly, <hi>Seneca</hi> making choice of <hi>Medea, Hippolytus,</hi> and <hi>Hercules Oetus;</hi> it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to shew <hi>Medea</hi> throwing old mangled <hi>Aeson</hi> into her Age-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Caldron, or to present the scattered Limbs of <hi>Hippolytus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50420:3"/>
upon the Stage, or shew <hi>Hercules</hi> burning upon his own Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pile: And this the Judicious <hi>Horace</hi> clearly speaks of in his <hi>Arte Poetica,</hi> where he says,</p>
            <lg>

               <l>Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius <hi>Atreus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Aut in avem <hi>Progne</hi> vertatur, <hi>Cadmus</hi> in anguem.</l>

            </lg>
            <p>So that it appears a fault to chuse such Subjects for the Stage, but much greater to affect that Method which those Subjects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force; and therefore the <hi>French</hi> seem much mistaken, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the necessity sometimes commit the Error; and this is as plainly decided by the same Author in his preceding words;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Aut agitur res in Scenis aut acta refertur:</l>
               <l>Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem;</l>
               <l>Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus &amp; quae</l>
               <l>Ipse sibi tradit spectator.—</l>
            </lg>
            <p>By which he directly declares his Judgment, That every thing makes more impression Presented than Related: Nor indeed can any one rationally assert the contrary; for if they affirm other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they do by consequence maintain, That a whole Play might be as well Related as Acted: Therefore whoever chuses a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that inforces him to Relations, is to blame; and he that does it without the necessity of the Subject, is much more.</p>
            <p>If these Premises be granted, 'tis no partiality to conclude, That our <hi>English</hi> Plays justly challenge the Preheminence; yet I shall as candidly acknowledge, That our best Poets have differed from other Nations (though not so happily) in usually mingling and interweaving Mirth and Sadness through the whole Course of their Plays, <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> only excepted, who keeps himself entire to one Argument; and I confess I am now convinc'd in my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That it is most proper to keep the Audience in one entire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position both of Concern and Attention; for when Scenes of so different Natures immediately succeed one another, 'tis probable the Audience may not so suddenly recollect themselves, as to start into an enjoyment of the Mirth, or into a concern for the Sadness: Yet I dispute not but the Variety of this World may afford pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:50420:4"/>
Accidents of such different Natures; but yet though possible in themselves to be, they may not be so proper to be Presented; an entire Connexion being the natural Beauty of all Plays, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Ornament to dress them in, which in serious Subjects ought to be great and easie, like a high-born Person that expresses Greatness without pride or affectation; the easier dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to flow in Comedy, yet separated from obsceneness, there being nothing more impudent than the immodesty of Words: Wit should be chast; and those that have it can only write well.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Si modo—</l>
               <l>Scimus in Urbanum Lepidose ponere dicto.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Another way of the Ancients which the <hi>French</hi> follow, and our Stage has now lately practis'd, is to write in Rhime; and this is the dispute betwixt many Ingenious Persons, Whether Verse in Rhime, or Verse without the sound, which may be called Blank Verse, (though a hard Expression) is to be preferred? But take the Question largely, and it is never to be decided, but by right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication I suppose it may; for in the general they are both proper, that is, one for a Play, the other for a Poem or Copy of Verses; a Blank Verse being as much too low for one, as Rhime is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural for the other: A Poem being a premeditated form of Thoughts upon design'd Occasions, ought not to he unfurnish'd of any harmony in Words or Sound: The other is presented as the present Effect of Accidents not thought of; so that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be equally proper to both these, unless it were possible that all Persons were born so much more than Poets, that Verses were not to be compos'd by them, but already made in them. Some may object, That this Argument is trivial, because, whatever is shew'd, 'tis known still to be but a Play; but such may as well excuse an ill Scene, that is not naturally painted, because they know 'tis only a Scene, and not really a City or Country.</p>
            <p>But there is yet another thing which makes Verse upon the Stage appear more unnatural; that is, when a Piece of a Verse is made up by one that knew not what the other meant to say, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Verse answered as perfectly in Sound as the last is supplied in Measure; so that the smartness of a Reply, which has its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by coming from sudden Thoughts, seems lost by that which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looks like a Design of two, than the Answer of one. It may be said, That Rhime is such a confinement to a quick and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
<pb facs="tcp:50420:4"/>
Phancy, that it gives a stop to its speed, till slow Judgment comes in to assist it; but this is no Argument for the Question in hand, for the dispute is not which way a Man may write best in, but which is most proper for the Subject he writes upon; and if this were let pass, the Argument is yet unresolv'd in it self; for he that wants Judgment in the liberty of his Phancy, may as well shew the defect of it in its Confinement; and to say truth, he that has Judgment will avoid the errors, and he that wants it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them both. It may be objected, 'Tis improbable that any should speak <hi>ex tempore</hi> as well as <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi> makes them, though in Blank Verse; I do not only acknowledg that, but that 'tis also improbable any will write so well that way; but if that may be allowed improbable, I believe it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded impossible that any should speak as good Verses in Rhime as the best Poets have writ; and therefore that which seems nearest to what it intends, is ever to be preferr'd: Nor are great Thoughts more adorned by Verse, than Verse unbeautified by mean ones; so that Verse seems not only unfit in the best use of it, but much more in the worse, when a Servant is call'd, or a Door bid to be shut in Rhime. Verses (I mean good ones) do in their height of Phancy declare the labour that brought them forth, like Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty that grows with care; and Nature that made the Poet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, seems to retire and leave its offers to be made perfect by Pains and Judgment: Against this I can raise no Argument but my Lord of <hi>Orory</hi>'s Writings, in whose Verse the Greatness of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty seems un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ullied with the Cares, and his unimitable Phancy descends to us in such easie Expressions, that they seem as if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ever been added to the other, but both together flowing from a height; like Birds got so high, that use no labouring Wings, but only with an easie care preserve a steddiness in Motion: But this particular Happiness, among those multitudes which that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Person is Owner of, does not convince my Reason, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Wonder: Yet I am glad such Verse has been writ for our Stage, since it has so happily exceeded those whom we seem'd to imitate. But while I give these Arguments against Verse, I may seem faulty that I have not only writ ill ones, but writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but since it was the fashion, I was resolv'd, as in all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, not to appear singular, the danger of the Vanity being greater than the Error; and therefore I followed it as a Fashion, though very far off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50420:5"/>For the <hi>Italian</hi> Plays, I have seen some of them which have been given me as the best; but they are so inconsiderable, that the Particulars of them are not at all worthy to entertain the Reader; but as much as they are short of others in this, they exceed in their other Performances on the Stage; I mean their <hi>Opera</hi>'s, which consisting of Musick and Painting, there's none but will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is much harder to equal them in that way, than 'tis to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them in the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Plays pretend to more, but indeed are not much, being nothing but so many Novels put into Acts and Scenes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least attempt or design of making the Reader more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd than a well-told Tale might do; whereas a Poet that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not to heighten the Accidents which Fortune seems to scatter in a well-knit Design, had better have told his tale by a Fire-side, than presented it on a Stage.</p>
            <p>For these times wherein we write, I admire to hear the Poets so often cry out upon, and wittily (as they believe) threaten their Judges, since the effects of their Mercy have so much exceeded their Justice, that others with me cannot but remember how many favourable Audiences some of our ill Plays have had; and when I consider how severe the former age has been to some of the best of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Johnson</hi>'s never to be equal'd Comedies, I cannot but wonder why any Poet should speak of former times, but rather acknowledge that the want of Abilities in this Age is largely supply'd with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it. I deny not but there are some who resolve to like no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing; and such perhaps are not unwise, since by that general reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they may be certainly in the right sometimes, which perhaps they would seldom be, if they should venture their Understandings in different Censures; and being forc'd to a general liking or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking, lest they should discover too much their own Weakness, 'tis to be expected they would rather chuse to pretend to Judgment than good Nature, tho' I wish they could find better ways to shew either.</p>
            <p>But I forget my self, not considering, That while I entertain the Reader in the Entrance with what a good Play should be, when he is come beyond the Entrance he must be treated with what ill Plays are: but in this I resemble the greatest part of the World, that better know how to talk of things than to perform them, and live short of their own Discourses.</p>
            <p>And now I seem like an eager Hunter, that has long pursu'd a Chase after an inconsiderable Quarry, and gives over weary, as I do.</p>

                     <l>TO cheat the most Judicious Eyes, there be</l>
                     <l>Ways in all Trades, but this of Poetry:</l>
                     <l>Your Tradesman shews his Ware by some false Light,</l>
                     <l>To hide the Faults, and slightness from your Sight.</l>
                     <l>Nay, though 'tis full of Bracks, he'll boldly swear</l>
                     <l>'Tis excellent, and so help off his Ware.</l>
                     <l>He'll rule your Judgment by his Confidence,</l>
                     <l>Which in a Poet you'd call Impudence;</l>
                     <l>Nay, if the World afford the like again,</l>
                     <l>He swears he'll give it you for nothing then:</l>
                     <l>Those are words too a Poet dares not say;</l>
                     <l>Let it be good or bad, you'r sure to pay.</l>
                     <l>—Wou'd 'twere a pen'worth;—but in this you are</l>
                     <l>Abler to judge than he that made the Ware:</l>
                     <l>However his design was well enough,</l>
                     <l>He try'd to shew some newer fashion'd Stuff.</l>
                     <l>Not that the name Committee can be new,</l>
                     <l>That has been too well known to most of you:</l>
                     <l>But you may smile, for you have past your doom;</l>
                     <l>The Poet dares not, his is still to come.</l>

                        <l>Well, to begin then, You must alter your posture,</l>
                        <l>And by your grave and high demeanour make your self</l>
                        <l>Appear a hole above <hi>Obadiah;</hi> lest your Mistress</l>
                        <l>Should take you for such another scribble scrabble as he is,</l>
                        <l>And always hold up your head as if it were</l>
                        <l>Bolster'd up with high matters, your hands join'd</l>
                        <l>Flat together, projecting a little beyond the rest of your</l>
                        <l>Body as ready to separate when you begin to open.</l>

                        <l>Accident; keep your posture so, and when you come</l>
                        <l>Just to me, start like a Horse that has spy'd</l>
                        <l>Something on one side of him, and give a little gird</l>
                        <l>Out of the way on a sudden; declaring that you</l>
                        <l>Did not see her before, by reason of your deep</l>

                        <l>A rich Heir of one of the Cavalier Party, came up also in,</l>

                        <l>Has a notable pate of her own; you all know her;</l>
                        <l>Presently cast about to get her for my Son <hi>Abel;</hi>
                        </l>

                        <l>For taking up Arms; but in his Opinion for the King:</l>
                        <l>He has left his Widow with Child, which will</l>
                        <l>Be the Heir; and his Trustees complain of wrong,</l>

                  <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
                  <l>PRologues, like Forlorn-hopes, first face the Stage,</l>
                  <l>Before the main Battalions do engage:</l>
                  <l>Just so our Poet, doubtful of the day,</l>
                  <l>Ventures his Prologue first, and next his Play.</l>
                  <l>But stay, I fancy that I hear one call;</l>
                  <l>I'll step but to the door, and tell you all.</l>
                  <l>'Troth 'tis the Poet's Voice, now danger's near;</l>
                  <l>He sends me back as his Commissioner,</l>
                  <l>To treat that he might fairly march away,</l>
                  <l>If you wou'd be content to have no Play.</l>
                  <l>He offers fair: Shou'd it prove very bad,</l>
                  <l>As like enough it will, you'd wish you had:</l>
                  <l>He has been wounded, proofs there need no more</l>
                  <l>Than what you know, that he has writ before;</l>
                  <l>For sure none ever scap'd that ever writ;</l>
                  <l>There's no being shot-free in the Wars of Wit:</l>
                  <l>Poets by dangers like old Souldiers taught,</l>
                  <l>Grow wise, and shun the fame which once they sought.</l>
                  <l>But if he must proceed—</l>
                  <l>Wou'd you wou'd tell him which of all the ways</l>
                  <l>You like in Prologues, us'd to help out Plays.</l>
                  <l>Some tell you stories of the former Age,</l>
                  <l>And swear that Faction now undoes the Stage;</l>
                  <l>Sure such believe you'll do as you are bid,</l>
                  <l>And that you paid your money to be chid.</l>
                  <l>Some craftier Poets at each other hit,</l>
                  <l>Knowing grave Rudeness has been took for Wit;</l>
                  <l>This does a wretched dearth of Wit betray,</l>
                  <l>When things of Kind on one another prey.</l>
                  <l>Some Prologues are more modestly address'd,</l>
                  <l>Just like Petitions, those he thinks are best;</l>
                  <l>For such a one he means that this shall be,</l>
                  <l>And therefore <hi>humbly shews</hi> as you shall see.</l>

                  <l>This walks about, and cries 'twill never take:</l>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Cannot plead the usual Excuse for Publishing this <hi>Trisle,</hi> which is commonly the Subject of most <hi>Prefaces,</hi> by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it upon the Importunity of Friends; for, I confess, I was my self willing, at the first Desire of Mr. <hi>Herringman,</hi> to Print it: not for any great Opinion that I had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, but for the Opinion that others were pleas'd to express; which being told me by some Friends, I was concern'd to let the World judge what subject matter of Offence was contain'd in it: Some were pleas'd to believe, little of it mine: but they are both obliging to me, though perhaps not intentionally; the last, by thinking there was any thing in it that was worth so ill design'd an Envy, as to place it to another <hi>Author:</hi> The others (perhaps, the best bred <hi>Informers</hi>) by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their Displeasures towards me, since I most gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have received some Advantage in the Opinion of the sober part of the World, by the loss of theirs.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Subject,</hi> I came accidentally to write upon it; for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman brought a <hi>Play</hi> to the <hi>King's Company,</hi> call'd, <hi>The Duke of LERMA;</hi> and by them I was desired to peruse it, and return my Opinion, whether I thought it fit for the <hi>Stage:</hi> After I had read it, I acquainted them, that in my Judgment it would not be of much Use for such a Design, since the Contrivance scarce would merit the Name of a <hi>Plot;</hi> and some of that, assisted by a Disguise; and it ended abruptly: and on the Person of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                     </hi> there was fix'd such a mean Character, and on the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> such a vitious one, that I cou'd not but judge it unfit to be presented by any that had a Respect, not only to Princes, but indeed to either Man or Woman; and about that time, being to go into the Country, I was perswaded by Mr. <hi>Hart</hi> to make it my Diversion there, that so great a Hint might not be lost, as the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> saving himself in his last Extremity, by his unexpected Disguise, which is as well in the true Story as the old <hi>Play;</hi> and besides that and the <hi>Names,</hi> my altering the most part of the <hi>Characters,</hi> and the whole <hi>Design,</hi> made me uncapable to use much more; though perhaps writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with higher Stile and Thoughts, than I cou'd attain to.</p>
                  <p>I intend not to trouble my self nor the World any more in such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but take my leave of these my too long Acquaintances; since that little Fancy and Liberty I once enjoy'd, is now fetter'd in Business of more unpleasant Natures; yet were I free to apply my Thoughts as my
<pb facs="tcp:50420:108"/>
own Choice directed them; I should hardly again venture into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars of Censures.</p>
                  <q>Ubi—Nullos habitura Triumphos.</q>
                  <p>In the next place, I must ingenuously confess, that the manner of <hi>Plays,</hi> which now are in most esteem, is beyond my power to perform; nor do I condemn in the least any thing of what Nature soever that pleases; since nothing cou'd appear to me a ruder Folly, than to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Satisfaction of others: I rather blame the unnecessary Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of some that have labour'd to give strict Rules to Things that are not Mathematical, and with such eagerness, pursuing their own seeming Reasons, that at last we are to apprehend such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative <hi>Poets</hi> will grow as strict as <hi>Sancho Panco</hi>'s Doctor was to our very Appetites; for in the difference of <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> and of <hi>Farce</hi> it self, there can be no determination but by the Taste; nor in the manner of their Composure; and who ever wou'd endeavour to like or dislike by the Rules of others, he will be as unsuccessful, as if he should try to be perswaded into a power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; not what he must, but what others direct him to believe.</p>
                  <p>But I confess, 'tis not necessary for <hi>Poets</hi> to study strict Reason, since they are so us'd to a greater Latitude than is allow'd by that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Inquisition; that they must infringe their own Jurisdiction, to profess themselves oblig'd to argue well: I will not therefore pretend to say, why I writ this <hi>Play;</hi> some <hi>Scenes</hi> in blank Verse, others in Rhime, since I have no better a Reason to give than Chance, which waited upon my present Fancy; and I expect no better a Reason from any ingenious person, than his Fancy for which he best relishes.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore but beg leave of the <hi>Reader,</hi> to take a little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the great pains the <hi>Author</hi> of an <hi>Essay</hi> of <hi>Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>este</hi> has taken, to prove <hi>Rhime</hi> as natural in a serious <hi>Play,</hi> and more effectual than <hi>blank Verse:</hi> Thus he states the Question, but pursues that which he calls <hi>Natural</hi> in a wrong Application; for 'tis not the Question, whether <hi>Rhime</hi> or not <hi>Rhime,</hi> be best, or most Natural for a grave and serious Subject; but what is nearest the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that which it presents. Now after all the Endeavours of that ingenious Person, a <hi>Play</hi> will still be supposed to be a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of several Persons speaking <hi>ex tempore;</hi> and 'tis as certain, that good <hi>Verses</hi> are the hardest things that can be imagin'd to be so spoken; so that if any will be pleas'd to impose the Rule of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring things to be the best, by being nearest Nature; it is granted by consequence, that which is most remote from the thing supposed, must needs be most improper; and therefore I may justly say, that both I and the Question were equally mistaken; for I do own, I had rather read good <hi>Verses,</hi> than either <hi>blank Verse</hi> or <hi>Prose,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Author</hi> did himself injury, if he like <hi>Verse</hi> so well in <hi>Plays,</hi> to lay down Rules to raise <hi>Arguments,</hi> only unanswerable against himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50420:108"/>But the same <hi>Author</hi> being fill'd with the Precedents of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> writing their <hi>Plays</hi> in <hi>Verse,</hi> commends the thing, and assures us that our <hi>Language</hi> is <hi>Noble, Full,</hi> and <hi>Significant;</hi> charging all Defects upon the ill placing of Words, and proves it by quoting <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> loftily expressing such an ordinary thing, as, <hi>Shutting a Door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Reserate clusos Regii postes Laris.</q>
                  <p>I suppose he was himself highly affected with the sound of these Words, but to have compleated his <hi>Dictates</hi> together with his <hi>Arguments,</hi> he should have oblig'd us, by Charming our Ears with such an Art of placing <hi>Words</hi> as in an <hi>English Verse</hi> to express so loftily the <hi>Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Door,</hi> that we might have been as much affected with the sound of his Words. This, instead of being an <hi>Argument</hi> upon the <hi>Question</hi> rightly stated, is an Attempt, to prove that nothing may seem something, by the help of a <hi>Verse,</hi> which I easily grant to be the Ill fortune of it; and therefore the <hi>Question</hi> being so much mistaken, I wonder to see that <hi>Author</hi> trouble himself twice about it, with such an absolute Triumph declared by his own Imagination. But I have heard that a Gentleman in <hi>Parliament,</hi> going to speak twice, and being interrupted by another <hi>Member,</hi> as against the Orders of the <hi>House,</hi> he was excused by a Third, assuring the <hi>House</hi> he had not yet spoken to the Question.</p>
                  <p>But if we examine the general Rules laid down for Plays by strict Reason, we shall find the Errours equally gross; for the great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is laid to build upon is nothing, as it is generally stated; which will appear upon the examination of the particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, We are told the Plot should not be so ridiculously contriv'd, as to croud two several Countries into one Stage; secondly, to cramp the Accidents of many years or days into the representation of two hours and a half: And lastly, a Conclusion drawn, that the only remaining dispute is concerning time, whether it should be contain'd in twelve, or four and twenty hours, and the place to be limited to the spot of ground, either in Town or City, where the Play is suppos'd to begin; And this is call'd nearest to Nature: For that is concluded most natural, which is most probable, and nearest to that which it presents.</p>
                  <p>I am so well pleas'd with any ingenious offers, as all these are, that I should not examine this strictly, did not the confidence of others force me to it; there being not any thing more unreasonable to my Judgment, than the attempt to infringe the Liberty of Opinion by Rules so little demostrative.</p>
                  <p>To shew therefore upon what ill grounds they dictate Laws for <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Poesie,</hi> I shall endeavour to make it evident, that there's no such thing as what they all pretend; for, if strictly and duly weigh'd, 'tis as impossible for one Stage to present two Houses, or two Rooms truly, as two Countreys or Kingdoms; and as impossible that five hours, or four and twenty hours should be two hours and a half, as that a thousand hours or years should be less than what they are; or the greatest part of time to be comprehended in the less; for all being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, they are none of them nearest the truth, or nature, of what
<pb facs="tcp:50420:109"/>
they present, for Impossibilities are all equal, and admit no degrees: and then if all those Poets that have so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ervently labour'd to give Rules as Maximes, would but be pleased to abbreviate, or endure to hear their Reasons reduc'd into one strict definition, it must be, that there are degrees in impossibilities, and that many things which are not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, may yet be more or less impossible; and from this proceed to give Rules to observe the least absurdity in things which are not at all.</p>
                  <p>I suppose I need not trouble the Reader with so impertinent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to attempt a farther Confutation of such ill-grounded Reasons, than thus by opening the true state of the Case, nor do I design to make any farther use of it, than from hence to draw this modest Conclusion, That I would have all attempts of this nature be submitted to the fancy of others, and bear the name of Propositions, not of Confident Laws, or Rules made by Demonstration; and then I shall not discommend any Poet that dresses his Play in such a fashion as his fancy best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves; and fairly leave it for others to follow, if it appears to them most convenient, and fullest of Ornament.</p>
                  <p>But writing this Epistle in so much haste, I had almost forgot one Argument, or Observation, which that Author has most good fortune in; It is in his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory,</hi> before his <hi>Essay</hi> of <hi>Dramatick Poesie;</hi> where, speaking of Rhyme in Plays, he desires it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, That none are violent against it, but such as have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, or who have succeeded ill in the attempt; which as to my self and him I easily acknowledge; for I confess none has written in that way better than himself, nor few worse than I: Yet, I hope, he is so ingenuous, that he would not wish this Argument should extend further than to him and Me; for if it should be received as a good one, all <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> would find a readier way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation than they yet have done, of any that should oppose the least Thesis or Definition, by saying, they were denied by none but such as never attempted to write, or succeeded ill in the attempt.</p>
                  <p>Thus as I am one that am extreamly well pleas'd with most of the <hi>Propositions,</hi> which are ingeniously laid down in that Essay, for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Stage; so I am also always concern'd for the true honour of Reason, and would have no spurious Issue Father'd upon her. Fancy may be allow'd her wantonness; but Reason is always pure and chast: and as it resembles the Sun, in making all things clear, it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles it in its several Positions, when it shines in full height, and directly ascendant over any Subject, it leaves but little shadow; But when descended and grown low, its oblique shining renders the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow larger than the substance, and gives the deceiv'd person a wrong measure of his own proportion.</p>
                  <p>Thus begging the <hi>Reader's</hi> Excuse for this seeming Impertinency, I submit what I have written to the liberty of his unconfin'd Opinion, which is all the favour I ask of others to afford to me.</p>

                  <l>MUch injur'd Gentlemen, may you now please,</l>
                  <l>You true Committee of such Grievances,</l>
                  <l>Kindly to hear me now, and I will show it,</l>
                  <l>We have been all ill us'd, by this days Poet.</l>
                  <l>'Tis our joint Cause; I know you in your hearts</l>
                  <l>Hate serious Plays, as I do serious Parts,</l>
                  <l>To trouble us with Thoughts and State-designs,</l>
                  <l>A melancholy Plot ty'd with strong Lines,</l>
                  <l>I had not the least Part to day you see,</l>
                  <l>Troth, he has neither writ for you, nor me;</l>
                  <l>You are not hard to please; though a Poet scarce</l>
                  <l>Can make a Play, yet he might make a Farce,</l>
                  <l>With small ridiculous things to stuff it full,</l>
                  <l>And make you pay to laugh, not to be dull.</l>
                  <l>Henceforth, against all sad and grave intregues,</l>
                  <l>We'll make Offensive, and Defensive Leagues;</l>
                  <l>And for all those that dare write Tragedy,</l>
                  <l>We'll make a Law, with a huge Penalty;</l>
                  <l>And yet few Poets so much Wealth possess,</l>
                  <l>Or Wit, where you might levy a Distress;</l>
                  <l>Let the grave Poets then trouble but few,</l>
                  <l>Write Elegies on Men, which few Men knew,</l>
                  <l>And few perhaps will read; or let 'em write</l>
                  <l>Rhimes for the Bell-man, to be spoke at night.</l>
                  <l>This Poet may be pardon'd, lest it be said</l>
                  <l>You did condemn before the Law was made;</l>
                  <l>I mean, if's Play be good, I tell you True,</l>
                  <l>He thinks it is, but pray now, What think you?</l>
