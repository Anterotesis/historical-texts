            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME FEW AND SHORT Conſiderations On the preſent Diſtempers; By J. P.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He tie which I have as an honeſt man, and the right which I have as a free man, of ſpeaking what I think conducible to the weale publike, hath invited me in the crowd of others who blot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Commodare vocem, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare operam, et  ſi nihil profuturam forſan, conaturam tamen prodeſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> and in the Exigents which now preſſe us, to commend to all men, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the wiſdom of our great Councell, theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we having at preſent a Commonwealth, in which, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nihil mali eſt, nihil adverſi, quod non boni metuunt improbi expectant,</hi> and matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now reduc'd to that extream article of time, on which depends miſery or proſperity, that they would be pleas'd with one eye to look up to His Majeſties gracious inclinations, his readineſſe for, may his deſire of any honorable tranſaction, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to no greater latitude nor altitude of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:130503:2"/>
then what his Anceſtors (as he conceives) enjoy'd actually or virtually; with the other to look down to the ground they ſtand on, the depth of that precipice, on the skirt of which they (and in them the Commonwealth) are, to remember that of an Ancient;<note place="margin">Prudent.</note>
            </p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>—Sciſſura domeſtica turbat</l>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Though the Propoſitions be not in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as they wiſh, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (a thing expedient, and ſutable, not to policie onely, but Chriſtianity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11.) eſpecially to weigh well that of the ſame <hi>Cicero, Omnis pax bello civili utilior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what probability or rather poſsibility there is of recovering <hi>Ireland,</hi> if the time to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the reſtitution of it be expended in the compoſing of our own diſtractions, the monies for that Countries relief be exhauſted in the protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of civil diſcord, and the perſons who ſhould quell Rebellion abroad, be miniſters in a war at home here. And if that Kingdom ſhould be loſt, in what ſtate this would be, in how deſperate, how deplorable a condition, how unable long to defend it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the Votes of whatſoever they paſſe, though in a compleat body, without His Majeſties ratification, be doubted whether efficacious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, how much rather then, when that body (as at preſent) is ſo mutilate and defective, as not to want the head, but ſo many Members too. What ſome Books have, <hi>Quod major pars curiae effecit, pro eo habetur ac ſi omnes egerint,</hi> I confeſſe is true, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130503:2"/>
(among other reſtrictions it receives) is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a full Aſſembly, or where who are not preſent, are abſent <hi>Reipublicae cauſa,</hi> (a thing held ever equivalent to appearance perſonall) or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome other caſualties and emergents, not where there is a deliberate ſeparation out of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, a contrariety of ſenſe, a Schiſme (as here too viſibly) and of perſons in quality and number ſo conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what hath reference to <hi>Hull,</hi> that they would vouchſafe to have in minde, that the Axe is now laid to the root of the tree, (a tree in the foreſt of this Iland not the leaſt conſiderable:) ſqueez'd and extorted things in the commerce of life are not welcome to us: what willingly we accept of, muſt come willingly; how much better then to leave that place rather upon demand, then by violence, to make the reſtitution of it a work of election, then of neceſſity, eſpecially having thoſe inducements, His Majeſties formerly being ſeized of it, and his preſent full pardon to all within it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, for the <hi>Commiſsions of Array</hi> on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties part, and the <hi>Militia</hi> on theirs, they being in the Theory (in a well-ordered ſtate) inconſiſtent, but in the practique part (the wretched condition we now are in) to a Commonwealth utterly deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, his Majeſtie (at leaſt what concerns the ſafety of the time preſent, the thing which in theſe immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent calamities chiefly is to be lookt at) hath ſhewn a ready way to end that controverſie, by declaring that he will lay his preparations of War aſide, if they pleaſe to do ſo. If this be aſſented to, the only
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:130503:3"/>
thing diſputable in this main particular, is, who ſhould firſt begin; which, whether it become him or them to do, as for matter of fact to their will and wiſdom, ſo for matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is left to every prudent man to conſider of.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, for the <hi>Navie;</hi> if his Maieſtie (as I hope no Subject will doubt) be Lord of the Seas circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, it might follow (and by no ſtretch'd infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) that he is Lord alſo of the Ships that walk on them. By <hi>Lord</hi> here, is underſtood, not he who hath <hi>directum,</hi> but <hi>utile dominium,</hi> a power in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like occaſions to command, and to diſpoſe of them. By <hi>Ships,</hi> not onely his own, (a thing before theſe rimes never controverted) are meant, but thoſe of any of his Subjects. <hi>Solo</hi> (as ſome ſpeak) <hi>ſuperficies cedit,</hi> a building, though of another mans, on my ground, paſſeth into my propriety. And though the ſolidity of earth being ſo contrary as it is to the inſtability of that other element, the authority may to ſome ſeem not ſo fitly alleadg'd, by way of Analogie however it is appliable, and by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>a fortiori,</hi> we may make uſe of it; for here no Subjects Ships, but the Kings own are treated of, the veſſels not which any common ſtock built, but His private Treaſury, and conſequently ſeem no leſſe his then the cloak he wears.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, what concerns theſe preſent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which carry a face of war with them, (no man entertaining ſuch purpoſes, but he ſits down firſt, and conſulteth whether he be able with 10 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, to meet him that cometh againſt him with 20 thouſand) that they would likewiſe vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130503:3"/>
ſeriouſly to conſider whether competent and equall forces can be levied.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, If leavyed, what aſſurance there is that they will be as valiant in the field, as in the Pallace-Yard at Weſtminſter; as conſtant in a pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, as in the Streets of <hi>London.</hi> A ſmooth and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oration may convert them. <hi>Friends, Covntrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, fellow-ſubjects,</hi> and ſuch loving Compellations, may work ſtrange changes in them; ſo mutable things alwayes having been multitudes: reflecting on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> may ſtir up a quicker ſenſe in them then before they had, make them enter into a neerer diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the juſtneſſe of that they ſtand for, and of the legality of that cauſe they appear in. Paſſages of theſe kindes are in Story frequent: And though none of theſe; when they ſhall ſee their undoubted and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Soveraign in the head of an adverſe Army, ſhooting forth Rayes of Majeſty, and thundering out a <hi>Durum eſt contra ſtimulos calcitrare,</hi> what man can promiſe that they will not be appall'd, dazled, blinded? That their hearts will not fayl, and their weapons fall, both in one inſtant? Their hands which were expected to fight, not be held up for pardon, and thoſe knees in the ſtrength<note place="margin">Robur in genibus.</note> of which it was thought they would have marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will not tremble, not knock each other, and bow for mercy?</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If God in his unſcrutable providence, and uncontrollable counſells, ſhould deliver this Kingdom up unto ſuch extremities, how miſerable that Warre would be, which would make us a ſpectacle to men and Angels, a prey to our ſelves at home, an obloquie to thoſe about us; and where who ever remains Victor, muſt of neceſſity want that honour which Antiquity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130503:4"/>
did ſo triumph in, I mean, that which commonly it ſtil'd, <hi>Obſervatos cives.</hi> By the memory of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed peace maker who reſts in Paradiſe, by ſeventeen continued yeers of his Sons Raign, ſpotted with no act of Tyranny, By the numerous and remarkable deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances God hath heap'd upon this our Iſland, By the ſtrength and vigour of the love they bear to the ſafety of their own perſons, the tenderneſſe they juſtly have over thoſe neer pledges, their wives and children (who all in the common Fate will be involved inevitably) ſuffer themſelves, that honourable and great Councell, to be in ſome meaſure conjur'd to convert their deſigns of War into the delights of peace, not to cut aſunder this Gordian knot of our diſtempers with the ſword, but to undo it by milder counſells, and in ſtead of that univerſall deſolation which like a Meteor hangs over us, to conſerve us in our ancient poſſeſſions of ſecurity and of ſerenity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For the intervall which hath divided his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty from them (and in them from all of us) ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, ſo continuedly, though it have not been (God be thanked) like the gulf in the Goſpel, ſo great, that they who would paſſe from hence thither, could not, nor they paſſe to us, that would come from thence; yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this diſtance of his, this reſentment, we live in a kinde of twi-light, a cloudy and foggie clime of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uncertainty, in which (if in no other) regard, whatſoever may induce him to draw neerer; O let us embrace with cheerfulnes, &amp; purſue with induſtry. His Majeſty, like a Royall Dove, in a former return of his from the North parts of his Dominions brought us back an Olive-Branch, a token of peace with our Neighbours, and their reconcilement to us; an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:130503:4"/>
that the Torrent which had ſwollen high, was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and dryed up; if readily and humbly he be comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within his now-propoſalls, his next return hither will bring better tidings, That the waters of his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure are abated, a deluge more formidable then that other, to loyall and obedient hearts (ſuch as we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to have) it being more dreadfull to ſuffer under the indignation of their own Soveraign, then to periſh by the inundation of hoſtility; this (I ſay) this onely Conſideration (like a parch'd ſoyl for rain) ſhould make us all thirſt for his return to us: but there is more beſides in it; for had wee the <hi>warmth</hi> againe of that <hi>Sun</hi> to bask in, that we ſhould have <hi>Gods bleſsing</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, we need not doubt. God in the riches of his goodneſſe confer this on us, that after this ſad rupture, both ſides into one body united, may choke (like a maſſy gobbet) any adverſary who ſhall attempt to ſwallow them, &amp; as a peec'd arrow (now made the ſtronger) they may flye againſt a common enemy more effectually.</p>
            <p>Such is the weak, but hearty and moſt humble aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which in ſtead of Plate, Money and Horſes, is preſented, if not from the head of an able man, from the heart (at leaſt) of an honeſt man, one whom no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of poſſible private loſſes (regard had to the mediocrity of that condition wherein God hath placed him, hee having as little to part with as hath any man) no by-reſpect of advancing his peculiar intereſt, nor adulation of Monarchique power hath mov'd in this way to ſpeak himſelf, (it having been ſtill his courſe, and he reſolving it ſhall ever be, <hi>Inter abruptam contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciam et deforme obſequium iter pergere,</hi> and never by<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> ſiniſter &amp; indirect means to gain either the leaſt or the greateſt preferments) but a lively and deep ſenſe of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:130503:5"/>
common danger, a foul labouring with Anxiety from the juſt and too certain eſtimate of impendent ruine. If what he offers, as to the generall, ſo in particular to the conſideration of that High Aſſembly ſeeme to be tendred by an obſcure hand, he humbly deſires them to remember that when a wrack is imminent even the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt contribution of help is not deprived, and for the quenching of a beginning fire, even the vileſt hands are not thought unuſeful. If lamely &amp; in an unpoliſhed way it have fallen from him, it may by a favourable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be eſteemed therefore the more cordiall, and in that regard only find acceptance. Endeavours of ſpeech in infants, and their inarticulate ſounds, are commonly more operative, on the parent then the language of his elder children, ſtir up his affections more powerfully, vehemently, efficaciouſly, and leave an impreſſion in him above all eloquence. And our devotions are moſt deare to God, moſt accepted, not when they are pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of words and admit vocalitie, but when the ſpirit makes interceſſion with grones that are unexpreſſable.
