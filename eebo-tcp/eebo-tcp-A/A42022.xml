            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY dear Brethren and Beloved Sisters in the pure, holy and heavenly Relation, who are sons and daughters of one Father, and heirs of one Kingdom, begotten through the one Eternal Word of Life, which lives and abides for ever; With the salutation of my dearest love do I greet you all, and with strong and vehement desires to the Lord, do I wish, that love and life, joy and peace, grace and mercy may be multiplied among you all, to the filling of every of your earthen Vessels, to the refreshing of every weary soul, and to the making glad of every sorrowful heart among you.</p>
            <p>I hope (my dearly beloved) you are not forgetful of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful kind Love of our God, which he manifested to us in the day of our visitation, how he sought us out that were as lost sheep going astray, that he might bring us unto himself, who is the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, how he took us as perforce from our Lovers, that our hearts and affections might be set upon him, and that our souls might love him above all; how he broke us, that he might bind us up; how he blinded us, that he might make us see; how he wounded us, that he might heal us; how he impoverished us, that he might make us rich; how he weakned us, that he might make us strong: and how he proved and cryed us as gold that is seven times tryed in the fire; that we might finally become his Jewels; though then we knew not whether that we should become Vessels of honor or dishonor: And since that day of blessed Visitation, how hath his endlesse love abounded towards us! how plentifully hath his Wisdom and Power been manifested amongst us! And what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43188:3"/>
wonderful things have we seen him since bring to passe by the Arm of his Power, not onely to our admiration, but also to the astonishment of his Enemies: And oh! how hath he brought down Principalities, and shaken powers inwardly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! how hath he overturned, overturned that which hath been exalted inwardly and outwardly that that which hath been aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, might be exalted! how hath he confounded the wisdom of the wise, and brought the understanding of the Prudent to nothing! how hath he scattered them that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and not by him, that he might gather that which was scattered from him! Oh the Wonders that he hath wrought in the Earth, they are innumerable! And the noble acts that he hath done in the Earth, who can declare them to the utmost? Neverthelesse, we will be speaking of them (when thereunto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his spirit) that we thereby may shew forth his praise, who through his making us Witnesses of them, hath made truly glad our hearts and souls, which have cause to rejoice in him, notwithstanding his trying of us with many tryals, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of us through many temptations and tribulations, vvhich many have been exercised in; and that divers manner of vvays. Yet let us not faint, nor let slip the confidence that vve have in him; for as certain as vve have seen his Wonders in the Earth, so certainly hath he vvrought several of them for good towards us; and as certainly as he hath dealt gently and favourably vvith us, so assuredly hath he loved us: And as certainly as his glorious Work is begun in the Earth, so assuredly will he make known his Name and Povver even unto the ends of the Earth: And as certainly as his adversaries oppose him and his Truth, so assuredly shall they be broken as the potsherds of the Earth; and as certainly as his lambs and babes novv mourn and are aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted, so assuredly shall they rejoice and be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And as certainly as the Wicked are novv set up, so assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall they fall: And as certainly as iniquity abounds, so assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly shall it have an end: And as certainly as the name of the Lord is blasphemed and dishonored, so assuredly shall it be glorified and exalted in the earth: And as certainly as Gods Truth is now trampled upon, and rejected by thousands, so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly shall it be advanced and received by ten thousands; and though my eye should not see the fulfilling of these things, yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43188:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will rejoice, and do rejoice in the Testimony that J have, that these things shall come to pass. And my soul inviteth you (my dear brethren and sisters) to come and rejoice with me in the assurance which God giveth us of the certainty of these things, which shal as certainly be fulfilled, as it is certain that the things before mentioned are come to pass since the Lord omnipotent first visited us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (my dearly beloved) look not out at the present blackness and darkness which represents it self upon the face of the Earth, by reason of the many clouds which hang over the Earth: But look at the Day-star which is a risen in your hearts, which precedes the sons of righteousness, which though he yet seem to be darkned, yet as certainly as the Lord <hi>Iehovah</hi> is in the highest Heavens, so assuredly shall this Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness arise, and shine gloriously in the hearts of the sons of men; and then shall just Judgement be set up in the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof they shall learn righteousness; then shal Wickedness and Oppression have an end, Cruelty and Tyranny shall have no place, and Deceit and Unrighteousness shall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Works and Workers of iniquity shall go to decay: And then shall the joyful song of deliverance be sung by the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed ones of the Lord; then shall the voice of joy and gladness be heard in our Land; then shall babes and sucklings learn the song of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the sons and daughters of the Most High shall make a heavenly pleasant melody, and great wil be the joy and delight of the Lords chosen, even such, as that their present suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings shall not be worthy to be compared to the same.</p>
            <p>Therefore O ye my suffering Friends, be ye comforted, be ye comforted of the Lord, and comfort ye one another with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance which God hath given unto some of his servants, of the certainty of these things coming to pass, of which I believe some of you wil be eye-witnesses, and partakers with the Saints in Light; and my confidence is, That neither principalities nor powers shall be able to deprive you thereof, though they should be permitted to deprive you of your liberty, of your estates, and of the society of Friends: And if your Heavenly Father should suffer such things to come to pass for the trial of your precious Faith, be not ye therefore dejected, as if you were altogether left comfortless, and should so perpetually remain; For I testifie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43188:4"/>
unto you, That our Heavenly Father hath re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erved enough in store, not onely to comfort you withal in this life, but also in the life to come.</p>
            <p>And now therefore as a servant of the Lord God to you all (who writes these things with tears unto you) do I in his Name beseech you to be faithful and obedient, quiet and peaceable children, behaving your selves as Lambs, or as new-born babes in his sight in this generation, lest you should provoke him through your disobedience, by being unfaithful and unquiet in his house; and they that are, or become so, they must be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and shut out too, among them that are without,—without love, faith, hope, peace, comfort and refreshment, in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate state, where the rents, schisms, strivings, divisions, envyings and hatings are, which are the fruits which they produce that go out from the Spirit, in which love, joy, and everlasting peace is. Therefore I exhort and beseech you all, to walk together in this one Spirit, to meet together to serve the Lord in this one Spirit, that you may be like-minded, &amp; that the fruits of it may abound in and among you plenteously, to the glory of him that hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited you with the day-spring from on high, and hath opened a Fountain for you, and hath prepared a Feast of fat things for you, and withal a rest for your weary souls.</p>
            <p>Wherefore faint not in the day of your adversity, lest your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies vaunt themselves, as if your God would not preserve you in unity, love, peace &amp; patience, in which you had need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, lest that the Enemy within or without, should get an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against you, which might easily be, if prejudice should be permitted to have place in any of you one against another; &amp; thereby might the Lord be provoked to jealousie against you. And therefore above all things, let brotherly love continue, that through your love to the Father, one to another, &amp; to all men, it may evidently appear that you are of your Father the Lord <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> who is love, and who delights in love and mercy, both which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

which in your hearts in measure you have felt: Oh dear friends, let the eye of your minds be alwayes fixed and fastened upon the same, even upon that in which the God and Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies hath so exceeding largely extended himself unto you, and in which he hath abundantly appeared in the manifestation of his loving kindness towards you, in begetting you again which were strayed, and in gathering you that were scattered afar off, and lost from him, and in raising you up to be a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that were not his people, and in begetting you to be his children, that were sometimes strangers, and in the alienation; and all this hath he done for you of his own good wil, in the riches of his free grace, when there was no worthiness at all in you, even when you were wallowing in your filth, when you were in your blood, &amp; no eye pittied you, even that was the time of his Love.

And tender Friends, and little ones, I exhort you in the Name and fear of the Lord, to watch against, and to be aware of suffering any root of bitterness to spring up amongst you, or of harbouring any prejudice one against another; but in that Spirit of Love dwel, which thinks no evil, nor is not easily provoked; for that which gives offence, and that which takes the offence, is one, and comes from the same old root of bitterness, and proceeds from him that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to divide and devour, and to break the unity amongst the Lambs, and to make a prey, a rent, a division, and a spoil; and if any are overtaken in these things for want of a diligent watch to their thoughts, words and actions, in it the Enemy will have a great advantage to hurt your peace, and to weaken you. And therefore dear friends, be tender one to another; let the strong bear with the weak, and be you pittiful and tender-heatted towards the bruised Reeds, that have been hurt by the subtilty of the Enemy, and let your bowels earn over any in whom there is yet remaining a little Love or Zeal, though it be but as a smoaking Flax; or of any that are wounded by reason of their fall which they have taken in the Evening-tide. I say again in God's fear, Be very tender to any such that in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love and meekness such may be restored, if so it may be: For Friends, you your selves may be tempted, snared and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the subtil Enemies bait; and therefore let all that think they stand, fear continually, and take heed lest they also fall. And Friends, beware of watching over one another with an evil eye; for that watcheth for the evil, and doth not see the good; and by that the good manners is, and hath been corrupted, and they that watch with that eye, they provoke to evil, and not to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43188:6"/>
good. And Friends, it lieth upon me to warn you to take heed of looking back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or to any thing that you have left behind; but pass on, and let your eye be to that which is before, and abide in the way in which you have begun to walk, and in the patience dwel, and keep to the good Word thereof, that in the Faith you may be found, that so the old Enemy may not beguile you, and so you come to be dispossessed of the blessing through disobedience; therefore to your Guide keep, and faithfully follow him, and take heed of staying behind, and beware of being too forward in going before; for there is danger in both, of being overcome with the Enemy: In staying behind, you wil be guilty of disobedience, and so not onely lose your reward, and the blessing of rest and peace; but you will have that Talent taken away which you do possess, and you wil have your portion where wil be weeping and gnashing of teeth: And he that goes before, wil be puffed up above his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so forget the Lord, and he wil have his portion also with the wicked. Therefore I do exhort and warn you all to take heed of an evil heart of unbelief, and of departing from the living God: Be you all therefore stedfastly grounded, setled and staid in your minds, unmoveable, upon the everlasting Foundation of God that standeth sure, that so you may not be tossed, turned aside, nor easily shaken in your minds, from that which you have believed, nor weakned in your confidence, but that you may hold out unto the end, and then you wil assuredly receive your reward, if you faint not: So you that have believed in the Truth, take heed of fainting, and beware of hunting abroad; for my Friends, there may be erring on the right hand, as wel as on the left; therefore to your Leader keep, and dwel low in the pure fear, and so the Cross you wil be led into, and then you wil feel that which wil slay your Enemies on every hand; for of a truth friends, there is no safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of the fear, nor prosperity out of the Cross; therefore let your resolution be for ever therein to dwel, and then you wil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Crown, and reap the Blessing that is everlasting. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it was he that hunted abroad, that fainted, and sold his Birth-right for a little of the earthly enjoyment, to satisfie his earthly desire, and so he lost the blessing: Therefore all dear Lambs and little ones keep at home, and dwel in your own habitation, in the Light, the House of the living God, and be you faithful unto
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43188:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him in all things that he doth require, that so none might deprive you of your blessed Inheritance, nor take away your Crown of glory, joy, rest and peace.</p>
            <p>And Friends, Brethren and Sisters, children of God, think it not strange that we have tryal upon tryal; and if the Furnace of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cometh to be heat more hotter, yet look not out thereat, be valiant for the Lord, and for his Truth upon the Earth, and in that stand which is immovable; for this I have seen in the eternal Light, that there wil be a day of dividing and separating between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the vile, the good metal and the dross, between the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Wheat, and the light airy chaff; between the meek, gentle, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient sheep, and the rough rugged Goats; the vile in nature shal no longer be hid under a false, outside form of likeness, without the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Life, that dross shall no longer abide among the good Metal, to darken the brightness thereof; for the day is come that burns as an Oven; the Furnace is already kindled, and the Refiners fire is lighted, which wil try each matter, metal and work, of what sort it is, neither shal the chaff any longer cover the good Wheat, but by the Arm of Gods Eternal Power wil be threshed off, and blown away with the wind of his wrath; for he is come whose Fan is in his hand, by which he wil scatter the chaff, and the wheat he wil gather into his Garner, therein to be preserved; and he wil also purge his Floor in this his notable day, and all the gentle, meek and patient sheep on his right hand he wil set, where the fulness of joy, mercy, peace and pleasures are for ever, and for evermore; when as the rough and bruitish Goat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> shal be separated on the left hand, to receive the curse, having walked out of the way of righteousness, which is the way of peace; in that therefore (dear Friends) all abide, which wil make you fruitful, and to abound in every good word and work; for this is the day wherein he is come to seek for fruit, and blessed wil all they be that are found in the Faith, for its they that are in the Vine, and therein abide, which wil yeild unto the Lord living fruit of obedience, and every Tree wil be clearly known of what sort they are, by their fruit; for no man can gather grapes of Thorns, or figs of thistles: Therefore all to the Vine come, that the nature thereof you may feel, that so fruitful unto the Lord you may all be in this his glorious day, to the praise and glory of his most holy Name; for I have also seen in the Spirit of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43188:7"/>
the living God, that there wil be a mighty fierce storm, a very great tempest, and a shaking time, such as hath not yet been upon the Earth, by which those trees that are fruitless, dead and dry, which hath stood for a time, and made a shew, yet do but cumber the ground, and are rotten at the root, are not wel setled and fastned upon the true Foundation, in the good ground, they wil be turned up, and laid low, as without it hath been seen, in which the Lord hath shewn his mighty Power, though the blind do not see nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the operation of his hand. And after that great and notable day of the Lord in which many of the lofty Hills and high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains wil be overturned and levelled thereby, and the tall Cedars and the sturdy Oaks wil be made to bend and bow, and many great old buildings wil be thrown off its rotten Foundation; then I say, in that day those that do stand and abide firm and wel fastned, they wil be exceeding faithful, to the praise and glory of the Lord, and such his good Trees that are bringing forth fruit unto him in this his day, them he wil purge, prune, dress, prop and preserve; and the wild Bores of the Forrest, (whose nature is to root, rend and tear) shall never be able to root them up, neither shall the subtil Foxes of the Wood have power to crop and spoile their tender branches, that abide in the living Vine; neither shall they ever be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from clustering, for the Lord God wil guard them by his Power, and uphold them by his Eternal Arm, as hitherto he hath done; neither wil he suffer the Swine to destroy his young Plants that are newly coming up; but by his power they shall be fenced, nourished and kept. And so all my dear Friends, be not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, although the Furnace may yet be hot; for the Lord wil not suffer his Gold to come to loss therein, but he wil save and bring it forth, all that the good Metal shall lose therein, shall be but its dross, that it may shine the better in lustre, to the honor of the Lord; and also his good sheep he wil not suffer to be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those old black Blood-hounds that thirst for blood: Oh! no, no, my Friends, he wil preserve them, because they are his own ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by his own hand, and are profitable unto him: Therefore I say, he wil take care of them; and though he do suffer the dogs (which are without the fear) loose a little to course them, and drive them up in holes and pines for a season, it is but that they may be driven from those rotten bogs of this Worlds enjoyments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43188:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which might otherwise be hurtful for them to feed upon, that they might be driven nearer to himself, and one unto another, to wait upon the Lord, and to feed together upon the Life that is Immortal, and to lye down in his Fold of rest, peace and joy, which wil last for ever. And so my dear Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brethren and Sisters, Lambs and Babes, what ever the Lord our good Shepherd suffers to come to pass, or to be acted against us in the Heathens wrath and Enemies rage, he wil turn it to his own praise, and for our good, and the remainder of the wrath &amp; rage of the wicked he wil restrain. Therefore blessed are all you of the Lord, that can say of a truth, he is your good Shepherd. So dear Lambs and Babes, Plants and Children of the Lord, in the Light live, walk, and for ever abide, and you wil have unity and fellowship with the Father, and one with another; and so in the holy awe, and pure dread of the Lord God Almighty, stand continually, and the peace and blessing of the Lord wil be felt by you, and multiplied in and amongst you, to the glory of his most holy Name, to whom be all glory given, honor and praise rendered, with living obedience and thanksgiving for ever and for evermore, <hi>Amen</hi> saith my soul.</p>
            <p>So dear Friends, take this as a testimony of my love to you all who are of my Fathers Flock, from one that is of the same Fold with you, and your Friend and Brother in the Kingdom, suffering and patience of the Lord Jesus, who am called and known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by</p>

            <p>A Second Salutation to the flock of God every where in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bonds and at liberty, who are born of the immortal Seed, and redeemed from the Earth, and separated from the evil that is in this World, and called to be Saints, and quickned by the power and operation of the Spirit of Life, and sanctified by the Word of Truth, and are (in this day of tryal) found faithful to the Lord in doing or suffering for that precious Truth which makes free from sin and death, and keeps us above all the fears, threatnings, and terrors of man, whose power is from beneath, and soon passeth away. Oh! unto you my heart is opened, and streams of unfeigned Love from the incomings of the Fountain of Life, runs forth unto you all abundantly, who am the least among many Brethren, but not the least in love to you: Oh my dearly beloved Brethren and Sisters, as you suffer for God's living Truth upon the Earth in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I suffer with you, and am one with you, and am afflicted with you: Oh my dear Friends, apply your hearts, and give up your selves to, and for the service of the living God, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently wait upon him in whom all our strength is, that you may be strengthened and encouraged, enabled and furnished with power and might in the Lord of Hosts, that you may not faint, nor be weary in your minds, but stay your minds upon the God of Truth, that his blessing of peace may for ever encrease in all your habitations. And you dear Friends, you upon whom the ends of the Earth is come, and in your hearts the day-star is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen, walk in the Light thereof, that you may be wise, bold, strong and valiant, to follow the Captain of our salvation, who is born King of the <hi>Iews</hi>; for its given to him to rule all Nations, and to subdue the Kingdom of this World, but not by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons, but by his invisible Arm of Power, and Sword which proceeds out of his mouth, whereby he wil utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, destroy and lay wast all that rebel and stand up against him. Therefore my dear Friends, let your Faith stand in the invisible Arm and Power of God, and be you all of a sound mind; be ye stedfast, unmoveable, rooted, grounded and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the living Truth and Righteousness of the God of all the Families of the Earth, that you may not be moved, shaken,

nor troubled in your minds at all these rumors of Wars, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of Nations, and perplexity and wrath which must come to pass upon this generation; but lift up your heads and rejoice, and let your eye be single, alwaies looking to, and following the Prince of Peace; and be not of a doubtful mind, for the Lord of Hosts is with us, and the shout of a King is amongst us; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have no helper in the earth, neither can make use of any carnal weapons to defend or deliver our selves, yet in the faith and patient suffering in, and for the Lamb of God that was slain, but now is alive, and liveth for evermore; in him we shall reign in victory, life and dominion, over all our Enemies within and without. And my dear Friends, you are called to a glorious freedom and liberty in the Spirit of Truth, stand fast in it, that you may keep your consciences void of offence in the sight of God in all things; and if God requires one thing, and man another, obey God, and fear not man, who can but kil the body, that your souls may live in the dominion of Gods truth, and in it meet and wait, and worship him, and go not with the uncircumcised in hearts and ears; for the uncurable stroke of the Lord is near to be executed upon them; neither return back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the plagues, pestilence and famine wil be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied amongst them, til the <hi>Egyptians</hi> be confounded. Therefore dear Friends, keep your constant watch in the true Light of the Son of the living God, that you may receive counsel, wisdom, and discerning in every motion and command, whether it be of flesh or spirit; for that which moveth in the fleshly part in your own particulars, you must take up the Cross of Christ to, in its fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43188:9"/>
which is tribulation in this World; but be of good chear, the Captain of our salvation hath overcome the World: Therefore I say again in the Name, fear and power of the Lord, be you faithful unto death, for he that shall come, wil come, &amp; crown you with everlasting Life. And my dear Friends, if it seemeth good in the sight of our God, that all the dayes of our appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
