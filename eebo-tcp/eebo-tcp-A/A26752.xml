            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>IME was, when this, and all other Scriptures, which teach us our Duties to Superiors in Church, and State, have been treated as <hi>Malignants;</hi> being miſerably rack'd, and tortur'd; to make 'em ſpeak the Language of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> And that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much talk'd of, ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the Reformation of this, and divers other Texts, which ſtand ſo ſtubborn, and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemies, to all oppoſition of Kings, and Monarchical Governments. I have met with them, who have dealt with this very Scripture, as ſome would perſwade the Devil doth with the Bodies of Witches, molding 'em to the forms of Beaſts, that in terrible Appearances, they may infatuate, and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>There is one in his Appeal to <hi>Fairfax, and his Army,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this place as a Spy, that came to diſcover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Pamphlet; deals with it, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did with <hi>David</hi>'s Ambaſſadors; <hi>ſhave its beard, and cut its clothes to its buttocks,</hi> then ſend it away with Shame, and Ignominy. He flyes to the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which literally rendered is, to every Humane Creature; and becauſe it follows, <hi>whether to the King;</hi> he concludes that the King is an Humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, as he explains it, <hi>a Creature of the People,</hi> who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51930:3"/>
have Power over the work of their own hands, and may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make him at pleaſure; by ſtripping him of that Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Power, which they gave him. Much like his gloſs on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> i. e. ſaith he, to the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> viz. the <hi>Commons;</hi> who are the Fountain and Original of all Power, whence that of Kings, and Nobles do ſpring; and, <hi>Non dat, quod non habet,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give more than it hath it ſelf, and what it doth give, it may recal again. Principles fit to debauch the moſt wretched Libels; and ſuited to the mouths of none, but a <hi>Scotch Carge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte:</hi> and ſo meet to be ſpoke in no place, as at Scaffolds, and Gibbets, where they come to receive a juſt Recompence for ſuch confounding, and deſtructive Tenents.</p>
            <p>But it is a common rule in expounding Scripture, that that cannot be the meaning of one Text, which is contradictory to another: But this ſenſe is contradictory, not only to many Particulars; but to the concurrent Doctrine, and Practice of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and all Apoſtolick Men. Nor can that be a due, and regular Deduction from a Text, which directly contradicts the very ſcope, and deſign of the place, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from: but ſuch is the caſe before us; For it is the very buſineſs, and deſign of this, and the following Verſes, to ingage our Submiſſion to <hi>Every Ordinance of man; whether to the King, as Supreme; or to them, that are ſent by him:</hi> Therefore to conclude from hence, that Kings may be reſiſted, and depoſed; makes the ſame Scripture to contradict it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt ſubmit, and yet may reſiſt 'em: obey, and yet depoſe 'em.</p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt ſeek for ſome more Natural, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Explication: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to Order, and Government; or to that diſpoſition of Civil Government, which is in every Nation; including all the particular Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Statutes, and Conſtitutions of a Society. And it is called an Humane Creature; <hi>Quòd ab hominibus ordinetur, &amp; conſtituatur;</hi> becauſe it is ordain'd, or appointed by Men: but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51930:3"/>
yet not without a Divine Sanction, in that God himſelf Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the firſt, and moſt Noble Government in the World; being founded originally in Families; the firſt of all Societies. For <hi>Monarch,</hi> as the word imports, is the ſole Governor in a Society: and therefore is agreeable to <hi>a Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familias,</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> and an <hi>Emperor,</hi> who have in themſelves the ſame Power over their Subjects; ſo far as they are not limited by a Superior Power, as the <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> by a King, and Kings by an Emperor; which limitation ſo far as it reaches, deſtroys the Notion of <hi>Monarch</hi> in the leſſer, and transfers it to the greater. Where there is only one Family, or if many, ſo far as one is independent, ſo far the <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> the Father, or Head of it, is a Monarch. Where there is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſeveral Families into one Body, the chief is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> ſtill, but yet diſterenced from a <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> by the Title of <hi>King.</hi> And where ſeveral Kingdoms are United, and Subject to one Head; that Head hath the Title of <hi>Monarch</hi> in common with the other; but is diſtinguiſhed from both by the Title of <hi>Emperor.</hi> Whence it is ſaid of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> Gen. 10. 10. that the <hi>beginning of his Kingdom was Babel,</hi> and <hi>Erech,</hi> and <hi>Accad,</hi> and <hi>Calneh, in the land of Shinar:</hi> implying that the Families of thoſe places being United under him, made up a Kingdom; and gave him the Title, and Dignity of a King. And at the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> when the World was divided into many Bodies, according to the number of Tongues, and Languages; every Captain was really a King, or ſole Ruler of that Body. Whence we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 9. of Nine Kings joyned together in one Battel. The degeneracy of which Government into <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and baſe <hi>Democracy,</hi> was a Creature, not exiſtent from the beginning, but aroſe, like the Mule, from the Unnatural conjunction of an Horſe, and an Aſs: and ſcarce ever obtain'd in any place, but by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Therefore it was, perhaps, from the Nature of the Government, as well as that it was at this time the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51930:4"/>
of the World; that St. <hi>Peter</hi> proceeds from Government it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ordinance of man,</hi> to the Form, and <hi>Modus</hi> of it, which is Monarchical, to <hi>the King as Supreme—</hi>Had ſome Men as much to Plead for <hi>Commonwealth, Free State,</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> they would long ſince have boaſted the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of 'em.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having found the meaning of this <hi>Ordinance of man;</hi> we ſhall obſerve the Command to ſubmit to it; for it is ſpoke Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratively <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Be ye ſubject:</hi> But we have no Precept, or Example to the contrary; and therefore muſt yield either Active, or Paſſive Obedience. Which is agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Practice of our Bleſſed Saviour; who paid Tribute, rather than make a Diſturbance: He ſubmitted to the High Prieſt, and Jewiſh <hi>Synedrium;</hi> to an Heathen <hi>Pilat,</hi> and the moſt unjuſt, and unreaſonable Sentence. This was not only taught by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> under <hi>Nero,</hi> the Monſter of Mankind; but was ſealed by their Blood under the ſame Emperor. To this did the Fathers, and Primitive Churches all agree; whoſe ſteps the Church of <hi>England</hi> follows both in Doctrine, and Practice. This is ſo great, and evident a part of Chriſtian Religion, that it was as Catholick as the Church it ſelf, till firſt Popery, and from thence Presbytery, began to appear, and diſturb the World.</p>
            <p>This is imply'd in the very Nature, and Reaſon of Society; which is an Union, or imbodying of particulars for mutual preſervation. For this very Union is it ſelf a tacit, and mutual Compact to be governed by the Laws, and Rules of that Society. The making, and execution of which, muſt be intruſted into a few hands; and in caſe any thing ſhall be ordain'd, or impoſed, that is unlawful in it ſelf, or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the firſt ends of Society; there is no Remedy, but either Patience, or a quiet remove into ſome other Society, where thoſe Evils cannot reach 'em; even as the Members of a Family, as Children, Servants, or others; muſt conform to the Rules of that Family, or remove. Whence the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51930:4"/>
word [Honor] doth import the Duties, we owe both to Civil Magiſtrates, and Natural Parents. Thus our Saviour ordered the Diſciples, that when they were Perſecuted in one City, they ſhould fly to another; and not look there to complain of Grievances, to make Parties, and Plots upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, indeavoring to ſecure the beſt things, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion, and Property, by the worſt Methods, <hi>viz.</hi> Rebellion, and Blood.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any other Doctrine, that gives either Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or People, any ſecurity of their Religion, Eſtates, or Lives. For leave but any hole for refuſals, reſiſtance, or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence, as ſome call it, to creep in at; and you give but an opportunity to every State-Mountebank, and Knaviſh Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to put tricks upon the People, in perſwading 'em to a neceſſity of ſlighting, or reſiſting the Laws, either for the removal, or prevention of thoſe Evils, which are ſuppoſed to licence ſuch refuſals, or reſiſtance. By which means all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would be ſet upon hinges; and Men would quickly do only what they have a mind to do: and a Society would be more dangerous, than many wild, and ungoverned Parts of the World. Inquire of this, and the Nations about us; Examine the Times, that are paſt; and you will find, that this Doctrine of reſiſtance hath made more Differences, Wars, and Bloodſhed; than all the Controverſies among Princes, in the like ſpace of time, have done. What Calamities, and Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, may we then imagine there would have been, and would yet be, had Men liberty upon any account whatever, to ſlight, and reſiſt the Government? Therefore the God of Peace, Unity, and Order, hath given us ſuch Rules, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Univerſal Obedience, that there is no room left for any reaſonable Plea to the contrary.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore ſubmit either Actively, or Paſſively:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Actively, by doing the thing commanded, where it is not contrary to any Law, or Ordinance of God. For God bids us ſubmit to <hi>every Ordinance,</hi> without exception; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51930:5"/>
therefore to every thing, which himſelf hath not forbidden. And if any Plead a Prohibition, it muſt not be from illogical Inferences, ſound of Words, and miſapplication of Phraſes; but from a Rule as plain, and ſatisfactory, as the Command. And if this be produced, yet it can licence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Only to a Paſſive Submiſſion, in ſuffering the Penalty of Non-obedience.</p>
            <p>Now we have here a Precept directed to us from my Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as one of our Pariſhes is under this Juriſdiction: and another from my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> as the other Pariſh is a Member of his Lordſhip's Dioceſs. Which Orders even this very Text doth oblige us to obſerve, and do; unleſs you can find any Evil in the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; in which caſe you are quietly to ſubmit to thoſe Penalties, with which the Law ſhall puniſh your Refuſals, or Neglects. For your Information, and Satisfactions in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns; I ſhall obſerve in theſe Letters, theſe three things,</p>

However it is certain, it was a thing very early, and Univerſally Practiſed in the Chriſtian Church. And <hi>Origen,</hi> with other Learned Men, condeſcended to this work.

               </gap>, or <hi>Catechumens,</hi> who were the Perſons, that learned theſe Catechiſes.

But the Children even of Chriſtians, whether Baptized, or not, were obliged to this exerciſe. And the Sons of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperor were put out to Maſters, and Tutors, to be train'd up in the Principles of Chriſtian Religion. Whence it appears,</p>

Therefore we have here an Ordinance from the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers of our Church, that commands only an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Duty; a thing founded on Eternal Reaſon: on Scripture, and the Laws of the Land. A Duty ſo plain, and ſo Natural, to train up Children in Virtue, and all laudible Knowledges, that the very Heathen did Court, and Practiſe it: and as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, A good Education out-lives Death, travels beyond the Grave, and abides with us through all the Tracts of Eternal Ages: and therefore being the greateſt, and moſt laſting good, we can do 'em, even common Nature prompts us to it. There can be therefore no objection againſt the thing it ſelf; the Matter lies only in reference to that Catechiſm, injoyn'd by the Church. Which ſome object againſt, upon the account, it ſuppoſes Children baptized with Sureties; which they cannot away with. This Point we will fully anſwer, and then conſider the Parts of the Catechiſm it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They plead that Sureties undertake more than they can perform; therefore they can neither make uſe of them, nor teach a Catechiſm, which ſuppoſes their uſe.</p>
            <p>We Anſwer,</p>
            <p>That the Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe Faith, and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, were famous in the World; thought no ſuch Matters: for then Infants had their <hi>Sponſores</hi> or <hi>Suſceptores,</hi> and <hi>Suſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices,</hi> Undertakers, or Sureties; and becauſe 'twas thought there was a Spiritual Relation ariſing between the Parents, and Sureties; therefore the Child called 'em <hi>God-father,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Father-in-God;</hi> and the ancient Saxons <hi>Godſibs,</hi> by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <hi>Goſſips, Sib</hi> ſignifying <hi>akin,</hi> implying that they were akin, in God. Now theſe anſwered, in behalf of the Child, the very ſame Queſtions that are uſed by our Church, <hi>viz. Doeſt thou renounce the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>DoEſt thou Believe in God the Father—the Son—the Holy Ghoſt?—</hi>This was the Univerſal Practice in the time of <hi>Tertul.</hi> Now thoſe Men, who for a good Conſcience, ſuffered ſo cruel Perſecutions, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51930:7"/>
               <hi>Lactan. de Juſt.</hi> cryes out, <hi>Quis Caucaſus! Quae India!</hi> What place, the moſt fruitful in Monſters, ever bred ſuch cruel and ſavage Beaſts, as their Perſecutors were! yet never cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured this part of Baptiſm, as a ſinful addition, or corruption of this Inſtitution. But becauſe ſome Men have cheap thoughts of Antiquity, I will conſider the thing it ſelf, and argue from the very Nature of it, as,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What it is they Undertake, and</item>
               <item>2. For how long.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. They undertake that the Child ſhall <hi>renounce the Devil, and all his works; and believe God's Holy Word, and keep his Commandments.</hi> Whence it follows, <hi>Doeſt thou in the Name of this Child renounce the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doeſt thou believe in God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wilt thou be Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wilt thou obediently keep God's Holy Will, and Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. Which is but the firſt Matter explain'd, and put into the form of Queſtions. Whence the Child ſaith in the Catechiſm, that they did Vow Three things in his Name, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he ſhould <hi>renounce the Devil,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>2. That he ſhould <hi>believe the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. That he ſhould <hi>keep God's Holy Will, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The meaning of which is only this, that the Child ſhall be brought up a Chriſtian, and not a Jew, or Heathen: and that it ſhall take this Vow, and Profeſſion upon it ſelf. Therefore in the Exhortation to the Sureties after Baptiſm, the whole Charge is compriſed in Two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they ſhall <hi>teach the Child what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe, and Profeſſion, it hath there made by them:</hi> the Matter of which Vow is contain'd in the ingagement above, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhall <hi>renounce the Devil—Believe the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and keep the Commands:</hi> as a means to which, they are directed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>Call upon it to hear Sermons, and provide that it may learn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51930:8"/>
which things, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Creed, Lord's Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> do compriſe all the Matter of this Promiſe; To which it is added,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That when the Child can ſay theſe things, and the Church Catechiſm (which Catechiſm I therefore preſume the Sureties are obliged to ſee it learn) they ſhall bring it to the <hi>Biſhop to be Confirm'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here is the whole Matter of Suretiſhip: which is confeſſed by thoſe very Men, that Diſpute againſt it. For they ſometimes Plead, that the reaſon of Sureties in the Firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, where there was a mixture of Chriſtians, and Gentiles together, was that there might be a ſufficient number ingaged to ſee the Child brought up a Chriſtian. Therefore, according to them, the bringing up the Child in the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, doth compriſe the whole burthen of Suretiſhip.</p>
            <p>Then the time this Obligation lyes upon the Sureties, is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Till the Child be of Age to take it upon it ſelf;</hi> as in the Publick Baptiſm: which is at <hi>Confirmation,</hi> as anon.</p>
            <p>We will now ſee how, and when, the Child takes this <hi>Vow</hi> from his Sureties upon himſelf; and that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. At the very learning of theſe things, for he declares in the Catechiſm, that he looks upon himſelf <hi>bound to believe, and do, as they have Promiſed for him;</hi> and ingages, that by <hi>God's help he will do ſo:</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. At <hi>Confirmation,</hi> where the Biſhop asks the Children, and that in order to Confirmation, <hi>Do you here in the Preſence of God, and of this Congregation, renew the ſolemn Promiſe, and Vow, that was made in your Name at your Baptiſm; ratifying, and confirming the ſame in your own Perſons; and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves bound to believe, and to do, all thoſe things, which your God-fathers, and God-mothers, then undertook for you?</hi> To which the anſwer is, <hi>I do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident then, that all that charge, which the Church laid upon the Sureties at the Child's Baptiſm; the Church
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51930:8"/>
takes off from the ſame Sureties at the Child's Confirmation. And becauſe Confirmation of the Child is a diſcharge of the Sureties; it follows, that the fitting this Child for, and the bringing him to Confirmation, doth compriſe the whole Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sureties. And the Rubrick at the end of the Catechiſm tells us, that the Child ſhall be confirm'd, when it can ſay <hi>the Creed, Lord's Prayer, and Ten Commandments, and anſwer the other Queſtions in that Catechiſm:</hi> which is adaequate to the Charge given. <hi>Ergo</hi> the teaching the Child thoſe things, and the bringing him duely to Confirmation, is a Plenary and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſcharge of the Sureties.</p>
            <p>But it will be farther objected, that the Sureties ingage, and the Catechiſm doth expreſs it, that the Child ſhall keep the <hi>Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of its life. Ergo</hi> the Obligation ſeems to lye on the Surety ſo long as the Child doth live.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That that Clauſe reſpects the Nature of the Baptiſmal Vow; the Covenant the Child makes with God by its Sureties at Baptiſm; and by it ſelf at Confirmation; but doth not reſpect the ingagement of the Surety any farther, than that the Child ſhall take this Vow upon it ſelf; whereof this of Perſeverance is a part.</p>
            <p>But in caſe the Child be uncapable, or will not learn; or is not ſuffered by Parents, Guardians, or Maſters; or that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence removes the Parties ſo far aſunder, that there is no means, or opportunity left, of performing ſuch ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the will is accepted for the deed: for God requires no more of any man than what he is able to do: But where Men have any reaſonable proſpect of ſuch Impediments, they ought not to ingage: but an honeſt ingagement is not made Sin by an accidental impoſſibility of Performance. But if Parents ſhall, as in Duty bound, do this of themſelves, the Sureties have no more upon 'em, but to ſee that the thing be done.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51930:9"/>
2. It is objected, That Heatheniſm ſtill abounding in the Chriſtian World, the Church required Sureties, leſt one, or two Perſons dying, the Child might fall into Gentile hands, and be brought up as ſuch: But now amongſt us Heatheniſm is rooted out, therefore the reaſon of the thing ceaſing, the thing it ſelf ought to ceaſe too; as it did in that caſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining <hi>from things Strangled, and from Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This runs upon a falſe Suppoſition, and is no better than a fallacy called <hi>Petitio Principii;</hi> which is a taking for granted what ought to be proved, For the danger of Heatheniſm was not the only reaſon of Sureties. For thoſe firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, did ground it much upon that Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. where he calls Baptiſm an <hi>Anſwer of a good Conſcience toward God.</hi> Whence they conjectured, he hinted at Interrogatories, and Reſponſes, in that Office. How truly conjectured is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide my Buſineſs to inquire; it is enough to the Objector, that there were other Reaſons, than what he aſſigns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Proſeſſion of Heatheniſm is not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, yet the Practice of Heatheniſh Debaucheries doth abound: and this Religious Education of Children was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to keep 'em, not ſo much from the Name, as from the Thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suretiſhip was alſo deſign'd as a fence againſt thoſe Schiſms, and Hereſies, that perplexed the Church; which things obtain amongſt us, perhaps, as much as in thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Times, and Places, where Suretiſhip was never ſcrupled. Therefore the reaſon of Sureties is as great, as Ever: and conſequently may be as profitably, and prudently continued, as at firſt uſed.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> Some think it abſurd, that the Charge is not given to the Parents; but that others are thruſt into their place; and bound to do thoſe Duties, which themſelves owe their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51930:9"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a Plea merely from Ignorance; for Parents have an antecedent Charge laid upon 'em both by God, and Nature; which they ſtand as much bound to perform, as if there had been no Surety at all. Therefore the Church layes the Charge upon others, who had none before: to the end, that they may not exclude, or excuſe the Parents, but be joyn'd with them, for the more certain, and eaſie carrying on of the work. The Parents never matter how many Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers the Child hath in Temporal concerns; and that they think otherwiſe in Spirituals, muſt be from Ignorance, or a mighty Prepoſſeſſion, or from too eaſie, and indifferent thoughts of Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This is a very Chriſtian, and charitable Work, to be Guides to the Blind, Teachers to the Simple, and Directors of Poor, and (perhaps) neglected Infants, into the Paths of Truth, and Life. By this means you may turn ſome to Righteouſneſs; and thereby increaſe your own Rewards for Ever.</p>
            <p>It tends mightily to the intereſt, and advance of Religion; for did Sureties perform their Vows to God (and it is their Sin, if they do not) we ſhould find it would quickly give a mighty check to the growing madneſs of the Age.</p>
            <p>But in fine, becauſe Suppoſitions grant nothing, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there may be ſtill ſome evil in the having Sureties; yet according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s reſolution of a like caſe, that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Evil cannot affect the Children, or Parents. For ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Daventre</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have confeſſed to me, inquiring of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> what he thought of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm; or of ſigning Children with it? He anſwered, <hi>Baptiſm is a neceſſary Duty, and in the Church of</hi> England <hi>we have all the Eſſential parts of it: Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I bring my Child, as the Law Commands, to be baptiz'd; but if there be any ſinful, or unneceſſary Additions, without which I cannot have Baptiſm; thoſe Additions are nothing to me; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not them, but ſimply</hi> Baptiſm; <hi>what evil there may be in any Additions, being they are impoſed, and not my choice, lyes upon</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51930:10"/>
               <hi>the Church, that Commands, and on the Miniſter, that uſes 'em.</hi> Therefore if we conſider either the thing it ſelf, or Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s ſenſe, Parents have not a ſufficient excuſe for refuſing to have their Children Catechiſed, becauſe the Catechiſm injoyn'd ſuppoſes they are baptized by Sureties.</p>
            <p>Whence we come to conſider the Catechiſm it ſelf; and I doubt not, but I may ſpeak it, not only ſhort, but eaſie, moſt comprehenſive, and every way moſt ſufficient to it's end. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Catechiſm teaches the Nature of our Baptiſmal Vow, and Covenant; which is to <hi>renounce the Devil, and all his works, the Pomps, and Vanity of this wicked World; and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh; to believe all the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith; and to keep God's holy Will, and Commandments all the dayes of our life.</hi> Where the whole Duty of Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in a few words; and ſuited to the Capacities of the meaneſt Learner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It teaches the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> whoſe Antiquity is ſuch, that ſome have thought it was made by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, every one of 'em being ſuppoſed to caſt in his part toward the compoſing the whole. It is obſerved from the Greek, and Latin Fathers, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Traditio Apoſtolorum,</hi> was a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſuppoſed to come from ſome Apoſtle: but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>traditio Apoſtolica,</hi> was only a very ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; which came, if not from ſome Apoſtle, yet from ſome other near thoſe Times. Now this hath been uſually called the <hi>Creed of the Apoſtles;</hi> and ſo Dr. <hi>D.</hi> in his Greek Verſion of our Liturgy, calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but whether with reſpect to this Obſervation, I cannot ſay; or how Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true it may be, is not to be determined by any, that have not made their Obſervations in numerous inſtances of this kind. The leaſt we can make of it is (and no man will go to prove any more) that it is a very ancient one, elſe, we may preſume, it had never been placed by any in the Apoſtles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51930:10"/>
times; we can trace it very far; and find it Univerſally uſed in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. It was uſed by the followers of the <hi>Presbyterian Directory,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſemblies Catechiſm;</hi> nor do I remember any Objection then againſt it, but in that Article, <hi>viz.</hi> the Deſcent <hi>into hell;</hi> which they wiſh was either altered, or left out. Yet the ſame Men own that deſcent <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> though not <hi>Locally;</hi> therefore according to them, that Article is true, and wants only an Explication.</p>
            <p>Now the Ancient, and Univerſal uſe of it, ſpeaks the eſteem, it hath ever had in the Chriſtian World: and the excellent choice our Catechiſm hath made in teaching this, rather than that of <hi>Nice,</hi> or <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> which are longer, and not ſo ſuited to every Capacity. And though the Presbyterian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cavill'd at the Deſcent <hi>into hell,</hi> yet they uſed this Creed, rather than the <hi>Nicoean,</hi> whoſe Antiquity is great, and which ſpeaks of no ſuch Deſcent at all: which is an Argument of their higher Approbation of the other Parts of it. Here, in the feweſt words, and plaineſt way, are taught the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Faith: what we are to believe concerning <hi>God the Father, who made the World: God the Son, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all Mankind: and God the Holy Ghoſt, who ſanctifies all the elect people of God.</hi> Which makes up a ſhort, but yet a moſt plain, and excellent Syſtem of all the <hi>Credenda,</hi> or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of pure Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It teaches what we are to do, and that from the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> which is the ſum, and breviary of all Morality. This is the ſtanding Rule given to the World. The <hi>Lex nata,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it, the Law born with us, and imprinted on the hearts of all Men by Nature, was a Counterpart of this: All the Moral Diſcourſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, were but Comments upon this Text: the Sermon of Chriſt upon the Mount, and the other practical Parts of the Goſpels, and Epiſtles; are but an Explication, and a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, from the falſe Gloſſes of the Phariſees, and the Corruptions of the Gnoſticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51930:11"/>
Therefore we have here the ſum of all Practical Religion, and as it is divided into two Tables; ſo our Catechiſm gives us the moſt ſhort, plain, and cloſe Explication of each, under thoſe two Heads, <hi>viz. Our Duty toward God,</hi> and <hi>our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Neighbor,</hi> that can well be compriſed in ſo few words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Catechiſm teaches the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> which was given not only a Pattern for us to Pray by; but as a Form for us to uſe. Therefore he taught it the Diſciples twice, the firſt time was <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9. And ſome time after, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 2. they come to him again, <hi>Maſter teach us to pray;</hi> as if they looked upon that ſhort form ſuited indeed to the Infancy of their Diſcipleſhip, but not ſo fitting, now they were taught farther, and came more near the ſtature of Men; but he gives 'em the very ſame again; a tacit reproof of their ignorance, and reach after Novels. And if we only ſuppoſe he might deſign it as a form; he could not well have expreſs'd himſelf more aptly to that purpoſe; for <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>ſic, vel ita orate,</hi> Pray <hi>thus,</hi> viz. in theſe very words; which is better rendered ſo, than as our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation doth, viz. <hi>after this manner,</hi> which looks ſomewhat like a <hi>Geneva</hi> caſt, as if it was intended only as a Pattern to form our conceived Prayers by. And <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 2. when ye Pray, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. which ſeems a confining 'em to thoſe very words; as well as to that matter. Indeed thoſe Men muſt think very highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that look upon that Prayer, which was compoſed by Chriſt himſelf, and given to the Twelve, whom he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and was training up for the Diſcipleing all Nations; to be fit only for Children, if for any; but to ſtand much below their own improvements. We do not read, that ever our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made uſe of any other Prayer himſelf, unleſs ſome ſhort Ejaculation, or particular Petition, ſuited to a preſent exigence, as when in his Agony, and bloody Sweat, <hi>If it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> And though there may be many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51930:11"/>
given, why Publick Service ought to be much longer; yet our Church uſes this very form, in every diſtinct Part of her Service. Here then Youth is taught a Prayer, ſhort, plain comprehenſive, and ſuited to the Divine Will, being given us by the Son of God, and Captain of our Salvation, who beſt knew how, and what we ought to pray for; a Prayer ſuited to all Perſons, Times, and Places; and therefore given for the uſe of all Poſterities; which none but <hi>gifted Men,</hi> and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Spirits, who love much <hi>babling,</hi> ever yet deſpiſed. And this our Catechiſm doth explain in a few words, and to the Capacities of every Learner; in the Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>What deſireſt thou of God in this Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We have the Explication of the Nature of a Sacrament, that <hi>it is an outward, and viſible ſign of an inward, and Spiritual Grace, given to us,</hi> &amp;c. Whence it deſcends to the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeverally. And tells you, that the outward, and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign, or form in Baptiſm, is <hi>Water, wherein the Perſon is baptiz'd in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that the inward, and Spiritual grace, is <hi>a death unto Sin, and a new birth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence it deſcends to the Sacrament of the Supper, and tells you, that the outward part, or ſign is, <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> &amp;c. And that the inward part or thing ſignified is, <hi>the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which are verily, and indeed taken, and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper.</hi> By which the Child is led from the conceits both of Tranſubſtantiation, and Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation at once. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It tells you that in the Sacrament, and therefore after <hi>Conſecration,</hi> or Bleſſing, for till then it is not a Sacrament; there are two diſtinct Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſign, which is Bread, and Wine; and the thing ſignified, which is the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; therefore the one is not changed into the other; but remain diſtinct ſtill; becauſe the ſign, and thing ſignified, while ſuch, cannot be the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51930:12"/>
2. It ſaith that this Body, and Blood of Chriſt <hi>is taken, and received by the faithful;</hi> which is ſpoke excluſively of all others: but if the Bread, and Wine, was really changed into the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; or if they did conſiſt together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in, and under the outward Elements; although ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; yet this Body, and Blood of Chriſt, would then be <hi>verily, and indeed,</hi> taken, and received, by every Communicant, and not by the faithful only. <hi>Ergo</hi> according to our Catechiſm, there is neither Tranſubſtantiation, nor Conſubſtantiation in this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt Anſwer, you have a full, and moſt excellent account of what is required of a worthy Communicant; and that is, <hi>to examine themſelves, whether they repent them truly of their former Sins; ſtedfaſtly purpoſing to lead a new life; have a lively faith in God's Mercy through Chriſt, with a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Death; and be in Charity with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then are <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads</hi> in a Nutſhel; a little Body, and Syſtem of Divinity, that compriſes the Subſtance of mighty Volumes! Here the deepeſt Points, and moſt myſterious parts of our Faith, are by eaſie, and familiar Expreſſions, brought down to puerile Capacities! Whereas the Aſſemblies Catechiſm is longer, and runs upon ſecond Notions, which do themſelves ſuppoſe ſome preceding Knowledges, and therefore Children need an Explication of 'em; and is burthened with numerous Quotations, which are apt to confound, and tire a young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner.</p>
            <p>This then ought to be prefer'd for its own ſake, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; which lyes both in the Matter it contains; and it's ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and ſufficiency to it's end, if it had not been injoyn'd by any Ordinance of Man. But ſince it is ſo, we have a double Obligation, firſt from it ſelf, and then from the Authority, that Commands it. Therefore if we refuſe, we ſin againſt both at once; and in one Act we are doubly guilty. And certainly Men have the leſs reaſon to do ſo, becauſe this very injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth yet leave room for every one to teach another at home.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51930:12"/>
2. It is required of you, that you receive the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</hi> The Perſons under obligation are all above Sixteen, and both the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Rubrick,</hi> ſay, that they ſhall receive at leaſt <hi>three times</hi> in the year; whereof <hi>Eaſter</hi> ſhall be one. There are ſeveral Statutes, that oblige the Subject to this Duty: which Laws the People have made themſelves in, and by their Repreſentatives; therefore they can no more complain of the thing, than they can, that they have had Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; or at leaſt ſuch, that have brought 'em under this Obligation.</p>
            <p>Nor is this founded merely on Humane Laws, but on a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution and Command of Heaven; it being the laſt Precept our Saviour gave his Diſciples, before he was made an offering for Sin; <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Therefore the obſervance of it muſt be a means to Salvation, elſe he lays a needleſs burthen upon us: and if Nature doth nothing in vain, we cannot imagine that the God of Nature ſhould give us Laws to no purpoſe. If men may be ſafe under the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary neglect of this Sacrament, why not of the other? And if of theſe, why not of any other Rules, and Precepts of the Goſpel, ſince they all come with a Divine Authority impreſs'd upon 'em? They are <hi>his</hi> Laws, one as well as another.</p>
            <p>But ſome may plead from the Nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that the Matter of ſome Commands is intrinſecally good, and neceſſary; and therefore was a Duty even ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to a Divine Precept: but this is a pure Poſitive, that hath no goodneſs in it ſelf; and therefore had not been a Duty, unleſs injoyn'd; and conſequently though they are all Commanded, yet they are not all alike obliging: becauſe the one hath a double Obligation, <hi>viz.</hi> both from it's own Nature, and Precept too; the other from Precept only.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, that ſome will not allow the two Sacraments to be purely Poſitive, but that they are founded partly on Nature, and Reaſon. But ſuppoſe 'em ſuch, and I cannot ſee the advantage, they can make of it. For pure Poſitives under
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51930:13"/>
the Law, ſuch as was Circumciſion were as ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Tranſgreſſions in things morally Good, and Evil. For he, that was not Circumciſed, was to be <hi>cut off from his People.</hi> And what reaſon can be given, why the neglect of Poſitives under the Goſpel ſhould not be ſeverely puniſhed, as well as under the Law? Why the neglect, or contempt of Baptiſm ſhould not be a Sin now, as well as that of Circumciſion was then? And this of the Sacrament, as well as that of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over? The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth argue it to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <hi>Chap,</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion receiv'd a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which—was ſpoken to us by the Lord—?</hi> As the Son of God is greater, than a Created Spirit, ſo the Tranſgreſſion of the Law given by him, is a greater Sin, than a Tranſgreſſion of the Law given by the other, and if it be ſo as to the whole, it muſt be ſo as to the like parts of each Diſpenſation. Therefore a man hath but little cauſe to hope he may ſafely neglect a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive inſtitution of Chriſt, when a like neglect was ſo ſeverely puniſhed under the Law. There is a contempt of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the neglect of a Poſitive, as well as there is of a Moral Duty: and every Contempt, and Diſobedience muſt have a due recompence of reward.</p>
            <p>This is the neareſt Communion, we have with God in this World; therefore the neglect of it, is the greateſt neglect of God himſelf. It is a means of conveighing Grace, and Life to the Soul; which is ſtrengthned, and refreſhed by the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, as the Body is by the Bread, and Wine: and a contempt of the means, is a contempt of the thing it ſelf. For which reaſons, as well as others, the Duty is great, and indiſpenſable.</p>
            <p>But I preſume few of us here are againſt the Duty it ſelf, ſo much as againſt the <hi>Modus</hi> of it, according to the Uſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Therefore I ſhall anſwer the moſt Common, and material Objections, I have met with; that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51930:13"/>
by giving reaſonable, and ſatisfactory anſwers to them, I may leave every wilful neglect without excuſe. And ſome object,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt the Poſture we receive it in, which is <hi>Kneeling:</hi> againſt which they plead,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not agreeable to that Poſture, which the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples received it in.</p>
            <p>To which we anſwer,</p>
            <p>That no Pretenders to Chriſtianity in theſe Parts of the World do receive it in that Poſture, that the Diſciples did; which was not ſitting, but rather lying. The ſame men plead, that they received it in a Table geſture, which to them was ſuch; but to us is ſitting: therefore, ſay they, we agree with 'em in a Table geſture, though not in the ſame Poſture of Body: which is nearer to 'em, than the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> goes.</p>
            <p>We argue,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no reaſon can be given, why a Table geſture, which is different according to different places; ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, and not the very Poſture, it was then given in. There is no Precept, nor Example for chooſing the one, rather than the other. Therefore this is merely Election, and not done upon any ſufficient warrant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here were many Circumſtances conſiderable, as the <hi>geſture, lying;</hi> the <hi>Perſons,</hi> to whom, which were <hi>Men only;</hi> the <hi>number,</hi> but <hi>twelve;</hi> the <hi>time,</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> and that <hi>after Supper.</hi> Now if we muſt obſerve one Circumſtance, why not the reſt? It is perfectly humourſom to make one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, and not another; when the Scripture leaves all alike.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is pleaded, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> ſeems an Adoration, either of the Table, we kneel before, or of the Bread, and Wine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Adoration of the Table was a thing never uſed in the Chriſtian Church. There are ſome indeed, that have bowed toward the Eaſt, and therefore toward the Table, becauſe it ſtands in the Eaſt end of the Church; but the reaſon of this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51930:14"/>
was, not becauſe the Table ſtood there, but becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected our Saviour ſhould, at the laſt day; appear firſt in that part of Heaven: from that ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 27. <hi>As the lightning comes out of the Eaſt, and ſhines even to the Weſt: ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> For the ſame reaſon they turn'd toward the Eaſt at the rehearſal of the Creed; and from thence we bury our Dead with their Faces that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others have bowed this way, becauſe as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple had it's <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> ſo they reckon a Divine Preſence in this, above what there is in other parts of the Church. For though every part hath the ſame Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the whole is the Houſe of God; yet this, ſay they, is as the higheſt Room, and the Preſence Chamber; here the Chriſtian Sacrifice is offered; here the King comes down to ſee his Gueſts; and is graciouſly preſent with every Communicant above what he is in other places; in regard of the intimate, and extraordinary Communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thoſe, that have made it <hi>motivum cultûs,</hi> have ever denyed, that they make it <hi>terminativum.</hi> All Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors would ever have look'd upon it to be as vile, and unjuſt an imputation, as thoſe did, who were accuſed to worſhip an Aſſes Head; or to kill a Child, and eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood.</p>
            <p>We are all Commanded to a Publick Worſhip, and are here determin'd to ſuch, and ſuch parts of the Church: and Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the very Poſture of Prayer, which therefore all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawful impediment, ought to uſe: whence it may as well be ſaid, that they worſhip the part of the Seat they Kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as that they Worſhip the Table, who Kneel about it at the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>This is ſuch a ſurprizing Objection, that the Church, which hath been careful to remove every ſcruple, never ſpeaks to; as not dreaming any would be ſo vain in their Imaginations, as to make ſuch an Objection. And indeed I muſt look upon it, not ſo much a real ſcruple, as a malicious ſlander of the Order of our Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51930:14"/>
2. Some think <hi>Kneeling</hi> an adoration of the Sacrament of Bread or Wine.</p>
            <p>Indeed the worſhipping the Bread is practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore our Church expecting ſome ſcruple this way, doth declare at the end of the Communion,<q> That <hi>Kneeling</hi> is injoyn'd, for a ſignification of our humble, and grateful acknowledgments of the Benefits of Chriſt, therein given to all worthy Receivers—; no adoration is intended, or ought to be done; either to the Sacramental Bread, and Wine, there bodily received; or to any corporal preſence of Chriſt's Natural Fleſh, and Blood. For the Sacramental Bread, and Wine, remain ſtill in their Natural Subſtances, and therefore may not be adored; (for that were Idolatry, to be abhor'd of all faithful Chriſtians) and the Natural Body, and Blood of our Saviour Chriſt are in Heaven, and not here; it being againſt the truth of Chriſt's Natural Body to be at one time in more places, than one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo plain, and rational, that where it cannot pleaſe, certainly nothing can. I am confident, few that make this Objection, know of this Declaration; I have that Charity as to believe, did Men well ſtudy what the Church injoyns, and her Reaſons, and Motives why, they would be aſham'd of their own ſcruples.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Some are againſt the Adminiſtration of it by a ſet Form of Prayer: for Chriſt <hi>Bleſſed the Bread,</hi> &amp;c. but the form of Bleſſing is not ſet down; <hi>Ergo</hi> he never intended it ſhould be given by ſet forms; but that all ſhould be left to their own conceptions, in imitation of him.</p>
            <p>We anſwer;</p>
            <p>That had he repeated the Sacrament, he might, perhaps, have uſed the ſame form again. For he, that gave a form to his Diſciples, and that twice; and did himſelf Pray the ſame words three times in the ſame day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39. 42, 44. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be ſuppoſed to be againſt a form in the Sacrament. If what Chriſt hath not done in this caſe be ſo obliging, what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51930:15"/>
he hath done in the like caſe muſt be much more obliging: becauſe there is a fairer Expreſſion of his Will in this, than can be ſuppoſed in that: therefore if, becauſe Chriſt hath not given us a form for the Sacrament, the Church may not appoint one; it muſt needs be, that ſince he hath given us a General Form, and indeed a <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> ſuited to all Times, Perſons, and Places, that therefore we may uſe no other. Therefore while they argue againſt a Form, they do but put us in a way to eſtabliſh that moſt perfect Form, Chriſt hath taught us, to the excluſion of all other. Some private Teachers have, at this very Sacrament, as well as at Baptiſm; uſed the ſame Prayer, without any material Alterations; of which ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be given; now this, though of their own making, is as much a Form, as that appointed by the Church: yet theſe Men never judge this unlawful; why then ſhould they judge the other ſo? Unleſs becauſe injoyned, which brings the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute to another Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Forms</hi> to the <hi>injunction</hi> of'em. Even Presbyterian Writers, as <hi>Calvin, Jenkins,</hi> &amp;c. tell us, that where there is the <hi>Word taught,</hi> or (as ſome) <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration of the Sacraments;</hi> there is a true Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> according to them, the manner of <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is not material to the being of a Church. The truth is, Chriſt hath given us the Subſtance, but hath left the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to the Church, as <hi>when, how,</hi> &amp;c. and for ſeveral Reaſons the Church thought fit to appoint very early Forms; and <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, that they of the Reformation ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Publick Prayers;</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper.</hi> He ſpeaks this by way of Purgation, and ſaith that their Church is falſly accuſed, in that it is ſaid, ſhe hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the <hi>Miſſa.</hi> This is one difference he makes between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that Spirit of Phanaticiſm, which he elſewhere ſaith is crept into the World; that delights in corners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch was the ſenſe of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion preſented to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, by the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> in the Name of the Proteſtant Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi> Therefore

theſe Men do reproach, and condemn not only the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers from Popery beyond the Seas; whom they pretend to admire, and call the <hi>Lights of the World:</hi> But <hi>our</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and that Reformation too; which even themſelves are apt to ſpeak the greateſt Mercy, that God hath done to his Church in theſe Nations. And indeed ſuch ſcruples ſerve only to evidence to what Unreaſonable exceſſes a wild, and roving ſpirit is apt to run Men; and how deſtructive a lawleſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is to all Religion, and Government in the World. And if any Form for the Communion be allowed, there can be no Objection againſt that appointed by our Church; for however ſome Parts of our Liturgy be cavill'd at, this hath eſcap'd as free as any. For thoſe Men, who put in their Objections againſt the Common Prayer to the Convocation called by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1662. had nothing material in this Service to fix upon: but that they may ſay ſomething, they plead a little impropriety of ſpeech in the Prayer after Receiving, <hi>viz.</hi> may <hi>be fulfill'd with</hi> thy Heavenly Grace. Which is but a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignifying ſatisfactory meaſures of Divine Bleſſings; a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>filled full</hi> with thy Heavenly grace. While Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf hath acknowledged, that he hath ſometimes heard ſuch <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers from his <hi>Non-Conforming Brethren,</hi> that no wiſe man could ſay, <hi>Amen</hi> to 'em.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Object.</hi> Is <hi>mixt Communions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we plead; that our Saviour, who knew the hearts of all men, gave the Sacrament to <hi>Judas,</hi> even after he had Covenanted to betray him. For, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 14. he ſat down with the Twelve, of which number <hi>Judas</hi> was one: <hi>V.</hi> 19. 20. he inſtitutes, and gives this Sacrament; which done, he faith <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>The hand of him, that betrays me, is with me on the Table:</hi> Therefore <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent, when it was given; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did receive with the reſt, unleſs excluded, or ſuſpended by our Lord; which cannot be ſuppoſed; becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no mention of any ſuch thing, and we ought not to preſume beyond what the Text may ſeem to bear. And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51930:16"/>
2. When our Saviour ſaid, that one of them ſhould betray him; <hi>V.</hi> 21. they are ſurpriz'd, and inquire, <hi>Maſter is it I?</hi> But ſuch an Excluſion, and ſuch a Declaration immediately upon it, would have given 'em a juſt ſuſpition, who it was.</p>
            <p>The Condition of the Church in this World is <hi>mixt,</hi> and therefore is compared to <hi>a field of wheat full of tares:</hi> which Argument <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks largely to in his Inſtitutions againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Novatians.</hi> It is contray to that Right, which Baptiſm gives to every Perſon, till ſuſpended by the Miniſter, or excluded by the Church. Therefore though the impure <hi>Corinthian</hi> was meritoriouſly Excommunicate upon the commiſſion of the Fact; yet he was not legally ſhut out, till it was made the Act of the Church: till which time, he had a Right ſtill to come. For which reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo preſſing to that Church, to <hi>purge out that leaven.</hi> And in the interim we do not find any Precept, or Example, of a Separation from the Communion of that Church, becauſe that Perſon was not yet ſhut out. Nor from the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> where there was ſuch a defection to <hi>Moſaick</hi> Rites, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you labor in vain.</hi> None from <hi>Laodicaea,</hi> or <hi>Thyatira.</hi> And therefore what Texts ſoever they found this Opinion on are abuſed: for we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any place contrary to the Practice of Chriſt, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Churches of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men make themſelves more pure, than Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and greater Preciſians than the very Apoſtles. It is a moſt Phariſaical Doctrine, that ſaith to others, like the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in the Prophet, <hi>ſtand off, for I am Holier than thou.</hi> The wickedneſs of this conceit will appear from hence, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That it adds to the Commands of God; for which cauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that theſe Men are <hi>rigidiores multò quàm Paulus,</hi> much more ſevere, than <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who bids every one to examine <hi>himſelf,</hi> but not others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It puts men upon Uncharitable cenſures, and judging of other men; contrary to the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Judge not</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51930:16"/>
               <hi>that ye be not judged;</hi> and contrary to the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. and <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Who art thou, that judgeſt another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſuppoſes another man's Sin, which I have no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or been, in any point, a partaker of; may pollute the Ordinance to me, though duely prepared my ſelf; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles Doctrine, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>to the pure every thing is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This Doctrine doth unavoidably deſtroy the Churches Unity, Order, and Peace; for we can never joyn with any Church in the World, but we ſhall find <hi>mixt Communions:</hi> and therefore muſt be always ſhifting, forming, and gathering of new Churches. And that cannot be a Duty, which puts men upon the breach of thoſe Undeniable, and indiſpenſable ones, viz. <hi>Charity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Order,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a fit Opinion to make men <hi>Seekers;</hi> but ſuch as ſhall never find. Therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that men do in vain ſeek a Church <hi>nullo naevo inſperſam,</hi> that hath no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and mixture in it. And if any pollute this Ordinance, I ſhould think it is theſe very men, who are ſo uncharitable, proud, and cenſorious, which are the Sins of the Devils; and ſtand as directly oppoſite to the Nature, and deſigns of the Goſpel, as the groſſeſt luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Inſtitut. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. he hath no excuſe, <hi>qui ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam Eccleſiae communionem deſerit: ubi Dei verbum praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur, &amp; Sacramenta adminiſtrantur,</hi> who forſakes the external Communion of that Church, where the Word is Preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred. Elſewhere he ſaith, ſuch are <hi>Phrenetici Spiritus,</hi> mad hot-headed People. <hi>And tanti Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae ſuae Communionem facit Dominus,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord ſo highly eſteems the Communion of his Church, that he reckons thoſe Renegado's, and Deſertors of their Religion, whoever ſhall alienate themſelves from any Chriſtian Society, which hath the Miniſtry of the Word, and Sacraments. And <hi>Poterit vel is Doctrinae, vel in Sacramentorum adminiſtratione—Vitii quidpiam obrepere, quod alienare nos ab ejus Communione non debeat.</hi> Every
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51930:17"/>
Error in the adminiſtration of the Word, and Sacraments, is not a ſufficient cauſe of Separation. <hi>Luther</hi> on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> ſaith they are <hi>Apoſtles of Men,</hi> but never ſent by God, who creep into corners, and do not enter into the Publick Church. According to whom, ſeparation upon any of theſe Pleas is an evidence of a wild, and Fanatick Spirit. Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> himſelf at laſt ſaw the endleſs Confuſions, which Phariſaical Spirits, that think no Church pure enough for 'em, began to lead men to; and therefore about the middle of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Godly man's Ark,</hi> endeavours to check this growing Miſchief; <q>Take heed of ſeparating from the Publick Aſſemblies of the Saints. I have found by Experience, that all our Church Calamities have ſprung from this root; He, that ſeparates from the Publick Worſhip, is like a man tumbling down an hill, and never leaving, till he comes to the bottom of it. I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late many ſad Stories of Perſons profeſſing Godlineſs; who out of diſlike to Church-Meetings, began at firſt to ſeparate from 'em: and after many changes, and alterations, are turned ſome of 'em Anabaptiſts, ſome Quakers, ſome Ranters, ſome direct Atheiſts. But I forbear, you muſt hold Communion with all thoſe Churches, with which Chriſt holds Communion: you muſt ſeparate from the Sins of Chriſtians, but not from the Ordinances of Chriſt. Take heed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching the Churches of Chriſt, leſt you prove Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, inſtead of being true Chriſtians.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When men once have an itch after Novelties, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reformation; every one is finding fault with what others do, till at laſt they can find no Church, or Communion pure enough for 'em; becauſe not ſuited in all Points to their own humors. Therefore Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> in the next Page doth wiſh us to avoid, as <hi>Soul-Poyſon,</hi> all Doctrines, which</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tend to <hi>Liberty,—</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Which hold forth a ſuperſtitious ſtrictneſs, above what is required in the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Which are Antimagiſtratical, and Antiminiſterial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51930:17"/>
But ſuch is this Doctrine of refuſing the Sacrament on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>mixt Communions;</hi> and therefore, according to Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> ought to be avoided as <hi>Soul-Poyſon.</hi> We need no other Arguments againſt a Separation from our Church, than the Writings, and Practices of the firſt Reformers from Popery both beyond the Seas; and in this Nation. The Puritans againſt the Congregational way; and (which differs in terms only) the late Presbyterians againſt the Independents.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Object.</hi> is againſt <hi>Compulſion,</hi> eſpecially from the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>This is no more than <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did in the caſe of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which anſwered to this Sacrament. For 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 5. <hi>Proclamation was made from Berſheba to Dan; that they ſhould come, and keep the Paſſover:</hi> which was occaſion'd by the neglect of it, as now amongſt us: and this ſtands recorded to the praiſe of this Pious King. Now the Goſpel doth not leſſen the Power, or the care of Kings over their Subjects. Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, never tampered with the Civil Government. Religion then never ſtrip'd the Crown of Prerogatives under Pretence of the Peoples Privileges. Therefore Kings may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as much now, as then. Whence Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf doth grant, that the <hi>King may Command the Subject to his Duty.</hi> Elſe certainly he may Command nothing at all. And in his <hi>Apol.</hi> That the <hi>Kings Laws bind the Conſcience, to a Conſcionable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all his lawful Commands:</hi> And therefore to this Duty of the Sacrament in particular, this being a lawful Command, becauſe commanded by Chriſt himſelf. But let it be on all ſides ſuppoſed a Duty, yet ſtill we have two Objections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They <hi>are not prepared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer,</p>
            <p>There may be a Proximate, and accidental unmeetneſs even in good Men; for ſome emergent occaſions, ſome ſuddain ſurprize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may diſcompoſe, and diſorder the Soul: at which time we do not cenſure a forbearance: But an habitual
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51930:18"/>
unmeetneſs is inexcuſable. God, and the King, exact this Duty of you, and if from one Sacrament, and Year to another; you ſtill cry, you are unprepared; the Sin is your own. Your neglects cannot null a Duty, and take off the Obligation of a Law. Should they wait, till you ſay, you are ready, that day, I believe, would never come.</p>
            <p>Doeſt thou really think, thou art unprepared, and yet makeſt no Conſcience of preparing thy ſelf? This implies the giving up of thy ſelf, as loſt for ever. For if thou art unmeet for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, thou art unmeet for the Fellowſhip of the Saints: if unmeet to eat, and drink in his Preſence, beſure thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for the Beatifick Viſion. For he, that is not qualified for a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moter, cannot be qualified for a more intimate Communion.</p>
            <p>This brings thee into a neceſſity of Sin; for he, that is idely unprepared; ſins if he eats; and ſins, if he lets it alone; for the one is an abuſe, the other a contempt of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Canſt thou plead, thou art unprepared to ſend thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Servants, to be Catechiſed? yet obſerve it, the ſame Men, that neglect the one, do neglect the other. Which gives me to preſume, that this is but a Pretence, not a real Cauſe: and that thou think'ſt thy ſelf not ſo much unmeet for the Ordinance, as the Ordinance unmeet for thy ſelf. Let men comply with their Duty in all things, but this; and then I ſhall have ſome Charity for ſuch a Plea.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> If it be never ſo much a Duty in it ſelf, yet it is not ſo to them; becauſe their Conſciences are not ſatisfied, and <hi>whatever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be thy Conſcience, it is ſuch an one, as brings thee into a Neceſſity of Sin. For if thou eateſt, thou ſinneſt againſt thy ſelf: if thou eateſt not, thou ſinneſt againſt God, and the King. Now God never brings any man into a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Sin: therefore this is not a Conſcience according to Godlineſs, as ſome ſpeak, but an Erroneous one. Therefore ſuch men ought to uſe all the means of Information, that they may come without prejudice to this Duty. And in the mean
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51930:18"/>
time muſt be content to ſuffer. For they muſt not think, their Diſſatisfactions may ſuperſede the Laws. For if ſo, all Laws would be made uſeleſs; and no man would ſuffer for any thing, which they pleaſe to plead Conſcience for.</p>
            <p>It is but few years, ſince the Parliament, by way of <hi>Ieſt</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon all Perſons in Places of Truſt, or Profit; which Act is ſtill in force, and was promoted eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the late Lord <hi>Shaf—</hi>and Presbyterian Party; under Pretence of diſcovering, and removing Papiſts. But not a man then cried out of <hi>Compulſion,</hi> and <hi>Impoſitions on the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men;</hi> nor were any excuſed from theſe Pleas, that they are not prepared; or that it is againſt their Conſciences. Whence they lay that upon others, which they reckon a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves. And would not be done by, as themſelves do to others. Down from late Repreſentatives, to Magiſtrates, and Common Councils, even to the Petty Offices, and Places of the Kingdom, I have ſcarce yet met with a man, but what, for the gaining his Point, could allow of an <hi>Occaſional Communion;</hi> but when there is nothing but plain Duty in the caſe, we have noiſe about <hi>Compulſion,</hi> and <hi>Tender Conſciences;</hi> are clog'd with Caſes, and Scruples; and hear nothing <hi>but touch not, taſt not, handle not.</hi> Which renders the ſincerity of this Plea much ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſpected. And becauſe ſome will never be wrought upon, we come,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To what is required of the <hi>Church-wardens:</hi> and that is, to Preſent <hi>ſuch as obſtinately refuſe.</hi> They are ſworn to do the Duties of Church-wardens; which Duties are contain'd in the Book of Articles to that purpoſe; where the Preſenting ſuch is expreſly required. No man will preſume that the Fathers of our Church will exact that of you, which is not your undoubted Duties: and was it put upon iſſue, whether this be ſo or not; no man will doubt, which way the tryal would go.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Church wardens</hi> are the Guardians of the Church; whoſe Obligations reach not only to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> of it; but to Loite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Diſturbers of the Congregation; to all Contemners,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51930:19"/>
and Depravers of the Liturgie: to all obſtinate Neglecters of Publick Prayers, Catechiſing, and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence they are call'd the <hi>Biſhops Eyes;</hi> by whom he ſees the State, and Condition of every Pariſh within his Juriſdiction, all which they are Sworn to do; they have given their Faith; and the Oath of God is upon 'em: and how they may ſatisfie their Conſciences without performing the Matter of that Oath, needs a good Caſuiſt to tell us. In this caſe Pity, and Charity to others, is the greateſt Cruelty, and Injuſtice to your ſelves. Such Favors are downright Perjuries. And there is no man, that deſires you to commit this Sin for his ſake, that would willingly bear the Puniſhment of it in your ſtead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is requir'd of us, that, in caſe of failure; we ſhould Preſent the Church-wardens and <hi>ſuch as obſtinately refuſe</hi> at once. The Law ſaith, they <hi>ſhall,</hi> but we <hi>may</hi> Preſent: we have the Power, but they the Neceſſity. Yet how far the Duty of <hi>obeying every Ordinance of Man;</hi> and the <hi>Oath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience,</hi> may oblige us in this particular: and how far the word [obſtinate] is to be taken, ſeems worthy our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. And becauſe that term [obſtinate] ſeems a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation reſtraining this Duty of Preſenting to ſome Neglecters only; that we ſhall preſent, not all, but <hi>ſuch;</hi> I purpoſe in a day, or two; to preſent every Family in both Pariſhes with a Copy of theſe Diſcourſes; that they may peruſe, and weigh 'em at leiſure: whereupon I hope that all under Obligation will either receive this <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or give me the reaſons of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes; that we may be able to judge whether they be <hi>Obſtinate,</hi> or not; and be capable of ſhewing our ſelves both Sober, and Honeſt.</p>
            <p>The Puniſhment then of <hi>obſtinate</hi> refuſals is <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which ſome men do incourage themſelves to the hazard, and contempt of, by pleading,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it was not uſed anciently, as now, upon light Cauſes, as differences in the mere Circumſtantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51930:19"/>
We anſwer: Differences may be little in themſelves, but if they lead to Separation, they are not to be accounted <hi>little;</hi> becauſe they then deſtroy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was decreed of old, that if any keep Separate Meetings, the Presbyter ſhall be depoſed; and the People Excommunicate: and there be inſtances of ſeveral, that have ſuffered accordingly. The Infancy, and Perſecutions of the Church, not only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Order, and good Government; but kept many things practiſed in thoſe times from our knowledge. If there is uncertainty as to the Succeſſion of Biſhops, and that in the moſt famous Churches then in the World, as <hi>Rome, Jeruſalem, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi> we muſt not expect an account of all the Uſes, and Reaſons of Excommunication in thoſe times. What notices we have are ſufficient, though there was much more done, than recorded. Nor is this Puniſhment beyond the Merits of the Cauſe; For Schiſm is directly contrary to the Nature, and deſigns of the Goſpel, which is to Unite us in one Body, to bring us into one Sheepfold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hath a more direct, and immediate tendency, to the Confuſion, and Ruine of Church, and State, than Luſts of the Fleſh have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They plead, that as Excommunication is called <hi>a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Satan,</hi> ſo ſuch Perſons were tormented in Body, or Mind, or both; but now we ſee no ſuch things, whence, ſay they, it is not regular, or not done upon due, and ſufficient Cauſes among us.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That Miracles were wrought for the more powerful Conviction of the Gentiles; and the more the Goſpel obtain'd, the leſs frequent they grew; till they ceaſed in the Third Century, unleſs in ſome rare inſtances: So thoſe ſenſible Evidences of Divine diſpleaſure upon Excommunicate Perſons were extraordinary, and deſign'd only to make Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation terrible to all Ages of the Chriſtian World, and therefore after ſome inſtances ceaſed too. Now men may as well argue againſt the Goſpel it ſelf, becauſe not backed by Miracles ſtill; as againſt the Validity of Excommunication, becauſe not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51930:20"/>
now by ſuch dreadful Viſitations, as before. <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp;c. for Schiſm, and Rebellion, went down alive into the Pit; they, that offered ſtrange fire were conſum'd by fire from Heaven: thoſe, that tempted God in the Wilderneſs were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things were writ for our Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. that we might learn to avoid thoſe Sins, againſt which God had ſo declared his wrath from Heaven. But after-Ages finding no ſuch Judgments on ſuch Offenders, may as well conclude theſe Sins differ in Cauſes, and Circumſtances, and are not the ſame in Guilt, though in Fact; as that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is not valid, and regular, becauſe Perſons are not buffeted by Satan, as ſoon as caſt out of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They plead, That in after-ages, Excommunication had powerful Effects on the Minds and Conſciences of Men: in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bringing 'em by Repentance into the arms of the Church, or by leaving 'em under a reprobate ſenſe; but now no ſuch things. <hi>Ergo—</hi>To which for brevity only thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe times were many Ages nearer the Apoſtles, whence thoſe inſtances of Wrath upon Excommunicate Perſons were more freſh, and warm amongſt 'em, and therefore made more deep impreſſions upon the Minds of Men, than now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The cauſes of Excommunication then were Three, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Practical Immoralities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Falling to Gentiliſm; in Sacrificing to Idols, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Bible in time of Perſecution; for which they were called <hi>Traditores,</hi> and were hardly received into the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The falling away to Schiſmatical, and Heretical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; as appears from Apoſtolical Canons, Councils, and the Practice of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now the two firſt ſorts, being Excommunicate, had no Church to fly to; nothing under which they could ſhelter, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their hopes of Heaven. And therefore they were eaſily convinced, and perſwaded to return. But now generally Men do firſt leave the Church, before the Church doth caſt 'em out: they become uſually Members of Separate Congregations,

where they promiſe themſelves a more certain way to Heaven; than amongſt us; and therefore neither matter Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, before it comes; nor are capable of ſeeing their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when under it. The caſe is like that of the <hi>Publicans, and Harlots</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> on the other: not that I Parallel the Perſons ſo much as the Caſe; the former had no Religion to palliate their Sins, and create an hope; and therefore were eaſily convinced, and brought to a Saviour: but the other truſting to their own Religion would never be wrought upon.</p>
            <p>Then the third ſort, that were Excommunicate for Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they ſtood upon like terms with them amongſt us; each were then, and are now, Members of a Congregation, where they expect Salvation: but here lies a difference, in thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times all men, that were not of their own Party did avoid 'em; and would hold no Society, and Commerce with 'em, which tended mightily to ſhame, convince, and reduce 'em. But now even they, that are of the Church, make hardly any difference between Excommunicate Perſons, and others; as if the thing were not worthy their Conſiderations, unleſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as a Civil, and Politick inſtrument of Government; while all others look upon 'em as <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> comfort, and incou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage 'em; which naturally tends to the blinding, hardning, and rendering 'em mightily uncapable of ſeeing the Evil, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; they are under.</p>
            <p>Now as to the latter part of the Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe, that lay under Excommunication then, were uſually given up to a <hi>Reprobate ſenſe;</hi> but now they continue as ſober, honeſt, and well-diſpoſed after, as before it: whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt the Validity of it as uſed amongſt us, that it binds not in Heaven.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, That by giving up to a <hi>Reprobate ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>hardning the heart,</hi> we underſtand two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's withdrawing his Grace: And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mens betaking themſelves thereupon to thoſe ſeveral Evils, they are diſpoſed to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:51930:21"/>
Some to Debaucheries, and Atheiſm: others to unlawful Schiſms, and Diſturbances; in which many become more blind, hardned, and incorrigible; more ſatisfactorily, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fixed in Deluſions, after Excommunication, than before. Which muſt be imputed to God's departure from them, who depart from his Church, ſlight her Admonitions, and contemn her Cenſures. We may find too many inſtances to prove this, that a man may be under a Reprobate ſenſe, and yet ſeem Religious to himſelf, and others; as many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did. Therefore theſe Objections can take off nothing from the Weight, and Power of Excommunication; but leaves it terrible to every Man, that hath any regard to his Eternal Safety.</p>
            <p>We have now one Argument in the Text, to preſs us to this Submiſſion to every, and therefore to this Ordinance of Man; viz. <hi>for the Lord's ſake:</hi> that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Lord Commands it: therefore out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our Duty to him, we ſhould do it. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is the Author, and Defender of all Order, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>The Powers, that are, be ordain'd of God:</hi> and <hi>V.</hi> 4. He is <hi>the Miniſter of God,</hi> therefore we ſhould Submit to him, for his Sake, who hath ſet him over us. <hi>Fear God, Honor the King,</hi> are inſeparable Duties; he can be no good Chriſtian, who is no good Subject, and no good Churchman.</p>
