            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So this our carnall carion is not meet for a heauenly match, til in the graue it be trained to the incorruptible eſtate.

And firſt all buriall ceremonies may be reduced to two ranks: for ſome are funerals, ſeruing for preparation to; and ſome ſepulchrals, ſeruing for placing in the graue the defunct. The ceremoniall variety of both, whereof my labor were infinite, let be vaine to deſcryue. For to giue but a glance in funerall, the Greke and Romane did burne their dead, <hi>in rogo,</hi> as they ſtyled their funerall fire; the Indean with Got-ſeame did beſmeare, the Schithean ſwallied, the Egiptian pickled with bryme, but the Gerrens a Schithian ſect, after exinteration beſpyced their gutleſſe goodſirs: that ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly,<note place="margin">Sylli. 13. lib.</note> by corruptible meanes they might aſſay to reteene fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue incorruption,<note place="margin">Cicer. lib. 2. de leg. and lib. 3. de tuſcu quaeſt.</note> as Lucian in his Dialogue <hi>de luctu</hi>: And Silius Italicus the Poet in his 13 booke doe teſtifie of many ſuch fooliſh feats. Againe in ſepulchrals, the variety is found no leſſe vaine, euery Nation ſeruing it ſelfe with the owne vowſtie deuiſe. For firſt according to the number of the elements, ſo hes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchrall receptacles of humane bodies fourefold bene found. Some choſing the floting fome for their tombe, as among others the African Lotophagians, others preferred to wither in the aire, as of old not a few in Egypt and Ethiopia, that ſo preuenting the ſtinck of putrifaction by ſcowdring their skins in the Sunne,

For although to theſe that are without ſpirituall ſpectacles, euery minute of our ſepulcromany ſeme not in expreſſe ſcripurall termes to be condemned (being to the ſpirit of God as parenticide was to the Law giuer,<note place="margin">Licurgus.</note> againſt the which he gaue no law, leſt he ſhold not ſuppoſe ſuch inhumane an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) yet by his grace, I ſhall diſcouer their particular conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in euery corrupt abuſe by the ſame.

For although the ten words of Moſes tables, ſeeme onely to ayme at the ten broad

But in reſpect the caſes of ſin, are become ſo infinite and intricate that ſome like mangrels doe participat of diuers kindes: and others ſo ſubtilly twiſted by the deuill, that yet they reſt vnacknowledged. For this cauſe the Lord hes ſupplied the generality of his law as the text, by his remanent word as the commentar. By the benefite whereof we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particularize our ſubtilleſt ſinnes whatſoeuer: and that by two ſpeciall meanes. Firſt by the rule of Analogie, and next by the benefite of example. To the twitch of the which, where expreſſe warrant wants, we muſt either qualifie or controle our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as we ſhall doe in this our particulare anent buriall. That what we ſee therin neither anſwerable to Analogie nor exemple of the word we may conclude it is ſin.<note place="margin">Quint. lib. 1</note> Now Analogy in any thing is that conuenient proportion, whereby euery part is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the whole.

Now ſcriptural Analogie is two fold, the one is of faith, the other of manners. That of faith is the platforme of knowledge that directs vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in all, and euery one of the articles of the ſame, the which by verſing and ſearching the Scriptures may ſo be conceiued in the minde of the faithfull, that in faith they need not erre. And this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy the Apoſt. Ro. 12.6 ſpeaks of: where he ſeems to deſigne the Apoſtolical creed that Tertulian calles the Canon or Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of faith. The which alſo 2. Tim. 2. he commendes vnder the name of the paterne of wholſome words. Againe the Analogy of maners is that platform of right, that we oght to obſerue in euery our action, according to the warrand of the will of God. And this Analogy by ſearching and verſing of Gods law Pſal. 1. the canon of our conuerſation may be ſo learned by the conſcience that for lake of knowledge we need not ſin. And this the Pſalmiſt very frequently calles the path way of God. As Pſa. 17. and 27. and 119. Now this Analogy of manners wherewith here we haue only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, being the morality or the law, exacts thre things in euery our

action. Firſt that the matter done, be good; next that the maner of doing be wel; and laſt in both that we euer ayme at the right end. As in our own particular we ſhall expone. And firſt for burial, it is an action and a good action as being anſwerable to both the general tytles of Moſes two tables, piety and charity: that it ſhold be done no chriſtian wil contrauert: but in the other two, how the ſame may be wel, and to the right end: that is formall and direct, there ſtands the queſtion. In the which cace a chriſtian duety wer to conſult. Firſt with their conſcience the regiſter of the wordes Analogy. The which if a chriſtian of knowledg wold but vouch ſaue to do, he ſhold ſoone finde the oracle of Analogy for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. But now moſt men alas are ſo deeply addicted to affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they neyther make count nor queſtion how or where they ſhould bury: contrare whom one day their criminall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will crye judgement, except they repent.

               <p>THe firſt rule that directs the forme, containes two cautions, &amp; that for good cauſes. For according to the forked foly vſed in buriall, which either is contemned, or elſe ouer caried in pomp, this rule does reſtraine both: by ranging contempt vnder the rule of honeſty and pomp, vnder the rule of order, that they no wayes exceede. Now as for buriall contemptes, if we peruſe humane hiſtories, as namely Caelius, Cicero in his Tuſculan queſtions, Crinitus, and diuers others: we ſhall finde them haue many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators: whereof we ſhall recite ſuch as make for vs. We reade
<pb facs="tcp:19886:7"/>
of the Albanes that of the defunct tooke no care at all: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans vſed them for fulzie: The Troglodites for mockage: The Hircanes expoſed them to dogges, that for the nonce they nuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But among the firſt of this crew were the doggiſh Cyniks, who would in no ſort conſent to be buried. As we read of Minip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus and Diogenes of whom it is recorded, that being to dye, he directed his corps to be expoſed. And being admoniſhed that ſo he ſhould be torne by birds and beaſts, did reiyre a taunt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyring a cudgell to be coutched beſide, whereby to weare his wirriers away. And being inſiſted with that it would be to ſmall vſe, ſince death was but ſenſleſſe: why then (ſaid he) are ye ſoliſt what befall a ſenſleſſe carrion? But this kinde of reprobate Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy rather becomes renigat mindes then chriſtian men. For if reprobates were by the Kirk knowne (as they are with God barred vp from hope) ſo might they juſtly be debarred from the benefite of chriſtian buriall. And this Cyniciſme although we ſeeme not to profeſſe, yet if we walke the land abroad we will finde many folke not flyting free in it. For our Kirk-courtes or yardes, are become more lyke pwind-folds nor burials: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinarly be dunged by peſtring and paſturing brute. Not far from ſubſcryuing the deſperat legacy of ſome that can be content to beſtow their bowke to the burroughmure, if God wold take the ſoule. According to the conceaty reſolution of Theodore, who being by the tyrant Lyſimachus minaſſed with the gibbet,<note place="margin">Viues on the Citty of God chap. 12.</note> anſwered that his own minzeons only had it to feare and not he, to whom all was one, whether to putrifie aboue, or vpon, or within the earth. But as this a buſe is contrare to the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie commanded, ſo is it alſo againſt the common law that prouids buriall to be had in holy reputation. So that to empty the bladder,<note place="margin">O to. friſing. lib. 4.</note> let be the belly about buriall (as they called it <hi>minxiſſe in patrios cineres</hi>) was reput <hi>nefas,</hi> that is iniquitie, let be inciuilitie. And for this cauſe the faithfull after Conſtantine (who firſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued edicts of liberty to edifie temples, whereas before the Kirks had alwaies beene ſerued onely with holy Innes) in founding of Kirks, taking the type at Ieruſalems temple, did among the reſt counterfaite the courts by Kirk yardes, the which for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded decencie they dedicated to buriall vſe. The which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Greeks (as thereby appeares the workes beginners)

were called <hi>Caemiteria.</hi> And that not without Emphaſe, ſeeing (as Atheneus ſayes) it was the name before of ſleeping celles for ſtrangers: and ſo the alluſion wanted not edification. And albeit the reaſon of the reſt of the reſemblance betwixt Temple and Kirk, as of the Quier to the holieſt place within the vaile, &amp;c. cannot ſo eaſily be eſpyed, yet the reaſon of this may well by this rule of decency, according whereto ſince we haue a Country law of our owne extant, enacted for reparation of ruinous Kirks,<note place="margin">Marie Par. 9 Act. 76.

               <p>THe other extremity that commes againſt the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is pompe. The which as it is found more common, ſo it brings with it more perturbation. But for the more particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphering thereof, we ſhall range it in two rankes: the one ſort of it being ciuile or ſeculare, the other ſuperſtitious. Againe the firſt, according to the duplicity of burial ceremonies, is found double. For partly in the funerals, and partly in the ſepulchrals of men it is to be ſeene. In funerall pompe if we ſhould view the cuſtomes of antiquity, and ballance the ſame with theſe of our dayes, as in few thinges we will be found inferiour, ſo in ſome far to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte them in vanity. To be ſhorte for commoditie of this our preſent compariſon, vnder the olde names of Funerall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we ſhall ſet downe the whole auncient funerall proces, and confer it with ours of the new now. All the which ceremonies for memory may be ranked in two ſortes. Whereof ſome did in common concerne the whole funerall preparation:<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> the generall ouerſight whereof, appertained to their <hi>Libitmarii,</hi> that is fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, that among the reſt had the cure of funerall feaſts.

hand in his Kirk, ſhould be celebrate with faſt and meaſurable mourning. The ſecond ſort of their ceremonies, were employed about the defuncts perſone, conſiſting in three pointes. Firſt in mourning for the dead, next in addreſſing the corps for the graue, and laſt in his conuoyance thither.

But in this alſo we are more antick nor antiquity: for in ſteed of humane teeres that beſt can expreſſe the owne ſmart, ſome will haue trumpets; and in ſteed of mourning in the duſt, as they did oft-tymes, we mumchance and mourgean in ſuch dilicate duilles, better feated for wowing nor woing, that heires or widowes neuer dallies more nor vnder their duilles. But the Lord will haue at ſuch hypocryſie in the end. The next point of their perſonall funerals, was their peremptor preparation to the graue, conſiſting in two ceremonies: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that by the Libutinarian cure the dead was weind,<note place="margin">Suer. in</note> the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linctors inbalmed, and Sandapilarianes beſpiſed, the corps of the great, and this alſo is ſuperſtitiouſlie ſometyme exceded among ſome of the beſt rank: on whom after Anatomicall exinteration, Apotheticary applications are ſo exceſſiuely employed, that oft tymes ſuch prodigall profuſion of arromaticall gummes (if they were otherwiſe charitably beſtowed) might make ſundry poore indifferently rich. Now the laſt funerall duety appertained to the Veſpilones, or bear-men, whoſe peculiare calling was (beeing followed in rankes by the Acoluthiſts their friends,<note place="margin">Domit.</note> wherof now the Roman Biſhops hes bereft them) to cary their corps in their coffins to the graue. Such as wee ſee mentioned in Luke 7.14. But among the reſt alſo, how far this auncient ſimplicity is mueterate, who beholdes our great burials may eaſily conſider. For althogh the death by all men ſhould be thoght to be a kynde of defeat from God, yet our Heroik burials are oft led lyke a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall triumphe, wherein the toutting of trumpets, trampling of ſteades, and trouping of men ranking themſelues vnder ſtately ſtanderts, and punicall pinſels, diſplayed for whiuering in the winde, may ſufficiently teſtifie the dedolence of men, as if by an vndantoned courage they would quarrelouſly demand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
<pb facs="tcp:19886:8"/>
in reuenge of the dead. And as if the worme (man) were able to ſtand out againſt the thunder-bolts of death delaſhed by God. but alas, if in death we could count our juſt kinſh we might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather diſmay and feare. For although in the kingdome of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming we ſhall triumph with our head Chriſt, ouer the ſtingles graue. 1.

Wherein for our due deſert here we deſerue with Chriſts theues to haue our legges broken, rather nor in pompe our badges borne. For looke how far fellonie may glory in her fetters, ſo far may we in our funerals wherewith we but feard death. For as ſome Gentiles, where gold is vernaculous and plentifull, their catiues thogh therewith enchained,<note place="margin">Tertul. de habitu mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liebri.</note> yet rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes catiues: ſo to vs, thogh our graue were of enamelled gold, yet it is but our graue, the monument of our common miſery, that by diuine mercy onely may be remedied without farther meanes.

For a document therefore againſt the which, the Lord did cloſly conuey the body of his owne diſſolued Moſes, from being the object of ſuch feckleſſe oſtentation and perillous pompe. Deut. 34.

               <p>THe ſepulchrall pride of men is nothing inferiour. For (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though before we deduced, that among al the elements the earth to be the moſt ſeemely ſepulcher, yet) in the vſage thereof the earthlings hes laboured to tranſcend the earth in pryd, as in a touch we ſhall ſhowe.

and others to mo, yet being of one ſort or family. To the proper kynde of ſepulchers (as in the world, yet for the moſt part out of the Kirk) the choiſe of place hes beene (as many where it remaines) indifferent: euen ſo in the Kirk to the death of Sara it ſeemes to haue beene, at what tyme Abraham firſt to eſchew that promiſcuous confuſion, and for a more actual poſſeſſion of his promiſed Canaan, vnder his pilgrimag, did acquyre a field for his conſtant buriall Gen. 23. wherein he and his Sara, Iſaac and his Rebeka, Jacob and his Lea, three maryed matches in others armes attendes the reſurrection. Gen. 48. And although the eſtate of Gods gathering Kirk then requyred the decency and order of common buriall, yet we finde the neceſſity thereof neuer holden abſolut. For as among diuers neceſſities the meaneſt muſt yeeld, ſo Iacob, hauing his head homeward from Sechem to Mambre (where his father dwelled at his ſepulcher) and within one dayes trauell to his rinks end, ſuſtening in his campe a double irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by death (in the firſt whereof, he was depriued of Debora his vmwhile mothers Nurce; in the other of Rachel, the wife of his choiſe) to auoyde the ſuſpition of ſuperſtitious curioſitie, he yeelds to the moſt preſent neceſſity, and ſuffers the treto ly wher it fell. Eccle. 11. by entombing Debora at the oake of Bethel, and Rachel in the way to Ephratah without farther cariage Gen. 35. So then we ſee that euen after the inſtitution of common buriall, the vſe of proper vpon neceſſity (which beeing lawleſſe can bring no diſorder) was neuer inueterat nor thoght vnlawfull. For as ſound doe they ſleepe by the mure edge that are folded vp in the fauour of God (though it were by the Peſt) as in the moſt ſtately tombe.<note place="margin">Quid.</note> For as fiſhe in euery ſea is at home, ſo we in euery earth, if we be the Lords, to whom the earth and her imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do all appertaine.

VVho wanting well grounded hope of heauen, and ſufficient horror of hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came plunged in infinite errors anent the eſtate of the dead.

the which by vulgar deceiued vote, were ſpirits employed for the benefite of our militant mortality heere. Their bad againe were lykewiſe of two rankes. The firſt was the worſt ſorte: who as the beſt of the good were their Eudaemonies, ſo theſe as the worſt were repute Cacodaemones, or incarnate deuilles,<note place="margin">Virg. 6.

The next were the not ſo bad: who being not <hi>Lares,</hi> but <hi>Laurae</hi> or <hi>Lemures,</hi> that is, bogils or Gaiſtes, were by the world adjudged to ſuch a purgatoriall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that wandring in a vagarant eſtate about graues and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh deſerts, they were ſuſpended till their pennance was ended from eliſean repoſe.

               <p>FOr the tyme when firſt this prat came in practiſe, the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will finde it but an after-ſhot of antiquitie: as the back-treading of tymes will teache For throughout the firſt foure thouſand yeares it reſted vnknowen: In reſpect that during the formeſt two from Adam to Abraham (whoſe Hiſtories the firſt eleuen chapters of Geneſis compryſes) wherein although the fathers at that tyme did neyther want (I doubt not) places of publicke worſhippe nor buriales, yet ſen wee neyther reade of Kirks nor buriales, me kill leſſe of Kirk-buriales. The next two to Chriſt, wherein lykewiſe we finde rather Kirk types nor Kirkes, but all free of buriall. For according as we may equally almoſt, ſubdiuyde that tyme in foure fiue-hundreths of yeres pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodes: In the firſt whereof there was onely Altares of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe to the Tabernacle: the which continued in the next to the Temple: and the Temple in the thirde to the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the vvhich vvith the ſynagogues did occupy the laſt. Now if any Hiſtorie either ſacred or profane in fragment or full in the Kirk or the vvorlde, did euer mention buriall at Altar or Tabernacle, in Temple or Synagogue, I will giue ouer the pleay. VVhere contrary wayes, the ceremoniall vncleanneſſe by the touche of the dead contracted, ſeemes highlie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte againſt that profanation. But leauing theſe Leuiticales to the owne tyme, let vs proceede in the progreſſe of tyme, wherein the conſtant ſilence of the inſuſpect auncients does teſtifie their misknowledgment and diſclamation of the ſame: as a ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is not onely late, but (as many of the Papiſticall punkes
<pb facs="tcp:19886:12"/>
hes ſecreetly ſlipped in the Kirk, without ſolemnitie: And but then at laſt when the Kirk beganne to growe no better worthie, but to become a buriall: as being a denne of theeues, deſeruing the Lords cord-tawes. And if I were poſed of my pettie opinion heerein, as I am ſure, the moſt pure fiue hundreth yeares of Chriſt was free of this euill; as whereof the formoſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the Kirk had no Kirkes till Conſtantines edict. And in the fourth hundreth likewiſe wherein Emperour Honorius tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the miraculouſlie diſcouered relictes of Steuen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the farther honourable commemoration, did lay them in no Kirk, but neere the Cittie walles of Ieruſalem. Yea, in the ſixth hundreth and fourtie foure, we finde an inhibitiue Canon againſt all Kirk-buriall in the counſell of Bracaren. A token that but then that repreſſed corruption beganne to peepe out, that long after became ſtrong. So I doubt not but that it was in the dyſemelleſt dayes onely that it came in, as a late birth: to witte after the error of purgatory, praying and maſſing for the dead, worſhipping of Saintes and their relictes, and hallowing of mouldes. For ſo ſoone as the Kirk-ground came by the opinion of holy prerogatiue for ſoules helpe, the oportunity and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was both ſought and boght to ly there. Lyke the money-changers, who thoght to ſpeed better by their troke in the temple nor any where elſe: whoſe tables as the Lord ouer-threw, ſo may he juſtly our temple-tombes. But (to come as neere as conjecture may lead to Kirk-burials beginning) there hes bene two kinde of Kirks in our chriſtian world (althogh now tyme and commodity of reformation may inueterat the platte) for ſome are common as builded vpon the publick charge that of old were called Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chials, compriſing for the moſt part a millenarie of people.

               <p>NOw hauing found by Analogies lyne Kirk-buriall beyond ſquare, it reſtes to rype vp the rule of exemple. The ſecond of the two meanes, that the Lord hes employed for our eaſier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in his obedience. For as by propheticall inſtruction we are taught what we ought to do, ſo by exemples inſtance we are ſhowen how the ſame hes beene done by others: for authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick exemples are the very practiſed ſpeculation of the Law it ſelfe. Wherein the ſpirit is ſo plentifull, that there is no caſe of our conuerſation,<note place="margin">Ierome on Daniel.</note> that may not either be qualified or controled by ſcripturall exemples; ſeeing they are of two ſortes. For ſome are to be noted as improper, that being certaine ſingular actions of ſome odde men, whoſe warrand if it wanted not, yet being at leaſt extraordinarly vouchſafed, they could requyre no ordinare imitation. Such as the patriarchall polygamie, &amp;c. For as the Lord ſaid to his two diſciples (that after the counterfoote of Elias 2. Kinges 1. would haue commanded a conſuming fire to come downe, againſt the in hoſpitall Samaritanes. Luk. 9.) They are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with an vnknowne ſpirite, that would imitate anomalous exemples. And this ſort (that thou be not deceiued) the indyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Analogy will eaſily diſcerne from proper exemples: whoſe vſe is onely ſet downe for vs. 1. Cor. 10. the which likewiſe are of two ſortes. For as the Lords lawes are either imperatiues of good or inhibitiues of ill: ſo are the exemples conforme. For ſome are of imitation to perſwade good, and others of abſtinence to diſſwade euill. And therefore they are to the Apoſtle types. 1. Cor. 10. that is, exemples anſwerable to the law the Architype from heauen. And ſo throgh this conformity of Canonick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples to Authentick law, exemples becommes no leſſe nor

Where through we ſee that not onely the fiue bookes of Moſes beares the tytle of the lawe, but the whole bookes of the old Teſtaments Bible alſo Ioh. 10.34. and xv. 25. that ſo wee may learne to count the compryſed exemples for conſecrate lawes. For like as the ſanctification and obſeruation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicall day (although it had no more warrand nor Dominicall and Apoſtolical exemples, yet) the ſame does importe a vigorous neceſſitie of law to imitation For euen as in a ſea-fairing flot, the formeſt by ſaile doth fuir before with lantern and flag as fade whom the reſt ſhould follow: or lyke the eagle in ſore, trayning her yong to flee: ſo did our auncient admirals and fathers of faith peſtere the righteous paths, for the vſe of our exemplare imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for our purpoſe; let vs licere looke what light of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plare lawes in buriall hes beene borne before, for vs to followe. And firſt as in the word there is nothing more frequent nor bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall exemple, in all the which there is a tenorall proceſſe ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually and vnchangeably euery-where obſerued, that they are not onely injurious, that count it without ſcripturall direction, but alſo vnjuſt that would infringe anywayes the old forme, that in funerals we finde was ſimple, without pompe or pryde, and in ſepulchers was ſober, without ſuperſtition or profanation of any place appointed for Gods publick worſhip. So that this one-fold Analogie ſo euenly obſerued, did juſtly deſerue in deed the prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall power of a perpetuall law. For ſen firſt we finde the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue paterne of buriall proponed by Abraham: next without interruption of the ſame a perpetuatl practiſe in Iſrael; and laſt a peremptor confirmation thereof by Chriſt, it can be no leſſe nor a law to continue for euer.

we finde frequent. For beſide that buriall in Kirk may be counted with the lintſey wolſey confuſions, or like the commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſundrie ſeeds) it may be put with the legal pollutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the dead: the which was of ſuch ſpeciall profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that to approch the Tabernacle vnder that kinde of vncleannes, was puniſhed with anathematicall excommunication. The reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the which law we ſee Ioſeph is ware to incur, euen with Pharao, tovvard whom (for all his ovvn credite) being vncleaned by the dead, he is enforced to imploy the domeſticks of court, to ſute his libertie of going vp to Canaan, to burie his father.

As one of Heliodore, who (maſgre the Prieſt) making violent irruption in the Temple was ſcourged by God, and plagued with impotency till the Prieſt prayed. But (beſide theſe propheticall, apocriphall, or profane proues) there is a popular experience that long ſince hes founded the opinion, that beſide the profanation of the whol Kirk was odious. The ſacriledge but of a Kirk-ſtone (though it were hid in a ſtrong hold) were better nor a cannon of battery to brangle downe all.

For all they can bring for buriall in Kirk, is builded vp vpon the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foundation of three gripleſſe grounds For firſt there is a crafty ſort that pretends reaſon from the cauſes nature: next there is a comberſome kynde, that vnder cullour of a right claime playes captane play. And laſt the confuſed commons, does argue from their owne vſe and others exemple. The firſt ſect againe hes two ſorts to reaſon the cauſe: The pan-ſauoring Papiſt, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous indifferent. For to the firſt no buriall is bleſt eneugh,<note place="margin">Remiſts in Apoc. ca 9.</note> that is not among the memorials of martyres, and canonized ſaintes for their ſoules helpe in Kirk: In the which religious reaſon (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both dead prayer and purgatory might be taine in to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, yet) I will not digreſſe, but hold on the point. So then where they alledge that religious buriall ſhould be in religious place, and conſequently in the Kirk, they faill in their following:<note place="margin">Durand. de Ecceſia.</note> as by their owne domeſticke diſtinction of hallowed places may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. For (fen ſome they call ſacred as quiers, and others <hi>ſancta</hi> or holy, as Kirks: a third ſort religious as buriall courts) it will rather follow that buriall an action of the religious ranke onely ought to be reſtrained from the whole Kirk to the court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. For indeed (to ſpeake lyke no Papiſt) properly no place by it ſelf is more holy nor others, for al the earth is the Lords Pſa 24 1. yet in a metonimicall meaning, the continent Kirk is called ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or holy for the ſeruice of God contained therein,<note place="margin">Conci.

And ſuppoſe that it were by nature to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among indifferentes, yet it cannot remaine of that kynde. For by the Apoſtles law 1. Corinth. 10. all indifferent libertie is bounded by edification and neighbourly loue, the which in Kirk-buriall a man cannot keepe; becauſe it breedes a kynde of contempt of the ſecluded ſorte, and a ſtumbling offence to the tender. And although it was long (yet louſelie) held as indifferent in the doylde dayes, yet beeing now but vmwhile, and as an hes-beene, ſhould neuer be more.

The patron doeth reaſon his right to proceed of the reſeruation of a buriall priuiledge at the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dedication of their Kirks by their forebeares; wherein (I think by their leaue) they play faſt and louſe. For what is it elſe to dedicate the ſame thing a Kirk, and yet deteene it a buriall,<note place="margin">De cult. ſan. lib. 3. cap. 4.</note> but to giue with the one hand, and to grippe againe with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Lyke Bellarmine who with a jugling diſtinction maks kirks as they are temples to appertaine to God, but as they are baſilice that is, ſumptuous buildings to appertaine to the ſaintes of their dedication, the which gif-gaffing with God is the verie ſimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſin of Anani and Saphira his wyfe, puniſhed with perdition. Acts. 5. Againſt the which Eſopes taile may well ſerue for a tant, whoſe colzer and fuller taking vp an Innes, in reſpect of their contrare cullours could not lodge together. For the colzear by cowming the walkers whyte webs did weary him away to ſhift for himſelf: As by our col-blacke behauiour heerein we are lyke to doe to God.

And this for the Patrones pretences, which I pray God it may haue power as much for to mooue their affectiones, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:19886:21"/>
able to conuince their conſcience. Againe the kyndely claime by poſſeſſion that ſome cleaues to (that they will haue ſo done old that the antiquitie is forgot) does reſt yet to reſolue. But firſt I would demand at this ſort (as did the King at the garmentleſſe gueſt, that being called and not choſen came to the wedding Mat. 22.) how came they there? for once they muſt grant me the Innes was the Lords: but how their intruſion hes ejected God out, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe with their anſwere till the great day, or elſe in tyme with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe repoſſeſſe. And if they claime tytle, condiſcend of the kynde. For the Iewes doe compriſe all titular rights vnder one of three: acquiſition, like Abrahams (in the conqueis of the caue Gen. 23.) Heredation, like Iſaacs (ſucceding thereto) lucrifaction, like Iacobs, whoſe wealth was the winning of his owne hand-hammers. But none of theſe ſorts can compaſſe the Kirk. For if they call it conquies or the penny-worth of their pecunial pryce, that is but ſimony ſold &amp; ſacriledge boght. Is it their heirſhip by anceſter right? they ſucceed to a vice by inqueſt of error. For ther can be no cedence to ſuch a ſucceſſion. And laſt, for to win ſuch a wagde, ſen none can propone ſuch a pryſe, I think ſhame ſhold neuer let them ſay it. The beſt then remaines, that what heerein by cauillation, with Zacheus, they doe vnjuſtly poſſeſſe, they male at leaſt (within him) to the intereſſed Kirk, an one-fold redreſſe in the feare of the Lord. The camſhoch commons now at laſt coms in a rere warde to debate the cauſe: who rather flytes nor formes reaſon, ſome from domeſtick vſe, others from exoticke exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Or by what reaſon did the firſt of thy vpward lyne that lyeth in the Kirk, leaue off his forbeares laire that lay in the yarde, if not farther yond? But this reaſon I may rightly regyre: that ſen the firſt followers of that foly in buriall Apoſtaſie, ſhaping themſelues ſchiſmatick Kirk-ſepulchers, did lawleſly leaue the auncient laire of their better aduyſed elders, they are vnworthy of imitation. And to pretend

For althogh Jacob ſeeme to vrge it Gen. 49. and that to entertaine his poſterity in full hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne (whereof the thre patriarchall burials were a ſpecial pledg) yet did he it without ſuperſtitious reſpect to Macpelaes caue.

For beſide the vnneceſſity of keeping this cuſtome, the conſideration of the impoſſibility of it ſhould reſolue the doubts in reſpect of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional multiplications. For as neither all Adams children, no nor Iaphets Gentiles, can be contained in graue with themſelues, what tombe could intumulate any entyre race of folks.<note place="margin">Durand. de Caen it.</note> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in temple foundations (becauſe nature in graue craues el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-roume, and abhorres to be rufled with ouer frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery) becauſe the center Kirk was both incompetent and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the congregations dead, there was alwayes a circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent yarde of thirty foote in compaſſe at leaſt, or more, if the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of farther confluence requyred, ſet apart to burial bounds in common to all.

For ſince vſe is an euill ruſe vvhere warrand is avvay, let reaſon ouer-rule and ordour reforme.

But the wyte makes a wrong no more the better, nor did the trajection of our firſt parents fall Geneſ. chap. 3. on the author of it ſathan, auailed vvith God. For in ſifting out their ſinne to the far end (from Adam to Eua, from her to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill one at laſt) as he did puniſhe all by proportion (the ſeducing ſerpent with a curſe, the inducing Eua with a croſſe of ſubjection and the grinding paines of her birth, the ouer eaſily adduced A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam with the care and ſweatty labours of this militant lyfe) So may the Lord doe in this proces of ours.

And this far for ſuch patrociny that Kirk-buriall procutors doe vſe pragmatically to pleade. But the practicians now keepes vp for the as good, a reaſon in oddes, that lyke a pittard hes more pith nor all the reſt whatſoeuer, that they vſe to take from the vſe of a forehammer.

And becauſe that a publict law would beſt ridde the martch (if ſo be that ſuch feete may come ſo farre ben) I doe preſent this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the knees of the Kirk to his Highneſſe ſelfe, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our expectation founded vppon his Majeſties gratious reſponſe (not far from the Aſſemblies ſute heere-anent) he wold procure an inacted law to beem fill the Kirk acts againſt Kirk-buriall: whereby ſecluding all from the Kirk-laire, the great ones and good ones whom qualitie and condition does exeeme from popular caſe, may in tyme begin to talke of a tombe, or elſe a new Ile for buriall vſe.</p>

               <head>A recapitulation of ſome former reaſons againſt buriall in Kirk. Chap. XX.</head>
               <p>NOw here ere I end, for the more populare application I will contriue an clench of ſome former reaſones in ſylogiſtick forme: by the which ſelf-momus may ſee Kirk-buriall blame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyablie induced: and that men may in familiar vſe, as it were, beare the ſame about at their belt. For (beſide that wee haue ſhowen it a prat of proud pryde. chap. xj. &amp;c. before) we may proue it alſo to be not onely a ſhamefull ſuperſtition, but alſo a moſt peruerſe profanation. And firſt to be ſuperſtition I proue it this way. All action that is atouer and againſt the ſtatute of the Lord is but ſuperſtition (for ſo the very etimologie of the word doth beare: for <hi>ſuperſtitio</hi> is <hi>quaſi ſupra ſtatutum. (Dei</hi>) that is aboue or at ouer, or againſt the ſtatute of God) but Kirk-buriall is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, yea, againſt the ſtatutes of God, Ergo, it is ſuperſtition. The aſſumption I proue: All that is againſt the wordes Analogie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtatute of God (as none will deny) but Kirk-buriall is againſt the words Analogie. Ergo, it is againſt the ſtatute of God. The aſſumption I proue: All action that is againſt the Apoſtles rule of decency and order in the manner of doing, and edification in the end, is againſt Analogy (for theſe things he does requyre j. Cor. xiiij. 26. and 40. verſ.) but Kirk-buriall is found to be ſuch Ergo, it is againſt the wordes Analogie. The aſſumption yet I proue in partes. Firſt it is againſt Analogicall order of buriall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> read the 15. chap. before. Next it is againſt Analogicall decency,
<pb facs="tcp:19886:23"/>
read chap. 18. Laſt it is againſt Analogicall edification read chap. xvj. Ergo againſt Analogie, and conſequently it is ſuperſtition. Againe I reaſon, al actions that is againſt the authentick exemples of the word, that like lawes are commended to vs for ordinar i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, are ſuperſtition. 1. Cor. 10. but Kirk-buriall is ſo, Ergo it is ſuperſtition. The aſſumption I proue by induction of tyme. chap. 14. and perſons. chap. 17. So that we haue there clearely proued that before the tyme of Antichriſts diſcouery Kirk-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall was vnknowne, and againſt the conſtant tennor and Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of coemiteriall exemples that are contained in ſcripture: the which we haue ſufficiently prouen to haue the force of a law, and of neceſſitie to be followed chap. xvj. So then ſince Kirk buriall is againſt ſcripturall Analogie and exemple, it is ſuperſtition. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that it is profanation, it is lykewiſe manifeſt by the wordes Etimologie: for <hi>profanum</hi> being <hi>quaſi antevel extra farum,</hi> is that that is vnholied, and depryued of ſanctification. And ſo contrare to the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which being (as many think) from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiue particle <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that ſignifies the earth meanes a ſanctified or ſeparate thing from earthly vſe to an holy end. So then I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all tranſferrence of a ſeparate thing from an holy end to a common vſe is profanation. chap. xviij but Kirk-buriall is ſuch. Ibid. Ergo profanation. Againe all Paganiſme or Papiſtry is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation: but Kirk-buriall is both. cap. xij &amp; xiij. Ergo profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So theſe with the reſt of my vnrecited reaſons cloſes vp this concluſion, vſe Kirk-buriall no more. Againſt the which what ſpirit will gaine ſay but that of contradiction that Angels cannot perſwade Whereby ſome do prattle of buriall rather nor learne to dye. But if old canons were to vrge (whereby men was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bury but where they payed their teynds) I ſee not where a great ſort of our cumber ſomeſt Kirk-buriers ſhould ly: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
