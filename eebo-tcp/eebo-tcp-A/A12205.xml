            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to leave the world with a good savour; so

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2557:4"/>
in our Saviour. The nearer to heaven,
the more heavenly minded, when grace
and glory are ready to joyne, the one to be
swallowed up of the other, then grace is
most glorious. All the passages of Christ
are comfortable, but none more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then those Sermons of his, that were
delivered a little before his death; of all
words that come from loving men to those
they love, such are most remarkable as be
spoken when they be ready to die, because
then men are most serious, they being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the most serious businesse: then they
bee wisest, and best able to judge: for the
consideration of their end makes them
wise. And therefore sayth <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> 
               <hi>Oh that my
people were wise to consider their latter
end.</hi> And, <hi>Teach mee to number my dayes,
that I may apply my heart to wisedome,</hi> sayth
<hi>Moses.</hi> And indeed there is no wisedome
to that: for it teacheth men to passe a right
judgement upon all things in the world:
they be no longer drunke with the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the world, they be no longer sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2557:4"/>
with opinion, but they passe an esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of things as they are.</p>
            <p>Besides, love at that time is especially
set on worke. Therefore our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
being now to offer himselfe a sacrifice
on the Crosse, he sweetly delivereth these
words before his departure, <hi>Let not your
hearts be troubled:</hi> Let us heare them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the dying words of our Saviour,
to his Disciples, and in his Disciples to us
all, as in the 17 of Saint <hi>Iohn, I pray not for
them onely, but for all such as shall beleeve in
me,</hi> through their word, for his comforts
concerne us all, as his prayers did.</p>
            <p>This Chapter is sweetly mixt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
counsels, and gratious promises, but
especially it affords matter of comfort:
mark who it is that gives this comfort, our
blessed Saviour; And at what time, when
he was to sacrifice himselfe.</p>
            <p>What admirable love, and care, and
pitie is in this mercifull high Priest of ours,
that should so thinke of comforting his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as to forget hemselfe, and his owne

approaching death; It is the nature of love
so to do, and we should imitate our blessed
Saviour in it: you see how he laboureth
to strengthen them; especially towards his
end, he knew they would then need it most,
and therfore he endeavoureth by all means
to strengthen them both by counsell, as
here by the Passeover, and by a newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>But what need we wonder at this in our
blessed Saviour who so regarded us, as he
left heaven, took our nature, became man;
put himselfe under the Law, became
sinne.</p>
            <p>The words containe a disswasion from
over-much trouble; and then a direction to
beleeve in God, and Christ, comforts must
be founded on strong reasons; For we are
reasonable and understanding creatures,
and God works on us answerably to our
principles. He stayes our spirits by reasons
stronger then the grievance. For what is
comfort, but that which establisheth and
upholds the soule against that evill which
is feared or felt, from a greater strength of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2557:6"/>
reason which overmastreth the evill. If
the grievance bee but even with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
then the consolation workes not; but
Christs comforts are of an higher nature,
then any trouble can be, for hee not onely
disswades from trouble, but also perswades
to confidence, <hi>Be of good comfort, I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasion of this comforting them,
and of remooving their discouragements
was this: In the former Chapter, hee had
told them, that he should leave them, and
that they should leave him, the best of them
all, even <hi>Peter</hi> should take offence at him,
and denie him, and that all the rest should
leave him: From whence they might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the approaching trouble should
be great, That should cause <hi>Peter</hi> to deny
him, and them all to forsake him: And
thence must needes arise great scandalls.
Our Saviour saw by the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
into their hearts, and like enough, in
their lookeshee saw a spirit of discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seyzing on them, for his departure,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2557:7"/>
and <hi>Peters</hi> fall, their forsaking of him, and
the persecutions that would follow. And
therefore Christ discerning this dejection
of their spirits, he rayseth them by this, <hi>Let
not your hearts be troubled.</hi> The heavenly
Physition of our soules applieth then the
remedy when it is the fittest season.</p>
            <p>There was some good in their trouble,
something naturally, and something spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
good. There was ground of naturall
trouble at the departure of such a friend, at
the hearing of such persecutions: For wee
are flesh, not steele, and in that sence, Christ
was troubled himselfe to shew the truth
of his manhood: nay trouble is the seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all heavenly comforts, so as there
were no comforts if there were no trouble:
and therefore this naturall trouble was not
disallowed by Christ. There was likewise
something spiritually good, in this trouble,
they loved their Master, who they saw
was going away; And they knew it was a
shamefull thing for them to forsake him:
there was love in them towards him all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2557:7"/>
this while, Christ could discerne gold in
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oare, some good in a great deale of ill; and
therefore loved them againe, and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it by comforting them, <hi>Let not your
beares be troubled:</hi> They were right in this
principle, that all comfort depends on the
presence of Christ. And so the maine
ground of the sorrow was good. For as all
heavenly light, and heat, and influence
comes from the Sunne, it being all gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into that body: so all heavenly comfort
is gathered into Christ, and therefore must
come to us from Christs presence, bodily
or spiritually. Their errour was in tying all
comfort to a bodily, a corporall presence.
As if it were necessary for the Sun to come
downe and abide upon the earth, to bestow
its heat and influence; and therefore he tels
them, that though he was to goe away, yet
he would send another comforter, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost.</p>
            <p>And then they were overcome by an
opinion, that it would go worse with them
when Christ was gone: therefore Christ
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2557:8"/>
telleth them that it should bee better for
them, and indeed it was better: Christ did
not take away his blessed presence for their
disadvantage, but for their good, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
takes any thing from his children, but
he maketh it up in a better kinde. If Christ
takes away his bodily presence, he leaveth
his spirituall presence, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
            <p>So that though they were led with sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
things and what they saw not, they
could hardly beleeve, yet Christ lookes to
what is good in them, and accepts it: hee
saw what was naught in them, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to purge it, what was naturally weak
in them to strengthen it, and therefore hee
counsels them, <hi>Let not your hearts bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing that I will first observe out
of the words, is, That the best Christians
are subject to be troubled, to be pensive, and
dejected more then should be.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Saviour Christ himself was
troubled, but his trouble was like the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2557:8"/>
of cleare water in a christall glasse.
There was no mudde in the bottome; but
our trouble is of another kinde, and apt to
be inordinate.</p>
            <p>We may carry this truth through the
whole Scripture, and shew how <hi>Hannah</hi>
was in bitternesse of spirit which exceeded
so, that <hi>Eli</hi> a good man mistakes her, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that she was overcome with
drinke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a good King, was in such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse,
that like a crane or swallow he
did chatter. And <hi>David</hi> complained that
his spirit was over-whelmed within him;
And <hi>Ionah</hi> cries out, that he was in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of hell.</p>
            <p>And God will have it so, partly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to our head; and partly that we
may be known to our selves, that we may
discerne where our weaknesse lyeth; and so
be better instructed to seeke to him in
whom our strength lyeth.</p>
            <p>He suffers us likewise to be troubled for
the preventing of spirituall sinnes, pride,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2557:9"/>
and security, and the like.</p>
            <p>And partly in regard of others, that we
may be pittifull; Christ was man for this
end that he might be a merciful high Priest,
and we have much more need to know
and feele the infirmities that are in our
selves, that we may be mercifull to others;
that we may not be harsh and censorious
upon the troubles of others; from want of
which consideration proceeded <hi>Elies rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
in passing that censure upon <hi>Hannah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how shall we know we know that our hearts
are more troubled then they should be? For
I lay this for a ground: That we may sinne
in being over-much troubled, at things for
which it is a sinne not to be troubled; If
they had not beene at all affected with the
absence of Christ; it had beene a sinne, and
no lesse then stupidity; yet it was their sinne
to be over much troubled. In a word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for answer; a trouble is sinfull, when it
hinders us in dutie, or from duty; when it
hinders us in duties to God, or to others.</p>
            <p>Or from duty, that is, when the soule is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2557:9"/>
disturbed by it, and like an Instrument out
of tune, made fit for nothing, or like a
limbe out of joynt, that moves, not onely
uncomelily, but painfully, &amp; becomes unfit
for action: when we finde this in our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
we may know it is not as it should
be.</p>
            <p>There be some affections especially that
are causes of over much trouble, feare of
evils to come, sorrow for evils that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
seize on us. Now when these do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from duty, or trouble us in dutie,
they be exorbitant and irregular.</p>
            <p>Naturally affections should be helps to
duty, they being the winde that carry the
soule on, and the spirituall wings of the
soule: so that a man without affections is
like the dead sea, that moves not at all. But
then they must be regulated, and ordered,
they must be raised up, and laid downe,
at the command of a spirituall understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
when they be raised up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by shallow and false conceits, and
opinions, they be irregular, when they be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2557:10"/>
raised up by a right judgement of things,
and laid downe againe when they ought
to be, then they are right and orderly.</p>
            <p>Now besides the hurt that is in such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
themselves, Sathan loves to fish
in these troubled waters. The affections
are never stirred and raised up irregularly,
and exorbitantly, but Sathan joynes with
them. And therefore we have need keep
our affections of griefe and feare within
their due bounds: Sathan is a curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of any excesse in our passions, and
in just correction (to speake the mildest of
it) God lets loose Sathan to ioyne with
that excesse. And therefore the Apostle
saith wisely, Let not the Sunne go downe
upon your wrath, neither give place to the
Devill, because as soone as ever we give
way to any excesse of affection, Sathan
fishes in these waters, and ioynes with that
excesse. He being a spirit of darknesse,
loves to dwell in the soule when it is in
darknesse. And therefore when it is cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by passion (as all passions beyond their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2557:10"/>
due measure are as clouds that darken the
soule) Sathan that works in darknesse, then
seizes on the soule presently.</p>
            <p>That was <hi>Sauls</hi> case, he was envious at
<hi>David</hi> being of a proud and haughty spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that could not endure competition:
and Sathan took his time to work on him,
And therefore it is said he was troubled
with an evill spirit.</p>
            <p>But <hi>trouble of Spirit</hi> is too large an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I will not now stand upon it,
onely I will shew that we should not yeeld
to excesse of trouble any way. And the
reasons are:</p>
            <p>First, we wrong our owne selves when
we give way to griefe and sorrow that is
immoderate and inordinate: The soule is
as it were put out of joynt by it; we make
actions difficult unto us, the wheeles of the
soule are thereby taken off; joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
are as it were oyle to the soule. And
therefore <hi>Nehemiah</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Chap. 8. 10.</note> The joy of the
Lord is your strength; when therefore we
give way to feare, and griefe, and such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2557:11"/>
it weakeneth the soule in action. And
then againe they are as it were a cloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Gods love, and us, and so the soule is
hindered of much comfort and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
ioy enlargeth the soule, but griefe
strengtheneth it: comfort raiseth up the
soule, griefe and sorrow weigh downe the
soule. A Christian should be of a straight,
upright. and enlarged spirit. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the spirit is streightened. when it is
prest downe and deiected, a Christian is not
in his right minde, in his due and proper
frame.</p>
            <p>Besides, if we regard God himselfe, we
should take heed that the soule be not thus
distempered: for by over much sorrow and
griefe what a great deale of dishonour do
we to God, it proceeding from a mistake
of his goodnesse and providence? And
with over much feare and sorrow, there is
alwayes ioyned murmuring and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and a spirit unsubdued to God, and
his Spirit. There is a wronging as of his
care in providence, so of his gratiousnesse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2557:11"/>
in his promises. There is a grieving of his
good Spirit, a questioning of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if he did not dispose of things as
he should, when we will have it one way,
and God will have it another way. There
is likewise a great deale of pride in dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and discontent. The most discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
spirit in the world is the Devill, and
none prouder. It argues a great deale of
pride, and sullennesse to be affectedly sad,
and deiected, as if such worthy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
persons as we should not be so afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Or there were greater cause for us to be
deiected then raised up. Whereas if we bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
our grounds of comfort (being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
as we should do, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
incomparably above the grounds of
our discouragements: so it is a wrong to
God, and his truth, and his gracious sweet
government to yeeld to a dejected sullen
disposition.</p>
            <p>It is likewise a wrong to others: for it
maketh us unfit for any office of love to
them, when we plodde and pore so much
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2557:12"/>
upon our discontentments, and drink up
our spirits, and eate up our hearts, it disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the soule, taking away not onely the
strength, but also the willingnesse of the
soule.</p>
            <p>Besides the scandal that it brings on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the best wayes, as if there were
not enough in Religion to comfort the
soule.</p>
            <p>But you will say, Religion breeds a great
deale of trouble, and pensivenesse. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the speech of the shallow people of
the world, Religion makes men sad.</p>
            <p>And it is true that as our Saviour Christ
here had made his Disciples sad, by telling
them that they would leave him, and that
a great scandall would be taken at his
Crosse, and shamefull suffering; but yet
withall bids them not be troubled, and
gives you grounds of comfort; so Religion
will make men sadde; For it discovers
truths, and sad truths. I but the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will cheare them up againe, yea it casts
them down, that it may raise them up. The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2557:12"/>
uSnne in the morning raiseth clouds, but
when it hath strength it scatters them. God
intending solid. and substantiall comfort.
doth first beget troubles, and discovers true
grounds of trouble: he lets us see that all
is not well, but still as Religion brings any
trouble, so it brings with it greater reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
against thse troubles: and that God
that raiseth a soule to see just matter of
griefe, will by his spirit shew its due, and
right portion in comfort. Thus to be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
and sad in some measure is from
Religion, but that which will prevent the
excesse and over measure of it, is from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
likewise.</p>
            <p>So that it is a scandall to Religion to be
over much dejected.</p>
            <p>Besides, though we should be troubled
for sinne, yet to be over much troubled
for sinne is a dishonour to Christ, and to
the love of God, in Christ: for it is as if
we had not in him a sufficient remedy for
that great maladie. As be it griefe for the
troubles of the Church: as not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2557:13"/>
at the affliction of <hi>Ioseph</hi> is branded
for a sinne. So to be too much cast downe,
as if Christ had cast off the government
from his shoulders, or had not the name of
the Church on his breast in heaven (as the
high Priest had the names of the 12 Tribes)
in his breast plate, to be so cast downe as to
be taken off from prayer, and from the use
of all good meanes to helpe the Church,
this is sinfull. So also when griefe for sinne
makes us forget the mercies of God in
Christ, to forget the healing vertue of him
our brazen Serpent, to neglect to search
our grounds of comforts, and to yeeld to
Sathan, to temptation. Even over much
sadnesse, though it be for sinne, or for the
Church, it is hurtfull and scandalous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iosuah</hi> was much cast downe when he
saw it went not well with <hi>Israel:</hi> but get
thee up <hi>Iosuah,</hi> saith God, what doest thou
lying here? up and do thy duty; consider
what is amisse: There is an <hi>Achan</hi> in the
Campe: and so when things go not well,
let not your thoughts be conversant about
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2557:13"/>
the matters of trouble, so much as about
your duty. So we see it is incident to Gods
people to be over much troubled, and we
see also the reasons why it should not be
so, because it is injurious to God, to our
selves, and others every way.</p>
            <p>And after all this there is much reason
in this that Christ hath forbidden it, let not
your hearts be troubled.</p>
            <p>But Christ could as well have cured it
being God,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> as easily as forbidden it.</p>
            <p>It is true, but he cures it by forbidding
it:<note place="margin">Ans.</note> with the words, there went forth a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of comfort into their hearts, an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of grace, accompanied his commands,
for the word, and Spirit God, together,
Christ deales with men by men. The spirit
of comfort is a spirit of truth, and therefore
God comforts by truths. He gives us san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
understandings, and affections, and
then works on them by sanctified truths.</p>
            <p>And sometimes Christ cures it by reall
comforts, for comforts are either rationall,
which are fetched fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grounds, which faith
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2557:14"/>
ministers, or reall from the presence of any
thing which comforts; as the sight of
friends, or the accommodating of us in any
thing wherein we see the love of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed:
how many reall comforts doth
God bestow, when he fitteth us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
in our way to heaven, so that
we may teade the love of God in them?
God doth not onely comfort us by his
gracious promise, by his Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
administring heavenly comforts
by them, but also by the conveighing of
himselfe, and his love by outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that we enjoy in the world: howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
carnall men abuse them, making all
things to work for the worst: yet that love
that intends heaven, sweetens all things
in the passage to heaven to his children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they see the love of God in the least
comfort.</p>
            <p>Againe, observe from this here, let not
your hearts be troubled, what is the seat of
comfort, the heart, the seat of comfort is
the fear of griese: There must be an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2557:14"/>
of comfort suitable to the griefe,
and the heart must be comforted.</p>
            <p>And therefore in <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. Comfort
ye, comfort ye my people, speake to the
heart. As the griefe sinks and soakes to the
root of the heart: so do Christs comforts,
like true cordials indeed, that go as deepe
as the grievance. If the griefe goes to the
heart, the comfort must go as deepe. Now
God the Father of spirits, and the holy
Ghost the Comforter, knows and searches
our spirits; they know all the corners of the
heart, they can banish feare, and sorrow,
out of every cranny; and bring light, heat,
and influence into every part of the soule.
And therefore Christ saith, Let not your
hearts be troubled.</p>
            <p>Now for the wayes whereby we must
labour to comfort our hearts (amongst
many that I might speak of) I will name a
few.</p>
            <p>First of all, there must be a due search
into the heart, of the grounds of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for oftentimes Christians are troubled,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2557:15"/>
they cannot tell wherefore: As children
that Will complaine they know not why. I
speake not of hypocrites that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of that which is not a true griefe to
them; like some Birds that make greatest
noyse, when they be furthest from their
nests: But of some poore Christians that
are troubled, but distinctly know not the
ground of it. But search the heart ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and truly to the bottome of it, and
see if there be not some <hi>Achan</hi> in the Camp,
some sinne in the heart (for sinne is like
winde when it gets into the veines, it will
have vent, and a troublesome one: and so
will sinne. if it get into the soule) it is that
indeed which causeth all trouble. And
therefore search your hearts throughly,
what sinne lyeth there unrepented of, and
for which you have not beene humbled.</p>
            <p>And when you have found out your
sinne, give it vent by confession of it to
God, and in some cases to others.</p>
            <p>And when we have done so, consider
what promises, and comforts, in the word
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2557:15"/>
of God are fitted to that condition; for we
can be in no condition, but there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
for it, and promises fitted to yeeld
comforts for every malady. And it will be
the wisedome of a Christian to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the remedy to the sore of his heart.
And therefore we ought to be skilfull and
well seene, in the word of God, that we
may sore up comforts before-hand. Our
Saviour Christ tels them before-hand of
the scandall of the Crosse, and of <hi>Peters</hi>
deniall, that they might lay up strength and
spirituall armour against the day of tryall.
Those comforts do not (for the most part)
hold out in the day of adversity,<note place="margin">Non durant in adversis quae non in pace quaesita.</note> which
were not procured in the day of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
It is not wisedome to be to learne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
when we should use it: and therefore
let us be spirituall good husbands for our
soules, by storing up comforts out of the
Word of God, and then we shall have no
more to do, then to remember the comforts
that we did before-hand know.</p>
            <p>And there be some promise of more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2557:16"/>
generall use, that are <hi>Catholica,</hi> fitted for
all sorts of grievances: and of these wee
must make use, when we cannot think of
particular ones. As the promises that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
forgivenesse of sinnes. Thinke of
Gods mercy in pardoning sinne with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
because sinne will be presented
us in such terrible colours, that if God be
not presented in as gracious colours, wee
shall sinke: and therefore set out Christ in
his mercies, and all sufficiencie, when sinne
is aggravated to be in its hainousnesse, and
out of measure sinfulnesse: as the Prophet
<hi>Michah</hi> doth, Who is a God like our God,
that pardoneth iniquitie, transgression, and
sinne, &amp;c. Likewise how many promises
and comforts are there in that one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
Luk. 11. <hi>He will give his spirit to them
that aske him.</hi> And here our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
to send the Comforter: all graces
and all comforts are included in the Spirit
of grace, and comfort; his Spirit is a Spirit
of all grace: and therefore our Saviour
thought that the promised enough when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2557:16"/>
be said he would send them the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And so what a world of comfort is in
that promise. <hi>All things shall worke together
for the best to them that love God:</hi> yea those
things that are worst shall work together;
though they be hostile, and opposite one to
another: yet they joyne issue in this, they
be all for the good of Gods people. As in
a clocke the wheels go severall wayes, but
all joyne to make the Clocke strike: And so
in the carriage, and ordering of things, one
passage crosses another, but in the issue, we
shall be able to say, all things worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the best, I found God turning all
things for my good. And I could not have
beene without such a crosse, such an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And so for present assistance in your
callings or straits, remember that promise
made to <hi>Iosuab,</hi> which is repeated in the 13
of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> I will not faile thee, nor
for sake thee: a promise which is five times
renewed in Scripture; and how much
comfort is in that, that he will vouchsafe by
his spirit a gracious presence in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2557:17"/>
whatsoever. And likewise that of
<hi>David,</hi> Psalme 23. Though I walke in the
valley of the shadow of death, yet will I
feare no ill, for thou art with me. It was a
terrible supposition made, that though he
should walke in the valley of the shadow
of death, yet he would feare no evill, These
promises well digested, will arme the soule
with confidence, that it shall be able to put
any case of trouble: As in the 27. <hi>Psalme,
David</hi> puts cases, The Lord is my strength,
the Lord is the light of my countenance, of
whom shall I be afraid? Though thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
shall rise against me, yet in this I
will be confident. If our hearts be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the word of God setled in the truth
of such promises, by the Spirit of God, we
may set God, and his truth, against all
troubles that can arise from Sathan, and
hell, and the instruments of Sathan, or our
owne hearts. And therefore it is a great
wrong to God, and his truth, if we know
not our portion of comfort, and use it, as
occasion serves. More particulars I omit,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2557:17"/>
leaving them to your owne industry, the
Scripture being full of them.</p>
            <p>When we have these promises, let us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
labour to understand them throughly, to
understand the grounds of our comfort in
them, and to beleeve the truth of them,
which are as true as God, who is truth it
selfe. And then to love them, and digest
them in our affections, and so make them
our owne, and then to walk in the strength
and comfort of them.</p>
            <p>Labour likewise to have them fresh in
memory: it is a great defect of Christians,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
they forget their consolation, as it is in the
<hi>Hebrews:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 5.</note> though we know many things,
yet we have the benefit of our comfort
from no more then we remember.</p>
            <p>But above all, if we will keep our hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
from trouble, let us labour to keepe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotred
consciences. Innocencie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
are marvellous preservers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
And therefore if the conscience be
sported, and uncleane, wash it in the bloud
of Christ, which is first purging, and then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2557:18"/>
purifying. It first purgeth the soule being
set aworke to search our sinnes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
them, which maketh us see our need
of Christ, who dyed to satisfie divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
Then God sprinkles our heart with
this bloud, which was shed for all penitent
sinners: by which when the heart is purged,
the conscience will be soone satisfied also,
by Christs bloud. And when it is purged,
and pacified, then keep it cleane, for a foule
soule is alwayes a troubled soule; and
though it may be quiet, yet it is sure to break
out afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> And because there can be no more
comfort, then there is care of duty: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
together with innocencie, let us be
carefull of all duties, in all our severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
let us consider in what relations
we stand, and what duties we owe, and be
carefull to satisfie them all. Neglect of duty
is a debt, and debts are troublesome, when
the soule reflects upon the omission of a
necessarie duty. I owe such a duty to such
a person, I should have done such a thing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2557:18"/>
in such a relation, but I have omitted it, it
is a disquietment, and that upon good
grounds, and if you have beene negligent,
there must be an actuall renewing of the
Covenant, and a setting upon the duty
with fresh endeavours to make amends for
former negligences, or else the soule shall
have no comfort. nor will God suffer it to
admit of comfort. And therefore <hi>work out
your salvation with feare, and trembling.</hi>
The reason that men do still tremble, and
are troubled with this doubt, and that feare,
is, because their salvation is not wrought
out, something is left undone, and their
consciences tels them so.</p>
            <p>But above all, that we may receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
let us labour for a spirit of faith.
Therefore here it is said, <hi>You beleeve in
God, beleeve also in me.</hi> Christ brings them
to faith for comfort. And he sets downe a
a double object of faith, <hi>God,</hi> that is, the
Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: and <hi>Christ,</hi>
considered as Mediator; and Christ brings
them to himselfe, (<hi>Beleeve also in me</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2557:19"/>
he would fense them against the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
scandal of his suffering. As if he should
say, You will hereafter when you see me so
handled, and upon the Crosse, doubt, and
call in question, whether I am God, and
the Messiah of the world, or no. But if you
beleeve in God, beleeve in me. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
in love to you, and mankinde, I
tooke mans nature on me, and am abased,
yet in my greatest abasement, remember
this, that I am God. And surely there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can stay the soule more, especially
when it is deeply humbled, then to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>God in the second person incarnate,</hi> and
abased, and crucified, and made a curse, and
sinne for us, to see the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and earth, whose excellencies we
cannot comprehend, to take our nature,
and in our nature to suffer for us those
things which he did endure. This will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the soule indeed. Can the the soule thinke
that this was done for any small, or to little
purpose? Or can there be any griefe, or
sinne, that should hinder comfort, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2557:19"/>
of the possibilitie of pardon, when
the great God became man, on purpose to
dye for sinne? We may set this against all
discouragements whatsoever. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
beleeve in God, beleeve also in me.
Howsoever you see me abased, yet you
may have comfort in my abasement, for it
is for you. And therefore saith <hi>Paul, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
to know nothing, but Iesus Christ, and
him crucified.</hi> That which proud, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisticall
Heathens tooke scandall at, that
he rejoyceth in, <hi>God forbid that I should glory
in anything but in the Crosse of Christ,</hi> Peace
of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and title to happinesse is all
founded upon Christ crucified.</p>
            <p>And then againe you see he joynes both
together (<hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve also in
me</hi>) to shew the distinction of persons in the
Trinitie, God the Father, Sonne, and holy
Ghost; all our faith is resolved at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one God, but yet withall into three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in that Divine nature, because as there
is God the Father offended, so there must
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2557:20"/>
be a God to satisfie that God, and there
must be a God to reveale, and apply that
satisfaction. The soule is so full of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that nothing can set it downe, but
that which is above the soule, and above
the devill. And therefore for our salvation,
and to give us comfort, there is a necessitie
of three persons in the Godhead. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is offended, God in the second person
must satisfie offended justice; and God in
the third person must reveale, and apply the
Sonne for comfort. And therefore he names
them distinctly (Ye beleeve in God, &amp;c.)
And because we cannot beleeve in God
the Father, but by beleeving in Christ,
therefore he joynes them together (ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in God, ye beleeve also in me,) <hi>No
man comes to the Father, but by the Sonne.</hi>
God the Father dwels in the light that no
mortall eye can approach unto, onely he
hath manifested himselfe in his Sonne,
who is the ingraven Image of his person;
God shines in the face of Christ, and as he
comes down, and makes himselfe knowne
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2557:20"/>
to us in his Sonne, so we must go up to him
in his Sonne, as he saith afterwards: <hi>I am
the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> There is no
going to the Father but by me: nothing is
more terrible then to conceive of God, out
of Christ, for so he is a <hi>consuming fire:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thinke of God as ours in Christ, carry
Christ our elder Brother with us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
God to looke upon us in his Sonne.</p>
            <p>Now now doth faith in Christ ease the
soule in trouble?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Many wayes:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I will name a few. Faith
in Christ banisheth troubles, and bringeth
in comfort.</p>
            <p>Because it is an emptying grace; it
emptieth us of our selves, and so makes us
cleane to another, and thereby becomes a
grace of union. It is such a grace as brings
the soule, and Christ together. Now Christ
being the fountaine of comfort, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
treasured all comfort in him; for the
fulnesse of the Godhead dwels in Christ,
and faith causeth Christ to dwell in us,
brings the soule and Christ together, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2557:21"/>
so must needs make way for comfort, for
it makes us one with the fountain of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
And by its repeated acts derives fresh
comfort.</p>
            <p>Again, faith establisheth the heart. Now
to establish the soule, there must be a solid
Basis, as in building there must be a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and a planting upon that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now here is a foundation, God and
Christ, and there must be a grace to found,
and bottome the soule thereupon, and that
is faith, and so the soule is established. The
chaine and connexion of causes herein is
this. God the Father in Christ, and by the
holy Ghost conveighs comforts, through
the word laid hold upon by faith. It is not
the word alone, for that is but as the veins
and atteries, that conveigh the bloud, and
spirits. So the Spirit being conveighed by
the promises, helpeth the soule to lay it selfe
upon Christ by faith, which is a grace of
union, by which union with him the foule
is established.</p>
            <p>And then againe faith stirreth up such
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2557:21"/>
graces, as do comfort the soule, as hope in
all good things promised. And therefore
in the next Verse he addes to comfort
them, <hi>In my Fathers house are many mansions;</hi>
and faith is the grace that apprehends the
joyes thereof, and hope expects that which
faith beleeves, and that hope becomes an
anchor to the soule, that stayeth the soule
in all the waves and troubels of the world;
and what is the ground of that hope but
faith? Faith stirreth up hope, and hope
pitcheth on the promise, especially of life
everlasting. And thus faith becomes a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
and a stilling grace, because it raiseth
the soule by representing and making reall
to it, better things then the world can give
or take, as it doth also at other times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
heavier things then the world can
threaten: faith makes things present to the
soule; and because it layes hold on divine
things, greater then any thing here below,
therefore it overcomes the world, and all
things in the world, yea hell it self, because
it layes hold on heaven and happinesse;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2557:22"/>
upon the power of God, and the mercy of
God in Christ, and upon those rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:
What is in the world, or in the rank
of good things, but faith out-bids it by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
heaven against it: and what evill is
there but faith overcomes the feare of it by
setting hell against it. I shall have such a
good, if I yeeld to such a lust: I, but what
is that to heaven, saith Faith? For faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Hypostasis the substance of things
to come, makes them substantiall, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the soule, as if they were alreadie
subsistent, being looked upon in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of the word; and so it affects the soul
deeply, and upholds it strongly, even as if
the things themselves were present and so
it banisheth and dispels all discomforts, the
11. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is a Comment
upon this truth in the example of <hi>Moses,</hi>
and many others. What greater object of
feare might be presented to a man then the
angry face and countenance of a terrible
Tyrant? Yet when by the eye of faith, he
saw him that was invisible, and then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2557:22"/>
upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> what was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to
God? When <hi>Micaiah</hi> had seene God sitting
on his Throne, what was <hi>Ahab</hi> to him?
And when the soule hath entred into the
vaile, and sees the glorious things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and happinesse, what are all things
below? Faith sets the Soule on a Rocke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of waves, upon the love of
God in Christ. And therefore set the grace
of Faith on worke, keepe it on the wing,
preserve it on exercise, and faith exercised
will be able to comfort the most dejected
soule in the world, and to raise it above all
the troubels that can be imagined, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words of dying men
departing out of the
world, as being most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and weighty, are
most to be regarded. The
children of God the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
they are to heaven, the more suteable
they are to their heavenly condition. So
was our Saviour Christ, and therefore he
labours to furnish his Disciples (and in
them us) with good counsell to establish
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2557:23"/>
their hearts against the troubles, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
to come. If you consider the time
when he spake these words, it was when he
himself was to be troubled more then ever
was any creature: yet ye forgets himselfe,
and his future troubles, and thinks how to
raise up and comfort them. He foresaw
that <hi>Peter</hi> would deny him, that the rest
would leave him; he foresaw that they
would be dejected, when he was gone: yet
let not your hearts be troubled.</p>
            <p>Oh what a blessed, and sweet Saviour
have we, that thinks more of us, then of
himselfe; that he forgets his own troubles,
and sufferings, and extremities, and thinks
of the supporting and upholding of his
Disciples.</p>
            <p>This came from the same love that
drew him from heaven to earth, which
moved him to take our nature, and in that
nature to dye for us: and what may we not
expect from that sweet and large love? out
of the same bowels of pittie, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
was it (that they should not be over
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2557:24"/>
much dejected) that he saith, <hi>Let not your
hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knew his Disciples were in the state
of grace already: yet he foresaw they were
such as would sinne. Nay, that <hi>Peter</hi>
would deny him. Yet the foresight of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
and their unkindnesse, did not take
away his love, and pittie, and compassion
towards them: Yet notwithstanding he
gives them sweet counsell; nay after they
had dealt unkindly with him, and denyed
and forsooke him. Indeed, he took no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their weaknesse. He knew they
had a secret love to him, that they had in
them a root of affection, and he was so
farre from taking advantage for it, that
presently after, he saith, <hi>Tell my brethren
that I ascend to my God, and their God,</hi> yea
and <hi>tell Peter so too,</hi> that hath dealt most
unkindly of all with me. What a gracious
and mercifull Saviour have we, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
what ill we will do; and when we have
done it, takes no advantage against us,
but is carefull to keepe us from too much
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2557:24"/>
dejection, though he knew we would deale
so unkindly by him: and indeed he did of
purpose take our nature, that he might be a
mercifull high Priest.</p>
            <p>Christians must distinguish bewixt
<hi>dejection</hi> and <hi>griefe:</hi> It had beene a sinne
for them not to have grieved, as well as it
was a sinne for them to be over much
troubled. None are more sensible then a
Christian: <hi>Sentit dum vincit,</hi> he feels trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
whiles he overcomes them.</p>
            <p>Christ speakes to the heart, because the
heart is the seat of trouble: Let not your
hearts be troubled.</p>
            <p>Christ could speake to the eares and
heart at once, his words were operative,
and conveighed comfort with them. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his words, he let in his holy
Spirit, that comforted them. Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in the ministery of his word, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not that we have any abilitie to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them, but together with his word
there comes forth a power. As when
Christ said, <hi>Lazarus arise:</hi> there went forth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2557:25"/>
a power that caused <hi>Lazarus</hi> to arise. As
in the Creation he said, Let there be light;
for the Word, and the Spirit go together.</p>
            <p>Having taken them off from trouble, he
shews a way how to raise them, which is by
faith, Ye beleeve in God, beleeve also in
me.</p>
            <p>The object in beleeving is God, and
Christ Mediator: we must have both to
found our faith upon. We cannot beleeve
in God, except we beleeve in Christ: for
God must be satisfied by God, and by him
that is God must that satisfaction be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Spirit of God, by working faith in
the heart, and for the raising of it up when
it is dejected, all is supernaturall in faith.
The things we beleeve are above nature,
the promises are above nature, the worker
of it the holy Ghost is above nature, and
every thing in faith is above nature, there
must be a God in whom we beleeve, and
a God through whom: if God had not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
God, the conscience would never
have beene satisfied, there would still have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2557:25"/>
beene misdoubtings. And yet if the holy
Ghost sets not downe the heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
it throughly of the all-sufficiencie
of that satisfaction, it would never beleeve
neither. And therefore as ye beleeve in
God, beleeve also in me, for I am God
too.</p>
            <p>We may know that Christ is God, not
onely by that which Christ hath done: the
Miracles, which none could do but God,
but also by what is done to him. And two
things are done to him, which shew that
he is God, that is, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> we
must beleeve onely in God, and pray onely
to God. But Christ is the object of both
these, here he is set forth as the object of
Faith, and of Prayer in that of Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
Lord Iesus receive my spirit.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is God, for that is done unto him
which is proper and peculiar onely to God.</p>
            <p>That which I shall now touch upon is
this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must remember what a strong
foundation, what bottome, and basis our
faith hath; there is God the Father, Sonne,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2557:26"/>
and holy Ghost, and Christ the Mediator,
that our faith may be supported, we have
him to beleeve on, who supports heaven
and earth. As in 1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> and <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. he
created all things as well as the Father; he
is honoured of all as well as the Father;
he that supports the pillars of heaven, and
earth, is able to support the pillars of thy
soule.</p>
            <p>But how doth faith in Christ ease the
soule of trouble?</p>
            <p>In a word, as it carrieth the soule out of
it selfe unto God in Christ, and unto Christ
uniting, and making us one with him, and
so sets the soule above all trouble whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
for being one with Christ, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with him in heaven. And againe,
faith is a grace that presents things to
come, as present, and so establisheth the
soule. It is the hypostasis of things, it
gives subsistance to them in the promise,
and it doth never leave to do it till the
things subsist indeed. It is grace that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth
the soule to heaven, looking
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2557:26"/>
upon things in the word of him that is
truth it selfe, and so giving a kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them throughout all the way to
heaven, till they have a being indeed. And
then faith is out of office, yeelding it up to
<hi>sight,</hi> and the full enjoyment of all.</p>
            <p>But did not the Disciples beleeve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yes they did,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but they had need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their faith, as occasions were renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as troubles were to increase. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in me:</hi> it is as he should have said, Now
there is occasion for you to use your faith,
I must be taken out of your sight, you must
see me suffer, and you had need of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
measure of faith to see me in
such abasement, and yet to beleeve that I
am God.</p>
            <p>We must grow from faith to faith, we
may live by it continually, and we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
with the encrease of God, that as our
difficulties do encrease, our strength to go
through them may encrease also: as they
prayed, Lord encrease our faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:2557:27"/>I gave some directions how we might
not be troubled.</p>
            <p>And first, we must labour to have our
part and portion in Christ, else there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
belongs to us but trouble. There
are two sorts of men in the Church, some
that usurpe a peace and exemption from
trouble, as if joy and comfort were their
portion. Sathan is wise enough not to
trouble them, and they take an order with
their consciences, that they shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them till needs must, till the houre of
death, or some dismall accident: the onely
way for such is to be troubled, that their
trouble may be a foundation of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
For to such as live in their sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
conscience apparantly, so that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may see it, and yet are not troubled,
they have no interest in comfort, nothing
but wo and misery belongs to them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Christ came to save sinners, but it is
broken-hearted sinners, penitent sinners,
that are wearie, and heavy laden under
the burthen of sin. And therefore though
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2557:27"/>
these speake peace to themselves, yet we
dare not speake any comfort to them from
Christ: As <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Ioram, What hast thou
to do with peace, as long as the whoredomes of
thy mother lezebel are so many?</hi> Dost thou
talke of peace as long as thou art a swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a prophane liver, a malitious person,
against all that are truly good, what hast
thou to do with peace?</p>
            <p>Now in the visible Church there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sort that Sathan laboureth to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
since he cannot keepe them in the state
of nature but they breake from him, Christ
pulling them out of Sathans kingdome by
the power of his ordinances, and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he labours to trouble them in their
peace all he can; because they be in the
world, above the world, he enjoyes their
condition, that they should enjoy that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
which he left, the comforts that he
once had, and therefore he labours to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
them in their comforts.</p>
            <p>The estate of such is mixt, here in this
world: they have that in them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2557:28"/>
them, which will alwayes be a cause
and occasion of trouble. They have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in them not altogether subdued:
and they have without them Sathan ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage against them: and the
world opposing them. These although
they have something in them that must be
subdued, yet something also that must be
cherished and strengthened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore
these are the persons to whom comfort
properly belongs.</p>
            <p>In heaven we shall have no need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comforted, for there our peace shall be
to have no enemies at all: our peace here
is to have comfort in the midst of discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and an heart inlarged in troubles.</p>
            <p>He speaks this to them here who were
beleevers already: <hi>Ye beleeve in God,</hi> who
he knew should not be troubled, <hi>Let not
your hearts be troubled</hi> So that to the end
we may be subjects capable of comfort, we
must be such as by faith are one with
Christ, and so reconciled to God. All mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ends in rest, and all the rest of the soul
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2557:28"/>
ends in God, the center of the soule. And
therefore before the soule can settle it selfe,
it must be brought to God, through Christ,
that must be laid as a ground.</p>
            <p>Now there is a threefold malady that
troubleth us, and there must be a threefold
peace, and ground of comfort against
them.</p>
            <p>First, it is a trouble to the soule (when
once it is awakened) that God, and it
should be in ill termes when the soule looks
upon God as angry, and is displeased with
it.</p>
            <p>Againe the soule is troubled, when it
looks upon it selfe, and sees nothing but
turmoiles and seditions there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when it looks upon the affaires
of the world, and accidents here below, it
is full of confusion for the present; and it
is full of feares for time to come, that things
will be worse and worse. Thus the soule
whilest it is in the world, is troubled about
its peace with God, and with its selfe, and
about this evill world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:2557:29"/>Now before the soule can yeeld to any
quiet, all these quarrels must be taken up.</p>
            <p>1 A peace must be made betwixt God &amp;
us, by the great peace-maker, who is also
called <hi>our peace,</hi> and when we be justified
and acquitted from our sins by the bloud
of Christ sprinkled on our souls by faith,
that bloud of Christ speaks peace to the
soule in the pardon of sinne: <hi>being justified
by faith, we have peace with God, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then secondly, there must be another
peace setled in some degree, and that is the
peace of government in the soule; grace
must be above corruption. They will be
together in the soule whilest we are here,
but sinne must not have the dominion.
This is such a peace, not, as will admit of
no conflict, but a peace wherein grace may
get the better; and where grace gets the
better, it will keepe corruption under, and
God gives his Spirit to whom he gives his
Sonne: that as we be in good termes with
God, so our natures may be like his: That
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2557:29"/>
we may love, and delight in what he loves
and delights in, and so may be as friends,
enjoying acquaintance and communion
together.</p>
            <p>I but thirdly, there is confusion in the
world, and many accidents may fall out,
that may disquiet us for time to come. Now
before the soule can be at peace in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
it must know, that being once in
Christ, reconciled to God, and having the
Spirit of God, it is under a gracious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and providence, that disposeth
all things to good, and maketh every
thing peaceable. <hi>Tranquillus Deus tranquillat
omnia:</hi> When God is at peace, all is at peace,
yea so farre at peace, that they have a
blessing in them. The curse and venome is
taken out of them by Christ, who took the
curse on himselfe, and satisfied the wrath of
God, and now they be not onely harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
but medicinall, and helpfull, so that
they be all ours, and made in some sort ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to further our spirituall good.</p>
            <p>When our husband hath all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2557:30"/>
unto him in heaven or earth, wil he
suffer any thing to befall his dearly beloved
Spouse, that shall be disadvantagious, and
prejudiciall to the maine. No, no, he will
not suffer any thing to befall her, which
he will not rule, and order, and over-rule
for the good of the Church, and so there
comes to be that third peace.</p>
            <p>And for the time to come a Christian
knows, that whom Christ loves, he loves
to the end, and the good work begun shall
be perfected to the day of the Lord. He
knoweth he is in heaven already in his
head: <hi>He that beleeves in Christ hath everlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
life,</hi> and is triumphing in glory in his
head.</p>
            <p>And therefore nothing can dismay a
Christian that is truly in Christ; grant the
first, grant all, stand upon good termes
with Christ, be reconciled to God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can do thee hurt.</p>
            <p>But when we at any time come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
such as have comfort for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it sticks here; if I were a childe of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2557:30"/>
God indeed, or if I did beleeve, it were
something. These be good comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and certaine, and true, for they be
the word of God: but what is this to me? I
finde universally, that comfort sticks
there, and therefore we must labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
that objection.</p>
            <p>First of all therfore labour to have a
good judgement of maine truths, that these
comforts are the comforts of the holy
Ghost, and that the word is the word of
God, by a generall knowledge of the truth
of the promises; thou shalt be better able
to apply them. If thou sticke in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
so as not to know them, nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them; there is no talking of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of faith upon them; we must
make that our owne in particular, which
we beleeve first in generall. And therefore
Christians must first be well seene in the
Scriptures, and in the promises there; that
they may know what belongs to them,
and apply them to themselues.</p>
            <p>I but my faith is weake?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:2557:31"/>I answer: The office of faith is to know
Christ, and the weakest faith will do that,
as well as the strongest: And when we are
once one with Christ, then our perfection
is to be found in him. It is the office of
Faith to bring us to Christ, and then looke
to him for all perfections, and for thy title
to him in heaven, and not in thy faith. And
true faith is faith even in the least degree
of it. As we say of the elements, every
drop of water is water, and every sparke
of fire is fire. And therefore the argument
will not hold, if we have not much faith,
we have no faith; or if we have no feeling,
we have no faith. There are many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
errours which we must remove, that
they may not hinder us in the application
of Christ, by distinguishing betweene
strong grace, and true grace; and above all,
labour to know and understand the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace. The tenor of which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
no set measures of grace, but if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
we shall not perish, but have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life, under so gracious and mercifull a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2557:31"/>
covenant are we.</p>
            <p>2 But this is not sufficient to satisfie the
soule. The very cleaving to Christ is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a sufficient ground of comfort, but yet
to obtaine actuall comfort, there must be a
knowledge that we do cleave to Christ,
and beleeve. There may be adherence
without evidence: and there must be an act
of reflexion to cause faith of evidence, it
must appeare to our selves that we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
before we can have comfort, though
we may be true Christians, and go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without it. Therefore let us labour <hi>to
make our calling and election sure:</hi> that is, in
our selves, and in our owne apprehension:
though it be never so sure in it selfe, and in
Gods breast, yet we must labour to make
it sure in our owne breasts, that sinne may
be pardoned in our owne consciences, that
all may be reconciled in our owne hearts,
that what is done in heaven, may be done
in our hearts also, being cleared to our
owne assurance. You see what advise the
Apostle gives, <hi>Give all diligence:</hi> it is not got
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2557:32"/>
without <hi>diligence,</hi> nor without <hi>all diligence:
to make our calling and election sure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> that is,
to make our election sure, by our calling,
and to that end <hi>to adde grace to grace.</hi> It
is the growing Christian, that is the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Christian. Whilest we are yet adding
to every heape, <hi>we shall get more abundant
entrance, and further into the kingdome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> as the Apostle there speaks.</p>
            <p>3 And when we have attained any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of true faith, labour to keepe that
our evidence cleare, let it not be spotted or
defiled by any sinfull acts: you have many
a good evidence that is so blurred with
negligences, and daily errours in speeches
and conversation, that when they reflect
upon themselves they conclude, Can such
a wretch as I, that have so loose a tongue,
that have no more watchfulnesse over my
heart, have any faith at all. And thus God
doth suspend their comforts so, that
though they may be in a good estate for
the maine, yet they shall not know it, and
all because they are not carefull to keepe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2557:32"/>
their evidence which we should preserve
cleare and bright, that it might be seene and
read upon all occasions. And we should
so keepe them bright, that our consciences
may witnesse with us, and that the Spirit
and the Word may joyne their witnesse
with our consciences. The Word saith,
<hi>That he that loves the brethren is translated
to life,</hi> and he that heares the word, as the
word, is Christs sheepe. Now doth thy
conscience tell thee, that though in weake
measure, yet <hi>I do so?</hi> Then here is the word,
and thy conscience for thee: and doth the
spirit witnesse with thy conscience that it
is so indeed? then it is well, thou keepest thy
Evidence to purpose.</p>
            <p>4 And when we have done this, let us
make conscience not to yeeld to any base
doubts, and feares, and objections of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and our owne hearts. When we finde
any worke of grace, deny not the worke
of God, lest we grieve the Spirit of God.
As some melancholy Christians, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2557:33"/>
though every man may see the worke of
God in them, yet yeeld so slavishly to the
misguidings of their hearts, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Sathan, that they conclude they
have no faith, no love: though other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that can reade their evidence better,
see that they have these in them; what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
is this to God and his Spirit, when
a darke humour shall prevaile more then
the Word, the truth it selfe? this is a great
bondage which Sathan brings the soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
that when there is evidence of faith in
the fruits of it, yet men will beleeve a
peevish humour, before the word and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of conscience, enlightned by the
spirit. Take heed of it as a great pride in
the heart, when we yeeld more to a sturdy,
darke, unsubdued humour, then to Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it selfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore in such cases hearken not to
what feare sayes, or humour saith, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
saith, or what the world saith, but
hearken what truth it selfe saith, and what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2557:33"/>
conscience saith, when it is enlightened by
the Spirit, as in good times when we are at
the best. True Christians, though more
remisse, shall have so much comfort as
shall support them from falling into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
yet not so much as shall strengthen
them, and carry them into a vigorous life,
fit for Christians.</p>
            <p>5 When we have found any worke of
grace, and thereupon that our faith is true,
we ought to comfort our selves, and to
maintaine our comfort by all meanes. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
grace is but faith exercised: when our
Saviour saith, <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in me,</hi> he might have said also in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
Be patient, be contented, be comforted.
But he names the root of all, Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all graces are radically, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
discerned in the fruits of it, so that if
any grace be found, as love to the brethren,
hope of life everlasting, or the like, there
is faith. For the root and branches be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
though the root is not alwayes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2557:34"/>
And therefore when we discover
any true faith in the fruit of it, let us support
and comfort our selves with it.</p>
            <p>For when a man is in Christ, and by
Christ an heire of heaven, and a childe of
God, what in the world can befall him, that
should deject over much, and cast him
downe? What losse, what crosse, what
want of friends, hath he not all in God,
and in Christ, and in the promise? Do not
the promises weigh downe all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whatsoever? Surely they do. And
therefore we must strive against dejection.
For besides what I spake the last day, it is a
dishonour to the profession of Religion,
which is in it selfe so glorious, what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to God, and to Christ, when we
have such glorious prerogatives, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
which the Angles themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire;
yet every petty crosse and losse that
we meet withall in the world should cast
us downe, we should take heed exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of this, and should labour every day to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2557:34"/>
have a more and more cleare sight of the
promises that belong unto us, and to know
the priviledges of Christianity, and renew
our faith in them continually, that they
may be fresh to us in all temptations, and
occasions whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I beseech you do but consider any one
grand promise, which if it be rooted in the
soule, how it is able to support the soule,
against all troubles whatsoever. As that,
<hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your Fathers
good pleasure to give you the kingdome.</hi> Or
that other: <hi>If God spared not his Sonne for
us; how will he not with him give us all things
else?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labour to have these things fresh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
together with the priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Christians. Thinke what is it
to be a childe of God, and an heire of
heaven.</p>
            <p>We must not looke onely to the blinde
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2557:35"/>
and darke side of our condition. Christians
have two sides, one to heaven ward, and
God-ward; and that is full of glory, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and immoveable. Another towards
the world, and that is oftentimes full of
abasement, full of disgrace, and dejection.
That is moveable, sometimes better, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
worse, as God pleaseth to dispense
his government in the Church. Let us
looke to the grace, to the comforts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to that grace, to the promises, the best
side, and not to be carried away with the
darknesse of the other.</p>
            <p>It is a terrible sight to looke upon sinne,
and miserie, and hell, and judgement to
come; but what are these to a Christian
that is in Christ, that seeth them all subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and overcome to him? The afflictions
of the world, and the crosses of the
world, what are they to a soule, that is
alreadie in heaven by faith, and seeth them
all overcome in his head Christ? <hi>Be of good
comfort, I have overcome the world.</hi> And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2557:35"/>
therefore we must not be so malignant, as
to looke all upon one part of a Christian,
and that the worser part which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of sence; for shame, live not by sence:
but if we be Christians, let us live by faith,
looke to the best part: looke, upwards and
forwards to that which is eternall.</p>
            <p>5 And withall labour to keepe the
grace of the Spirit in continuall exercise
upon all occasions. For grace exercised
brings certaine comfort: it may be with a
Christian in his feelings as with the worst
man living; but he may thanke his owne
negligence, his owne dulnesse; his not stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up of the graces of God in him. For
therefore it is that he hangs the wing, upon
every pettie crosse, on every occasion: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have an heart ready to exercise
grace suteable to that occasion; for then
grace will reflect sweetly, where there is
sinceritie and grace in exercise. Sinceritie
alone will not comfort a man, unlesse it
grow up to fruitfulnesse: and fruitfulnesse
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2557:36"/>
which springs from the exercise of grace,
hath a sweet reflection upon the soule.
<hi>Remember Lord how I have walked before
thee, in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> saith
<hi>Hezekiah.</hi> He stood then most in need of
comfort, and this comforted him, this his
reflection upon his former sinceritie. So
when a man can appeale unto God as
<hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Lord thou knowest I love thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
much sincerity, so much boldnesse with God.</hi>
And therefore let us keep grace in exercise,
that we may be fruitfull in our lives and
conversations, and then we shal be alwaies
comfortable.</p>
            <p>And to adde a little, there is no grace in
a Christian, but if it be exercised, there is a
suteable comfort upon it even here in this
world. There is a <hi>Praemium ante praemium,</hi>
A reward before a reward. Nay, the
Heathen men, <hi>Socrates,</hi> and the best of
them, so farre as they exercised the naturall
goodnesse that was in them; their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
reflected peace so farre as they were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2557:36"/>
good, and did good, they had peace, much
more peace then bad men had. God gave
even them some rewards, upon discharge
of their duties: he will not be beholden to
any man, that exerciseth any degree of
goodnesse that is in him. Much more
therefore shall a childe of God enjoy it,
when he exerciseth his graces in any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when he overcomes any uncleane,
earthly, vaine-glorious vindictive, or any
other base lust, he shall finde peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
suteable: and the more he grows
in strength, and resolution for the time to
come, the more he groweth in inward
peace. <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> go together,
not onely the righteousnesse of Christ, and
our reconciliation before God; but also the
righteousnesse of an holy life, and peace
in our own consciences.</p>
            <p>The righteousnesse of Christ entitles
to heaven, and the righteousnesse of an
holy life sheweth my title unto comfort. As
faith in Christs righteousnesse brings peace,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2557:37"/>
so sanctification also:<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 1.</note> Christ is <hi>first King of
righteousnesse,</hi> and then <hi>King of peace.</hi> And
therfore where there is no righteousnesse,
there is no peace. But on the contrary, as
heat followeth the fire, and as the beames
have an emanation from the Sunne, so
doth comfort arise from grace, especially
from grace exercised.</p>
            <p>Therefore they that would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, let them labour to be gratious,
and that not onely in the inward frame of
the heart, but in the exercise of grace upon
all occasions. <hi>For they that walke according
to this rule,</hi> that is, of the new creature, <hi>peace
be to them, and the whole Israel of God. Gal.</hi>
15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an exact and carefull life will bring
constant peace.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us labour first for interest
in Christs righteousnesse, and then for the
righteousnesse of an holy life; for a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to justifie us, that we have no purpose
to live in any sinne, and a not accusing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2557:37"/>
conscience will be a justifying consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
What a blessed condition shall we
be in, to be in Christ, and to know that we
are so? Oh the heaven on earth of such a
man, as is in that condition! For which
way soever he looks, he finds matter of
comfort. If he looks backward, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the spirit that hath ruled him
in the former part of his life, he may say
with Saint <hi>Paul, I have fought a good fight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note>
               <hi>I have runne the race that God hath set before
me.</hi> And what a sweet reflection is this? he
is not afraid to looke backe to his life past
as other men. If he looks forward, he seeth
a place prepared for him in heaven, and
there he sees himselfe already in Christ:
hence forth <hi>there is laid up for me a crowne
of righteousnesse, which the righteous judge
shall give me at that day:</hi> and all that love
his appearing, saith he, there. When there
comes ill tydings of the Church abroad,
and at home, it doth not much dismay him,
his heart is fixed, he beleeveth in God, and
in Christ, and that keepes him from being

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:2557:39"/>
like a reed shaken with every winde. For
reproaches, and disgraces that he meets
withall in the world, he weares them as
his crowne, if they be for Religion and
goodnesse sake. For his witnesse is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and in his owne conscience. And God
in heaven, and his conscience within, do
acquit him, and if he suffer for his deserts,
yet in all afflictions God dealeth with him
as a correcting father, he knoweth he hath
deserved them; but he lookes on them as
coming from a father in covenant with
him: And what can come from a father
but what is sweet? He sees it moderated
and sweetened, and in the issue tending to
make him more holy. The sting is taken
out, and a blessing is upon it, to make him
better. And therefore what can make a
Christian uncomfortable when he hath the
Spirit of Christ, and faith the root of grace?</p>
            <p>These comforts being warmed with
meditation, will sticke close to the heart:
comforts that are digested, are they that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2557:39"/>
worke. Let them therefore not onely enter
into the braine and fleete there, but let
them sinke into the heart by often conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Gods love in Christ, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Christians here, and in heaven,
where our head is, and where we shall be
ere long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Warme the heart with
these, and see if any petty thing
