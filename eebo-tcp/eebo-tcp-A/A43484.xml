         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER I had travelled through the world in speculation, by translating and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of ATLAS MAJOUR in English, dedicated to his most excellent Majesty your Vncle, &amp; my dread Soveraign: I could give no rest unto my thoughts till I had undertaken some thing of my owne profession, which might give light, understanding, and instruction, unto some young Gentlemen, Souldiers and others, who desire to follow the warres, and to studie this Art Military, for their princes service, and the good of their Country. And where could I find a fitter place, and a better subject to worke upon, then in these Vnited Provinces, under the command of the Lords, the STATES GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALL, and his Highnesse the Prince of ORANGE, which now in regard of their long Warres may truly be called a nurcery, and <hi>sedes belli,</hi> for the breeding and trayning up of Souldiers, and verily how could I do better then to begin <hi>ad principium,</hi> with the very first principles, and rudiments of the Art Military, Practised in these Warres, under the command, first of Prince MAURICE, <hi>of blessed Memory,</hi> and now under the able conduct of that great and victorious Captain Generall of our age, his <hi>Highnesse</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> his <hi>Brother.</hi> Now besides what experience my long service hath gayned vnder their Commaund, for the space of fortie yeeres, as an addition thereunto, I have got some translations and extracts out of the best and choisest Authors of our modern times, who have writ upon this subject, to give lustre unto it, and having before by the assistance of God, run through the first two parts: I have now also finished my third part, concerning all preparations and necessaries appertaining to an Army, and so to put an end unto this laborious work, For in my first part I promised the right honourable the Earle of Holland, and in my second part my noble Colonel, that I would go through the three whole parts, for the arming of a Souldier, <hi>de cap en pied,</hi> that is at all points, which now thanks be to God I have done, to the end, that such as may go into, his Majesties service, your Highnesses, or any other forrain State or Princes, may gaine some experience, and reape some benefit by my labours, which is, and was the principall thing I aymed at, For I hope, as old as I am, when these unhappy differences at home are reconciled, appeased and composed, that God, <hi>vvho leads the hearts of all Kings in his hand, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of brooks,</hi> will so direct his Majesties heart for your right, that his Majesty will assist your Highnesse, and turne his powerfull Armes another way, and make your Highnesse Generall of a brave Brittish Armie, for the vindicating of your injuries, and the recovery of your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and antient rights and inheritances, against the usurpers thereof.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble your Highnesse any longer with a tedious discourse, seeing my selfe, and thousands of true hearted Brittaines besides my self, (whensoever his sacred Majesty and our dread Soveraign shall lay his commands upon us) shall be all willing to fight in so just a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, for your Highnesse, and lay our lives down at your feet, and your Queen mothers, for the regaining of your Highnesses Rights and Countries.</p>
            <p>This third part then of the <hi>Principles of the Art Military,</hi> comes in all humility to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it selfe unto your Highnesses gracious pratronage, that though it be mean in itself, yet it craves to comeforth to the view of the world, under your illustrious name, which if it may be acceptable unto your Highnesse, then I shall think my weak indevours happily sacrificed, and acknowledge my selfe much obliged to your Highnesse, and shall not onely be bound to pray unto the Lord of Hoasts, to honour and blesse your proceedings here in this world with happy successe, but also to crown you, your <hi>Royall Mother the Queen of Vertues,</hi> and her princely progenie with eternall felicity hereafter, beseeching your Highnesse to beleeve, that no creature living shall more heartily fight, nor more willingly die in your service, then</p>

                  <p>Treating of the Leagues, Alligations, and Commixture of mettals, wherewith Ordnance are Cast, and made inthese Countries, and else where.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Alloye</hi> wherewith our Ordnance is made here in these Countries, is commonly old cast <hi>brasse peeces,</hi> ill proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, burst, or made vnseruiceable with too much Shooting, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, must be refounded into some better, and more seruiceable <hi>formes,</hi> or are such perhaps, as are too great for ordinarie Carriages and bullets. If these old brasse peeces be of too fine a <hi>mettall</hi> (wich yet is seldome found) the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Founder</hi> maye mingle some slighter copper amongst it; yea so much as he in his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall think sitting: so that the Ordnance, which he makes be answerable to their proofe.</p>
               <p>Our newe Ordnance then being founded with these new <hi>alligations,</hi> and <hi>alloyes</hi> are commixted with three fourth parts of red Copper, made vp in Sowes one fourth part of Bell mettal cast also in Sowes, and one ninth part of the finest Cornish tinne you can gett.</p>
               <p>These bricks are peeces of red copper weighing, about 50 lb. weight, cast after the fashion of a square footed pauement, and your great Sowes, are peeces of other Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, melted one timelesse, then your brick Copper, where of some of them weighes 200, 300. yea the greatest 600 lb. a peece, The is tinne mix ed amongst the Copper, and Bell-mettal, that they maye run ne the better in melting, which makes your peece more solid and firme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in Italy S.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">nor.</hi> Alexander Bianco <hi>(as master</hi> Norton <hi>oneof his ma<hi rend="sup">tias</hi>, master Gunoners, And Enginier citeth in his practize of Artilerie) saith, That the best</hi> Alligations <hi>of these mettals for Ordnance is for every 200. lb. of Copper 20 lb. of tinne, and 5 lb. of brasse, or Latton is to be mixted therewith. And</hi> Digeo Vffano <hi>a Spainyard, Captaine of the Ordnance in the Castle of</hi> Antwerpe, <hi>in his instruction of Artilerie affirmeth, that the best</hi> ligature <hi>for Ordnance is 100 lb. of Copper, 8 lb. of tinne and 5 lb. of Latton, and 10 lb. of Sow-lead, affirming that lead being tough &amp; cold, maketh the peece-become hard. But le</hi> Sieur de Brissac, <hi>a french man in his</hi> militatie discourses <hi>saith, that the french, Founders vnto every 100 lb. of Copper doe either ad 20 lb. of Bell-mettal, which is 25 pound of Tinne &amp; Lead for 100 lb. of Copper, orbrasse, or else 10 lb. of soft tinne to every 100 lb. of Copper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords the States have in the Hagh avery brave founderie, and a work-house ioyning to it, in which they doe all their</hi> massive <hi>workes, and behinde that aspacious roome, where they Settand place all their carriages, which is kept faire and dry, and besides the</hi> Master Founder <hi>hath a house to dwell in, all which belongs to the Land.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Master Founder <hi>must be very carefull in makeing choise of his powders, &amp; Earths where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is to make his</hi> Mouldes <hi>for the Casting of brasse Ordnance in, that they be able to resist the fire, and receiue the melted mettals: So that they maye render them to be east, and founded neately, without being Subject, either to be diminished, crackt, or peeld, when they shalbe nealed, which is such a matter, as without experience cannot be done well. Wherefore, I wil conclude with master</hi> Norton <hi>in his practize of</hi> Artillerie, <hi>that good Earths are neither fatt, nor leane, but betweene both, and of a fine and subtill graine or mould, which soone dryeth, and remayneth firme, without breaking, being able to resist the</hi> vehemencie <hi>of the fire, and such Earths are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a yellow, or a red colour.</hi>

                  <p>THe Master Founder having prepared, and resolued of what kind, and what sort of that kinde the Ordnance is, which he intends to cast, he is then first to make a perfect Modell there of, either of timber, or of Earth, orboth, with all the Mouldures, Ornaments, &amp; compartiments, euen as you would have the peece to be, which you must thinnely annoint with soft hogt-grease, and then cover it over uith a Colume of the afore said tempered Earthp, made and dryed by little and litle, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting it, vntill it be of a Competent strength, and thicknesse.

Their must elso be a smooth, and equall Cillender, whose Dyamitre must be iust the beigth of the Bore, and made of the same Earth, moulded vpon a stronge Iron square Barre, and vpon a Cord woulded about the same, to make therewith the soule, Concaue or hollow Cillinder of the peece, by placing yt (by helpe of the Base, and Muzzle ring) exactly in the midst of the Vacuity of the outermost Colume, which whenthe Patterne, or Modell Shalbe taken out, will remaine hollow, to receiue the metrall, that must make the bodie of the peece. All these must be well ioynted together, polished smooth, dryed Nealed, that the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall maye runne fine, and come off smooth and neate.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the patterne of the breech, with all the Mouldures, and Cascabell, is in like manner to be Couvered ouer, by litle and litle with the same tempered Earth, which must afterwards be Luted neatly, and strongly to the breech end of the outter Colume: all which Mouldures, Rings, Armes, Devises, Flowers, Trunions, Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and Circles, maye be at pleasure added there vnto, vpon the patterne, either with waxe, earth, or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and so the perfect Impression thereof wilbe receiued by the Concavity of the outward Colume, keeping still the due prescribed proportion of the peeces (yow intend to cast) accordingto the kind &amp; sort thereof, for the rest se master Norton in his 21, &amp; 22 Chapters of the practize of Artillerie.</p>
                  <p>Having thus digressed, I will returne againe to my former matter, and giue the gentle Reader to vnder stand, shat the States have Conditioned with their Master Founder, that he shalbe at the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing all Mouldures, Formes, castings, borings, and finding of firing, for which he hath from the States six gildens, or 12 hillings starling, for the founding, of 100 lb. weight; so that for a whole Canon, which weighs 7000 lb. weight, he hath 840 gilders for him and his men, the rest proportionally. Now when any old brasse peeces are to be cast, they are deliuered to him by weight, and he is allowed him ten pounds in every 100 lb. weight for drosse and wast: for you must vnderstand, that Copper &amp; brasse have much more drosse in them, then gould or silver, because the finer the Alloye is, the lesser it will consume by fire.</p>
                  <p>The greatest number of new peeces cast in the States Founderie at the Hagh, euery yeare by the helpe of some, 20 men are sixe whole Canons, twelve half Canons, and sixe long Feild peeces, or demy Culvering, makeing in all the number of 24 peeces of Ordnance. But of late yeares they cast diverse sorts of french short Demy Canon, and smaller Drakes, as now the occasion of fervice requires.</p>
                  <p>These Ordnance being founded and made, the Master Feunder is to deliuer them to the States vpon Proofe in the presence of some Commissioners, and the Controuleur of the Ordnance, who are to ouersee them, and to take care, that the peece, which is to be tryed, be well loaded with her due weight of powder, and bullet, and rammed well home.</p>
                  <p>The proofe of a whole Canon which weights 7000 lb. weight, and carries an yron bullet of 48 lb. weight must be charged with 32 lb. of fine powder, and with the bullet aboue said well rammed home; but the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charge then of it wilbe noe more then 20, 19, or 18 lb. of sine pouder at the least: A halfe Canon which weighs 4500 lb. weight and shootes a bullet of 24 lb. weight, the proofe Shott must be 16 pounds of fine powder &amp; the ordinarie charge 12 lb.</p>
                  <p>A Feild peece, which weighs 3200 pound weight, carrying a bullet, of 12 lb. must be loaded with nine pounds of fine powder, but the ordinarie charge is noe more but sixe pounds.</p>
                  <p>The Faulconet, that weighs 2100 lb. which carries a bullet of sixe pound weight, must be loaded with 4 and a halfe lb. of fine powder for it proofs shotr, and with 3 lb. for its ordinarie charge.</p>
                  <p>Note also, that a Canon, which shoots a bullet of 48 lb. must be bored for a bullet of 52 lb.</p>
                  <p>Weight, A Demy Canon, which carries a bullet of 24 lb. must be bored for a bullet of 28 pound.</p>
                  <p>Weight, A quarter Canon, which carries a bullet of 12 lb. must le bored for a bullet of 16 lib.</p>
                  <p>A Faulconet which carries a bullet of 6 lb. weight, must be bored for a bullet of 8 lb.</p>
                  <p>Your whole Canon, and Demy Canon, are commonly peeces for Batterie, vsed at seiges for to make a breach, but your Feild peeces, and Drakes are to be drawne to some suddaine peece of seruice, as in the day of Battle, vpon a Passage, or vppon Plate Formes, &amp; Batteries made vpon the line of Circumvalatione, or for the defence of a Campe, when an ennemy is at hand, and the rest of the short chambred Drakes likewise.</p>
                  <p>A Canon or a smaller peece of Ordnance, maye shoote in 12 howres some 80 shoot, yea 100, if it be not Ouer Heated, but after yow have made with it some 10 or 12 shott at the most, it must have a Cooling time, by casting ouer the breech of it a Danck hair cloath a pretie while, and that will coole it enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42771:4"/>
For a whole Canon mounted vpon a block waggon, or vpon its owne Catriage, it is commonly drawne in these hollow, and marshie Countries, with a teeme of 15 couple of Bustie horses, besides the Thiller horse, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account, that euery couple of horses, must drawe for their shares 600, yea 650 pound weight if they be well putt to it. A Demy Canon with eleuen couple and a Thiller horse, a quarter Canon with eight coupple and a Thiller horse, &amp; a Faulconet with foure couple &amp; a Thiller horse, and your smaller Drakes with a number proportionable to the weight abouesaid, yea euen to a small Drake carrying a bullet but of one pound weight, is drawne but with a Thiller horse. The length of the chase of euery peece both Reinforced &amp; Chambred is noted aboue its figure.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe figures of a ladle, a Rammer, and a Sponge is represented vnto yow vnder the Faulconet, and feild peece, with their iust lenght, and thicknesse, after which forme yow maye make all others for what sorts of peeces yow please, and with all obserue, that the bignesse of them must be according to the Dyamitre of the bullet which your peece carries. The lengh of the ladle vnder the feild peece with the staff and Rammer is 11 foote, and 9 inches &amp; a halfe long. The opening of the ladle is a foote and a fourth part of an inch. The brasse plate rounded to the staff, and to the height of the shoot, and due vent allowed is fiue inches. The staff of the ladle 3 ynches thick made of soft fast wood as Aspe Beech or willow. The Rammer B is 4 inches, turned with hard wood, and the length of the copper ladle a foote and ten ynches, the staff to the neck on both sides is 3 inches thick. The Dyamiter of the bullet is traced out with bricks coming downe from the ladle marked 1, 2, &amp; 3.</p>
               <p>The Spunge C. is couvered with rough sheeps skinns wool, and nailed to the staff with Copper nailles so that it maye fill vp the Soule or Concavity of the peece when it is to be scowred and cleared. Note also that the Copper ladle for a peece of ordnance must be threetimes the length of the Dyamitre of the bullet. Such a ladle costs the States 6 gl. 10 stivers, vidz. The staff 2 gl. and 14 stivers for a whole Canon, for a halfe Canon 5 gilders, for a feild peece foure gilders 10 stivers. And the Rammer, the staff, and the Sponge or sheeps skinne will cost two gilders 14 stivers.</p>
               <p>Yow have also in the plate B figure, 9 represented vnto yow the figure of a Carriage for a feild peece with all the Dimensions, ioynts, and parts belonging to yt.</p>

               <p>The Lords the States have agreed with their Master Carpentes, to make them a Carriage for a whole Canon for 134 gilders 10 stivers, namely the two side peeces 15, or 16 foote long, 17 inches broad, and six and a half inches thick, for 59 gilders, and to every carriage foure transoms for 6 gilders. An Axeltree for 4. gilders 10 stivers, The two wheeles 37 gilders 16 stivers, for the framing and makeing of the carriage for a whole Canon 27 gilders 10 stivers, for an Axekree 1 gl. 10 stivers. for the makeing, of the wheeles 10 gl. which comes to in all, as aboue said to 134 gilders 10 stivers, and so the rest of all Carriages proportionally.</p>

               <head>THE DEMOMSTRATION OF THE NEXT Figures following, and first of a Block, or a long Waggon: THE THIRD CHAPTER</head>
               <p>THe first figure underneath number 10. sheweth you of what singular use and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation your <hi>Block,</hi> or <hi>Lisng waggon</hi> o for the carriage, and drawing of a peece of Ordnance, or for the carrying of small Punts, or Boats to clapp on a sunden over a River, or a brooke, when occasion may serue: therefore there is no one Instrument more usefull for the traine of Ordnance then this is, and are excellent good also to stopan <hi>Avenue</hi> or a passage croswise, where an Enemies horse may breake in upon an Armie unawares, especially, when one hath no time to cast vp a trench, or a traverse vpon it. Besides, a peece of Canon will be easilyer drawne, through moorish, foule, and sandie wayes vpon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the peece lieth more steddie, and is not subject to so much wrenching afide in durtie and Ruttie waies, then vpon its proper Carriage. Now whensoever an Enemie should draw neere unto an Armie by the helpe of the <hi>Fearne,</hi> you may quickly hoize it vp, and laye it vpon its own carriage. The forme and moddle whereof is represented unto you in the figure following, noted number 10.</p>
               <p>The second figure number 11. demonstrates to your eye a halfe Canon mounted vpon its carriage, drawne with seven couple of horse, and a <hi>Thiller</hi> horse, and this to be understood in a good way: but if the way be foule, morish, and durty, then for a whole Canon, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 7000. li. weight, you must spanne in 15. couple of horse and a <hi>Thiller;</hi> for a <hi>halfe cannon</hi> eleuen couple and a <hi>thiller;</hi> for a feild peece or a quarter Canon six couple and a <hi>Thiller;</hi> for a <hi>Falconet</hi> two couple and a <hi>thiller;</hi> and for a small <hi>Drake</hi> weighing 250. pound weight. one horse. You must obserue also that the mettle of one of the States half canons weigheth (as is said before) 4500 pound weight, the carriage and yron worke thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing about 900. pound, so that these horses are to draw in all the weight of 5400. pound, and the other peeces proportionably.</p>
               <p>The third figure, number 12. represents unto you this, that when you want or cannot use Canon horses and <hi>Athrals,</hi> how you may then by the helpe and strength of men, drawe a peece of <hi>Ordnance</hi> to the topp of a hill, and there to make a <hi>Platforme</hi> for the battering of a Castle: Now presuppose you are to batter it with 16. Peeces of Ordnance; to wit, eight <hi>Demy canon,</hi> and 8 <hi>Quarter canon,</hi> the first carrying a bullet of 24. li. and the second of 12. li. and are to carry along with you all necessaries, as Powder, Bullets, Match, bedding, traces and diverse other materials. The question is how many Souldiers, Pyonniers, and workemen are able to doe this? which <hi>Diego Vffano</hi> in his 22. Dialogue resolveth in this manner following.</p>

Now if you lay three of these bullets, in a wheele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow, they will make 72. pound for every Souldier to wheele, and will require 200. men to doe it.</p>
                  <p>And for 600. quarter canon bullets, weighing 12. pound a peece, the weight of the whole will be 7200. li: now putting 7. of these into a wheele-barrow, for every mans share to driue, you must haue 86. men in all, and every man as before 72. pound weight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item</hi> for 168. weight of powder, for to charge these 16. peeces of Ordnance withall, each halfe canon requiring 12 pound of good powder for its charge, and for your quarter canon, or field peece 7. pound; you must have 240. small firkins, or so many leather powder baggs to carry it in, and giving to euery Souldier 70. pound weight of powder, it will require the like number of 240. men to carry it, as is represented vnto you in the fourth plate and 12. figure following.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Attelage</hi> or drawing ropes for these 16 peeces of ordnance, represented vnto you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42771:9"/>
also in this fourth plate and 13. figure, is shown you the manner of it, by dividing your men into three drawing files or teames, according to the greatnesse of the peece which your men are to draw up, for a Demy-canon, carriage, attelage, and all will weigh a matter of 6000. pound weight, now giving to every man 60. pound weight to draw such a halfe Canon will require a 100. men to draw it, and proportionably the 8. half canons 800. men.</p>
                  <p>For a quarter Canon, carriage, attelage and all, will weigh 3000. pound weight, now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to every 60. pound weight to draw, every of these 8. peeces will require 43. men, so that for these 8. quarter Canons you must have in all 344. men, which being (as is said) divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three equall files and distances, each drawing rope must have 14. men and one odde man over to go by.</p>
                  <p>And because it may sometimes happen, that by reason of the steepinesse, badnesse, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evennesse of the way, you may be driven to dismount and remount your peece ere you get up to the top of the hill, you must carry along with you a <hi>Fearne,</hi> a <hi>winch,</hi> or a <hi>Scalet,</hi> with all appurtenances thereunto belonging, as winding roaps, an iron goats foot, with a crow, pinns, truckles, pullies to help you withall at a dead lift. All these Engines and Materials may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be carryed on the shoulders of 30. men, insomuch that if you make your calculation you shall find that you must have for the drawing of these 16. peeces of Ordnance, and for all things above specified, the number of a 1703. men without any difficulty will do the deed and draw these Ordnance whithersoever you please. The Fearn the figure and its necessaries shall be described unto you in the next chapter following.</p>
                  <p>Now for your attirals or drawing harnesse, to the end that every man may draw alike share you must fasten a crossebeame or barre to the end of the fore waggon marked as you see with <hi>A. B.</hi> through which you put your drawing roaps into an equall distance, that your men may not hinder one another drawing, having behind it three men to steer the peece aright, when you come to any winding or turning in the way.</p>
                  <p>Again, if it be a whole canon or a peece of Ordnance, which you are to draw through a trench to a battery, or some other place, where you would plant it, and find these drawing ropes to short for the men that are to draw it, then you must lengthen the ropes and fasten an other crosse barre just in the very midst, and this will guide your peece from wrenching aside for certain, the shorter your drawing ropes be, the more steddier and easier your peece will be drawn, to every drawing rope also you must have as many necklines to cast about your mens shoulders as you have men, to the end they may draw with more ease, strength, and take fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer footing. Neverthelesse if you draw your peece after this manner up to some steepy hill least the peece should fall downward and overturn them, for the avoiding of this danger, they must in an instant whip these lines over their heads to loosen themselves from them, or else cut them on a suddain, but then it is safer to draw with their hands.</p>
                  <p>This manner of drawing of Ordnance is no new thing, but hath been practised by the first conquerours of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> as <hi>Pizarre, Ferdinand Cortes,</hi> and diverse others, who with the strength of men drew their Ordnance over hils and mountains to the City of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Henry</hi> 4. King of France, of immortall memory, used this manner of drawing of his Ordnance over the Alphes in his last warres of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and instead of pyoniers used lusty Swissers to do it</p>
                  <p>The 5. rings called in dutch, Mailles, number 14. is to try whether the bullets which you are to choose in the Arsenall will fall through them, which if they do, then they will fit your peece to a hair, the severall bores and calibres of your 8. peece of Ordnance described before.</p>

                  <p>THE Carriage being placed in a readinesse, you are then to hoise up your peece into it, which in regard of the weight of it, be it a Canon or any other great peece of Ordnance, cannot be well done without the ingenious help of the <hi>Fearne</hi> or <hi>Ghynne,</hi> ropes, a Goats foot or an yron crow, leavers to wind up the Rouler, &amp;c. especially when a wheel is graveled, and sticks fast in some deepe rutt, or rotten ground, then you must use the helpe of the <hi>Scallet</hi> or <hi>Winch,</hi> demonstrated unto you in the figures following.</p>
                  <p>First then you must make and frame your <hi>Fearn,</hi> according to this model used in the States service, which is accounted the best, number 14. and for the goodnesse of it ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all others, and for the lightnesse of it may upon a march be laid upon a waggon to be carried along in the train of the Ordnance with the Scallet, Winch, and all appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereunto belonging.

                  <p>The other Engine is called in French a <hi>Scalet</hi> or a <hi>Ladderet,</hi> in Netherdutch a <hi>Knape,</hi> which must have likewise a strong iron crow belonging to it, a thicke oaken board upon which the pillars or supporters of the weight stands, which are well nigh two foot long and a foot broad and about halfe a foot in thicknesse.</p>
                  <p>The two pillars of the <hi>Scalet</hi> must be enchased a quarter of a foot in the thick board, to give it the more firmnesse whereupon they stand, and must be a matter of 2. Geometricall foote high about the said board, and ⅗ and ¼ part of a foot thick each pillar as you see having 8. holes boored through them at an equall distance one from another, through which you are to put
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42771:11"/>
your great yron bolt, which with the iron crow must sustain and beare up the ponderosity: unto this bolt there is an iron chain fastned to it, and nailed to the right hand pillar as you may mark: the bolt it self ought to be one and one fifth part of a Geometricall inch round, and one an a half of a foot long, each pillar must stand at least half a foot one from an other. Vpon this yron bolt, which may be put into any of the holes as you raise vp the peece, and as occasion serues, resteth your yron crow and leavers, and receiveth strength from it to lift vp your wheel peece, and all at a dead lift out of any rutt, moorish ground, or place when it sticks fast in it, and as you raise it, by this engine, you may clap thick fagots, or boards vnder the wheele, till you advance it higher to an other hole.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Winch</hi> or <hi>Windlace</hi> represented here unto you in the 14. figure, is called in Netherdutch a <hi>Windaes,</hi> or a <hi>Dumcracht;</hi> and is a differing Engine from the former, but of singular use also for the heaving vp of a peece of Ordnance, carriage, and all, let it be never so great, or any ponderous weight, as blocks loggs &amp;c. yea it is of such great strength and force that it is able to overturne a house, and hath no neede but of one man to put it a worke. Now to make it stronge and sufficient, it must be two foote long at the least, 1 foot and a half broad, and half a foot thick, with avice, and a teethed scrue comming out of the midst of the woodworke of it, and winding up its teeth by the force of two secret wheeles turning within the midst of the woodworke. This Engine may also be used (as the former) for the lifting up of a peece of ordnance out of adeep rutt, morish ground, or any durt or mire into which it is sunck; by laying of thick boards, and faggots vnder the wheele, as is said; and this will be done quickly, so that you need not loose much time vpon a march: and thus much in brief for the making and use of these three Instruments.

               <head>HOW ONE IS TO MOVNT A PEECE VPON ITS carriage, by the helpe of a Fearne, or a Ghynne. THE FIFTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>BEfore you are to mount your peece, above all things you must have a singular care that the <hi>Fearn</hi> be so firmly set, that it doth not recoil or slip away in any manner, and so that the rope, and pullie, or truckle, comming downe from the head fall just vpon the eares of the peece: whereof to be assured, you may let fall downeward from the pullie aboue, a whipcoard with a plummet, or some small stone hanging downe: and turning the said <hi>Fearn,</hi> till the <hi>Plummet</hi> falls just in the very midst, as is said.</p>
               <p>If it be in a <hi>plaine, even,</hi> and fast ground, you may have the lesse care in setting firme and steadfast the feete of your <hi>Fearn</hi> vpon it, but if it be a <hi>Sandie</hi> and a soft Earth into which the feete may sinke, or give back, according to the greatnesse of the weight, then you must put plancks, blocks, or some solid thing vnder the feete, setting tent pinnes about it, according as necessity shall require, and as opportunity will permit you.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Fearn</hi> then being thus firmly placed and setled, the <hi>Gunner</hi> shall get vp by a ladder, or some stepps to the head or top of it, having the rope in his hand, shall put it through the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost truckle of the head, and let it fall downe to the other, that he which catches it may put it through the left side of the peece in his hand, to fasten it, (as wee shall shew hereafter) into the eares of the peece, and so having put it through them, he drawes it vp till he can give it to him that is aboue him, and then he puts it againe through the hole of the right hand truckle, and gives it downe to him that is vnder him, who reaches it againe to him that is above: and so he fastens it to the head of the <hi>Fearn,</hi> giving it some turnes, till it comes under the vppermost truckle, as you see.</p>
               <p>This done, he must fasten it (with great discretion) to the lower truckle, by puting the rope through the eares of the peece, putting the end of it thorow three times, as well through the eares, as through the ring which is under the said truckle: after this, you shall begin to hoise your peece, putting a great, and a long peece of timber into the mouth of the peece to guide it aright, that it doth not swagg from one side to an other; a dangerous thing, which stricking against one of the feete of the <hi>Fearn</hi> or against the Rouler, may break it, and so hinder the whole worke. Those which mounts it, must have a care to keepe the peece steddie and right, untill the weight of the peece is well setled. The <hi>Generall</hi> or his <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> Generall, in the meane while having a watchfull eye, as well vpon the ropes, as vpon the feete of the <hi>Fearne;</hi> that the feet do not slip away, or the rope be cadgeld one among an other, or drawing not alike, may breake. Therefore, when they begin to hoise the peece vp, they must give a blow or two with a staff vpon the ropes, to part them a sunder, one from an other, that each may beare an equall weight.</p>
               <p>If you perceive that your <hi>Fearne</hi> beginnes to give back, then you must presently let your peece sinke, and underlaye, and settle well the feete of it, and that as gently as may be, to the end the <hi>Crosse beame,</hi> or Rouler may not be disjoynted, or broken.</p>
               <p>Finally, giving two or three turnes to the <hi>Maine rope,</hi> vpon the <hi>rouler</hi> or winder of the <hi>Fearn,</hi> you must wind it vp carefully, and very gently with the help of two men only: in such sort, that when one of the levers or handles hath gone about, the other must be held fast till that the other man hath put this in its place to make likewise its turne about: or else the other man shall stay his hand, till that his fellow drawing out his, hath put it also in its hole; which must be done so often till the peece be hoised so high, that you may put your Carriage vnder it.</p>
               <p>Also you must take heede that your peece knocketh not against any part of your <hi>Fearne,</hi> which might cause any <hi>disaster,</hi> or that the <hi>Fearne</hi> might breake, and letting the peece fall, a mischiefe may happen, and put all into disorder: wherefore you must put the carriage under it very gently, that the <hi>Tronions</hi> may fall just into the holes or clasping sockets of the carriage and so guide your peece by the beame which it hath in its mouth, that it falls softly to rest upon its carriage, and then locking it well in, and fastning it with the wedges, you may then loosen your ropes, and taking away the <hi>Fearne,</hi> your peece being thus mounted you may draw it whithersoever you please.</p>

               <head>HOW A CANONIER OUGHT TO CHARGE A PEECE. CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>A Peece being brought to a <hi>Batterie,</hi> and planted upon a <hi>Platforme,</hi> having powder, bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, his linstock, scowrers, Rammers, and all things else in a readinesse, after he hath stuck down his linstockin some place under the winde, and first carefully cleared his peece with his scowrer and sheepe-skin within, and sees that the touch-hole be not stopped, or any dust or filth cleaving to it, then one of his Companions, which is to assist him, (for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there must bee two Canoniers to every Canon, or great peece of Ordnance) brings him the <hi>pouch barrell,</hi> with powder iust before the mouth of the peeee, and putting his Ladle or charger into it, fils it, and least it might be overfull, giues it a little iogg, that the <hi>Surplus</hi> may fall down againe into the barrell, after this he puts it gently into the mouth of his peece, even till the end of his Ladle comes up to the very brich and touch-hole of his peece, and then turnes his Ladle softly, and lets it lye within the chamber of the peece, and drawing out his Ladle almost to the mouth of his peece, puts it back againe to take up the loose cornes which were spilt by the way, and to bring them up to the charge of powder: this done he drawes out his Ladle, and takes out of the <hi>pouch-barrell</hi> a second Ladle full (for by triall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he knowes the weight and charge of powder, which his Ladle will hold, and which his peece well require) and so putting in his second Ladle full up to the former, drawes it out, and doth as he did before, that no loose cornes may lie in the bottome of the mould of his peece, and in drawing out of his Ladle, he must haue a care, that he let fall any powder upon the ground, for it is a thing unseemely for a Cannonier, to trample it under his feete. Then he takes a wispe of straw, hay, or any other thing: and puts it so hard into the mouth of the peece (turning his ladle to come to the end of his Rammer) hee driues up the wispe and carries up with it the loose cornes, which happily may be by the way in the mould of the peece, even up to the charge of powder, and then giving the stopper and powder, two or three shoues, to make it lie close together in the chamber of his peece, he drawes out his Rammer, puts in his bullet, which roules gently into his peece up to the wispe or stopper which keepes up the powder (all this while his <hi>Companion</hi> stopping the <hi>touch-hole</hi> with his finger, that no powder flies out of it, but that it be also well fild and stopt with powder which hee may do out of his <hi>touch-horne</hi> afterwards) and then puts in his second wispe after his bullet. And the Canonier is to be forwarned, that he stands not iust before the mouth of his peece, while this is a doing, but aside of it, least a danger or mischelfe might happen to him, and thus the peece having its due charge both of powder and bullet, he shall cover his touch-hole with a dry sheepskin, after he hath levelled his peece, and setting away his pouch barrell of powder with the rest, in some <hi>Concaue,</hi> or hollow hutt into the ground covered over with sodds or earth, he shall attend the Gentlemans of the Ordnance his command before he giues fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An other observation for a Canonier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the charging of a peece <hi>Frons-berghen</hi> maintaineth, that one ought to take in powder one half of the weight of the Bullet. Rivius and some others are of the opinion, that the more powder one puts in, the swifter and further the bullet wil fly shewing many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to proue it. But experience the mistris of this Art teacheth us otherwise: for a peece being loaded with two third parts of the bullets weight in powder, sends the bullet going more swiftly, and will carry it further, which hath bin so often tryed, that it is without all contradiction, giving this reason, that the <hi>exhencia</hi> is so swift and violent, that it bursteth out of the mould before the two third parts of the powder be fired, and this hath beene found irrefutable.</p>
               <p>Again others maintain, that if one should forcibly ramme in the bullet then the powder might take fire, ere it could cast out the bullet, and then would cause the bullet to fly further then otherwise it would do, but you must consider in so doing, you either indanger the break ing of your peece, or else make it crooked and unserviceable, because your ordinary peeces will not bear so great a charg of powder, this hath bin tryed upon the Sea strand at Scheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

The place being marked where the bullet rested, shee was loaden again with 9. pounds, which shot as far as the ten pound did, but last of all shee was charged but with 7. pounds of the same powder, which carried her bullet further then the two former shots: whence one may obserue, that a peece of Ordnance may be overcharged, and therefore a good Gunner ought to haue a singular care to giue his peece her due measure and charge.</p>

               <head>HOW A CANNONIER OVGHT TO LAY AND Levell his Peece and to amend a bad shott, CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>HAving time and Command to lay and Levell a Peece, according to the ordinary ayme, to try how farr it will carry, the <hi>Canonier</hi> shall take a long ruler, and laying it vpon the midst of the <hi>Frizes,</hi> aswell of the brich, as of the <hi>muzzle</hi> of the peece, and a levell upon it, he shall raise or sinke it, untill the plummet of the Levell be iust in the midst: then taking away both the Ruler and the Levell, he shall see even with the Frizes, the point or marke which this ayme discovers, which without doubt will be the place it wil carry to; with which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the levell of the mettell, whereof wee will speake hereafter, it will make but the half. But if he hath no leisure so to use the <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Levell,</hi> he may take his ayme, or lay his peece, as he finds good, according to the charge and proportion of his peece. If he strickes his marke, he may then be assured, that his ayme is right, and using the like weight of powder, will alwaies make the same shot.</p>
               <p>But if his bullet carries over, he shall level his peece againe as he did before, and having got the first marke in his sight, he shall neither stirre nor mooue his peece: but shall take away asmuch of the <hi>Frizes</hi> of the brich, till he sees the blow which the bullet gaue, and which will bee the true, and right sight, which he presently may trie by laying his peece upon his first marke, which without any doubt he will strike.</p>
               <p>Now if his first shot fals short, then he must doe as he did before, levelling his peece again and then without mooving it, he shall goe and take away the <hi>Frizes</hi> from the <hi>muzzle</hi> till hee discovers the blow of the bullet, and then he shall haue the true sight; according to which, laying his peece upon the first marke, hee will surely strike it, if that there bee no fault in the powder.</p>
               <p>There is an other way of levelling of a peece, and amending of a bad shott, in adding or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing the elevation, according to discretion. To witt, when he shootes short of his mark, the peece is remooved and layd as before, afterward he raises up the <hi>Muzzle</hi> as he shall judg, and as need shall require, that he may strike his desired mark, observing well alwaies how much this elevation is made higher then his first ayme taken, which he shall perceiue if looking even with the mettell, he shall see what marke it will show him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How a Canonier ought to Levell his Peece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then giving fire, and striking the marke before aymed at, he may be assured, that his peece carries right, to which henceforward hee shall giue as much height aboue the naturall Levell: if it failes, that is, if he over shootes his marke, let him dispart that which his firstshot fell too short, with the length of the same, for the lessening of the Elevation proportionably; in doing whereof, without all question hee shall see his shott remedied, and a right shott made. And this is your common and ordinary way in which Gunners do most exercise themselues in, with assurance that he which knowes not by this meanes to giue the right elevation and range to his peece, is not worthy of the name of a <hi>Canonier.</hi> Now for his better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I will giue him this example.</p>
               <p>Suppose a <hi>canon</hi> be mounted upon his carriage, and planted upon a <hi>plateforme,</hi> and is to mark a shot at some <hi>white-stone</hi> or marke in a Wall. To doe this, your Gunner must take his ayme as curiously as possibly he can Levell with the mettell of his peece, but if his shot fals to short, to helpe it he shall take his ayme againe, and shall lay his peece as hath beene taught before: afterward he shall raise it a point higher, so that whereas he had but 6. before, now he hath 7. points of the elevation, and afterward giues fire. If he striks his mark let him alwaies take the same ayme and Levell, But if he over shootes his marke, let him levell his peece as is taught before: by disparting the difference of the first, from 6. with that of seven points, as discretion shall guide him, according to the carriage of the first shot, and giving fire, (without all doubt) he shall hit his desired marke. And his Peece being thus raised he must keep in his sight the point or marke which is showne him, and obserue wel the height which is aboue his marke, with assurance that when he is to make more shot by keeping this elevation he wil never faile. But if the first shot lying upon the 6. points be to high, then he shall helpe that by the same Rule in laying his peece lower, and so shall strike his marke whereby he shall get credit and commendations for it.</p>

Lastly out of the table of Sines, take the number answering to every degree out of the said 1000. parts, and set that distance from the said mark downwards, and if the totall Syne of the table be 100000. omit the two last figures of each number thereof toward the right hand, and if it be 10000000. then omit 4. figures of each number you find in that Table, and the remaining number will shew how many of those 1000. equall parts are to be set downwards from the mark beneath the said levell for each severall degree: Then drawing also 10. paralels or diagonals from the first degree to the second, and from the second to the third, &amp;c. successively continued from each to his next, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every degree with Arithmeticall characters, so you may from six minutes to six minutes by those right signes mount the peece, so set forth for any peece which it shalbe prepared for. This may also be described upon such a staffe without the table of synes in a mechanical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thus, If you describe a Quadrant or quarter of a circle with a semidiametre, equall to the distance from the centre of the trunions, to the centre of the pomel or caskabel, &amp; devide the Arch of that quadrant into 90. equall parts or degrees, and then from each degree letting a line fall perpendicularly upon the base side of the said quadrant, and lastly, each of those right lines being thence transferred from the said first marke downwards upon the said staffe, and marking them with arithmeticall figures for each degree, thereupon making also paralels and Diagonals as aforesaid, you may thereby Geometrically and mechanically marke the same from 6. to 6. minutes as before. The use of them is plain and easie, for if you bring downe the centre of the caskabel or pomel of the peece to any number of the degrees thereon so mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that peece, you setting the lower end of the staffe to the platform being even, although it be rising or descending backwards, I say then the axis of the bore of that peece wilbe found to be elevated to the degree assigned: If you be to imbase the peece, those lines and number also set above the first named mark, will perform the like office there, in the thing required.</p>

               <head>OF A QVADRANT LEVELL, AND OTHER Instruments for Ordnance, and the use of them <hi>The forme, proportion, and making of aquadrant and a Levell, with an instrument to shew the use of it, is very necessary for</hi> master-Gunners; <hi>and</hi> Canoniers, <hi>for the Levelling and ayming of Canon, other Ordnance, and Morters demonstrated in the fift plate, and 15. 16. and 17 figures following.</hi> CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>TO make a <hi>quadrant,</hi> as is fitting, one must first make the whole circle marked 1. which is devided by lines, running from its <hi>center</hi> into 48 equall parts; at the end of each is noted the number thereof, inclosed in a space between two little lines within an other circle, and between two <hi>Vergets</hi> or small <hi>rings,</hi> where you see there is a space also, by which the said line is devided equally in the midst.</p>
               <p>With a quarter of this circle is made your <hi>Quadrant</hi> marked (2) being from <hi>l</hi> devided into twelue points, making seven degrees and a halfe, so that in all they make 90, which is iust the fourth part of the 360 degrees of the whole circumference of the world.</p>
               <p>It may also be devided, as you see upon the white, each one the outside, into 45 points, wherof every of them make 8 degrees: so that the whole 360 degres are comprehended within them, according to this <hi>form</hi> and devision is made your other <hi>quadrant,</hi> noted (3) and is marked with, <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> devided into 9 equall parts, each of them making 10 degrees.</p>
               <p>Now by these two <hi>quadrant,</hi> the plummet hanging in the midst from the point of the 45 degree, which are also devided into two equall parts, is showne to you the highest elevation and range of a peece, yea as ever the peece is able to carry at length, as you may see in the figrues following of a Canon and a Culvering.</p>
               <p>The like is also showne you by the <hi>Levell</hi> marked (4) for the ayming, and levelling of peeces, when you are to take your marke aright, which also is usefull for the making of your <hi>platformes,</hi> and beddings for Ordnance, all which are necessarie for the Art of Gunnerie.</p>
               <p>This may also be made by a <hi>quart</hi> of the former Circle, if you devide it into 12 equall points, and so noted and ordered, that you must beginn to count from the midst of it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ends or sides to the 6 point, so that your <hi>plummet,</hi> being upon the 6 point iust as the others, you shall, finde that your peece is layd at its highest elevation and range.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cartabon</hi> (or your fouresquare levell) marked 5, comprehends also all the circle abouesaid, and is devided into 48 pointes, according to the foure quarters of the world, that is, <hi>East, South, North, and West,</hi> making also foure particular <hi>Quadrants,</hi> whereof the forked dart comming from the center or midst; showes all the lines, not onely of the <hi>Circle,</hi> but also of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> or your foure square levell, and running in a line from the midst, marked with O and N or with O and S, it will make a <hi>Levell,</hi> and is in the first degree of the right <hi>Quadrant,</hi> but comming from the midst, and betweene the said lines, it will shew you your highest elevation, as the other Quadrants haue done. The handle noted <hi>E. F.</hi> (if it be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible) must be 2 foote and a halfe long, whereof each foote must be 16 ynches, to the end it may make iust 40 inches, that in 3 foote and foure inches of our ordinary foote, which is an ordinary pace, or halfe a Geometricall one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of a Quadrant Levell, and the use of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each of these ought to haue in the midst, and at the end a little hole going from the one side of the handle to the other, which serue for this use, that this instrument being set upon the brich of your peece, looking through one of them aboue the highest <hi>Frizes:</hi> you may giue a shreud gesse how farre your peece will carry the bullet, according to the length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and proportion thereof. The two pins which you see on the sides of it, marked C F serue to this end, that thereby you may discerne the quality of the place, which you would measure, the point dessigning by its fall from the East towards the North, the length, bredth depth, and height of the same. Finally this instrument contayneth many misteries of great consequence, and is of excellent use both for an <hi>Inginer,</hi> and a <hi>Canonier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The common rule, whereby a <hi>Canonier</hi> may know how farre his peece will carrie, and how farre from one degree to an other, according to the <hi>elevation</hi> thereof, let him first see how many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42771:15"/>
paces it will carry being laid even with the mettle, which afterward he shall devide by 50. and multiply the Quotient by 11. and that will bring out the number of the further digression or range, which if he devides again by 44. he shall then find the quotient to be the just num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of paces which the bullet will loose in the other ranges, degree by degree, as for example A battering Canon will shoot its bullet being laid even with the mettle a thousand ordinarie paces, at two foot and a half the pace, which being devided by 50. your quotient will give 20 which being multiplyed again by 11. it will give 220. paces, which is the number of the next digression, made in the second degree of the quadrant, or the first after the Levell abovesaid.</p>
               <p>But all the other digressions or ranges, do alwaies diminish even unto the 45. degree. To know then what this diminishing is from degree to degree, even unto the 45. which is the highest elevation, you must take the just number of the digressions from the first to the 45. which will be 44. now deviding them by the former number of 220. paces, you shall find your quotient to be 5. which is the number which goes alwaies, decreasing from the first to the last digression, so that your Canon being laid upon its naturall mark, in which it is raised a degree above the Levell, even with the mettle, making a 1000. paces as is said, being laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the second degree, adding 220. paces to it as an advantage, then it will carry the bullet 1220. paces before it stops. Again, you may add the same to the third degree, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being the greatest digression, as we have taught, this then, and all the others will alwaies diminish 5. paces, and will make but 215. above the 1220. of the second degree, so that you shal have in your third degree 1435. paces. in the fourth degree 1645. in the fift degree 1850 paces, in the sixt 2050. paces, in the seventh, 2245. paces, in the eighth, 2435. in the ninth 2620. paces, in the tenth degree which is the first of the quadrant of 9. points, it will be 2800. paces, in the eleventh, 2975. in the twelft, 3145. in the thirteenth, 3310. in the fourteenth, 3470. paces, in the fifteenth, 3657. in the sixteenth, 3775. in the seventeenth, 3920. in the eighteenth 4060. in the nineteenth 4595. in the twentieth degree, which is the first of the second point, 4325. paces, in the one and twentieth, 4450. in the two and twentieth, 4570. in the three and twentieth, 4685. in the twenty fourth, 4795. in the twenty fift, 4900. in the twenty sixt, 5000. in the twenty seventh, 5095. in the twenty eight, 5185. in the twenty ninth 5270. paces, in the thirtieth which is the beginning of the third point, 5350. paces, In the thirty one, 5425. paces, in the two and thirty, 5595. in the three and thirty, 5560. in the four and thirty, 5620. in the five and thirty, 5675. in the six and thirty, 5725. in the seven and thirty 5770. in the eight and thirty, 5810. and in the nine and thirty degree, 5945. paces, in the forty point which is the beginning of the fourth point, 5875. in the 41. 5900. in the 42. 5920. in the 43. 5935. in 44. 5945. Lastly in the 45. when you reckon but foure halfe points of the quadrant, you have the highest elevation or range, as you shall see in the figure following, which maketh 5950 paces.</p>
               <p>To conclude, a skilfull Canonier exercising himself herein, will easily conceive and know certainly how to levell his peece upon any one of these degrees and points, and how farre it will carry, be it great or little: for this calculation will never fail him, by observing this, that in giving the chase or elevation of his peece, in what point soever it be of this rule or degree reaches from 1. inch to 16. which is a Geometricall foot. <hi>The next chapter following shall shew you the use of it in levelling of Ordnance after three manner of wayes, to wit, even or levell with the mettle, point-blanke, or upon a higher elevation at a range.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>TO do this, he must first take a crooked compasse, therewith take the highest frizes to or base ring of the brich, and marking well the distance of the two points which make the diamiter of the circumference upon a right line, then he must do the like upon the frizes of the peeces muzzle or mouth, and set the points of his Compasse upon the said line in such sort, that setting the one upon the first point which he had taken before, extending the other to the second, he shall divide the distance between the two points towards the lower part of the line, into the two equall parts, of which each will show him how much the frizes of the brich doth differ, or are higher then those of the mouth. Therefore to lay his peece right, so that it may be levelled even with the mouth, he must trace out this height upon a peece of wood or some such thing, and put it to the highest frizes of the mouth, and upon that a rule, which is so long that it will lye upon the frize of the brich, upon which, hanging a levell with a line and a plummet, he shall raise the peece or sinck it, till that the plummet comes to fall just in the midst, and then he shall have the boore thereof, right in the Levell.</p>
               <p>Then taking away the rule, and taking his aim upon the highest frize of the brich, and the height which is upon the frize of the mouth, he shal mark well the point which it showes him and surely in giving fire to his peece he shall without fail hit his mark.</p>
               <p>But it is needlesse alwaies to set the said height upon the frize of the mouth, therefore the Canonier shall hold it in his hand, whensoever he would shoot upon this point (which he is to do upon batteries, which have the mark neer enough) and shall take his aime levell by the mettle of his peece, as usually he doth, till he hath in his sight the mark he meanes to hitt, but because the distance being too near, and that the bullet may carry over, letting his peece stand without stirring it, he shall set the heigth which he hath in his hand upon the frize of the brich and observe well the point which it showes above the said height, and after he hath it, he shall lay his peece again levell by the mettle upon the said point, and he shal without fail hit his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired mark. But this being something obscure, I will explain it by an example, Suppose there be three points, as <hi>D. A. C.</hi> and that you would shoot even by the boore of the levell upon the point <hi>A.</hi> you must lay your peece levell by the mettle, but questionlesse you shall shoot over it, the distance being too near at hand for his aime, so that in giving fire to your peece the bullet will come to strike the point <hi>C.</hi> to hit then just upon the point <hi>A.</hi> you must set the said height upon the brich and taking from thence your aim (without moving your peece down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) you shal have in your sight the point <hi>D.</hi> from which having taken away the said height you shall lay your peece again levell by the mettle as before, and giving fire, the bullet will fly over <hi>D.</hi> and strike just upon your desired mark <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If occasion were that you would shoot at a mark which is too far for the aime, levell by the boore, and notwithstanding is so neer for the Ordnance levell, a Canonier must use this discretion, to wit, the distance being a third part further, he must then take away a third part of the height, and if it exceeds the carriage of the levell two parts, then he must also take away two parts, and he shall snoot so right, that if it were for a wager he would hit a shilling or at least a hat without fayling.</p>
               <p>This is your Ordnance pointeries against batteries, which according to the instruction given before, one ought to approach as neere an enemie as one can, so that if you do not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42771:16"/>
take heed to lay alwaies this heigth upon the brich of your peece, you will alwaies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot your mark, contrary to the desire of a good Canonier, which is alwaies to beat upon the foot or foundation of a wall, that it may tumble down, and be battered the sooner, for the easier entrance of a breach, observing that it is one of the principallest considerations in all shoots, that in making a good shot one levels his peece at the foot of his mark, especially in shooting at a troup of horse, or a company of foot. But in a stony place, a Canonier doth willingly shoot short, because in striking upon the stones or bricks, in razing them, he makes a hole much greater then the bullet which goeth through them. But in a plaine place one must lay his peece so, as the bullet may take them iust in the middle, or about the girdle, and so may kill a whole file, or a rank at a shot, yea though they should all fall flat down upon the ground, yet they cannot all escape, otherwise if you levell too high, it may be accounted but as a lost shot. To amend then a shot too high for this mark, you must levell your peece up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the white or marke you shoot at, then going to the mouth of your peece with a levell line and a plummer, and take there the height of the highest frize or ring to the bottome of the boore, which you shall set to the frize of the brich, and from thence, and aboue the frize of the mouth, you shall take (without stirring the peece) your aime, marking well the place it will shew you, then taking away the said heigth, you shall lay your peece againe upon the point it showed you, and so without fayling, you shall hitt the mark you desired. But if you peece carries to short, it must be amended in this manner, lay the peece as before, then going to the mouth with your line and plummet, take all the heigth of the frize from the top to the bottome, in such sort, that your line may take the whole Dyamiter of all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference thereof, and by this dyamiter, you shall take the thicknesse of the  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ettle from the bottome of the boore, even to the lowest part of the said frize, and laying this heigth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the brich of the peece, and levelling it upon the mark dessigned, which you would shoot at, you shall see the good effect it will take: now for a shot that is made on either side of your mark, it is to be helpt in this manner following, if the bullet fals on the right side of it, then you must lay or mooue your peece, and take your aime so much on the left hand, and that you may not faile a hairesbreadth, now to make the distance of the other side alike, you shall level your peece as before, right upon your white, then take a long ruler, which you shall lay upon the frizes, aswell of the brich, as of the muzzle, and leaving it upon the mouth, you shal take your aime removing it at the brich so long, till you haue got in your sight the place of the side shot which your bullet made, and without taking away your eye, or your hand from this fight, removing the brich of your carriage, till the brich of your peece, comes to be right in the midst under the said ruler, which being done, take away the ruler, and take your aime level by the mettle of the peece, and you shall find your peece to be turned iust as much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your left hand, as it shot before on your right hand. Moreouer, there are many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which may cause a bullet to straggle either on the one side or on the other. The first is, when the boore is boored more on the one then vpon the other side, or by reason of the inequallity of the mettle, or that the mould is not right: this cannot be imputed a fault in the Canonier but in the Founder: neuerthelesse, if he be ingenious, he may helpe this fault by his discretion trying his peece by his creuset in, or scaling primer, and so help it as the fault may require.</p>
               <p>A Peece also will carry sidelings, if the tronions be not iust right the one ouer against the other. Also if the platforme be not layd even, but that the one part is higher then the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item</hi> if a Canonier it taking of his aime stirs his eye from the iust middle of the frizes of the peece, and though he hath it, yet he may faile in not taking his aime iust in the middle of his mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item</hi> if one wheele be higher then the other, the shot will fly alwaies toward the lower side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item</hi> if one of the wheeles should stay upon a naile, and the other not, as likewise when the one turns more easily then the other, and if one wheel should stand upon dirty ground and the other on hard, or when one of the Cubes or heads of the wheele is longer then he other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42771:17"/>
                  <hi>Item</hi> When the bullet is not driven home alike, or lies more upon the one side of the boore then upon the other: And Finally, the straying of the bullet upon the one side may be caused by the vehemency of the wind, when it cannot be holpen.</p>
               <p>Likewise a short or an overshot may be occasioned either by the force or the weakenesse of the powder, or by reason of the unskilfullnesse of the Gunner which knowes not to lay and levell his peece aright, neither knowes the true distance of the mark whereat he shootes.</p>
               <p>All which I have marked at large, not as a matter to excuse an unexpert Canonier but to give advice to the wise to have a vigilant eye upon all things, and to follow the rules above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; and so to prevent all inconveniences, for to faile the first time may passe, the second may be pardoned, but the third time is too much, and cannot be excused, because it is a certain signe of indiscretion and want of iudgement; And indeed there is no fault which we have shown, but by discretion it may be remedied, whereof we have seen many examples at the famous siege of <hi>Ostend,</hi> wherein a sound iudgement was shown in this kind, whereof I will relate two examples.</p>
               <p>A ship running into the haven to get into the Town, which brought the enemy some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, a woman sat at the helm to make us ashamed, order was given to a Canonier that he should make a shot at this Steeresse, who thinking it was too cruell a thing to shoot at so weak a sexe, offered to take away the helme from between her hands, and to make the boat come floating towards us with the floud, if she were not provided with an other, which he presently put in practice, levelling his peece so right and discreetly, that indeed shooting of the helme it fell in the water, and the boat came floating towards our quarter, where it was pillaged and burnt in sight of our enemies.</p>
               <p>An other ship lying at anckor, staying for a high water to come into the Towne, our men to sinck it made many Canon shot at it in vaine, judging that the distance was too far to do it any harme, whereupon they were forbidden to shoot any more at it, and not to spend their powder to no purpose: But at last there came a Canonier who promised not onely to strike the ship, but also to shoot the Cable in sunder, so that by favour of the water the boat should come floating to our mercy, and indeed, levelling and giving fire to his peece, he shot the Cable in peeces, and to the great admiration of all our Army, the boat came swimming to our quarter. These examples I have related and will do others in the following Chapters, to shew the skill of a good Canonier that hath discretion and judgement in such occurrences, and to give encouragement to all Canoniers and Gunners to do the like when occasion shall serve.</p>

BETWEENE THE MASTER, OR GENERALL OF THE Ordnance, and a Captaine, to know whether a Demy Canon or a Culvering will carry furthest at the highest range, and how a Canonier must levell, and raise his Canon, and Culvering to try it, as the two next figures following shall demonstrate.</head>

                     <p>SENOR CAPTAINE, I haue often heard that in trying of a Canon with a Culvering, at randome, it hath bin found that the Canon will carry its bullet further then a Culvering, and indeede I should be of the same opinion, if your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course perswade mee not to the contrary.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord there are many reasons, which one must yeeld vnto, that a Culvering will carry its bullet further then a Canon.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>It may be so, yet I haue heard many men say, who haue tryed it, that a Canon will carry further, then the Culvering.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>It may well be, but I would fain see the tryall thereof, to the end it might be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>How ought then a due tryall to be made thereof.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Sure it is, that a Culvering is mounted vpon a higher and a longer carriage, then a Canon is, and that the crosse-beames vpon which the brich of the Canon resteth, being higher then that of a Canon, and the peece being longer cannot stoope so much as to elevate its mouth so high as a Canon can, that hath its carriage shorter, then the crossebeames lower, for the shorter a peece is, the easier it may be elevated even to 45 degrees of the quadrant aboue said, whence will follow, that a Canon being raised to a higher elevation, must needs carry its bullet further then a Culvering, not that the fault is in it, but that it wants its due elevation, for if it could be raised to the same elevation and degree the Canon is, then you should see the Culvering, would ouer shoot the Canon by far.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Generall.</speaker>
                     <p>How so? then there must bee some fault in the Inginier, that made the mettall of it, or else in the Carpenter in the makeing or frameing of the Carriage.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt</speaker>
                     <p>It may be in both of them, though they have done their best endeavour, because they haue not attained vnto the heigth of this perfection: for as in the Art of Gunnerie, so in the fabricking and framing of the other Engines and Instruments, there are many secrets in them, which a common capacity cannot so easely find out.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>How shall we then discouer this mistery, and to haue a sure tryall therof, that the one peece may haue no more advantage then the other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>To haue a true tryall thereof, first the carriages of the one and of the other must be so rightly fitted, and locked with crosse-beames low enough, to giue both the peece one and the same elevation, as you may see in the figures following.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. They must be planted upon two plaine and euen plate formes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the Culvering cannot be laid vpon the same height as the Canon is, then you must take away so much of the Crosse beame of the Carriage, that the brich of it may sinck, and the muzzle lie vpon the same elevation as the Canon doth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Generall.</speaker>
                     <p>What need is it then to take away so much of the Crosse-beames, and so to weaken the Carriage, which may easelie bee remedyed by digging a hole in the ground, to make the brich of the carriage sink into it, till the muzzle of the peece be raised high enough.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>It may well be done, when there is no strife nor dispute about it, to which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary parties will never agree, because of giuing an advantage.</p>

                     <p>What advantage can there be in this, to haue a peece to lye vpon a plat-forme, and to haue the brich of the carriage sunke a little into the ground.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I am of that mind, that a peece, which hath the brich of the Carriage stept from

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I am of that mind, that a peece, which hath the brich of the Carriage stept from recoyling, will shoot its bullet with a greater force and violence, then that which lies freer upon an explanado, or a plat-form, And therefore to giue no advantage to a Culvering, it is better to shaue of some of the Crossebeames, to cause it to sinke lower, then to ly in such a ditch by raiseing the muzzell to the required height as you may see in the figures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>I haue heard diverse disputes among good Canoniers touching this point, Who thought that a Culvering, could not carry so farre as a Canon, because this peece being long, the bullet must go a longer way from out the chamber to the mouth, and that before the bullet comes out, the powder in that while may loose some of the strength thereof, whereas a Canon being shorter, and the flying of a bullet out of the Canon shorter, the powder will send it going with a greater strength.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I beleeue well that there is some reason for what you alledge for the length of a Culvering, and the shortnesse of a Canon, when they are charged with that quantity of powder as their bullets require: but for your Culvering, in regard of the length of it, you giue it a greater charge, whereas for the charging of your Canon, you giue it in powder but halfe the weight of his bullet, and to an ordinary Culvering, you give it, in powder, or the weight of the bullet, but being a Culvering renforced, you may giue it as many pound of powder as the weight of your bullet.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen</speaker>
                     <p>I will demaund of you Sir one question more, and therewith conclude this discourse, If you were to shoot at ships upon the Sea, what peeces would you choose to be best either your Canon or your whole Culvering?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Of this you may be assured from one that hath found it by experience, that there is no better peeces to do this then your Canon.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Giue me your reason?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Your Canon being shorter, may be laid lower, and better levelled, considering also that their bullets are weightier then the others, and fly more certain, because neither the wind, nor the humidity of the water, can haue any such great power to dead or hinder their sight.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>How so? seeing your Culvering taketh a greater charge of powder, then your Canon, as you even now confessed is better, and will ding away the bullet with a more violent force.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>My reason is that the wind and the moistnesse of the water haue more power over a lighter, then of Canon bullet, which is heavier then a Culvering, now if you were to shoot at a ship of a like distance, you must raise your Culvering to your thinking two pikes length higher then the ship is, whereas your Canon will require but one pikes length of elevation aboue it. Therefore I haue made many a tryall of it at the siege of Ostend, both of a Canon and of a Culvering.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Well Sir you haue satisfied mee, and given mee good reasons for what you say: but I pray you tell me whether a peece will carrie furthest, which is shot out of the Sea to the landward, or that which is shot from the shoare side, along the superfices of the water</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>This were a hard question to resolue, if one had not made experience of it, Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I will tell you what I haue seen, that wee shooting into the Sea from our batteries in Dunkirke at the Enemies shipping, which rid before the Town, we could scarce reach them, But I haue seen with admiration, that the Enemy shooting from their shipping to us ward, their bullets flew from that place, fiue hundred paces further, then ours did, where wee stood, yea some of them into the very Towne of Dunkirke.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely I was of a contrary opinion, thinking that a peece planted upon the firme
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42771:19"/>
ground, the bullet would flie further, and with a more violent force, then that which is shot from a floating ship, because the peece in recoyling shakes the ship, and by the shaking therof, the bullet may loose some of its strength, but these are secrets in nature, more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then apprehensible.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>True it is, that there are many hidden and secret misteries in nature, but for this one may alledg some naturall causes: for a bullet shot from a ship to the land-ward, seeketh its naturall resting place: but that which is shot from the land along the surface of the water, the bullet is forced to striue against two elements, that is first against the aire, which retaineth it with all might, and secondly against the moistnesse of the water, which also deads the bullet, causing it to stoope, for this hath bin found by experience to be true, that a bullet will shoot further into the Sea at a low water, then it will doe at a high Sea.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>If a peece were so planted, that one could shoot both into the land, and also into the Sea, by turning the said peece, the question is, whether the bullet would flye furthest over the Land, or upon the Sea.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>A Canon will carry its bullet a thousand paces further over the Land, then it will do upon the superficies of the water, and though we haue had no certain tryall of it: yet the siege of Ostend hath taught us this experience, that we may be assured of it: For in the channell by Newport, when the battle in Flaunders was fought Anno. 1600. we shot at the Enemyes shipping and men of warre, to make them giue back, that our men might come up along the strand with more safety, and lesse danger to fight, we found that our bullets, which were shot at them from the land, could not reach them to doe them any harme, but the Enemies bullets, which were shot from their men of warre, shot amongst us, and flew fiue or sixe hundred paces over our heads.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>That might well be, for perhaps the enemies peeces were either greater or longer then ours, or else that they had finer, and stronger powder then ours had.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>The Calibres and boores of the one and of the other were alike, for their bullets fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our peeces, but indeed in the goodnesse of the powder there might be some difference, and for our parts to charge them well, we put a Ladle full of powder more then ordinary into ours, but this would not help. This question I haue asked many times, both of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Marriners, who haue given me alwaies this reason, that it was for some secret cause in nature, that a shot being made into the land, should fly further, then that which was made from the land into the water.</p>

                     <p>Though this troubled me a little yet I am glad to heare your reasons, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you have had. But I had almost forgotten to haue asked you one question more, which now I call to mind how comes it to passe, that all the charge of the powder takes not fire, and is not consumed in a Canon, aswell as in a Culvering.</p>

                     <p>This is not any fault or advantage in the peeces, for one would thinke that a Canon being shorter, and of a Larger bore then a Culvering a small part of the powder might bee expulsed or driuen out before it be all fired, and that a Culvering being longe and straight, might keept in the powder till it takes all fire, but this is done at a venture, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it happens oftner in a Canon, by reason of the biggnesse of the boore, then in a Culvering, for after you haue giuen your peece its due charge of powder to ramme it vp some what close into the chamber of your peece, you give it two or 3 shoues with the end of your Rammer, the powder being well corned; there lies ordinarily some loose cornes and dust by the way in the bottome of the mould, which the wispe or stopping hath not driven home, so that if a Canonier, doth not take very good heed, there will alwaies be some part of the powder shed in the peece, which will ly before the bullet, and when the rest of powder takes fire those loose cornes flyes out, and cannot take fire, like as you see also that some shreds and peeces of the stopping after the shot is made, and smoaks without being consumed by fire. So that your <hi>Lo.</hi> may be assured that any peece of ordnance be it either short or long, if the charge of the powder be well stopped and rammed home and some

loose cornes which will fly back gathered well up by the wisp, there will not be so much as one Corn, but will all take fire. This is seen also in the tryall of Bombards and Morters, which though they be short, and large mouthed, fire and consume, all their powder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loosing so much as a graine.</p>

                     <p>Now I vnderstand well, and confesse that hitherto I haue bin of the vulgar opinion attributing the cause to the shortnesse of the peece and herewith we will conclude.

               <head>CONTAYNING THE DEMONSTRATION OF Morters, and the vse of them. THE TENTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>YOUR great and small Morters, are not onely serviceable in a warre offensiue, by shooting and casting of great <hi>Granadoes,</hi> as of a 100, 150, 170 pound weight, and smaller of 40 and 50 pound, but also by casting of Fire-balles, stones, old rubbidge, and peeces of yron into Cities, Townes, and Fortresses, and may be used also defensiuely, to be shot from Townes, and Forts besieged, into any Enemies workes, and approaches, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially they are of singular use, when an Enemy hath covertly approached, and lodged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe under some Bulwark, Tower, or Turret, and is a beginning to undermine them, which if they do, you may plant one of these Morters at a reasonable distance, on the inside of your Wall, and shooting your <hi>Granado,</hi> as it were bolt upright into the aire, by its naturall fall, it may light iust into the Enemies workes, and there with great violence, breaking among them, it w <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll make them cry, flye, and forsake the place, you may also fire them out of a place, by casting good store of <hi>hand-granadoes</hi> down among them, and so annoy them, that the work will be too hot for them.</p>
               <p>Two of these Morters are represented unto you, in the plate and figurs following number. Now for the shooting away of your great Granadoes or Firebals, you must ever remember, but to take ⅕ or 1/7 part of fine powder of the weight of your grandoe or thing which you shoot, but if you are to shoot away a bullet without any fire workes in it, or some massie stone, or such like solid thing, then you must take but halfe the weight of it in fine powder, which having given fire to the Morter, will send it going merrily.</p>
               <p>The use of them is not to shoot in a right line, as other ordance doe, but in an oblique line, as you may see by the two figures following, unlesse your morter be mounted to 90 degrees, mounting them usually aboue 45 degrees, namely to 60 70 80. and sometimes more or lesse, as the distance, and fall of your Granadoe or shot shall require.</p>
               <p>Having before shown you the making and use of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> it remaines now, that I come to the charging and use of a morter, now before you put in your powder, it must be well sponged and cleared, whether you charge it with loose powder, or Cartouch, turning the mouth almost bolt upright, the powder being put into the chamber, you must stop it with a wade, either of Hay or okam, and after a Tamkin of some soft wood, and this with the powder that was put in first, it must fill up the whole chamber thereof, that there may be no vacuity, between the powder, and the wadd, or betweene the wadd, and the shot, this done the shot shall be put in at the mouth, with another wadd after it, but you must haue a care that your Morter be not much mounted, least your shot flies out too soon, and the wadd between the Tampkin, and the shot will not onely saue the shot from the Tampkins breaking of it, but also is to avoid vacuities, which may endanger the breaking of the peece by second expansions.</p>
               <p>Now then having resolved of the premisses, touching your peece, shot, and powder, as aboue said, and upon the distance and monture of your mark, as the rules and tables fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing shall direct you, then for the bending and disposing of it to the assigned mark, lay first a straight ruler upon the mouth of your morter, and upon it place a quadrant (as you may see by the figures, or some other instrument crosse-wise, to set the morter vpright for shuning of wide shooting, and then placeing them fore- <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight to elevate it into the resolved degree of monture, to avoid short or overshooting accordingly, as the tables following will teach you, for having made one shot, you may thereby, proportion the rest considering whether you are to shoot with or against the wind, or whether it blowes towards the right or the left hand, whether weakely, or strongly, and so accordingly to giue or abate the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or disadvantage, which iudgment and discretion will induce you thereunto, and the helpe of the Rules following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42771:20"/>
Now wee will come to the use of a morter, and that in this example following, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an Enemy be approached to the <hi>Basis,</hi> or foot of a wall, or a Bulwark, and there is a rooting, and begins to make a mine, and having chambred his powder, intends to blow it up, and that there is no other meanes left you, to repulse, and hinder their egresse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse into it: but by shooting out of your morters some Granadoes firebals, stones and rubish among them, or at least by casting many hand-granadoes down uponthem. To do this either by force or policy, it behoveth a good canonier, or fire-worker, to know first (as hath bin taught) how far his morter will carry a granado, or any solid thing else, which shalbe shot out of it, being set upon such and such a degree &amp; elevation as the morter figure will show you. As for example, takey our aime levell with the mould or mouth of your morter, noted A upon the quadrant, and it will carry 200 paces, where you see the grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do fals upon the letter A. but your morter being elevated to the mark B it then will carry its bullet 487 paces, if to the second C, then 755 paces, if to the third D, it will carry 937 paces, if to the fourth E, then 1065 paces, if to the fifth elevation F, then 1132 paces, if to the sixth <hi>G,</hi> which is in the midst of the quadrant, and lies then upon its highest elevation it will carry 1170 paces, as you may see by the severall fals of the bullets upon every letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The second figure showes you a morter casting a granado upon a Castle, as you may see by the example.</p>

The Eleventh Chapter.</head>
               <p>FIrst, take three parts of Canon powder well pounded, and sifted, one third part of Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish pitch, &amp; halfe the weight thereof in brimstone, mingle these two lightly together, and then add to them a half part of ordinary salt, and afterwards knead them well together, with oyle of linseed. This done, fill the pipe of a Cain, with some of this paste, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture for a tryall of it: if it carryes the flame cleare and faire, and blowes out of the pipe, with an offensiue force, without cleaving to the pipe, into which it was put, then without all question it is a signe and token of the goodnesse and perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Now to charge a granado for your Morter or Bombard with this mixture, and ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: first you must take a round stick, to turn them about withall, of the bignes that it may go iust into the touch-hole of your granado, which you are to charge by reaching down to the very bottome of it, and giue it a stamp or two with the said stick, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, filling and stamping it, untill you haue filled up the concaue of your granado up to the touch-hole of it within three or foure fingers breadth, then put into the pipe, or hole of your granado, an artificiall match, and fill it up round about the match, with the aforesaid Ingrediences even up to the very top of it, which you may do with your finger, without the help of the stick, because the match will stand bolt upright in the hole, and in the verymidst of it. Lastly take a peece of course linnen cloath and smeare it over with pitch and waxe well melted together, and lay it over the mouth of your touch-hole, in such sort, that the upper end of your match may peepe up a little through a small hole, made in your cloth, and then you must bind it hard about, by making your cloth fast to the mouth of the Morter.</p>
               <p>There are divers other receits, both for the making of your Compositions, for great and small Granadoes, much differing one from the other, but of all others, this aboue is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vse, and therefore it is needlesse for me to spend more time in the further search and discription of them: onely remember this for a generall rule, that in all compositions, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ingrediences, they must all be well dryed, pounsed, and pulverized, but for your great morters, it will suffice if they be lightly broken, the fall, breaking, and operation of them, are able to teare, rend, and breake downe houses in peeces. The figures of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes are marked ABC vnder, the Morter figure.</p>
               <p>The same ingrediences will serue also for your hand-granadoes if they be finely dryed, pounced and pulverized as is aboue-said, and thus much for your Bombards Morters and granadoes both great and small.</p>

               <p>THE Modell or forme of a pettard, represented unto you in the next plate and figure, is not much unlike to a Grocers, or an Apothecaries Spice-morter, and some are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred much like a Coopers payle, little deeper then the Dyamiter of their mouthes but being not aboue ¾ in dyamitre at their bottome, or breech of their mouthes calibre, and in thicknesse of mettell  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Dyamitre at their breech, and lessening by degrees in thick nes towards their mouthes, Their magnitudes are some to hold but one pound of I ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or lesse, and others to hold 50 pound or more, and they vsually allow foure pound of brasse, or fiue pound of yron, to cast a pettard for one pound of powder, and two hundred 50 pound of brasse, or 3 hundred pound for a pettard that shall hold fifty pound of powder, using those proportions diminished for lesser, and augmented for greater, as Mr Norton in his practize of Artillery describeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The demonstration thereof out of Diego Vffano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being massie and heavie (whereof the figure A is the mouth, B the breech neere the touch-hole) it must be carried upon a thick-board or planck, marked E E, and then layd upon a Karr noted C D, which serues not only for the use of it, but also to raise it, when you are to hang and fasten it upon a Port. This planchier in the midst, hath a round hole in it marked H, Through which the nose, or mouth of your pettard is enchased. Aboue it there are two yron rings to hang it on to two Crochets marked G screwed fast into the port marked A with a match to giue fire unto it. A A are the Bungs, or tampkins wherewith the mouth of the Pettard is bunged up or stopped.</p>
               <p>The outside on which the planchier is enchased being three inches thicke is even and plaine, armed with strong plates of yron to defend it from splitting: it is also to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped with the forked rest, and stayed in the ground at the hirder end to keepe it from recoyling.</p>
               <p>When you charge your pettard, you put a round stick into the very midst of the mouth of it down to the bottome, about the length of halfe a cube and some two fingers in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, &amp; put no more into it at a time, then the better part of a pound of fine come powder, and so fill it litle and litle, stamping it well in, round about the said stick, with yron drifts or wodden stampers within the concaue of the Pettard, vntill it be filled within one fingers breadth of the top and haue its due charge, then tume your stick in the midst about draw it out gently and fill up the hole out of which you draw the sticke with fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that when you are to giue fire at the touch-hole, the whole charge within may be fired in the twinckling of an eye, And having thus giuen it the full charge, then stop the mouth of it closse with the bung or tampkin noted A, which must be of the thicknesse of your litle finger, and lastly couer the mouth thereof with a thick waxed cloath, and power melted waxe vpon it some two fingers thick aboue the tampkin, &amp; thus much for the charg ing of a pettard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42771:22"/>
Now we come to the fastning and hanging it on a gate, to do this well, you must first scrue in fast into the Gate the Crochets marked <hi>G.</hi> and make choice as neere as you can of the weakest place of the <hi>Gate</hi> or <hi>Port,</hi> where it may easiliest be broken open, upon this hang your <hi>Planchier</hi> and put the mouth of your <hi>Pettard</hi> through the hole of the <hi>Planchier</hi> aboue mentioned, then fasten it firmly to the Port. There is also a third ring or a crochet, and the eare of your Pettard through which you put a roap to bind your pettard fast to the Port.</p>
               <p>And being thus fastened, and hung vpon a port, nothing remaines then, but to give fire to it, but your Pettardier must haue a singular care, that he orders his match so, within the Touch-hole, that is giues not fire too soon, but that he and the men which help him may haue leasure and time to come of with safety, before the pettard burst open the gate, least any be mischeived with the violence of the breaking of this diabolicall Engine, which hauing taken its operation, and the gate flying open, your men must presently enter, but one caviat I must giue you by the way, that while they are a fastning and hanging on your pettard, to the gate, you must haue a speciall care, to look to the Percullies, that it be well vnderpropped to keep it from falling, for I my selfe was onee vpon a peece of service at <hi>Venlo,</hi> that yeere as the Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> took in Rhyn-berg, and having burst open one gate of the Town, the petar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier hanging his pettard vpon a second gate, a woman throwing a great stone down from the top of the wall fel'd the pettardier while he was a doing his businesse, which gaue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my so much time that they knocked down their percullis, and so catched some 30 of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seur <hi>Chastilons</hi> Company between the last gate and the percullies, who first should haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Town, and being massacred and taken pirsoners, the surprising of that Town by this accident failed. The figures following doth demonstrate all things vnto you that it may be the better vnderstood.</p>

                        </gap>dition is, that the violence of the Canon planted upon the battery A. beates with as much force upon the flanck E. D. as it doth upon the Face C. D. whence it is manifest, that the Angle of the <hi>espaule</hi> or shoulder EDC. being devided into two equall parts with the right line T. V. D. A. that then this battery of necessity must come to be in the right line T. D A. Secondly, that the face D. C. and I. G. and the distance D. G. may with the like Canon shot be flancked and beaten upon by the battery A. that is, when as the Angles I. A. G. G. A D. D. A. C. are alike one to the other, whence will follow, that through the five points, C. D. G. I and A. a circular circumference will passe. Now for that which concernes the third known part, namely, as that the batterie A. must be no further from C. then sixty rodd, or six hundred foot, A. being the greatest distance in the circumference as is in the third booke and fifteenth proposition which is taken from of the middle-line of Euclids propositions, we have found out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to this preparation, the middle line as <hi>C. Y.</hi> to be sixty rodds, the right line <hi>C. I.</hi> to be nine 34. rodds, 7. foot, and 7. inches, or 34. 77/00 and the lines <hi>I. G. G.

Q. as superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the depth I. C. are together alike to the corps upon the Quadrate I.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Generall.</speaker>
                  <p>HAving brought your Approches neere unto a Towne or a Forttesse, whether would you choose a Bulwarke or a Curtaine to be battered with your Ordnance?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Captaine</speaker>
                  <p>A. Towne may be assaulted in divers places, sometimes you assault one side, when as you make your Batterie on an other, Sometimes you choose a Bulwarke, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles a Curtaine to be battered, with this intention, to take in the Towne, assoone as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible may bee. As for mee, if I were to take in a great Towne which is populous, I had rather choose to batter a Curtaine, then a Bulwarke, which hath a high catt, or mount upon it: especially, seeing that in great Townes the Bulwarkes lying one far from an other, they doe show the skirt of the Curtaine very open.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Why would you rather choose a Curtain then a Bulwark?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Because your Bulwarks are alwaies stronger and better fortified then your Curtain, and being as it is the principall strength of a place, and better furnished with platformes, flancks, &amp;c. will require more time, labour, and charge to batter then your Curtaine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>But what Generall is so ill experienced, as to labour to batter a Curtaine, having two strong Bulwarkes on both sides of him, to flanker him when hee is to put over his Gallerie, and to giue an assault upon the Curtaine: peradventure for his labour and paines, hee may bee well beaten.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Soft (Good Sir,) Suppose that after a great deale of labour and paines you haue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a Bulwarke, and falling up to the breach to assault it, you finde it cut off, and an Enemy lodged in it, must you not then beginne to sap forward againe, to make a new batterie, whereas on a Curtaine there is not that meanes of cutting it off, as upon a large Bulwarke.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Haue you ever seene the experience of it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes Sir, the Prince of Orange tooke in the Bosch by a Bulwark, and also Breda, but Mastricht was taken in by making a breach, and springing of a mine, upon the Curtain bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween Jonger Port and a bulwark, howsoever the Town of <hi>Cortes</hi> upon the frontiers of France, was first battered by the <hi>Arch-duke of Austria</hi> upon the point of a Bulwark, neer unto the very ioynt of the Curtain, where a high, and a strong turret stood, which did annoy us much, so that we could not advance forward, but were constrayned to leaue off our approach on that side, and began to make a new Batterie for a breach in a Curtain on the Field-side, where there lay a strong Bulwark to defend it, which did our men a great deal of harm, but wohsoever with great difficulty and much adoe, we took in the Town that way, by lodging our selues in the Curtain: Likewise the city of <hi>Cambray</hi> was battered, and taken in upon a Curtain, for all there were two strong Bulwarks that flanked it, which if we had run our line upon a Bulwark, we should not haue forced it so soon, yea such an occasion might present it self, that a Generall may be forced to batter both the one and the other, or to find out some secret way by undermining a wall, and blowing it up with powder.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>This is for your great Townes, but what say you to a Castle, a Cattadel, or some nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Fortresse, how will you goe to worke to take in those with the best advantage.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>As for your Forts, and Castles, it is much better to batter them upon a mount or a Bulwark, then upon a Curtain: my reason is this, that in these your Bulwarks lying close one by an other, will flank one an other with the greater force, and hide the Curtain much better to defend it, so that one cannot so easily force it, if the said defences be not taken away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Go to then; a Town then being to be battered, either upon a Curtain or a Bulwark how many peeces of Ordnance would you haue to do it, and how, and in what manner would you place, and plant your Ordnance upon your batteries to make a good breach?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt</speaker>
                  <p>To effect this, I would haue 18. peeces of canon and halfe canon, <hi>(for lesser peeces for batterie are novv grovvne out of use).</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether would you choose more whole canon or halfe canon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>To batter a place well either upon an stony or a earthy wall, you may assure your self,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42771:26"/>
the more whole canon you haue, the greater and the moresufficient your breach will be: for your great battering peeces doe spoile, and beate downe any thing, which doth meete with their great force and violence: <hi>howsoever of late yeares, experience hath taught at divers seiges that your halfe Canon vvhich are more portable, having good store of them, vvill doe the businesse asvvell as your vvhole canon.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>But at what distance would you make your batteries, for these 18. peece. of Canons and how neere unto the place, which you intend to batter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I would counsell a Generall to approach as neere unto that place as possible may bee, and make his batteries some two or three hundred paces one from an other, and that if it were possible to advance covertly the Approch and sap, even up to the Counter-scharfe, and very brinke of the moate, to prepare a way for his Gallerie: not onely to batter that place being at hand with the greater force, but also to keepe in, and hinder an Enemie from Sallying out upon the beseigers, to discover and dismount their Ordnance in <hi>Casemates,</hi> or if they haue sunke any in their walles or False-bray, and so to terrifie them, that they dare not stirre out.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>I am also of your opinion, and hold it for good, yet I feare this will not be so soon done, and is sooner spoken, then executed, and that before you can bring your approach and sapp so far it will cost you warme blood, and a great many mens liues, if you haue a stout Enemie within to deale withall, and one that is very Vigilant, and carefull to stand upon his Guard, and his defence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>T'is true, this cannot bee done without danger, and the losse of men, but hee that is fearefull must stay at home, and not come into the warres where there is neither place nor time, which doth free or exempt him from danger: yet the danger is not alwaies so great, especially in such places, where you haue Earth enough to worke with, to cast up your sapps, and to heighthen and deepen your Approaches, which will show you the more higher you finde the ground in Approching to the edge of the moate, the deeper trenches you may make and cover your selfe by casting up of blinds continually, to keepe you from the sight of the besieged, and it is better when you haue brought your approach as it were under them, then if you were 200. or 300. paces distant from them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gene.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray you Good Sir, how would you plant, and devide these 18. peeces of Canon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I would make a great batterie with 8. of them to beate upon a right line, either upon a Curtaine or the point of a Bulwarke (which the Generall shall finde fittest) Two batteries with each 3. Canon to play slope-wise from the great batterie as the ninth plate and 28. and 29. figures showes, and two batteries, with two halfe Canon a peece to play as it were cross-wise upon the breach, and thus you see your 18. peeees planted upon 5. bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as you may obserue in the ninth plate and the two figures of a Curtaine and of a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke following.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Good Sir tell mee I pray you how many shot will these 18. peeces of Canon make in 10. howers, and how much powder will they require.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>In 10. howres they may make some 1500. shott, and will require a matter of 25000. pound weight of powder, that is 150. barrels full, each barrell contayning 160. pound weight in it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>You make your account then that every peece in the space of 10. howers is to shoot 80. shot, that is 8. shot an hower for every peece.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>You may make 10 shot in an howre if you please, if your peeces be renforced, but as for your ordinary peeces, they haue not mettailline substance enough to beare it: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering also that after you haue made 40. shot out of a peece, it will be so heated, that it must haue a cooling time, which must bee at least an hower, for otherwise your peece being growne over hot, it may cause danger.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>Me thinkes that 80. shot for a peece in so long a time were too little, having often heard, that in that while, a peece may wellbe shot of 130. times, can you giue me your resolution upon this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I will tell you Sir what hapned once in the Iland of <hi>Bomble</hi> Anno 1599. we planted a peece by a mill, by which we did annoy the Enemy very much, so that they were forced to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42771:26"/>
make a battery, and planted a whole Canon and a demy-canon upon it, seeking to dismount ours. Now shooting with this peece from foure of the clock in the morning, till eleven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward noone, this peece had a cooling time the space of two howers, and about one of the clock, wee began to play with it againe, and continued shooting with it till 4. a clock in the afternoon: but this peece being not able to endure the force and heating of so many shot, we were constrain'd to leaue off with it and yet ceased not shooting with our other peeces from an other batterie by command from <hi>Don Lewes de Valasco</hi> Generall of our Ordnance, and shooting croswise with some other of our peeces, wee put the Enemies two peeces to silence in the space of an hower, a Souldier of ours standing by, was curious to keepe a taily of the number of all the shot we made from the morning till foure a clock in the afternoone, and showed mee 80. notches, which deducting the two howers cooling, our peece planted at the mill made 8 shot in an hower, which was as much as could be required of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Senior</hi> Diego Vffano <hi>giue your Translatour leaue to interrupt you a little, and so to conclude this discourse. If you remember at the seige of Ostend which you mention often in your Chapters and dialogues you were without, and I was within the Towne, that on the seventh of January Anno 1602. Stilo Novo, After Sir</hi> Francis Vere <hi>of famous memory (who defended and kept the Towne against you) had deluded you with a</hi> Parley, <hi>onely to gaine time, and to make up our Canon and Sea-beaten workes, along the skirt of the old Towne, his highnesse the Archduke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to assault us, and that morning began to batter</hi> Sand-hill <hi>and</hi> Schotenburgh, <hi>to make a breach for you against that night, with intent to Assault us (as you did) and to haue entred the Towne, and haue put us all to the sword, the Relation whereof you shall heare in the end of this booke. Now you had placed and planted your 20. peeces of Canon to batter them in this manner, 8. from your batterie at the foote of the</hi> downes, 8. <hi>from a batterie on the right hand of the downes, 6. more which you had made upon the sand, and as it were raised out of the sea: the first shot upon the breach in a right line, and the other 2. slopewise, as your two figures following doe demonstrate. These 20. peeces of Canon towards noone had a cooling time, for a matter of some 2. howers, just as you haue said, and afterward you began to batter the breach and old Towne againe, till it was almost twilight, and then they cooled againe, till you were readie to giue us an assault, and before you fell on as I doe well remember, you shot of one of your Canons with a hollow bullet which flew over the Towne and made a great humming noise as a warning peece to the</hi> Count of Bucquoy, <hi>who lay on the East side, that you were then ready to fall on, and that he should doe the like, this was your Signall: Now</hi> Generall Vere <hi>knowing well your intent, gaue order to the Gentleman of our Ordnance who had the guard upon</hi> Sandhill, <hi>that hee should keepe a true</hi> taily, <hi>and an account of all the shot you made that day with your 20. peeces of Canon upon the breach and the old Towne which being cast up, there were found to be made that day from morning till night 2200. shot, which was found to be an 110. shotfor every peece, and 11 shot an houre for every peece, which is more then 8. but I verely beleeue your peeces were renforced.</hi> This by the way, and so I returne againe to your owne dialogue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>(Good Sir) I pray you show mee how you would batter the point of a Bulwarke (as the figure 28. following demonstrates,) and giue mee some reasons aswell defensiue as offensiue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I am willing to giue your Lordship content, and say, If I were to batter the point of a <hi>Bulwarke</hi> or a <hi>Bastion,</hi> I would haue the same number of battering Canon, and planted in the same for me and manner as they were for the Curtaine and to shoot sloope and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swise also, and if your approaches were advanced so farre they should be planted upon the very brinke of the moate and upon the <hi>Counterscharfe,</hi> I would plant 4. of them so, that they should dismount the Enemies Canon in their <hi>Casemates,</hi> or any if they had sunk them in their <hi>Falsebray</hi> which should waite vpon that occasion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of your mind and preferre such a battery before all others who are of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they had rather choose a Curtaine then a Bulwarke to be battered.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>You haue heard my reasons for that, and see the figures following traced out to you. But as for your <hi>Bulwark</hi> the <hi>besieged</hi> may cut it off (as you may mark in the figurs of <hi>retrenchments</hi> and <hi>Cuttings off</hi> in the second part of this booke) for indeed it will be a hard matter to force an Enemy out of a Bulwark, who is resolved to loose it by peecemeale and
<pb facs="tcp:42771:27"/>
degrees and there is not so much danger in assaulting of a Curtaine, which being once well battered and beaten down with your Ordnance, you have an easier way and entrance to fall on with your troupes of men, to enter the Towne or Fortresse, but for the defence which is made from your flanking Bulwarks, or your Casemates, you must make batteries upon the brinke of the moate against them, (as is said) to dismount the Enemies peeces, and to flanker with your Ordnance the parapets of the Bulwarkes to beate them about their eares, that the bulwarks may lie the more open to you, and I think this way is the least danger.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                  <p>But the besieged their cuttings off, may they not be made aswell upon a Curtaine as upon a Bulwark?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cap.</speaker>
                  <p>No, for the Rampier being thinner, you have neither so much ground, nor the like accommodation in a Curtain as in a Bulwark, and indeed, a Governour of a town or of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse if he were put to his choise, had rather to be assaulted on a Bulwark (then on a Curtain) by cutting it off into the form of a halfe moone, that he might make a new resistance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with a lesse number of men: Besides, in a Bulwark the besieged have this advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Assailants, which is very dangerous for them, that they may make a mine within the bowels of their Bulwark, when an enemy shall attempt to assault it, and thinking to enter the breach, and take the town, they may be blown up into the aire by a countermine, the like also may happen to the besieged, the Assaillants springing their mine also in a Bulwark, when they think they stand upon their best defence.</p>

                  <p>No, It will not take the like effect as in a Bulwark, for a breach being once made in a Curtaine, for as an enemy may assault it at large, so they may bring a greater number of men to fight to help to defend it, whereas in a bulwark they are pend up and straighted in a narrow place, which may be cut off, and will require a fewer number of men to defend it, whereas those which are to force it, must be constrayned to bring up a great many men to assault, who in an instant may be in danger of blowing up.</p>

                  <p>Your reasons (good Captain) are not to be slighted, but as for me, I hold it safer to batter and assault the breach of a bulwark then of a curtaine. For though the besieged may cut it off, and defend it with a fewer number of men, yet the Assaulters have this advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the besieged defendants, that they have more place and elbow room, and may find a lesse resistance then in a Curtain, seeing that one may make as great a breach in a Bulwarke, as in a Curtain, because your Ordnance may beat it flat and levell with the ground, and choosing rather a Bulwark: I will here with conclude this discourse, and now shew you the figures both of the one and of the other in this plate following.</p>

               <head>HOW A CANONIER OVGHT TO GOVERNE himselfe in makeing of a good shott. CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>AN occasion may happen sometimes, that a peece must be curiously, and iustly Levelled, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, when one is to dismount an enemies peece, which lies in some secret port hole or <hi>Casemate,</hi> which may hinder and annoy the Besiegers of a towne, or Fortresse. It behooves then a good Gunner, to know well the condition and quality of his peece, having had the triall of it many times. For it is impossible, that a canonier can, let him be never so expert, know what his peece will do before he hath practize and experience of it. He must not shoote at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, neither must he in charging of it, ramme and stopp the powder too hard, but that it may take fire in the twinkling of an eye, and that his peece may not recoyle to much, for it is most certaine, the lesse the powder is rammed in, the lesse will be the recoyling of the peece, and the easier is the shott. The like consideration must he also obserue in his bullet, that it be not driven in too hard, but that it lies gently in the mould, and have such vent as is requisite. Finally, hee must lay his peece by the <hi>Quadrant</hi> aboue taught, and Levell as they ordinarily use to do, taking his aime iust in the midst of the frizes, having marked wel with a small file the point or button of the sight, and this may be done very easily, if he hath a care to prevent all the accidents reckoned up in the 9 Chapter especially, those which makes a peece shoot aside, considering that a good shot makes a Canonier to be beloved and respected.</p>
               <p>The fittest peeces for this effect are your ordinary cannons, demy and quarter canon, your culverings, demy and quarter.</p>
               <p>Such a good shot the Generall ought to take notice of, and to recompence such a Canonier liberallie, not onely to encourage him that made it, but also the other canoniers to do the like <hi>Lewes Collade</hi> in his <hi>manuell</hi> practize writeth, that at the Seige of <hi>Sienna</hi> there was a peece plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Lead, or walking place of the great church which overlooked the Besiegers appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and did them much harme, and though many shot were made at it, yet they could not dismount it, till at last there was a Germaine canonier found, which at the very first shot, did not onely dismount it, but also shot the canonier, and some that stood by him, making their Leggs and armes fly vp into the aire. Which the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Martinia,</hi> Generall of that Army seeing, it pleased him so much, that he tooke a chaine of gold from off his neck, and gave it to this Canonier, which had made so brave a shot, which did not onely encourage this canonier, but also stirred up others thereby to gaine the like recompence and reputation, when as occasion might present it selfe.</p>
               <p>The like was done also (though not of that account) at the fiege of <hi>Ostend,</hi> There was a boat, which would come through the chanell into the Towne, and running in, the rudder was shot off by one of our canon bullets, whereat the shippers were much affrighted, and withall let their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker fall, and were glad to save themselves by swimming into the towne, leaving so their boate riding at an Ankor between the dike and the Towne, which <hi>Marques Spinola</hi> perceiving, enquired among his Captaines if there were ever a souldier so venturous as to swim to the boat and cut the cable of it, for which he should not onely be advanced but also he should be liberally rewarded. Vpon this there were many brave souldiers offred to do it: but when it came to the push, and had stript themselues to go into the water, the enemy within powred so volley of shot upon them, that they began to flinch and grow faint-harted, the <hi>Marquis</hi> being loath to venter his men, and to employ so great a courage for so small a matter, called them back againe. But at last there came an excellent canonier considering aswell the service that he might do to his Marie, as the pleasure which the Marquesse might take in it: offred himselfe, and intreated me being then Generall of the Ordnance, that I would be pleased to give him leave, that he might make some shot at it, with promise, that within two or three shot he would shoot the cable asunder, and make the boat come floating to us to the downes side.</p>
               <p>Vpon this I gave him leave, though I feared, both powder, and bullets would be mispent: with the first shot he missed, but with the second he strake the cable in peeces: so that the boat indeed came floating to us. This brave shot pleased the Marquesse exceedingly, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this canonier greatly, gave him a good peece of gold, or two &amp; besides promised to advance him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42771:28"/>
                  <hi>It is true Senior</hi> Diego Vffano, <hi>your translator being then page unto Generall</hi> Francis Vere, <hi>who then commanded within this Towne, was then a spectatour of it, and Sir</hi> Francis Vere <hi>and divers Officers which looked on, commended also your Canonier highly, for making so brave a shot, but I will put you in mind of two or three other, more famous then that. If you remember, there lay a whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of ours upon the West Bulwarke, which carried a bullet of 48. or 49 pound weight, and as it was a brave peece, so had it an excellent Canonier, one</hi> Francis Nelson <hi>an</hi> Englishman, <hi>who served Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>of ever blessed Memory, in the</hi> Brill, <hi>he shooting so sure with it, that he dismounted 2. or 3. of your peeces which were planted vpon your high Catt upon the Downes, for a revenge you did make a battery of 2. or 3. Canon to dismount our peece, and one of your Canoniers made so good a shot, that he shot his bullet just into the very bore or month of our Canon, ours being charged, your bullet and ours striking together in our Canon, from that violent blow flew sparkes which gave fire to some loose cornes of powder which were not well driven home, and so our peece giving fire to it selfe, sent you backe your owne bullet, and ours to accompany it, without breaking or doing any harme to our peece, and this is most true, for there are some Officers yet living that saw it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second was this, you had a halfe Canon that indevoured to dismount one of ours, which also sought to dismount yours, both Canoniers having levelled their peeces as right as possibly they could, and giving fire at an instant together, your bullet and ours meeting one another in the aire, with the violence of that encounter, both bullets breaking, the peeces of them flew up as high into the Aire as</hi> Pauls <hi>steeple, if</hi> Vandermyle <hi>the Controuler of the States Ordnance were alive, he could tell you that this strange shot is true, aswell as I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now you are a discoursing, I will truly relate two or three more unto you which came from your Catt, Some of our Run-awaies could tell and show you almost in what house Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Vere</hi> lay in <hi>Ostend,</hi> and you had a shrewd spight at him, for some dayes you have shot eight or nine Canon shot through the upper part of his lodging, and one night amongst the rest, having bin the round, for he was very vigilant and careful to look to your proceedings, and by all means possible to hinder your approaches, comming home after Sun rising, when he knew there was no danger, he went to take his rest for 3. or 4. houres, and lay downe and slept upon his bed in an upper chamber, awaking he called for a clean shirt, and while his footman was ayring of it before a Charcoale fire in the Chimney, while one that was then his Page was a pulling a silke quilted was-coate over his eares, and calling for the shirt to put it over his head, his footman comming with it, just came a Canon bullet of nine and forty pound weight, through a winescot bedstead just by Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> and his Page, the Lacquey comming with the shirt, shot both his bowels and the shirt to pash, which bloud light and sprang on him and his page: Was not this a narrow escape?</p>
               <p>After this Sir Francis Vere would lye no more in this upper chamber, but removed his owne lodging to another lower Roome, howsoever from your high Catt or Mount you could finde us out againe. For a while after, Sir Francis Vere going every night the Round, and visiting the Guards without the Town, to discover how you did advance your approaches, and to make you buy that ground full dearly, The Sunne being up came home to take his wonted rest, till ten a clock before noone, making our nights the dayes, and part of the day our night, for a resting time The same page after Sir Francis Vere had called for him, came into his chamber, and having a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle firkin standing by the hearth, in taking up a few Charcoale ashes into it, comes an other Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of some 48 pound weight from your Catt, shootes through the utmost part of the chimney, a little above the mantle tree, and the bullet having come through a good part of the forehouse, and being somewhat deaded, fals just by the pages eares, into the very firkin, which the page was a putting the ashes into, brake it, and made a dint upon the hearth, all the ashes flying out, the page giving a leape towards his Masters bed, for we could scarce see one another, because the ashes made such a dust, and presently fell downe above twenty great brick-bats, which the bullet had loosened in the chimney (had he not leapt away) upon his head, this was an other escape, but for a revenge the page got one of Sir <hi>Francis Veres</hi> centinels, that stood in the streete before his dore, to crue up this bullet in a wheel-barrow up to the west bulwarke, to the English Canonier before mentioned, and because you write in your former Dialogue, that one bullet may fitt the Calibre or bore of another peece, this bullet fitted so justly our Canon above mentioned to a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42771:29"/>
a haire, which was sent going to you again, piping hot out of our Canon to your Catt: and he made so good a shot, that I verily beleeve, he sent some of you to Purgatory, for we could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover some Armes and Legges which flew up into the Aire, and so you were paid with your owne coine.</p>
               <p>One or two more, and then I have done, You may remember the seventh of Ianuary, that day which you did batter <hi>Sandhill,</hi> and the skirt of the old Town afore mentioned, for all your often shooting, yet there was one halfe Canon lay upon it, not farre from your breach undismounted. The same page, after he had taken his Levell, gave fire upon two Horses and a Waggon which came riding along the strand from <hi>Albertus Sconce,</hi> towards your <hi>Pile Battery,</hi> it seemes laden with powder or bullets, he made so direct a shot, that he strook his mark, killed one of your hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the Waggon shot a peeces. The page being overjoyed with this shot, he would needes make an other, and whiles he was a levelling his peece at an other marke, one of your Canoniers turnes a peece aside from the Pile Batterie, and shoots just in at the very port-hole of our halfe Canon, and came so right, that it licked off a pound or two of the mettle of the Muzzle upon the upper Frizes of our halfe Canon, some peeces of this mettle killed a Gentleman that stood by as a spectatour, and shot Sir <hi>John Ogles</hi> Cooke into his belly, which was there likewise, but the page which stood behind the brich, a levelling the peece with his thumbe, escaped, and had no harme, but your bullet flying by his eare made such a humming noise in his head, that he thought there had been a swarme of Bees in it. This I have written, not for any Ostentation, but onely to shew you how miraculously (yea even in the greatest dangers) God can preserve his servants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise: Psal. 90. verse 7. <hi>A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, yet it shall not come nigh thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One more, and then I will end my digression: at the last seige of the <hi>Bosch</hi> the yeere we took it in, <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. We having advanced our approaches close under your little <hi>Skonce,</hi> a musketteir of ours, putting the nose of his Musket through the Musket baskets to give fire, one of your Firelocks lying upon the snap for him, gave fire upon him iust at the very same instant, and shot his firelock bullet right into the very mouth or boore of his musket, so that the bullet striking aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst the scrue of his brich, brust open the <hi>touch-hole</hi> of his musket, and a peece of the bullet came out of the said <hi>touch-hole,</hi> while the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> Colonell Generall of the English, and diverse other Officers stood by, and thus you see how wonderfully it pleased God sometimes to preserue his creature.</p>
               <p>Now I come to you againe, where you exhort all <hi>Master-Gunners,</hi> and <hi>Canoniers,</hi> that will studie this Art, that they with great care and diligence practise these rules abouesaid, for the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ayming, and taking their markes right, remembring, that there is more dexterity, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be showne in shooting at a ship, sayling away swiftly before the winde then at a Troupe of Horse, or Men marching softly upon the Land, or to dismount a peece planted upon a Tower or a Bulwarke, where you haue an immoveable marke, especially when as you are to shoot upward.</p>
               <p>This Art must be learned and practised, when you haue not much to doe, that when necessity cals for your employment, you may then not onely be able to doe your Prince and Countrey service against their Enemies, but also gain your selfe fame and reputarion.</p>
               <p>Now hauing treated at large in the former Chapter, how you shall <hi>levell</hi> your peece <hi>point blanck, levell with the mettle</hi> or at a <hi>range;</hi> according to the elavation you giue it, To shut vp all, take this observation along with you, that if the <hi>muzzle</hi> of your peece, or the button of it be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then those of the <hi>brich,</hi> then it will carry ouer, Againe, if you take your aime from the <hi>button</hi> resting onely vpon the thicknesse of the <hi>Mettaline-substance,</hi> your bullet will alwaies fall short. But if your <hi>frizes,</hi> be alike, aswell at the muzzle as at your brich, then you shall be sure to shoot levell with the mettell of your peece, &amp; shall not faile to strike the marke you shoote at if it lies within the termes of the pointes aboue esaid.</p>

                     <speaker>Generall,</speaker>
                     <p>SIR, I would fain know of you, how Ordnance ought to be placed in a Day of Battell, for to gaule the Enemie most?</p>

                     <p>I make no question but your Lordship having had experience in the Wars of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Hungarie,</hi> can tell better then I am able to speak, and if I should use a tedious discourse, it might then seem that the Scholler might presume to teach his Master.</p>

                     <p>Howsoever, in such a case I would willingly take the advice of an old experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souldier, and especially of such a one, who hath served in these parts. As for me, I dare not boast of any great experience, having had enough to do to look unto my owne affaires, neither have I had much leasure to inform my self well about Artillerie. But now seeing I am to receive that charge upon me, I pray you tell me, as a man who hath been beaten thereunto, and hath had long experience in the Warres, how they do use to plant Ordnance in these quarters.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, There hath been but a few battels fought in these parts, and to speak truly I am not able to satisfie you touching this point. Neverthelesse, I will tell you what I have seen in two, wherein I was present. In the one the Ordnance was planted in the head of the Battalions, and in the other between them, two by two, and three by three, upon the flanks and wings of the Muskettiers, and blinded with the wings of the Cavallerie. But as for me, I am of the opinion that it is best to plant some peeces in the front of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which may play upon the Enemies troopes on all sides: seeking out alwaies for this effect, some places of advantage to place them in, that you may not be in danger of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your peeces. And though you cannot get such an advantage, yet your peeces being in the head of your Battell, will be of lesse service, because when you are to come to the Chock and ioyning of Battels, they may in some wise annoy your own men, which I saw in one of these Battels abovesaid.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Therefore I think it were fitter they should be placed upon both the flanks, and in the Reere of the Battaillions, by leaving a free place of Armes, which may give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to our own men.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I can hardly beleeve <hi>(Illustrious Sir)</hi> that that would be so expedient, for an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie perceiving that the Front is left bare without Ordnance, he will take the more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to fall on, and come up to the charge: Therefore, I hold it more fitting, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie may be devided some here some there, both before the Front, and upon the Flanks, placed some fifty or an hundred paces one from another, and then there will be no danger when the Enemie shall come up to Chock, to encounter you, or offend our own men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when they are fastened to them by drawing-Ropes and yron Rings, that upon an instant they may be remooved and turned for the advantage of our own Troops, and give fire as fast as they can charge and discharge among the Enemies Troops, which is a matter of great moment for the obtaining of a Victorie.</p>
                     <p>But it happens very seldome that such convenient places can be found for the planting of Ordnance in a Battell, as were to be wished, for oftentimes one shall be driven of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to make choice of such places as the ground will afford, by reason of woods, hills, marish grounds, and such like disadvantagious places as you may meet withall, and for which one can give no certain rule, but that the Generall by his wisedome and discretion may make choice of the best advantages, which may annoy the Enemy most, and give the least offence to his owne men, either by dazling them by the sun, the raising of Dust, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42771:30"/>
which way the wind drives the smoak, both of Ordnance and small shot, which though little in themselves, yet may prove to his men great impediments and disadvantagious. But leaving these things, we will now return again to our former discourse, because your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is of the opinion that the Ordnance ought rather to be planted upon the wings and flanks of the Battailions then otherwise, which I dare not approve of, in regard that when the Troops are to encounter with the Enemy, and come up to the charge, our own men may be more annoyed by our own Ordnance (which may breed a confusion) then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; when as the wings of our horse which are upon the flanks shall come up to charge the enemie, so that our own peeces might puzzle them greatly, when as they are to play from the flanks, besides the mischief which might happen among our own men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ought to be very carefull and circumspect in planting them, and this is that which out of my own experience I am able to say upon this question. Wherefore I do advise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Captain of the Ordnance, and Master-Gunners, to use some light field peeces, and small Drakes, which upon every occasion may be remooved from one place to another, and couragiously advanced to the places of most advantage, which might offend the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>

                        <hi>Sir,</hi> The reasons you use have given me good satisfaction, but I pray you resolve me of one thing more, that is, how a Generall of the Ordnance ought to carrie himself in the day of Battell.</p>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>In such a time the Generall is to show most his wisedom, discretion and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which chiefly consists herein, that he and his Lieutenant keep their train together in good order, to have a vigilant eye upon all accidents that may fall out, and to make choice of such ground for the planting of his Ordnance as the Generall of the Army and he shall think best, to see that all things be in a readinesse, the Ordnance well placed, and that the master-Gunners, Gentlemen of the Ordnance, and Canoniers do their best ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and acquit themselves like men. It is partly also his charge to see that the whole Army be well provided with Munition, as powder, bullets, and match, because the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition marches under his Train, He is to be near the Generall of the Armie upon all occasions, to receive his directions and commands, and to see them executed speedily, and to know of him after what forr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he will make his Battell, that he may plant his Ordnance accordingly, and so to find out hils and heights, to play over his own men, and offend the Enemie most. And when an Enemy shall present himself, and come up to the charge, to draw and plant his Ordnance as neer their horse as possible may be, to hinder them from breaking in upon the divisions of foot, taking along with him Saylors and Pioniers to help to draw up the Ordnance, and sufficient guards to defend them, and this is that which in so great a businesse is the charge and duty of the Generall of the Ordnance, and which may be required of him.</p>

               <p>MAny a brave occasion in the warres hath bin lost for want of Bridges to passe over a River a Brook, or a Moate, therefore the States for any peece of service, have alwaies diverse bridges in a readinesse, both small and great. The smaller sort for any suddain enterprise, or for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over the moat of a Town, a Hom-work, or a Half moon are 3. as first a Corke bridge now not in use, secondly a Bulrush bridge, the peeces whereof are ten foot long, and six or seven foot broad, that foure men may go over them in Front, described unto you in my second part in the Chapter of Approches, figure 159. whereof many peeces being joyned fast together with ropes and Ankors, will lay a bridge over a moate, a brook, or a ditch for men to passe over, the third sort is a wicker, or a basket bridge, as shall be hereafter described.</p>
               <p>Moreover they have three sorts of other Bridges, namely, a small boat bridge, with beames, plancks, roaps and ankors, which are carried upon long waggons in the Army, whereof you may see one of them in this treatise, chapter the third, figure ten, of these we have commonly twelve, that goes along with our Army upon a long waggon, drawne with 15. couple of horses, and a Thillet horse.</p>
               <p>Besides those above mentioned, there are two great bridges, the one called a punt bridge, which is laid longwaies, end to end over the Rhine, or any other great River, and the other a Maze schip bridge, as you shall see in the figure following.</p>
               <p>Command then being given to the Captain of the Bridges and his men, for the first they lade Ordnance, and all manner of equipage in those great Punts, as beames, plancks, cordage, cables, anckors, windlasses, winches, and all other necessaries, to bring them up to the Rendevous.</p>
               <p>Now when the Captain of the Bridge is to lay a great Punt bridge over the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> or the <hi>Whale,</hi> as at <hi>Nemegen, Schencksconce, Wesell,</hi> or at <hi>Rhenebergh,</hi> taking first the breadth, and distance of the River from the one side to the other, they can easily give a gesse, how many of these punts being 50 foot long, and 10. foot broad, will serve to reach over the River. The first punt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid longwise from the edge of the one side of the River being fastened to two great Stakes (and Anckers) driven into the ground, they then lay at the furthest end of the first punt. and other punt laying Brush at both ends of the punts, which rises and falls, that horse and waggons may passe over them, and alwaies fasten and bind them together with ropes and cables which stayes the punts, by casting out ankors and cables into the streame, to hold them fast together, and thus they do till they have laid over 15. or 16. of these long punts which will reach over from the one to the other side of the river, at the end whereof there are cast up two halfe moones, (if it be not neare a Town, and a Steckado or two Gats made, that none may passe over it without leave, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwaies a guard to defend it and keep it from burning.</p>
               <p>Number 37 is the figure of a peece of a basket Bridge, such a one as was used at our last en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise upon <hi>Hulst,</hi> made of wicket, about the bignesse of ones middle finger, with supporters of wickers within it, as hedges, a foot distant one from another, to strengthen it, and helpe it from bending, when one goes over it, being also matted in the bottom, and covered round about with waxed Canvas, being carried between two men, with two coole staves some 13 foot long, as two men carries a hand barrow, being laid crossewise peece to peece, and fastened together with ropes, and at both ends anckors, the length whereof from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>b</hi> is 6. foot, and the breadth from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>d</hi> two foot and a half, and is a foot in heigth, so that 2 men in front may go over a moat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any surprisall of a Towne.</p>
               <p>Number 38 is a Maze bridge laid crossewaies, such a one as our Army passed over the Maze at the <hi>Grave, Venlo,</hi> and <hi>Mastricht,</hi> having beames some 15 or 16 foot long, and crosse beames over the Maze schips, with plancks from the one side of the river to the other, and is held fast together by cables and anckors, as the figure following of such a bridge doth demonstrate.</p>
               <p>Number 39 is the figure of a Mathematicall Horse watermill, first invented by Vitrivius, and is of singular use for the drayning out of water in Marrish groundes and places, being drawne but with one horse, as the figure demonstrates, and by relieving it with fresh horses and a

Driver may go night and day: the experience whereof we saw at the seige of the Bosch, what abundance of water twenty of them drayned out of the overflowne Meddowes and the River of the <hi>Dummell,</hi> which did helpe and further our Approaches greatly.</p>
               <p>Number 40. is the figure of a <hi>Water Scoupe,</hi> made after this manner following, first you take three long pooles or Sparrs, and at the top bind them together with a match or a Cord, from the top whereof discends an other Cord, which is bound fast to the hast of the Scoupe, as you may see, and the feet of the Sparrs put into the ground Triangular wise, with which you see the figure of a man casting water out of a moate or a ditch. This plate <hi>P</hi> following will shew you the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of all that is said above.</p>

                  <p>NVmber 41. is the figure of a new invented Copper Oven, set upon three Iron chimnies for the baking of bread for an Armie, having at both ends two mouths or doores, which opens and shuts, whereof the length of one of them from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>b</hi> is nine foot long, the breadth from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>d</hi> is three foot, the heigth from <hi>e</hi> to <hi>f</hi> to the top is a foot and a halfe, and the bottome upon which the bread bakes marked <hi>g h</hi> is two foot and a halfe. This Oven (as is said) stands upon three Iron chimnies, noted 1. into which fuel and turf is put to heat this Oven, how many loafes, and pounds of bread it will bake in three houres, the list following will show you.</p>
                  <p>Number 42. is the figure of a Kneading Trough, which from <hi>k</hi> to <hi>i</hi> is seven foot long, and from <hi>m</hi> to <hi>n</hi> is two foot broad, the ledge or cover <hi>o</hi> is three foot high, and the bottome <hi>p</hi> is almost two foot broad, to this kneading trough, you must have water pailes, dow knives, peeles, to draw out the batches of bread, and all other necessaries belonging to a Baker.</p>
                  <p>Number 43. is the figure of a Bread chest very usefull in the warres for the carrying of Bread and Bisket upon a march, whereof the length from <hi>q</hi> to <hi>r</hi> is eight foot long, the bredth from <hi>s</hi> to <hi>t</hi> is foure foot long, the height from <hi>u</hi> to <hi>w</hi> is three foot to the Cover, and the roofe or Cover from <hi>w</hi> to <hi>x</hi> is likewise three foot high. This Bread-chest being set up a waggon, and drawne with three lustie horses, will carry a thousand, yea twelve hundred pounds of bread or bisket, if need require the Figures follow.</p>
