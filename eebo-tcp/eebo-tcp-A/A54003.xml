            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Better</hi>! there is little Fear you will: You may turn <hi>Pelagian</hi> in the Caſe, and exclude all Divine Aſſiſtance; for I hope none are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this Age, as to think that Men of your Stamp need ſpecial Grace to keep you from the Sin of rendering the poor <hi>Quakers Better</hi> then they are: How much <hi>Worſe</hi> will be the Queſtion? I confeſs, you ſay fair; but what if you break your Word with us? Muſt not your Cenſure of us fall upon your own Heads? And will it not be reaſonable for us to interpret your Uſe of ſo true an Expreſſion to be a Trick to decoy People into a Belief, that you had taken right Meaſures of us, whilſt you have really dealt moſt unjuſtly with us.</p>
               <p>Let me a little expoſtulate with you in this Matter. You have either read or not read the Book ye recommend: If you have not read it, certainly you have done very Ill to recommend it, ſince you know not what you recommend; which is not <hi>to Imitate God,</hi> or do the <hi>Quakers</hi> Juſtice: If you have read it, you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96942:4"/>
manifeſtly entitle your ſelves to all the Evils of it. Again, ſince the Strength of the Book depends upon <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> out of our Writings: either you have compared his <hi>Citations</hi> with the Books themſelves, or ye have not; if you have not (and I am apt to think that's your Caſe) you commend him, and condemn us by rote: If you have compared and conſidered them, you muſt needs have offered great Violence to your Underſtandings in giving your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which anon we ſhall ſo undeniably evidence, as it would have been comparatively your Virtue, to have recommended the Book without reading it or examining the Citations.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the moſt of what he chargeth upon us to be our <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> are not ſo laid down by any one of us, nor, ſay we, ſayable by any of us upon our real Principles; but are ſuch <hi>Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> as he through Ignorance or Malice hath indirectly drawn from our Words: For Inſtance, <hi>That there is no other Judgment, Heaven or H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would fain know of you, if you would be ſo treated with the Reſpect to the Articles of your own Creed? Would you eſteem it juſt in me, to give my <hi>Conſequence for your Principle,</hi> ſuppoſing I thought it a true Conſequence, eſpecially if you reject it? For Example; You are moſt, if not all of you, ſtrict <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in the Point of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi>; would you take it for a candid Repreſentation of your Judgment, that I ſhould proclaim it to the World, <hi>T.

The Labours of no <hi>Adverſary</hi> hath had more grateful Acceptance in the Thoughts of your <hi>Reverend Author</hi> J. Faldo, then a noted <hi>Socinian,</hi> of whoſe Attempt he ſpeaks thus, <hi>I reſent it as one of the beſt and moſt ingenuouſly mannaged that ever I read againſt that Sort of People,</hi> meaning the <hi>Quakers</hi>: He alſo, both in his <hi>firſt Book</hi> and in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> as heartily advocates the Cauſe of a <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> againſt me, as if he had been doubly feed to the Work: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, we have been of late both publibkly and vehemently, yet groundleſly, exclaimed upon, <hi>for denying the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and aſſcribing the Chriſtſhip to the Divinity alone</hi>; and you know the <hi>Socinians</hi> own him to be but a <hi>bare Man</hi>; and that ſome of our eminenteſt Adverſaries in that Controverſie were aſſiſted by <hi>Socinians,</hi> I am able to prove: But to what Pitch of Inconſiſtency may not the Pride, Paſſion and Prejudice of Men raiſe them? You think it enough to do our Buſineſs, to pin the <hi>Pope</hi> at our Tail: but you may remember how unjuſt you thought ſuch Suggeſtions from ſome of the former <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Church,</hi> who made the ſame Uſe of your Separation; and as well as you <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> &amp; <hi>Independents</hi> agree againſt us, both of you have mutually <hi>Jeſuited</hi> one another; the Refuge of Malice, when drove to a Pinch.

INDEPENDENCY <hi>is a Schiſm; they draw &amp; ſeduce our Members from our Congregations; a Toleration of it will be follow'd with inevitable Miſchiefs; They erect ſeparate Congregations, under a ſeparate and undiſcover'd Government; The refuſe Communion with our Churches in the Sacraments:</hi> And are ſuch men fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Chriſtian Communion</hi> to others, who themſelves break it, and impeach one another at this bitter rate for doing ſo? But what follows? <hi>The Godly, painful Orthodox Miniſtry will be diſcouraged and deſpiſed; the Life and Power of Godlineſs will be eaten out by frivolous Diſputes and vain Janglings; it is too much to be doubted leſt the Power of the Magiſtrate ſhould not only be weakened, but even utterly overthrown, conſidering the Principles and Practices of</hi> Independents, <hi>together with their Complyance with other Sectaries, ſufficiently known to be Anti-magiſtratical; Hereby we ſhall be involved in the Guilt of other Mens Sins, and thereby be endangered to receive of their Plagues; It ſeems utterly Impoſſible (if ſuch Toleration ſhould be granted) that the</hi> LORD SHOULD BE ONE, AND HIS NAME ONE IN THE THREE KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOMS.</p>
               <p>This ſeriouſly conſider'd, let me ask you, if you did not think theſe <hi>Independents</hi> either ſo <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or ſo <hi>Bad,</hi> as to be unworthy
