            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his duty both to God and man, through his true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the truth, the other seeking what in him lyeth for the advancing of impiety: The good man joyning with his practise, is daily labours for the defence of vertuous and pious designes; thereby seeking with vigilancy to bring the malignant persons to deserved punishments, it being a work, which in conscience is due both to God, his King, and Country.</p>
            <p>First, To God in respect of Religion, and the true and reall Faith, we now professe in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without which we are nothing, being no lesse then meer Atomes to the World, and the just Antipothes to a ground Faith. No faith can stand without that true Foundation of Christ; no grounds of salvation can be had, but by and through those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary merits and sufferings, which we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of in Christ: If so then does our Saviour daily suffer in the instigations, and quotidiall provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against him; all which are violated by those (who are many) malignants to the truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the King, what greater abuse can there be to His Sacred Majesty then by the continuall sufferance, the Subject endures through the ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell administred to our Soveraign, being done under the colour of Loyalty; yet in proving in matter no better then flat abuses to this whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If that God and the King, so much suffer

               <p>It is palpable enough that the wicked man, cares not though he dishonours God in the highest degree may he but defend himselfe and vices, thougth to the utter abolishing of Religion, King, and Countrey, (as aforesaid) if opposite to his designes.</p>
               <p>Wee have had the experience of the evils and great troubles that have beene raised, this State by ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments men of power and authority in the same, and not onely of publique misedoers and open enemies, but also of many private disaffected Spirits, whose outward carriage hath procured to themselves great esteem and respect in their County. Nay so well have they been approved on, that their Countrey hath not misled them, with both their estates and priviledges, as electing them Members of this high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; wherein also for a long time, they have discharged their duties to their King and Countrey;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96602:4"/>
nay and attained the generall estimation, and respect of all men, as worthy Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but their hearts disagreeing with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualities, being not upright and perfect, have at least shewed themselves in their perfect colours, and brought themselves to shame and dishonour.</p>

               <p>By this he hath made himself guilty of those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, that other Delinquents have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, and accused for, and nothing inferiour to them in their crime. This designe was a great offence (if by him advised) against His sacred Majesty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in seeking to work an evill opinion in him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning His Parliament, and their Proceedings in the great Affairs, of both Church and State. This is the matter that discourages this Honourable Assembly in proceeding in such businesses as may be for the honour of their King and Country; when they peceive that all their endeavours, and dutifull actions, are not well accepted by His Majesty, This and such like ill Councells hath caused all this distraction in the State.</p>
