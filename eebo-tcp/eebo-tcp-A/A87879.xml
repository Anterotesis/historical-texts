         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your commands. To thoſe commands next
God, I totally reſign the glory may reſult from
the little I have done well, the many Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
I ſhall file upon mine own account;
And as I have ever found in myſelf a Diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="tcp:115092:3"/>
to reſiſt your commands, ſo your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
never found my will in readier mode

for had not they preſt me into this ſervice of
Truth, and this Church, my peculiar inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had liſted me a Voluntier. For no little
impatience hath poſſeſt me, to hear Error ſo long
and ſo uncontroul'd, crow and triumph over
Truth in that his Lordſhips Paper, the great
pretenders to the Proteſtant belief (to their
ſhame be it ſpoken) or not willing, or not able,
or not daring to oppoſe her. Thoſe whom it
more concern'd making thus default of their
devoir, reſolved I was (though the weakest of
many hundreds) of this Churches Votary, to
become her Champion, and put my ſelf into
the Forlorn; being most aſſured I ſhould
thereby not onely in ſome meaſure, pay a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
Vote to the Cauſe of God, but alſo in part
vindicate the Reputation of that ſide to which
I ſo constantly adhered, and to demonstrate
to the face of calumny, that amongſt thoſe ſo
decry'd and reproached as popiſhly affected,
ſome there are of that animoſity and courage,
who dare tell <hi>Rome</hi> to her teeth, that that
thing which ſhe calls her Religion is but meer
Policy, not founded upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

years. How my atchivement and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb facs="tcp:115092:3"/>
hath anſwered my daring, it becomes
not me to judge. Suppoſe the worſt, and that I
have made too publique my many failings, yet
have I not failed to publiſh a zeal firm and
cordial to the Proteſtant Profeſſion. And that
zeal will, I truſt, bid theſe unworthy Labours,
in ſome degree, welcome to God and his Church.
It is one and the ſame ſpirit, to defend the

between the Papists and the Protestants are acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately

are Differences, and in the main too,
yet not ſo much as ſaluted in paſſage, nor any
the leaſt notice taken of them; and Adoration
of Images, no petty Difference, hath but a very
perfunctory, a ſlight glance, and is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcuſt. And for thoſe Differences treated
of, few will, I think, of the Proteſtant perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſay with the Doctor, they are acurately
diſcuſt; for wherein doth that acurateneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt?
View the order and array of the Points,
<pb facs="tcp:115092:4"/>
and Tenets there ſet down, never was there
ſuch a confuſed Rhapſody, ſuch an independent
medly ſhuffled peſle-meſle together, without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,
without care. In the Scheme and frame
of his Poſitions, there is I grant a great, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
care; but not a commendable, not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
care, not a care to ſtate the Queſtions
ingenuouſly right, but rather to render them
more dubious and dark, but a care to diſſemble
the Errors of his own Church, the Truths of
ours; a care to diſ-guiſe the Proteſtant Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
under his own imaginary Fictions, and to
repreſent <hi>Romes</hi> putrid and ulcerous Body with
a ſpecious and glorious out-ſide; in ſhort, a
care to contrive that Paper with ſuch artifice as
might render it unanſwerable. And therefore I
have qualified my Anſwer with theſe additional
words, <hi>Such as it is,</hi> implying ſuch an Anſwer as
that Paper will admit of, a full and compleat
one being not onely difficult, but almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:
for it being farced and ſtuffed thick
with Quotations, the words of the Authors are
rarely recited, very often the Chapters and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
omitted, and ſometimes the whole
Books; ſo that beſides an infinite waſte of Time,
it requires a kinde of Divination to decypher
and ſet forth what the Marques his minde was
fixt upon. This notwithſtanding, I have with
moſt diligent impartiality collected what
might in any degree favour his Lordſhips opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or abet his Cauſe, and to every Proof fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a ſuitable Anſwer, where Conjecture could
not attain, I there freely acknowledge it, being
ſecure under the candor of thy Charity, which

            <p>
               <hi>MY Lord, I have peruſed your Paper; whereby I
finde, that it is no ſtrange thing to ſee Error,
triumph in Antiquity, and flouriſh all thoſe
Enſignes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, Succeſſion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

was ſo familiar, either with the</hi> Jews <hi>or Gentiles, as to
beſmear the face of Truth with ſpots of Novelty; for
this was</hi> Jeremiahs <hi>caſe,</hi> Jer. 44. 16. <hi>viz.</hi> As for
the word which thou haſt ſpoken unto us in

            <p>
               <hi>Radbodus,</hi> King of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> (being about to be
baptized) asked the Biſhop, what was become of all his
Ancestors, who were dead without being baptized?
The Biſhop anſwered; that they were all in Hell;
whereupon the King ſuddenly withdrew himſelf from
the Font, (ſaying) <hi>Ibi profecto me illis Comitem
adjungam: Thither will I go unto them:</hi> no leſs
<pb facs="tcp:115092:6"/>
wiſe are they, who had rather err with Fathers and
Councels, than rectifie their understanding by the Word
of God, and ſquare their Faith according to its Rules.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, we must not ſo much
<hi>hearken to what hath been ſaid by them of old
time,</hi> Matth. 21. 12. as to that which <hi>he</hi> ſhall <hi>tell
you,</hi> where <hi>Auditis dictum eſſe antiquitis</hi> is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
and <hi>Ego dico vobis</hi> is come in its place; which
of them all can attribute that credit to be given unto
him, as is to be given to Saint <hi>Paul?</hi> Yet he would not
have us to be followers of him more, than he is a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of <hi>Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 1. Wherefore if you cry
never ſo loud, <hi>Sancta mater Eccleſia, ſancta mater
Eccleſia,</hi> the holy mother Church, holy mother Church,
as of old, they had nothing to ſay for themſelves, but
<hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini,</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, we will cry as
loud again with the Prophet; <hi>quomodo facta eſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrix
Urbs fidelis?</hi> How is the faithfull City become
an Harlot? If you vaunt never ſo much of your <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Church, we can tell you out of Saint <hi>John,</hi>
that ſhe is become the Synagogue of Sathan: neither is
it impoſſible, but that the houſe of prayers may be made
a Den of Thieves: you call us Hereticks; we anſwer
you with Saint <hi>Paul, Acts 24. 14. After the way
which you call Hereſie, ſo worſhip we the God
of our fathers, believing all things which were
written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will grant you that all thoſe marks which you have
ſet down, are marks of the true Church; and I will
<pb facs="tcp:115092:7"/>
grant you more, that they were belonging to the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> but then, you must grant me thus much,
that they are as well belonging to any other Church, who
hold and maintain that Doctrine which the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> then maintained, when ſhe wrought thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions;
and not at all to her, if ſhe have changed her
first Love, and fallen from her old Principles; for it
will do her no good to keep poſſeſſion of the Keys, when
the Lock is changed: now to try whether ſhe hath done
ſo or no, there can be no better way, than by ſearching
the Scriptures; for though I grant you that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is the white in that Butt of Earth at which
we all must aim; yet the Scripture is the heart centre,
or peg in the midst of that white that holds it up, from
whence we must meaſure, eſpecially when we are all in
the white. We are all of us in <hi>gremio Eccleſiae;</hi> ſo
that Controverſies cannot be decided by the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> but by the Scriptures, which is the thing by
which the nearneſs nnto Truth must be decided; for
that which must determine Truth must not be fallible:
but whether you mean the conſent of Fathers, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of General Councels, they both have erred; I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
no Fathers nakedneſs, but deplore their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that we ſhould not trust in arms of fleſh: <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
was a Montanist; <hi>Cyprian</hi> a Rebaptist; <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
an Anthropomorphiſt; <hi>Hierom</hi> a Monoganiſt;
<hi>Nazianzen</hi> an Angeliſt; <hi>Euſebius</hi> an Arrian; Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> had written ſo many Errors, as occaſioned
the writing of a whole Book of Retractions: they have
oftentimes contradicted one another, and ſome times
themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115092:7"/>
Now, for General Councels; Did not that <hi>Concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Ariminenſe,</hi> conclude for the Arrian Hereſie?
Did not that <hi>Concilium Ephiſinum,</hi> conclude for the
Eutichian Hereſie? Did not that <hi>Concilium Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſe,</hi>
conclude it not lawfull for Prieſts to marry?
Was not <hi>Athanaſius</hi> condemned, <hi>In Concilio Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio?</hi>
Was not <hi>Eiconolatria</hi> eſtabliſhed, <hi>In Concilio
Nicaeno ſecundo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay more? when the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
leſs obnoxious to Error, either in Life or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
more to be preferred than any, or all the world
beſides; one of them betrays his Saviour, another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
him; all forſake him. They thought <hi>Chriſt's
Kingdom to be of this world;</hi> and a promiſe onely
unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not unto the Gentiles; and this
after the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They wondred that</hi> the holy Ghoſt ſhould fall
upon the Gentiles. <hi>Saint</hi> John <hi>twice</hi> worſhipped
the Angel, <hi>and was rebuked for it;</hi> Apoc. 22. 8.
<hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaw how</hi> Peter walked not uprightly,
according to the truth of the Goſpel, Gal. 2. 14.
<hi>Not onely</hi> Peter, <hi>but other of the Apostles, were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how the Word of God was to be preached unto the
Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who then ſhall rowl away the ſtone from the
mouth of the Monument? Who ſhall expound the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to us? One puls one way, and another another:
by whom ſhall we be directed?</p>
            <p>Scinditur incertum ſtudia in contraria vulgus.</p>

ſaith;</hi> Rom. 9. 17. The Scripture hath concluded
all under ſin, Gal. 3. 22. For that which Rom. 11. 32
<hi>he ſaith,</hi> God hath concluded all, &amp;c. <hi>How ſhall we
otherwiſe conclude than but with the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor.
2. 12. We have received not the ſpirit of the
world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we
might know the things that are freely given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us of God.</p>
            <p>They who know not this ſpirit, do deride it: but
this ſpirit is <hi>the hidden Manna, Apoc.</hi> 2. 17. which
God giveth them to eat who ſhall overcome; it is the
<pb facs="tcp:115092:9"/>
white ſtone wherein the white name is written, which
no man knoweth but he that received it. Wherefore we
ſee the Scripture is the Rule by which all difference may
be compoſed; it is the Light wherein we muſt walk;
the Food of our Souls; an Antidote that expels any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
the onely Sword that kils the Enemy; the onely

gave much offence to many, becauſe it was not to be

in it ſelf; that therefore it ſhould thence forward be
forborn, and inſtead thereof ſhould be inſerted, that the

and that in effect there was as much implied in

finding that the Emperour would tire them
out, if they did not yield at length, conſented
to have that word omitted. Thus this Councel
erred by Circumvention, and that it erred is
enough for us, and againſt the Marques; for if
one erreth, another may, yea all may; and that
others have done ſo too, his Majeſty hath inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,

<hi>So that by his Lordſhips Rule, had not
the Councel of</hi> Calcedon, <hi>nor any other ſince,
condemned</hi> Eutyches <hi>for an Heretick, we muſt all
have held to this day but one Nature in</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>[Wherefore if it ſhould be granted that the
Church at any time had determined amiſs, yet
the Church cannot be ſaid to have erred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you muſt not take the particular time for

to change their Decrees and Canons, as
well as Parlaments their former Statutes; and I
yield that Power reſident in them in matters of
outward Polity, and Government in the
Church; but that they have a power to decree
matters of Faith, which ſhall binde the Church,
needs no other Confutation, than the allowing
them a power to change their Decrees. <hi>For the

            <p>The recalling mine own words may be an
Error, as well as the avoidance of one; for a

               </gap> and being ſo, it
is in my opinion a great blemiſh to his Honours
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115092:13"/>
Cauſe, to charge and accriminate a Church
with no leſs than Hereſie, and not with one
onely, but many, very many, and not produce
any one Book, or one Article, where thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
are to be found; but to accuſe a Church of
Hereſies which are no where to be found, (and
this he hath done very often) is a blemiſh to his
Honour, as well as to his Cauſe. What the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques

of our Church, ſhall be by me ſupplied, and I
will do it with that ingenuous integrity,<note place="margin">Art. 28.</note> that I
will not ſuppreſs any one ſyllable, which may
advantage her Adverſaries in the leaſt. And firſt,
to the point of <hi>Christ's</hi> preſence. Thus <hi>[The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <note place="margin">Art. 94.</note>

<hi>indeed</hi> (as the Catechiſme hath it, and the Church
of <hi>Ireland) ſubstantially,</hi> wee'll grant that too; ſo
that it had been much more for his Lordſhips
credit,<note place="margin">Ser. 13.</note> to have forborn the urging of this Real
Preſence againſt us.<note place="margin">Cant 2.</note> 
               <hi>Non opus erat ut ea contra nos
diceret, quae dicimus ſecum;</hi> why ſhould he urge
that againſt us, which we aſſert with him?
Well, but is there no difference between us?
Yes, a very great one <hi>Rome</hi> holds, <hi>a Tranſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
a Converſion of the whole ſubstance of the
Elements in the Sacrament into the very body and
bloud of</hi> Chriſt, as the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath it;
why did the Marques ſuppreſs this Tenet? Durſt
he not own it? He is then no Papiſt, for what
that Councel hath determined, the Papiſts do,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115092:13"/>
and muſt hold. On the other ſide, our Church
ſaith, <hi>Christs body is there given, taken and eaten,
onely after an heavenly and ſpiritual manner.</hi> Now
you have heard what both ſides hold, wee'll
give the Marques his Scriptures leave to ſpeak
next. <hi>[Matth. 20. 26. Take, eat, this is my body.
Luke 22. 19. This is my body which is given for you.]</hi>
I can ſee <hi>Christ's</hi> body here indeed, but where's
the Converſion, the Tranſubſtantiation the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
hold? I cannot ſee that: and though I can
ſee <hi>Christ's</hi> body there, yet there is ſomething
elſe which ſhould be there, I cannot ſee; and
that is, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> which we
conceive is an evident Explanation of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
this his Lordſhip thought too hot for
him, ſo that if we ſtand to his carving, we ſhall
be ſure to have that we have leaſt minde to.
Now let his Fathers be produced; <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith,
<hi>The Eucharist is the fleſh of</hi> Chriſt;<note place="margin">2 Ep. ad Smyrn.</note> ſo ſay we too,
and <hi>Ignatius</hi> tells you for all that,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Philad.</note> it is Bread
ſtill, and after Conſecration too, both are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
moſt ſure, as Saint <hi>Hillary</hi> ſaith exceeding
well, <hi>Figura est dum Panis &amp; Vinum extra videtur,
veritas autem dum corpus &amp; ſanguis Christi in verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
interius creditur; It is the figure, whilest the
Bread and Wine are beheld outwardly; but the truth
it ſelf, when the Body and Bloud are inwardly in
truth beleeved. Justin Martyr</hi> ſaith, <hi>That after
Conſecration, the Elements become the body and bloud
of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>who doubts of it?</hi> but ſpeaks not of
any Converſion of the ſubſtance, nay, ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
in the ſame place, that <hi>the Deacons distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
after conſecration the bread and wine,</hi> clearly
implying, he thought not of any Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115092:14"/>
but that the Elements kept their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſtill. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> I confeſs ſpake
the firſt of a Change, the other of a Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Elements; but 'tis not of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
neither, but onely of their uſe, <hi>Sunt quae
erant &amp; in aliud commutantur; They are ſtill what they
were before, but are changed in quality.</hi> Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
we grant too; we hold the Elements af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Conſecration differ in uſe and virtue from
common Bread and Wine. <hi>Rhemigius</hi> ſpeaks not
of Converſion, if <hi>Christ's</hi> body be there, ſure his
fleſh is, and I never read of any other fleſh he
had, than what he took in the Virgins womb.
The difference is not whether <hi>Christ's</hi> body be
here, but how? And if I did not think it time
miſ-ſpent, I could deſtroy this carnal Doctrine
by the teſtimony of twenty ſeveral Fathers,
who all underſtand the Preſence to be no other,
than as a Symbole, Type, figure, repreſentation,
ſigne, image, likeneſs, and memory of <hi>Christ's</hi>
body crucified upon the Croſs; and as for
Tranſubſtantiation, they never dreamt of ſuch
a word, nor thought of ſuch a thing. I will
onely inſtance in one, and I hope his word may
be taken,<note place="margin">Gelaſius cont. Eutic. de duabus natur. Chr.</note> becauſe a Pope: <hi>Non deſinit ſubstantia vel

            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We hold that there is in the Church an

            <p>Our Church hath no where delivered her ſelf
expreſly in this point, yet I take it to be the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Doctrine of Proteſtants, that there is no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115092:14"/>
other Rule beſides Scripture, to underſtand
Scripture, that is infallible. For if Scripture be
an infallible Rule, why ſhould we cumber our
ſelves with more than one, unleſs this one were
hard to come by, or eaſie to be loſt. And it
ſeems his Lordſhip thought Scripture was <hi>one</hi>
infallible Rule, when he ſaid, there is <hi>another</hi>
beſides it: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> comes in with his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit

               <note place="margin">Bellarm. l. 1. in praeſ.</note> 
               <hi>In this

that the Word of God is the Rule of Faith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">l. 1. c. 2. ſect. 5.</note> and after
he tells you, why it muſt be ſo, becauſe <hi>a Rule
must be certain and known; for if it be not certain, it
is no Rule; and if not known, it is no Rule to us:
now there is nothing more certain or more known than
the Scriptures.</hi> Compare the Marques his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule of Traditions, with this ſaying of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
and it will appear they have little of a
Rule in them. For certainly, what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain?
When the Primitive Church it ſelf,
within a hundred years after the Apoſtolical
Times, was ſplit into that great Schiſm about
the Celebration of <hi>Easter,</hi> which was but a
meer Tradition, and was not reconciled till the
Councel of <hi>Nice.</hi> And for being known, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is leſs, ſeeing in the very Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
they are not yet agreed which are Apoſtolical
Traditions.<note place="margin">Vide Suar. in part.</note> The Scriptures he urgeth, are <hi>Rom.</hi>
12. 6. And there is a Rule of Faith I grant, and
an infallible one too,<note place="margin">Thom.</note> but it is not <hi>praeter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;</hi>
nor <hi>extra, without</hi> the Scripture, but that
mentioned in the Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. there is a
Rule, but a Rule of Doctrine concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Liberty in the point of Circumciſion, no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115092:15"/>
Rule of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. there is neither Rule,
nor Faith, but a form of Doctrine delivered to
them by the preaching of the Goſpel: what he
urged out of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12, 16. is ſo extremely
and groſly impertinent, as ſure when he caſt his
eye upon that place, his Lordſhip was either
entring into, or newly raiſed from ſuch a nap
wherein the Doctor found him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> But leſt we ſhould miſ-underſtand what
this Rule of Faith is, the Marques tells us, [By
it, is not meant the holy Scriptures, for that
cannot do it, and he gives the Reaſon, whileſt
there are unſtable men who wreſt this way, and
that way to their own deſtruction.] So that
Scripture is now with the Marques no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule at all, Traditions have outed her
clear; and the Reaſon inferreth plainly, that
we muſt not walk abroad at high noon-day
without a Torch, becauſe ſome men notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

               <hi>No man can fulfill the Law, and perform all

               <hi>M.</hi> We ſay, Faith cannot juſtifie without
Works; you ſay, good Works are not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Here the Marques ſlides from the point, and
wilfully leaves his old wont of challenging our
oppoſition; for whereas he ſhould have ſaid,
<hi>You ſay, Faith alone can justifie;</hi> he tells us here,
we ſay, good Works are not abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to ſalvation. Neceſſary to ſalvation is one
thing, neceſſary to juſtification another: ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and juſtification are different things, one
is the cauſe, the other the effect. We hold good
Works are neceſſary to ſalvation, but not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.
The Thief upon the Croſs was ſaved
without them; thouſands who believe and are
prevented by Death before their Faith can ſhew
it ſelf in Works, are ſaved without them; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
dying are ſaved without them; ſo they are
not abſolutely neceſſary, no not to ſalvation;
but to juſtification they are not ſo much as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:
for as our Church ſaith, <hi>We are justified
by faith onely;</hi> this will appear, firſt by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what things are required to juſtification,
and thoſe are three;<note place="margin">Art. 11.</note> 
               <hi>firſt, God's great mercy and
grace;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. of Juſtif. 1.</note>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115092:22"/>
lastly, by a true and lively faith in Gods free grace, and</hi>
Chriſt's <hi>merits.</hi> So that good works are clearly
outed. Secondly, faith alone juſtifieth without
works, becauſe we are juſtified by faith before
we can do good works,<note place="margin">Sequuntur iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non precedunt iuſtifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. Aug. de fid. &amp; op. c. 14.</note> and works are not good
till juſtifying faith makes them ſo. But though
faith alone juſtifieth without works, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be alone and without them, for impoſſible
it is for any man to believe God will be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him, and that <hi>Christ's</hi> righteouſneſs and
merits ſhall be ever imputed to him, who at
that inſtant of believing, doth not ſeriouſly
and unfainedly reſolve to obey, and obſerve to
his uttermoſt all God's Commandments. The
places of Scripture alleadged by the Marques
againſt our <hi>Faith alone without Works,</hi> are; firſt,
1 <hi>Cor. 13. 2. Though I have all Faith, and have no
Charity, I am nothing.</hi> There is faith indeed, but
no juſtifying faith, <hi>'tis the faith of miracles,</hi> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> tells us ſo, <hi>chap. 12. v.</hi> 9. The faith mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Luke 17. 8. of removing mountains,</hi> and ſo the
Apoſtle would have told us in this very Text,
had not his Lordſhip, by what faith I know
not, removed thoſe mountains, thoſe words
out of his way. Secondly, <hi>James 2. v. 24. By works
a man is justified, and not by faith onely.</hi> This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
is an eminent place, and hath exerciſed the
wits of all Expoſitors how to reconcile it to
that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom. 3. 28. A man is justified
by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Many have
gone ſeveral ways, and ſome not the right. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
having beaten his brains about it a good
while, at laſt threw the whole Epiſtle of Saint
<hi>James</hi> out of the Volume of Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115092:22"/>
               <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> that great Scholar of the
latter Age, hath taken it to task by it ſelf, and
hath indeed ſhewn great Reading, but I confeſſe
as to the elucidation and clearing of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
he makes me no wiſer than I was before:
and indeed, after all hath been ſaid <hi>Aquinas</hi> his

works juſtifie, <hi>declarative, by declaring our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men,</hi> not, <hi>offective,</hi> by <hi>making us just before God.</hi>

               <hi>M.</hi> This opinion of yours Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi> mentions it not as an Hereſie, but
onely ſaith, that in the Apoſtles time ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
that place of <hi>Paul, Rom. 5. Where
ſin abounded, there grace ſuperaboundeth,</hi> thought
faith onely neceſſary to ſalvation, and therefore
neglected moral duties, and ſanctity of life;
and this we call the high way to Hell, as well as
<hi>Augustine, Hillary</hi> in his 7. chapter or canon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Matth.</hi> hath nothing tending to juſtification,
either ſolitary without, or aſſociated with
works, but <hi>can.</hi> 8. he is expreſly at, <hi>Fides ſola justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat,

            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We hold good works to be meritorious,

               <hi>All the good works that we

our justification.</hi> His Lordſhip produceth out of
Scripture, <hi>Matth. 16. 27. He ſhall reward every man
according to his works.</hi> Anſwer, I confeſſe our
Tranſlation gives it ſo, but the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal

is not He will reward, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>He

<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. 'tis ſaid, <hi>Great is your reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and there is <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>great reward</hi> too;
and the Marques inferreth that Reward in the
end, preſuppoſeth merit in the work: but ſure
it is no general Rule; for when the Laborers
were called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 8. to receive their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

and here) The Steward gave to him that
wrought but one hour a penny, which was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the wages for the whole day, was this
work of an hour adequate to, or did it earn that
wages?<note place="margin">Deut coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat dona ſua non opera no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra.</note> Again, this Reward is not ſuch to
which the Lord is tyed by any precontract, but
it proceedeth from his meer grace. Laſtly, could
the Work merit the Reward? it is but ſtill <hi>God
crowns his own gifts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">T. 3. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. Bapt. l. 1. c. 6.</note> 
               <hi>not our works,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi>
ſaith. But if it be true what the Apoſtle ſaith,
That <hi>the ſufferings of this life</hi> (even Martyrdom it
ſelf) <hi>which remitteth all ſins both original and actual,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sic opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem in Sanctis ſuis in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus vitae tentatione laboranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ut ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſit quod peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giter adji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat &amp; confitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter ignoſcat.</note>
               <hi>and which justifieth</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>by the very
act of ſuffering</hi> (if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may be believed) are
not worthy of the joys which ſhall be revealed
hereafter, what will become of his Lordſhips
merits? He ſaith, The Fathers were of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But the firſt <hi>Tract. de Apolog. David.</hi> wants
a Father, it being clearly ſpurious, <hi>Hierome</hi> hath
nothing to the purpoſe, and <hi>Augustine</hi> is ſo clear
of another minde, that the whole chapter is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
elſe but a confutation of the Doctrine of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<hi>God</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſo worketh justification in his
Saints, whilest they are cumbered with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this life, as he hath ſtill ſomewhat to add to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115092:23"/>
them who ask, and ſomewhat to remit to thoſe who are
penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hold that faith once had may be loſt, if
we have not a care to preſerve it, you ſay it can,
it cannot.</p>
            <p>Our Church hath determined nothing in this
point,<note place="margin">Art. 34.</note> yet becauſe their ſiſter of <hi>Ireland</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>That a true lively juſtifying faith is not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
nor vaniſheth away in the regenerate, either
finally, or totally.</hi> I ſhall for this time own her
Tenet, and conſider the validity of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Texts: and firſt for <hi>Luke 8. 13. They on the
Rock, are they which when they hear receive the
Word with joy, which for a while believe, and in time
of temptation fall away.</hi> Anſwer, the faith menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
there was but a falſe conception, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
no juſtifying faith. But I ſee the Marques
hath left part of the Text behinde him, and
left that be loſt, as well as faith, I will for this
time bring it after him; the words are, <hi>And
theſe have no root,</hi> evidently implying, the reaſon
why that ſeed took no better, but was ſcorched
with the heat of perſecution, was that it took
no root. Now for 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 18, 19. Which ſome
having put away, have made ſhipwrack of their faith.]</hi>
Anſwer, the faith there ſpoken of is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith, nay, ſo far from it, as it is not ſo
much as the faith of aſſent, to the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God revealed in his Word; but it is
the faith which denoteth the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
in which ſenſe it is frequently uſed in
Scripture, <hi>Acts 6. v. 7. Gal. 1. 23. 1 Tim. 3. 8. &amp;
4. v. 1. Jude</hi> 3. Such a faith we grant may be loſt.
The authority his Lordſhip alleadgeth is <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>

come clearly off with him: it is not enough to
ſay as they do, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh not of
ſolid and perfect Faith and Love, but of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
this is no Anſwer but a meer ſhift; for
Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that ſome ſons of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>begin to live, yea, and a while do</hi> live, <hi>and that
faithfully, and juſtly in faith which worketh by love,

My anſwer ſhall be, what he once ſaid of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
I am not bound to his authority,<note place="margin">Nobis qui vere Chr. inſiti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, talis data eſt gratia, non ſolum ut poſſimus ſi velimus, ſed ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus in Chr. perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verare. de Corrept. &amp; grat. c. 11.</note> &amp; I am the

with himſelf, for he elſewhere ſaith, They who
are once ingrafted in <hi>Christ,</hi> are indued with
grace, not onely to perſevere, if they will, but
alſo to will perſeverance.</p>
            <p>We hold, that God did never inevitably damn
any man from all eternity, you ſay he did.</p>
            <p>Was our Church ſo weak? Is it poſſible a
Church (conſiſting of as many gallant and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Divines, as ever any Age afforded) ſhould
fall ſo foully, to aſſert what never yet to my
reading dropt from any private pen? To ſave
and damn are proper to God, as he is ſupreme
Judge of all the World, who is ſo far from
damning any man, from all Eternity, or before
he is born, as he actually doth it not when born,
till he is dead. Decree, I grant, he did from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
to leave a certain number of the comon
maſſe of all mankinde in the ſtate of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115092:24"/>
being plunged therein by the default of
their own free will, and as ſole Lord and Maſter
of his own, not to beſtow upon them ſuch
grace as would infallibly raiſe them out, and
without which they would, in time, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
incur, by their own corrupt, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
will, eternal Damnation. The Texts cited
are and muſt be underſtood of God's revealed,
not of his ſecret will, and without allowing
that diſtinction he muſt be accounted as weak as
we (according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> cenſure of us) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
him cruel.</p>
            <p>We hold that no man ought infallibly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
himſelf of his ſalvation, you ſay he ought.</p>
            <p>Our Church is ſilent in this point too.<note place="margin">Zanch.</note> Some,
I confeſſe,<note place="margin">Tom. 7. de certa ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Eccleſ. Perk. de praedeſt. &amp; Gr.</note> there are of prime note amongſt the
Proteſtants, hold, that every man is bound to
believe himſelf predeſtinated; and their main
Reaſon is, becauſe every man in the Church is
bound to believe the Goſpel; which I take to
be very ſtrong againſt their own opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the Goſpel did tell every man that he is of
the number of the predeſtinated. But it will be
ſaid, though this Propoſition, <hi>Such and ſuch a
man is predeſtinated,</hi> is not expreſly found in
Scripture, yet it may be inferred from thence by
unavoidable conſequence; as, ſuch, and ſuch a
man hath Faith, and Charity, and therefore he
aſſuredly belongeth to God. Moſt true, but
then he cannot be aſſured that he is predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
till he hath Faith, and that the true juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith too; for he may believe there is a God,
he may believe the Scriptures to be the Word of
God, he may believe all things conteined in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115092:25"/>
them to be true, and yet come ſhort of a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith ſtill: nor muſt he onely have faith, but
he muſt alſo know that he hath it, or elſe he
muſt not aſſure himſelf of ſalvation; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, Faith he may have and not know it,
yea, and a living juſtifying faith too; it may be
ſo weak he cannot feel the Pulſe, them motion,
the operation of it, and yet the faith may be
alive for all that; and though we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>to examine our ſelves whether we be in the faith
or not,</hi> yet aſſuredly many a dear childe of God,
notwithſtanding all poſſible ſearch, ſobs, and
ſighs, and howls, and laments, becauſe he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not that faith in himſelf, which yet in the
effects and fruits there, as ſelf-denial, unfained
contrition, an hungring and thirſting after the
righteouſneſs of his bleſſed Redeemer, is moſt
evidently viſible to all beholders. In this very
ſad agony, and bleeding diſtreſs, Satan is ready
enough to ſuggeſt to him, that faith he cannot
have, but he muſt be ſenſible of it, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God are always aſſured of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that the faith which juſtifieth, is and muſt
be without the leaſt doubting. This is the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
conſequence of being taught, that all the
ſons of God ought to be and are aſſured of their
ſalvation. A far wiſer and warier courſe take
they, who with the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hold one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus,<note place="margin">Art. 38.</note> that a true believer may be certain by
the aſſurance of faith of his everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Here we are taught to diſtruſt our own
worthineſſe, and to ſtand in aw of offending
God: nor are we the leſſe aſſured of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through this diffidence of our ſelves, but
rather much more. As to the Fathers cited, I
cannot diſcover any thing in them following
ſute with this Tenet, onely <hi>Bernard</hi> (who comes
very tardy a thouſand years after <hi>Christ;</hi>) and he
only upon <hi>Septuageſima</hi> (for in that upon the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi>
there's not a ſyllable pertinent to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion)
hath indeed theſe words; <hi>Who can ſay, I
am elected? I am predestinated? I am the childe of
God?</hi> But <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch a certitude
and aſſurance as Reaſon ſhould demonſtrate,
and deriveth his inference, from <hi>Eccleſiast.</hi>
9. 1. <hi>Who can know whether he be worthy of
love or hate?</hi> True it is, know it we cannot,
but though we cannot know it, yet we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, and undoubtedly believe it too, and ſo

For this very cauſe God exhibiteth manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of our ſalvation, that he who hath theſe ſignes in
him ſhould not doubt of his Election.</hi> And again,
<hi>Quibus certitudinem negat cauſa ſolicitudinis, fiduciam

            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We ſay that every man hath an Angel
Guardian, you ſay he hath not.</p>
            <p>This is a matter ſo indifferent, as we leave
every man to think what he pleaſe; the Fathers,
<hi>Origen</hi> eſpecially, held many of them as the
Marques holds; whether we are guarded by one
peculiar, or many Angels, is not worth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
ſince on all ſides we are agreed, that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we are by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We ſay the Angels pray for us, knowing
our thoughts and deeds, you deny it.</p>
            <p>I deny that Deny; we hold that the Angels
pray for the Church in general, and that they
know our Deeds, but not our thoughts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they do not, we hold it unlawfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
or pray to them; nor do the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
import any thing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We hold it lawfull to pray to them, you
not: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. The
Angel which redeemed Me from all evil, bleſſe
theſe Lads, <hi>&amp;c. Hoſea</hi> 12. 4. He had power over

<hi>Job</hi> ſaith, Have pity on me, O my Friends, <hi>Job</hi>

theſe words, <hi>that holy Job addrest himſelf to the

nothing from that of Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We hold, that we may pray to them, you not,
we have Scripture for it, <hi>Luk. 16. 24. Father</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

            <p>Ladies, this proof is for you, far fetcht and
dear bought; dead and damned in Hell: who
would have thought to have taken <hi>Dives</hi> at his
Beads? Nor are the place and perſon more odd,
than the prayer, for it is no <hi>Ora pro me, Pray for
me,</hi> but <hi>Miſerere mei, Have mercy on me;</hi> ſo Saint
<hi>Abraham</hi> was no ordinary Saint: the Marques
would prevent us in what we ſhould ſay, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115092:27"/>
this is a Parable, and we ſay ſo indeed; but no
matter what we ſay, his Lordſhip hath ready a
grand Inqueſt of ten Fathers, <hi>Theophylact, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Chryſostome, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
Ambroſe, Augustine, Gregory, Euthymius,</hi> and

maintains the hiſtorical part onely till

when he called it a Parable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> But, ſuppoſe it a Parable, every Parable is
either true in the Perſons named, or may be
true in ſome others.</p>
            <p>Not every Parable, not this, for <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
tells us that <hi>Christ</hi> when he deſcended into Hell
went into the Conclave of the Fathers, (where
then <hi>Abraham</hi> was) and preached to the ſouls
there,<note place="margin">Et tempore ſuo corpora etiam rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturas.</note> that he now had finiſhed the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and they muſt go along with him to

they ſhould receive their bodies.<note place="margin">Bell. de Chr. Anim. l. 4. c. 13.</note> So that clear it
is by him, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had not now his body,
and how he could diſcourſe thus to <hi>Dives</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115092:28"/>
his Tongue, a member of that body, is to
me a miracle. <hi>[Job 5. 1. Call now if there be any

But if the Marques hath Scripture, by that we

True,<note place="margin">

Nor did he ſpeak here of the ſacrametal bread,

(ſo there the Cup comes in, it cannot be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<hi>you have no life in you.</hi> What can the Papiſts
here ſay, that judgement ſhould not be given
againſt them? Next, the Marques alleadgeth,
<hi>Acts 2. 42. And they continued in breaking of Bread,
and prayer;</hi> and tells us, here is no mention of
the Cup. I anſwer, granted; but what if we ſay,
there is no abſolute neceſſity enforceth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
theſe words of the Euchariſt, how
could the Marques prove it? But if the Papiſts
will take it for a courteſie, we will not ſtand
with them about it. And though the Cup was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115092:29"/>
not there mentioned, yet for ought the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
could tell, it might be there; for breaking
of bread are words large enough to hold it, elſe
<hi>Eutychus</hi> had but a dry and choking repaſt. And
why may not breaking of bread include the
cup, as well as eating comprehendeth drinking?
Chriſt ſate down with the Diſciples to eat the
Paſſeover, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 15. 16. and yet we find a cup
there, verſ. 17. and the fruit of the vine in it too,
verſ. 18. and no Communion chalice neither.
His laſt Text is <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 30, 35. where Chriſt
communicated with his Diſciples under one
kind, where he tells us that <hi>Auguſtine, Theophylact</hi>
and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expound this place of the bleſſed
Sacrament: well wee'l not quarrel about that
neither; but this triumvirate of Fathers had not
it ſeems kond their leſſon right, for they ſhould
have told us that Chriſt communicated under
one kind onely: Nay, had they told us of any
ſuch practiſe in the Primitive Church, it had
been ſomewhat, but nor they, nor any other,
for the firſt 500 years, I might ſay 1000 have left
us any ſuch thing upon record, and therefore
here his Lordſhip forſakes his old wont of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fathers are of this opinion, and ſtands
ingenuouſly ſilent; no more then what <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
did before him, who in this very point,
leaveth his old <hi>Idem probatur ex Patribus, The ſame

ſlip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M.</hi> We hold that Chriſt offered up unto his
Father in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is a true and
lively ſacrifice; this you deny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115092:29"/>
Our Church ſaith,<note place="margin">Art. 31.</note> the ſacrifices of the Maſſe
are blaſphemous fables and dangerous deceits.
His Lordſhip urgeth <hi>Malachy</hi> 1. 11. In every

pure offering. This could not be meant of the
Jewiſh ſacrifices, nor of that real ſacrifice of
Chriſt upon the Croſſe, but of the dayly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſſe.</p>
            <p>Of the 2 former I grant with the Marques it
could not be meant, and fear the ſacrifice of
the Maſſe cometh in ſo late, and ſo many to be
ſerved before it, that it will ſpeed as ill as
they.</p>
            <p>For firſt there is a <hi>ſacrifice of Prayer.</hi>

<hi>Hierome</hi> underſtood it. There is a ſacrifice of
<hi>Praiſe, the fruit of our lips. Heb.</hi> 13. 15. It might be

There is a ſacrifice Eleemoſynary, of almes, with
<hi>which is God well pleaſed. Heb.</hi> 13. 16. It might be
that; there is the ſacrifice mentioned. <hi>Rom. 12. 1.
a living ſacrifice.</hi> It might be that; any of theſe, or

Commemorative ſacrifice, of the bleſſed <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi>
comprehendeth them all in our Church
Leiturgy, the 2 and laſt in the Prayer after the

the great eſteem he hath amongſt Proteſtants

work.</hi> In this Parallel and comparing both
Churches together, the Marques ſpends many
pages, which I ſhall anſwer in as few lines. And
firſt, I might demand, were his Lordſhip living,
as <hi>David</hi> did of the Widow of <hi>Tekoah,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Andrews Opuſc. poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huma.</note> ſo a very
reverend and learned Biſhop hath ſaved me as
much, in already anſwering that eighteenth
Chapter of the Cardinal's Reply; and he hath
done it ſo full, ſo home, that never as yet durſt
any Jeſuit, or other of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion,
take him to task for it: to that excellent Piece
I ſhall tranſmit the Reader, with this onely
cautionary hint, that what the Biſhop <hi>page</hi> 7.
citeth out of Saint <hi>Augustine de Civit. Dei l. 17.
c.</hi> 20. is no where to be found in that Tome or
Tract, but is in his ſixth Tome <hi>contra Fauſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich.

ſhould have it ſo, and that the Error ſhould

            <p>After all theſe borrowed, or rather ſtollen
Compariſons, the Marques makes no doubt but
his Majeſties judgement will tell him, that <hi>[the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115092:38"/>
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath not changed her countenance,
nor the Papiſts fled from their Colours, but that they do
antiquum obtinere.]</hi> True indeed, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
do ſtill <hi>antiquum obtinere,</hi> keep their old
wont, the old wont of the ancient Hereticks, and
what that was <hi>Tertullian</hi> can inform us; <hi>Adjectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,
by foisting in</hi> (as,<note place="margin">Tertul. de praeſcript.</note>

wresting the Scriptures to ſerve their own turns.</hi> This
is all the Antiquity his Majeſties judgement
could tell him of in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, where
differing from ours. Nor is it enough his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
proves (as he would perſwade us) the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>

that the Church may err, this they had from the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.]</hi>
But I would gladly know from whence
the Marques had his Information concerning
this opinion of the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> he quoteth <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
for it, I confeſſe, and with a <hi>paſſion</hi> as if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where you might finde it in him, where he
undertaketh <hi>Donatus;</hi> but ſure it is, his Lordſhips
every where will come to no where; for the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Donatus</hi> was clearly this; that all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
but his own were erroneous, his own onely
infallible, and out of which hold he did, that
none could be ſaved; which I conceive is the very
Tenet of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholiques, and ſo the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
and they are neareſt ally'd.</p>
            <p>Proteſtants deny unwritten Tradit ions this

            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:115092:38"/>
I deny that Deny, Traditions we hold, and

and we oppoſe to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party their

is with Traditions in Divinity, they cannot
conſtitute any Articles of Faith, or impoſe any
thing of the neceſſity of ſalvation, for which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
muſt be had to the written Word, and to
that only. Though <hi>Arrius</hi> is branded for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,

admitted to communicate with the faithfull in

hope of mercy with God, but from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Church, that the ſtrictneſſe of this

Apoſtatizing. And the Catholique Church her
ſelf went but one degree, but one ſtep further in
her Indulgence beyond <hi>Novatus;</hi> for whereas he
in Reconciliation, thought once was too much,

was done as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ne medicina vilis minus

Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaks of, were they who held,
that juſtifying Faith might be ſevered from, and
without works; ſuch an Opinion the Church of

            <p>Laſtly, as I have ſhewed your Majeſty, that

and if his So here, proves no better than his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
As, his Lordſhips ſhews will be but So So;
And firſt, he begins with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
who he ſaith holds Invocation of Saints, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Images, Tranſubſtantiation, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in one kinde; but his Lordſhip is clearly out
in the laſt, for they communicat under both
kindes, though received at once <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>The Bread ſopt in the Wine,</hi> as <hi>Christophorus
Angelus,</hi> a Native of that place, aſſures us. And for
Worſhiping of Images, he is half out there too,
for though they worſhip Images yet in their
Churches they will not endure them, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
do. In many points it cannot be deny'd, they
have confederacy with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
have their Errors,<note place="margin">Cap. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colis terrae ſancta.</note> and are cenſured for them by
us, and ſo they are by <hi>Bocardus</hi> a Monk, with a
<hi>Faxit Deus, &amp;c. God grant there be no Fopperies
crept into our Church</hi> (meaning the <hi>Romiſh) alſo.</hi>
His Lordſhip did <hi>toto coelo errare, was Heaven wide</hi>
when he reckon'd the <hi>Greek</hi> Church amongſt
our Doctors, though true it is, they hold indeed
with us in the weightieſt, with the Papiſts in
the moſt points. And to little better purpoſe
was it, that he urgeth againſt us <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,
Wickliff,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> we own them
not for our predeceſſors, they had their Errors,
the Rancidity of <hi>Rome</hi> was not wholly out of
them, nor could it be expected otherwiſe. For
Illumination is not in Divinity, as in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
an inſtantaneous action; we bleſſe God for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115092:40"/>
the light they had, though umbrageous and
clouded, yet was it ſuch as diſcovered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
and ſhame of the Church of Rome.
And ſince the Marques hath begun to us, we will
requite him, with ſhewing the Romaniſts our
Tenets amongſt their own Doctors; whom they
do, and always account undoubted Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
and becauſe he begins with <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi>
we will follow him in his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> take notice when this opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be an Article of Faith, and for that hear
<hi>Scotus: Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not a point of
Faith,<note place="margin">Scot. in 4.</note> till the Lateran Councel. And <hi>Tonſtal:</hi> Of

ſuch as the Scripture evidence is for the

juſt ſo and no more, which more explicitely is,
juſt none at all. For I challange them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

            <p>I ſhall make bold to put your Majeſty in

which your Majeſty once made unto his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
concerning the true Church; for if once that
Queſtion were throughly determined, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
not onely between your Majeſty and
his Lordſhip, but alſo all Controverſies that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115092:44"/>
ever were, would ſoon be decided, at a ſhort
race end] And is there no way, no means to end
Controverſies, but by that which this fifteen
hundred years and upward, hath been diſputed
what it is, and where to finde it? Did God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
ſo ill for us, as to leave us in ſuſpenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the main points of Faith, untill that
Church, which is yet in the clouds, ſhall define
what is the true ſenſe of that Scripture, which
muſt guide us to eternal happineſſe. And if after
15 hundred years debate this Church were but
in view, ſome comfort it were to us; but clear
it is (and a miſerable caſe) ſhe is as far off, for
ought we know, as ever; for we are not agreed
upon thoſe marks and tokens by which ſhe muſt
be known. Our Church (the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
holds the purity of Doctrine preached
agreeable to God's Word,<note place="margin">De not is Eccleſ. l. 4. c. 3.</note> and Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
according to <hi>Christ's</hi> Ordinance, to be
the notes of it. The papiſts hold they know not
how many; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons fifteen, but at laſt
reduceth them to four, (according to the moſt
uſual and received Opinion amongſt them)
Unity, Holineſſe, Univerſality, Succeſſion; as
they are in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; but yet he comes
reeling off too, giving them no more than an
Evidence of Credibility; ſo that if a man will
believe them he may,<note place="margin">Evidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatis ib.</note> and may not if he will: and
if we were agreed upon the true marks, yet
ſhould we not be agreed upon the true Church;
for ſuppoſe the four mentioned before and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be they, yet we ſay,
they are more viſible in our Church, than in
that of <hi>Rome.</hi> There are not amongſt us, three
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115092:45"/>
hundred and three differences in points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">B. <hi>Halls</hi> peace of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note>
as hath been demonſtrated in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore ours the greater Unity.
For Holineſſe, that is a grace keeps home, and
ſtirs little abroad, yet if we may judge of it by
its fruits, the papiſts cannot ſhew us more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
members of our Church, than we can them
Heads of theirs; ſo the thing Holineſſe is ours,
let the Title be theirs. For Univerſality, <hi>Rome</hi>
(wherein ſhe differeth from us) cannot prove her
Aſſertions from the teſtimony of the primitive
Church, in ſome points for a thouſand years,
not in any for five hundred after <hi>Christ;</hi> ſo we
are the more Catholique. Laſtly, for Succeſſion
of Doctrine (which is the beſt Succeſſion) we
derive ours from all the Apoſtles; <hi>Rome</hi> onely
from <hi>Peter,</hi> derives onely a Succeſſion of Chairs;
and yet it is not infallibly certain that ever <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> much leſſe Biſhop there; and
therefore our Succeſſion the beſt too; ſo that as
the caſe now ſtands between us, we are not like
to agree in haſte.</p>
            <p>Doctor, I wiſh you could ſet us through; and
truly I muſt needs ſay, in my opinion you have
made a fair offer at deciding this Controverſie,
when you ſaid,<note place="margin">Page 79</note> The true Church muſt be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Men, though I can go no further with
you, for that, That Society of Men are to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge of Scripture, and Controverſies
Theological will not down with me, nor I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
with many more. For let that Society of
Men be a General Councel, which is a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of as much advantage to you as you can
deſire, becauſe it repreſents the Catholique
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115092:45"/>
Church; and it is but a ſuppoſition too, for
though there have been before the Empire was
ſplit, General Councels in former times; yet as
the caſe ſtands now, it ſeemeth to wiſe men an
incredible thing, that ever ſuch a Councel ſhall
be again: and Religion would be in a moſt ſad
condition, were all controverſies to ſtay for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
till then.<note place="margin">Conc. Eph.</note> Beſides Doctor, it hath befallen
ſome General Councels, that there hath been
ſhamefull packing and fore-ſtalling of Suffrages

many have been frighted and minaced to vote
clean contrary to their own ſenſe; and ſuch
Councels are but ill to be truſted with Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

their Canons are no Articles of Faith, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees

<hi>Augustine</hi> would urge the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed

<hi>Ariminum</hi> believes; but finding after that <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
would not take this for an Anſwer, ſays
further, <hi>I did not plead the Councel of</hi> Ariminum
<hi>to excuſe my opinion, but to ſhew the Authority of the
Fathers; who, according to Scripture, delivered to us
a Confeſſion of Faith, which they had out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

him thus, <hi>Neither ought I to produce the Councel of</hi>
Nice <hi>againſt thee, nor thou that of</hi> Ariminum <hi>againſt
me; I am not bound to the authority of this, nor thou of
that; let us in our conflict urge the authority of ſcripture
witneſs indifferent to both, and not peculiar to either.</hi>
See here the Orthodox and Heretique, both
compromiſe to abide the order of Scripture,
and both wave the Authority and Judgement of
two General Councels; which certainly they
would not have done, had they reputed them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and a Judge not infallible ſhall rule no
Faith of mine. But the Doctor tells us <hi>page</hi> 79.
[His Society of Men muſt be ſuch as can ſay,
[It ſeemed good unto us and to the holy Ghoſt]
Now Doctor, you ſpeak to the point indeed,
that Society of Men, that Church would I fain
ſee; but are you well adviſed what you ſay?
If yea, then it muſt ſeem good to the holy
Ghoſt becauſe ſo to us, whereas the firſt form
if he ever promiſed to be there with infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aſſiſtance, I dare take his word for it; but
had it to the holy Ghoſt firſt, and then to
us. But aſſign the holy Ghoſt what place ye
pleaſe, if he be there, 't is all I look for, and
I will not take yours, unleſs you ſhew me that
promiſe, which hitherto you have not done.
But we will not part ſo neither, admit for once
you finde the Church you ſo hunt for, and a
ſpirit of infallibility directing her in that
Councel, muſt and will all Controverſies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ceaſe? Certainly no ſuch matter; for may
not perverſe ſpirits wreſt to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what the holy Ghoſt ſhall declare in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councel, as well as what he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115092:46"/>
in the ſacred Scripture? Did not the <hi>Nestorians</hi>
vouch for their Hereſie the Authority of the
Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> as General a Councel, and as
much endowed with the holy Ghoſt, as ever
any (ſince that of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) was, or I believe
ſhall be. Nor do I ſpeak onely of what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan ſowing Tares, and man's crooked
&amp; untoward will (a ſoil proper for them) may
produce; for the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>ſignanter,</hi> and expreſly, there muſt be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch aſſiſtance, Controverſies ſtill.
For if there muſt be Hereſies, there will be
without controverſie, Controverſies ſtill; and
that Hereſies muſt be, the holy Ghoſt tells us,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. So that the revenue and product of
all I have ſaid is this, That the true Church hath
not the ſupreme Judicature over Queſtions of
Faith; and if ſhe had, yet Controverſies would
and muſt ſtill continue; and all this I hope I
have not onely ſaid but proved.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe ingeniouſly (ſure he meant inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly,
for there was no great wit in his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
that there is not a thing that I ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
leſſe, than that Aſſertion of the Scriptures
being Judge of Controverſies, though in ſome
ſort I muſt and will acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor was here going a ſtep beyond
the Papiſts themſelves, who all hold the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to be an infallible Rule; but reſum'd
himſelf, and modifieth his ſpeech with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of it to be ſo in ſome ſenſe; but
in what, he thought us not worthy to know.
Nor, ſince he is ſo reſerved, will we much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
becauſe, when known, it can extend
little to our ſatisfaction. But though we muſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115092:47"/>
not know in what ſenſe it is ſole Judge, yet in
what it is not he tells us; and that is,</p>
            <p>Not as it is a Book conſiſting of papers,
words and letters; for as we commonly ſay in
matters of civil Differences, The Law ſhall be
Judge between us, we do not meane that every
man ſhall run unto the Law-books, or that any
Lawyer himſelf ſhall ſearch his Law-caſes, and
thereupon poſſeſſe himſelf of the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
without a legal Triall by lawfull Judges
conſtituted to that ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>How the Doctor thinks he hath nickt it, and
yet I fear he is ſo far from hitting the White,
as he hath miſt the But. For firſt, the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is extremely wide. Things <hi>ad extra,</hi> and what
are without us, may be ſtated and determined
by civil Judicatories; but Faith is a thing mixt
of the underſtanding and the will, over which
none can claim Juriſdiction. Man may adjudge
away my Land, my Faith he cannot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt ſay with the Poet,</p>
            <p>Hane animam concede mihi,<note place="margin">Virg. Aen. 11.</note> tua eaetera ſunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in civil Differences, will the Doctor
ſay that the Judges decide the Queſtion, or the
Law? For if the Judgement be given according
to the Law, then the Law is the Judge I take it;
and if contrary to Law, or not according to it,
he who ſo determineth, is not a Judge, but an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator.
<hi>Our Law judgeth no man,</hi>

though with us in <hi>England,</hi> the Law is a kinde of
Craft or Myſtery, full of Quirks and Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
yet in other places, as in <hi>Denmark, Onely
the Parties at variance plead their own Cauſe, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115092:47"/>
then a Man ſtands up and reades the Law, and there's
an end; for the very Law-book is the onely Judge;</hi>
ſaith my royal Author,<note place="margin">Ki. <hi>James</hi> his Speech in <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,</hi> 1616.</note> and adds, <hi>Happy were all
Kingdoms if they could be ſo.</hi> Laſtly, where the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſaith, [It is not our meaning that every
man ſhall run unto the Law-books] We will,
though not yield it, yet ſuppoſe it ſo in other
Differences, but in Divinity it is clearly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for there is an expreſſe Command given by
<hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, not to the Phariſees onely, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to all, <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> and it were
a meer mockery in our Saviour, to bid us Reade
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Suet. in Caligula.</note> if they were like <hi>Caligula's</hi> Laws,
written in ſo ſmal an hand that we cannot reade
them, or in ſo obſcure words as we cannot
without the help of the Church, in matters of
Salvation, underſtand them.</p>
            <p>In like manner ſaving knowledge and divine
Truths are the Portion that all God's Children
lay faſt claim to, yet they muſt not be their own
Carvers, though it be their own meat that is
before them, whileſt they have a Mother at the
Table.</p>
            <p>It is no Argument of ill nurture for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who are adult and grown to full ſtature,
and paſt the danger of cutting their own fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
ſometimes to be their own Carvers,
though their Mother be at the Table. But how
commeth it to paſſe, that the Doctor here pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
our Mother the Church, in no obſcure
place neither, but in the Carvers place, at the
Tables end, where ſhe ſhould be viſible enough;
and yet ſay afterward, <hi>he would fain finde out this

carved me nothing, no, nor any man elſe for
theſe fifteen hundred years; and 'tis an hard
caſe, that Children ſhould cry, and pine, and
ſterve, and die eternally, for want of this Food
everlaſting, which is before them, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Mother will not carve them, and
themſelves they muſt not. 'Tis time then for
God to take away, and I heartily pray he may
not take away, and deprive this Church of that
bleſſed Food, for ſuch wicked Tenets as this.</p>
            <p>They muſt not ſlight all Orders, Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Appeals, and Rules of Faith.</p>
            <p>Moſt true, the Churches Orders are not to be
ſlighted, nor yet to be obeyed without further
diſquiſition and ſcrutiny: the Apoſtle <hi>ſpake as to
wiſe men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 15.</note> yet left them to judge what he ſaid, ſo
may the Church determine what ſhe pleaſe, and
if not agreeable to my ſenſe, endeavour I will
to inform my ſelf better; and if after after all
my ſtudy, I cannot ſubdue my Reaſon to hers,
yet to her Orders my outward conformity I
will, provided ſhe makes no Rules of Faith,
and obtrudeth nothing deſtructive to ſaving
principles, things above her ſphere.</p>
            <p>Saving knowledge and divine Truths muſt
not be wreſted from the Scripture by private
hands.</p>
            <p>This is that we deſire, let them there remain,

he alſo ſhould to it have equal acceſſe;
and moſt unfit, that the means of eternal liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

               <hi>Doct.</hi> There is nothing more abſurd to my

            <p>Decide you it Doctor, whence it concerns,

not yet been, nor can be divin'd when it ſhall

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> It will tell me no more than it told the

how he knew all that to be true which he
had told him, and the Jeſuit anſwering him,
that God's Word did tell him ſo; the Emperor
asked him where it was? He ſhewed him his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the Emperor after he had held it in his

But you will ſay, you can reade, and ſo
you will finde the meaning out of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant

you apprehend it, ſo it muſt be, and ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is nothing elſe but your meaning.</p>
            <p>Not ſo Doctor, but ſo it muſt be to me, be it
to the Doctor what he pleaſe; nor perhaps ſhall
it be always ſo to me, as I now apprehend it;
for I am no infallible Judge to my ſelf; rectifie
I may, and will, upon better reaſon, what I
formerly miſ-apprehended upon worſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore neceſſity requireth an external
Judge for Determination of Differences beſides
the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:115092:49"/>
If an external Judge beſides Scriptures be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
then neceſſary alſo it is, that that Judge
be firſt infallible; for elſe better it were the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
continued, than the Error be ſtated,
and put into poſſeſſion, as may well be feared in
an erring Judge. Secondly, that that Judges au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
be allow'd of for infallible by general
conſent; for elſe all will not abide her arreſt
and doom. Laſtly, that that Judge be always
ready and forth coming upon all emergent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to ſtill them; never out of the way, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to ſeek; for elſe the Differences will the
more increaſe and fructifie, by ſtaying the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for judicial ſentence and deciſion. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
for theſe fifteen hundred years, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
have been, and no ſuch Judge as yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>in rerum natura</hi> to quiet them, we may
ſafely conclude from the no Judge, a no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or accuſe God for improvidence and neglect
in leaving us deſtitute all this time of ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Requiſite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> And we can have no better recourſes to
any than to ſuch as the Scripture it ſelf calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to hear, which is the Church, which
Church would be found out.</p>
            <p>The Scripture calls upon us <hi>to hear the Church,</hi>
but is this <hi>to hear, to obey</hi> her Gloſſe and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Scripture, to give up, and reſign
our judgements to her ſenſe? <hi>Calvin, Beza, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
all Expoſitors, the Context it ſelf will tell
you no; it is to ſubmit to her cenſure in point
of ſatisfaction for mutual offence, whereby ſhe
is ſcandalized: ſo that, Doctor, you muſt before
you finde the Church you ſo look for, finde
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115092:50"/>
ſome other Text to warrant her Authority, or
ſhe is like to be no external Judge, whom all
muſt obey in matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>Here the Doctor takes breath, and gives his
moſt Excellent Majeſty leave to ſpeak; who,
like himſelf, moſt judiciouſly catechiſeth the
Doctor in the all-ſufficiency of Scripture, after
which the Doctor rejoyns.</p>
            <p>All that your Majeſty hath ſaid concerning the
ſcriptures ſufficiency is true, provided that thoſe
Scriptures be duly handled, for as the Law is
ſufficient to determine right, and keep all in
peace and quietneſſe, yet the execution of that
ſufficienciency cannot be performed without
Courts and Judges.</p>
            <p>The Doctor holds his own Compariſon ſtill:
Well Doctor, we have a Court too, <hi>Forum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae,</hi>
the Court of every mans conſcience,
and a Judge alſo of that Court; if you demand
Who? 'Tis every mans ſelf, and therefore they
who controul that Court, are by the voice of

            </p>
            <p>For as <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us, who was no great
Friend to Popes or Biſhops. If there be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Church the Authority of one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and peerleſſe Power above others, there
will be as many Schiſmes in the Church as
Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Doctor, you are out, let me put you in; the
Queſtions we ſpeak of, are of Hereſie, not of
Schiſme, that relates to dogmatical points of
Faith, this to outward Rites. Ceremonies are
the Garments of Religion, not the Body; and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115092:50"/>
Cloath are for Ornament, yet not for that only,
they are alſo to keep the Body warm; a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
naked without Ceremonies will have but
little outward warmth, but a frozen zeal (if I
may ſo ſay) and too many Cloaths are as bad
and cumberſome on the other ſide. Fit it is the
Church ſhould appoint her ſelf, what and how
many ſhe will wear; for leave it at liberty, there
will indeed be Schiſmes as many as <hi>Hierome</hi>
ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I would fain finde out that which
the Scripture bids me hear, <hi>Audi Eccleſiam, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor is again at his <hi>Hear the Church,
Matth.</hi> 18. and I again muſt tell him that place is
onely applyable to Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. But
that the Church may the better be heard, the
Doctor tells us from Saint <hi>Paul, that ſhe is the
Pillar and Foundation of Truth:</hi> from <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that
<hi>God will place his ſanctification in the midst of her for
ever:</hi> from <hi>Eſay,</hi> that <hi>the Lord will never forſake
her:</hi> from our Saviour, that <hi>the Gates of Hell
ſhall not prevail against her,</hi> and that he <hi>will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with her unto the end of the world.</hi> All this
we grant, and yet deny all that the Doctor
would from theſe Texts infer; for firſt, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
not any one of all theſe is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
or hath any reference to a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Church, or General Councel, but to the
Univerſal Catholique Church. Secondly, if a
General Councel were intended by them, yet
there is not any grant of an infallible ſpirit to
direct that Councel, and without the ſpirit of
infallibility, men will be (and no more than
need) very cautelous of yielding plenary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

all the Doctrine neceſſary to ſalvation
being there abbreviated. [He who means to
walk by the rules of Gods word muſt lay hold
upon the means that God hath ordained, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may attain to the true underſtanding of
them; for as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God hath placed in
the Church Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts,
Paſtors, and Doctors, to the end we ſhould be
no more little children, blown about with every
wind of Doctrine.] Were I diſpoſed to quarrel,
I could tell you <hi>Doctor Bayly,</hi> or <hi>Doctor Stapleton,</hi>
(chuſe you which) that your Text is out of date,
and that the Prophets and Evangeliſts there
mentioned were extraordinary, and proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe times; and the Presbyterian party
will tell you as much of the Apoſtles; ſo that
there will be onely left Paſtors and Doctors,

(which with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> I conceive to be both
one) of perpetual uſe in the Church,<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 59. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino.</note> for the
work of the Miniſtery, part of which work, I
freely grant, is the interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
Again, I might expoſtulate as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth 1. <hi>Cor. 12. 30. do all interpret?</hi> have all
Paſtors that gift? And admit they have, have
they all that aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt in an
infallible guidance, which thoſe Paſtors of the
Apoſtolical times had? Nay, is that infallible
aſſiſtance now afforded to any one of all the
Paſtors in the world? If yea, let us know the
man, ſo qualified: if not, then what remedy but
we may be ſtill blown about with every puff of
Doctrine, and what will then become of your
external Judge, beſides Scripture. [Though it be
true, the Scripture is a river through which a
Lamb may wade and an Elephant may ſwim,
yet the meaning of that place is not that the
child of God may wade through the Scripture
without directions, help or Judges, but that the
meaneſt capacity may find ſo much of comfort
and heavenly knowledge there eaſily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that he may eaſily wade through to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Salvation.] If the meaneſt capacity, may
wade through the Scriptures to his eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
they are mad men will ſeek to go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

upon the true meaning of the Scripture, that
the outward letter ſealed with the inward wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Spirit, (being all Hereticks have
quoted Scripture, and pretended ſpirit will not
be a warrant ſufficient for any private man to
judge ſo much as the Scripture to be Scripture,
or the Goſpel to be the Goſpel of Chriſt.) The
Doctor is now entered into a weighty point,
and not more weighty then intricate, <hi>viz.</hi> how
we are aſcertained that the Scriptures are the
word of God. The Doctor with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> derives that aſſurance from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and tradition of the Church, and her Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is indeed of all, ſufficient to render us ſo
aſſured, if ſhe be ſo infallible and in-erring as
they pretend; for our Faith, in this particular,
cannot be guided by any thing beneath infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
This queſtion being ſo conſiderable, and
of ſuch concernment, it will not I hope be
thought amiſſe, if I ſpend a little the more time
about it. Therefore for elucidation, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
therof, I ſay, That the Scriptures are the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115092:53"/>
word of God is a propoſition, which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the evidence either of knowledge,
or Faith. If of knowledge then it muſt be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
and extracted from the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reaſon. But all the reaſon in the world
will never be able to demonſtrate, either that
the Scriptures are the word of God, or that they
are not. Miſtake me not, I do not exclude rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as a guide, nor place it ſo in the line of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence,
as if it ſtood neuter, or indifferently
inclined to both the affirmative and negative;
no, I hold vaſtly otherwayes; Arguments ſhe
hath many, and ponderous to perſwade that the
Scriptures are of Divine inſpiration; that they
are not ſo, to diſwade ſhe hath and can frame
none. But yet thoſe Arguments are but ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
no Demonſtrations; for in Demonſtrations
the underſtanding is ſo clearly convinced by

then all men who have reaſon, would aſſent
preſently without more ado, to her dictates, and
conſequently the whole world would become
Chriſtian, ſo that impoſſible it is for us to <hi>know</hi>
that the Scriptures are the word of God, and if
know it we cannot,<note place="margin">Articuli Fidei ſunt indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrabiles. Poſnamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. l 1. diſt 1. q 1. art. 5.</note> it reſteth onely that we
muſt thereof be aſſured by Faith, and Faith will
aſſure us of it as infallibly to the full, though
not ſo evidently (in regard the principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are indemonſtrable) as reaſon can; well then,
Faith it is which teacheth us infallibly that the
Scriptures are Divine and ſacred, but how that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115092:53"/>
Faith is produced and wrought in us, is next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable.
The Doctor tels us out of <hi>Hooker,</hi>
(that the Authority of the Church produceth it,
and unleſſe that be required, the inward witneſſe
of the ſpirit will not be a warrant ſufficient for
any private man to Judge ſo much as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

Goſpel of Chriſt.) But the Doctor hath here
moſt ſhamefully abuſed that judicious worthy,
who hath in his whole 5. books of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Polity no ſuch words, and which is more,
no ſuch thing. If I bely the Doctor, let the ſhame

            <p>What that ſomething is beſides Scripture,

preſignifying that the glory of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law was bidding the World good

the fail of the ſacred Prieſthood, ſoon after by
<hi>Herod</hi> alien'd and conferr'd in an arbitrary way
on whom he pleaſed, without regard had either
to Law or Line. The Prieſthood thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan'd,
what remain'd but the complement and
laſt act of deſolation, the deſtruction of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115092:57"/>
Temple, which delay'd not after <hi>Christ's</hi> Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
above fourty years, ever ſince which time the
<hi>Jews</hi> have had neither true Prieſts, nor true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
nor true places of Worſhip, nor a true

            <p>All theſe are motives and inductions from
Reaſon to make it credible that the Scriptures
are the Word of God, but not all theſe, nor the
Teſtimony of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church it ſelf, is
able to create faith in us,<note place="margin">Aug. contr. Manich. c. 14.</note> which muſt be <hi>ipſo Deo

never ſo credible, believe we cannot, till
God's Spirit worketh Faith in us. For the final
reſolution, termination, and reſt of our Faith
muſt be upon God alone, and by him alone
wrought in us. That the Authority of the
Church ſhould be the <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> ſo abſolutely
neceſſary, as that the inward witneſſe of God's
Spirit cannot warrant us that the Scriptures are
divine without her teſtimony, needs no further
confutation than the Hiſtory of the Evangeliſts
and Acts, where we reade of thouſands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to <hi>Christianity,</hi> who never entred at that
door. In ſhort, to contract my diſcourſe within
a ſtraighter compaſſe, Faith being an Habit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
and every Habit requiring ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
diſpoſitions and degrees to it, Faith muſt
have hers alſo to make the thing credible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be actually believed: of theſe motives
and preparatory diſpoſitions the Tradition of
the Church is I grant to us <hi>Christians</hi> the firſt
and moſt prevalent: but the Church is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115092:58"/>
in unſociable, it is not her teſtimony alone will
make it credible that the Scriptures are divine;
other deductions and inferences framed by light
of Reaſon, muſt, and uſually do co-operate in
working the minde to that perſwaſion.<note place="margin">Contra Ep. Fund. c. 5.</note> And by

            <p>This Church being found out, and her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

            <p>You ſay true indeed Doctor, her Authority
being allowed of, but then it muſt be allowed of
for divine, and who will ſo allow it amongſt

I know, to <hi>Audi Eccleſiam.</hi> But there will be a
controverſie what is the genuine interpretation
of that place, whether hearing implieth an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

that controverſie? You'll ſay, the Church,

            <p>As the Lion wants neither ſtrength, nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
nor power, nor weapons to ſeiſe upon his
prey, yet he wants a noſe to finde it out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by natural inſtinct he takes to his aſſiſtance
the little Jack-call, a quick-ſented beaſt, who
runs before the Lion, and having found out the
prey, in his Language gives the Lion notice of
it: now to apply this to our purpoſe, <hi>Christ</hi>
crucified is the main ſubſtance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor is here fallen upon a compariſon
wherewith he is much taken, I confeſſe I am not
ſo well read to tell whence he had it, nor of ſo
eaſie belief to credit the Fable; nor is it eſſential
or to the purpoſe, whether a Fable or a Story,
ſince rhe main deſign lies in the Moral and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
wherein the Doctor hath rendred
himſelf ſo impertinently tedious, and ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately
perplexed, that (to uſe his own words)
<hi>I must confeſs ingenuouſly (yet under his highest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
there is not a thing that I ever understood leſs
than the Doctor in this particular;</hi> of whom I may
ſay in part, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115092:59"/>
               <hi>What I understand is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diogenes Laert. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.</note>
               <hi>and ſo is, I am perſwaded, what I understand
not:</hi> his ſcope and meaning being ſo darkly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed,
I ſhall adventure to bolt out by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
and make his application in what I can
follow ſute with his Compariſon. The Lion is,
as I apprehend him, Man's Soul; the Prey,
<hi>Christ</hi> crucified; the place where this Prey is to
be found, the holy Scriptures; the quick-ſented
beaſt, the <hi>Jack-call,</hi> the Church; theſe put into
frame, &amp; ſet together, ſeem to exhibit and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that though the Scriptures contain <hi>Christ</hi>
the food of our ſouls; yet cannot our ſouls finde
out that Food, till the Church (like a Setter)
makes her paint, &amp; directs us where it is. But Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
we ſay &amp; you ſhall never be able by Reaſon
and Scripture evidence (though by words you
may) to gain-ſay it, that our Souls are not ſo
dull ſented, nor <hi>Christ</hi> ſo obſcurely tendred to
us in the Scriptures, as that the ſimpleſt and
moſt ignorant ſoul which humbly and devoutly
ſeeketh him, can poſſibly miſſe him; and if found,
he cannot be till the Church cry So ho, and
ſhew him to us, we are but in an ill plight, ſeeing
we have need of a quick-ſented <hi>Jack-call</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us to that Church, which you Doctor
would ſo fain finde out. But will you ſee the
artifice of this deviſed Plot, the cunning of this
contrived ſimilitude? Behold it here.</p>
            <p>There is a quick ſented Aſſiſtant called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
or Church, which is derived from a Verb
which ſignifies to call, which muſt be the <hi>Jack-call,</hi>
to which this powerfull Seeker after this
Prey muſt joyn it ſelf, or elſe it will never be
able to finde it out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:115092:59"/>
Here's the depth of the deſign laid open, the
Doctor, hapning by chance upon the Fable of
the Lion and Jack-call, thought it would ſerve
his purpoſe moſt happily, becauſe the Jack-call
was to be reſembled by the word Church, which
he conceived was derived from a Verb ſignifying
to call; but here the Doctor is miſerably,
ſhamefully, even to ridiculouſneſſe groſly out;
for <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which doth
not ſignifie to call, but to cull, ſeparate, chuſe,
appropriate, and ſet apart, to elect. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ſaith, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confirms the uſe of this
Etymology, writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he muſt be hinted, that the word is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
there one and the ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, called, not
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, elected, or called forth; calling is one
thing, Election another; calling is in time,
Election from all Eternity; all that are called,
are not elected; nor are all that are elected, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
for children dying infants are many elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not any called. But perhaps the Doctor
will ſay the word Church or <hi>Eccleſia</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth,
in a large notion, not onely the Elect,
but all that are called to the external profeſſion
of <hi>Christianity.</hi> I anſwer, true, but 'tis ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that Church is a choſen,
a peculiar people ſelected from the maſſe of all
mankinde.</p>
            <p>When diſſention aroſe between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
concerning Circumciſion, their diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
could effect nothing but heat, till the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Elders met together, and determined
the matter.</p>
            <p>Good Doctor, if it be not too much trouble
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115092:60"/>
to you, I pray reviſe the Text again, for I fear
you are much out of the ſtory, and wide in two
points; Firſt, in affirming <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to
differ in the doctrine of Circumciſion, who
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thought taught, and defended
one and the ſame Truth, as is evident, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 2.
Secondly, in affirming their diſſention to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas 'tis
clearly directly ſaid to be after it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 39.
A Queſtion there was I grant about Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
before that Councel, but not between <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but between them and <hi>ſome who
came from Judea:</hi> again, a diſſention there was,
a Paroxiſme <hi>between</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, but it
was after that Councel.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a ſociety of men who can ſay,
<hi>Bene viſum fuit nobis &amp; Spiritui ſancto;</hi> or elſe
matters of that nature will never be determined,
which ſociety is there called the Church, which
Church we are to finde.</p>
            <p>That your external Judge is a ſociety of men,
you tell us here; but there are many ſocieties of
men; there is a ſociety of men after the <hi>Geneva</hi>
Model, there is a ſociety of men according to
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion, there is a ſociety of men
aſſembled in a General Council, not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the Pope, which of theſe ſocieties is it
you mean? If none of all theſe, explain your
ſelf; why ſhould you be thus reſerved, like a
ſullen Cow that will not give down her Milk?
Come, impart, communicate your notion free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us; if you ſay it is a ſociety that can ſay,
<hi>Bene viſum fuit nobis &amp; Spiritui ſancto,</hi> you are not
explicite, not yet clear enough; for the Holy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115092:60"/>
Ghoſt may be ſo aſſiſtant to a ſociety, as that
form mentioned (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.) may be aſſumed by it
(though none hath as yet preſumed ſo far) &amp; yet
notwithſtanding, the definitions of that ſociety
may be not abſolutely infallible. But Doct. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an Elegancy in your form, ſingularly, and
peculiarly, your own, you have reform'd the
<hi>viſiun est</hi> or <hi>placuit,</hi> uſed by other Interpreters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>bene viſum,</hi> the myſtery of which diverſity, I
would gladly learn I nor is this all, but by what
warrant I know not; I finde <hi>nobis</hi> take place of
<hi>Spiritui ſancto,</hi> whereas the Apoſtles rendred them
counter-changed, and put the holy Ghoſt in the
upper hand. But it is time to make an end; no
more but this; you ſay ſtill, this Church you are
to finde; and becauſe if findable, your good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
may be to finde it, in caſe you do, let me
adviſe you to proclaim your <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for aſſure
your ſelf, it will be <hi>treaſure trouve,</hi> and then it
belongs either to the King or State, and then
Concealment may create your Trouble.</p>
