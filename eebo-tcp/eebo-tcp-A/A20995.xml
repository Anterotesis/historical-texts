         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S of all the bleſſinges that vve
receue here in earth there is
none that doth ſo liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
Gods inward fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
man as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion from
ſinne, ſo truely there is none ſo dreadful a
ſigne of his heauy reuenge as falling from
fayth. Mark but the hiſtory of the people
of Iſrael and you shall finde that ther fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawe of God, as it was the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt
ſin which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, ſo was it the
greateſt plague that euer they had. Their
ſickenes and peſtilence was nothing, their
dearth and famine was nothing, the loſſe
that they endured by warre was nothing,
their captiuity and death was nothing in
compariſon of reuolting from God, who
had choſen them for his people. This was
a plague of al plagues. Likewiſe if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of Gods benefites towards them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their deliueraunce out of the land of
Egipt, neither their ſafe conduct into the
land of promiſe, neither their well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
common wealth, nor all the victories
obteyned ageinſt their enemies may ons
<pb facs="tcp:19335:4"/>
be compared with that, that it pleaſed him
to turne their hartes from ſinne and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
to the trewe honoring of his name.
This was a bleſſing of al bleſſings. So that
in theſe two poyntes chiefly, is ſet foorth
vnto vs both Gods iuſtice and mercy. His
mercy in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting vs from ſinne, his iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in leauing vs to our ſelues. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there are perilous examples of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and denying a profeſſed treuth. The
tragicall hiſtories of <hi>Frauncis Speyra</hi> and
<hi>Iudge Hales</hi> are able to make a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to tremble. No doubte it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
ſene (&amp; it is a iuſt plague) that who ſo with
his mouth belieth his conſcience, the ſame
with his hand deſtroyeth him ſelfe. Here
I deny not but that God hath his ſecrete
working beyond the reaſon and capacitie
of man, as by the pitifull diſcourſe of this
booke may eaſely appeare. This mans fal
was great, his fact was deteſtable, his mouth
blaſphemous, his hart trayterous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious
to the blud of Chriſt: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
al this, did not God ſuffer him to
ſincke down into the pitte of diſpeire, but
did rayſe him vp ageine by the operation
of his holy ſpirite. Vndoutedly this is a
<pb facs="tcp:19335:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rare exaumple, like vnto the which many
haue not ben ſeene in the church of God.
Therfore I would wiſh all ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the teſtimony of the trewth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how grounding hereuppon, they do
tempt god in hope of the like fauour. Let
that hel and torment of conſcience which
they do here plainely ſee in this man ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denying the trewth</p>
            <p>He was ſometime one of the chief mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the reformed church in <hi>Orleance,</hi>
and becauſe I knew him my ſelf and haue
hard him preach ther ſundry times, I was
the more willing at my frendes requeſt to
putte his booke into english, hoping that
all Chriſten men will reioyce as much at
his penitent conuerſion, as they haue cauſe
to be grieued at his reuolt. I doubt not but
there are that will ſcoffe at this matter and
ſaye that he can not be of a ſounde religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that hath turned his coate ſo ofte. Of
what religion then are theſe our men, that
haue turned alwayes with the time? Let al
turners with tyme learne of this man to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turne
a right. It may be that ſome ſeke to
shew now a more ſtedfaſtnes in error then
in deed they haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to gaine therby the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
<pb facs="tcp:19335:5"/>
of conſtancy. But alas, it can not be
called conſtancy to abyde in euil, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
in Idolatry, to ſtick faſt in ignorance.
This is obſtinacy. They shall neuer be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of wauering that come out of <hi>Babel</hi>
to dwell in <hi>Sion.</hi> If this poore man had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden

Chriſtes veritie, and betraying
of Chriſtians to Romiſh wolues, oh, what
a heauy damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had he procured to him
ſelf: but God in his rich mercy hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prouided for this loſte sheepe. Let
all thoſe therefore which are touched in
harte with the care of gods trewth, and do
bewayle the ruinous decayes of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
iudge rightle hereof. To conclude we may
all ſee in this booke the liuely paterne of
a trewe remorſe, here may we ſee how Saul
doeth become Paul. VVhy should not
the teares and mourning of Peter argue
and declare the conuerſion of Peter? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what a worthi father of our time
(when he came to the Fyre to be brent)
did to his hand that had ſubſcribed to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trewth.
The like maye wee hope of thys
man,<note place="margin">Cranmer</note> that when tyme shall ſerue, he vvill
make both hand and tongue, body &amp; life,
<pb facs="tcp:19335:5"/>
yea and all that he hath to feele the ſmart
of that his deloyaulty. Therefore (good
Reader) be not haſty in condemning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but pray to God to ſtrengthen thy

doe fall that thou mayeſt ryſe agayne, to

Submiſsion.</head>
            <p>THe church of Chriſte hath had
this cuſtome of all antiquitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
the actes of Martyrs haue ben
faithfully ſet down in writing, &amp;
namely their death, their confeſſion of
fayth, their diſputing &amp; refutation of the
doctrine of the aduerſaries. The reading
of ſuch hiſtories did ſerue to confirme the
faythfull in the faith, &amp; to ſtirre them vp
to the imitacion of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy &amp; vertue
of thoſe perſonages. As we reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
to haue ben obſerued by S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the
narration of S. <hi>Stephens</hi> death: &amp; of all
the other perſecutions done ſens againſt
the church, the ſelfe ſame diligence hath
ben followed euen till our time: wherin
our Lorde hath had worthy members a
great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre that haue for his name ſake
ſuffered death, &amp; namely in our countrey
of, <hi>Fraunce,</hi> firſt by forme &amp; order of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and by ſentence of the Iudge to the
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ath of fyre the moſt cruell &amp; horrible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

committed without controlement, &amp;
laſt of al by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnnatural ſlaughters late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:19335:7"/>
executed through out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Realm,
wherof the trwe &amp; faithful hiſtories ſhal
in tyme to come beare witneſſe, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to poſteritie how God hauing at the
firſt but cropt as it wer certain firſt fruts
of his field, thought good now in theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dayes to make a great and plentifull
harueſt of his choſen. In lyke caſe if ther
haue ben any treaſon, reuolt, or notable
breach of fayth committed by any one du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring
the tyme of thoſe perſecutions, men
haue not ben ſlacke in noting ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
to ſerue for an admonition to the
faythful to conſider with them ſelues and
to tremble at the dreadfull iudgements
of God, eſpecially when thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
ſuch faults be publike perſons, and
in ſome reſpect notable. The fal of whom
as it is a proofe of a horrible vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
God through the which they haue ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned,
ſo is it a very violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
to ſhake the weake conſciences and
therewithall to draw a great multitude
to the ſame perdition. And no doubt the
rage of the cruell enemies doth not geue
ſo dangerous a wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flock of Chriſt,
as doth ſuch treachery and infidelitie.
<pb facs="tcp:19335:7"/>
Moreouer if ther haue ben ani one of the
church, that hath by gods grace preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
the hands of the murderers that he hath
not fallen into them, or if ther haue ben
any apprehended and yet eſcaped thens
without hauing eyther ſuffered or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any euil, the fauour of god in that
his deliuerance ought not to be buried in
ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but to be publiſhed to aſſure others
to put their confidence in him that can
drawe fourth his owne out of all perills,
as much as he knowes to be expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for
him ſo to doe. Of theſe thrée ſortes, there
are at this day many examples in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
calamity of the preſent perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
full of crueltie and falſehood, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in tyme the trewth ſhall be knowen &amp;
publiſhed. But as for me, I hauing ben
of that miſerable and peſtilent ſecte tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
my fall &amp; offenciue denyall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I laye wallowing a long tyme: now
after that God hath geuen me grace to
come again to my right witts, I will my
ſelfe be the hiſtoriographer of the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
cryme that I haue committed, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
it according to the trewth and as
it happened: then afterward noting the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:8"/>
circumſtances, I wil aſſaye to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the enormitie and grieuouſnes
therof as much as in me ſhal be poſſible.
Finally whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ſhal ſet before your eyes
this writing (Dearly beloued brethren
and readers of this pitifull diſcourſe) I
beſéeche you that through chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
ye doe helpe me to féele to the

            <p>I was then abyding in <hi>Fraunce</hi> in a

ſaue my ſelfe out of the Realme. And ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
with my ſelf the difficulties &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that ther ſhould be to paſſe, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
after a ſort to counterfet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſt,
by the badge that was worn in the hatts,
by geſture &amp; countenaunce as much as I

                  </gap>ſſe.</note> I was demaunded who I
was, wherwith finding my ſelf wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
amaſed, I had not the memory to
<pb facs="tcp:19335:8"/>
ſpeake that which before I had premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
but making an anſwere without
head or foote, they had me in ſuſpicion: &amp;
the Iudge examyning me by othe what I
was, forthwith without ought diſguiſing
I fréely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed the whole. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes
wherof being clapt in priſon, I toke this
reſolution to ſuffer any kinde of death y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
they ſhold lay vppon me, and I felt ſome
peace &amp; reſt in my conſcience if I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the trewth of the Goſpell wherof I
was moſt aſſured. Although I had euen
than my head buſyed with certeyne cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions
touching the perſonall ſucceſſion
of the Romiſh church, wherof I then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
againſt ſome that wer ther preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
&amp; the trewth had alwaies the victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
falſehod. But this boldnes of mine
was but a puffe that did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
For being all alone I began to diſcourſe
with my ſelf touching the grieuouſnes of
the perſecution then befallen, &amp; I founde
the ſame to be farre beyond all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
For I alwayes toke the calamities
of the tyme paſt to be but viſitations and
roddes wherwithall God did purge his
church, and had euer iudged them to bée
<pb facs="tcp:19335:9"/>
aſſured marks of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of God. But
becauſe that in this laſt ther did appeare
as it were a ruyne and vtter diſtruction
of the whole without any appearance or
hope of reſtabliſhment, I began to valew
it at none other rate then a playne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of gods wrath and indignation, as
if he had by this meanes declared, that he
did deteſt and condemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profeſſion and
exercyſe of our Religion, for that he had
ſo often turned againe to ſtryke vs, yea &amp;
finally ſo to ouerthrow vs, as if he were
willing wholly to deſtroy and roote out
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, &amp; fauour that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
By this meanes I began to giue ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
to this temptation of Sathan, and the
fleſh deſyring to ſaue it ſelf from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
danger got the vpper hand. In ſo
much that I did ſtraight way conclude
with my ſelfe to acknowledge and auow
the church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the trew church,
wherinto I did deſire to be receued. The
which I did declare the ſame daye to the
Iudge, imagening that without delay I
ſhould be ſet at lybertie, which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
I wold withdraw my ſelfe with
all ſpéede out of the Realme, to kéepe me
<pb facs="tcp:19335:9"/>
ſolitary, and to apply my ſelfe to do what
I could to paſſe away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of my tyme.
In the ſame priſon ther were others of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Religion, vnto whom I gaue counſell
to do the lyke, alleging to them that the
Romiſh church was the auncient church
whens we wer departed, and wherunto
we ought to returne, with many other de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſes
tending to the ſame end. Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to my curſed allurements &amp; ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
made the ſame proteſtations to
the Iudge, and not long after they were
deliuered, yet not content with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
I had done and ſayde, to ſhew that I did
it with hart and good will, I wrote to the
chief of my congregation, and farther, to
them of myne owne famyly, exhorting
them to betake them ſelues to popery, &amp;
to be aſſiſtant at the ſeruice there, as I
for my parte minded to be. And to the
ende that this Metamorphoſis or change
happened in my perſon, ſhould not aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them, I declared that I had reaſons
to moue me therunto, wherof ſome I did
ſet down in writing, as well in the ſaid
letters, as in a certayn ſcrole that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Iudge. Now thought I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
<pb facs="tcp:19335:10"/>
that betwixt that and the morrow
after, I ſhould be let out of priſon to goe
wher I would, but it happened quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
For the Iudge hauing geuen
intelligence how I was taken, and of the
great and manifeſt ſignes of my conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and returne to the catholike church
(as they terme it) kept me vntil he hard
newes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Court, whens he receiued
letters of the King, who gaue him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
to ſend me to him to be an
inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; to ſerue to perſwade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
of <hi>Nauarra</hi> and the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to
renounce the religion wherein they had
ben brought vp, with a proteſtation to
follow the faith and doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to acknowledge the Pope for head.
This newes being brought, I was very
ſory when I ſawe my ſelfe fruſtrate of
myne intent, knowing that I muſte
now play a part on the greateſt ſtage in
all <hi>Fraunce,</hi> to confeſſe and defend infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
things which I had heretofore by
word of mouth and writing condemned,
yea and did yet condemne in my hart.
Notwithſtanding hauing already made
the firſt breach into my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, by the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:10"/>
which Sathan had made his entrey, I
left him the full &amp; peaceable poſſeſſion of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole, minding now to doe al thinges
wholy to the lyking of men, laying aſyde
the reuerence of God, and the reſpect of
his glory.</p>
            <p>Being brought to <hi>Paris</hi> and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the King, I declared the ſelfe
ſame aboueſayd, auowing the Romiſh
church to be the trew church, and ſundry
dayes together in the preſence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king
of <hi>Nauarra</hi> and the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> I
maynteyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cauſe agreing with
the Sorboniſts in that point principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and refelling that which ſome of the
king of <hi>Nauarra</hi> his officers (men fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God) did alledge to the contrarie,
that the Reformed church was the trew
church, and their religion the trew reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Furthermore touching the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies
and points of doctrine commenly
debated, in ſome I ſpake lewdly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
myne owne conſcience, euen as
they are taught in popery: of other ſome,
(as principally of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe, the oblation,
and the preſence of Chriſts body) I made
ſome doubt and contradiction, being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:19335:11"/>
therto by the force of the trewth: but
immediatly I let go and abandoned all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
euer I had truely ſpoken &amp; by a falſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
I ſuffered them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude as they
wold them ſelues, hauing beſide that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therin ageinſt myne owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience,
for a miſerable inſtrument to lead thoſe
young Princes to goe to Maſſe, &amp; by that
means to worſhip a falſe God, &amp; to tread
vnder their féete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only ſacrifice of Chriſt
his death. And ſithens I haue fallen in
hand with this conference and diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I wil giue you good aduertiſement of
an edict publiſhed in the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king
of <hi>Nauarra,</hi> for that they haue not bene
contented ther to Chronycle my name &amp;
calling, but they haue followed therin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
cuſtome of the Papiſts, who can not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
recyte that which is happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome addition. For there it is ſayed
that ther were certeyne other miniſters
of the Citie of <hi>Orleance,</hi> that dyd ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confeſſe with me them ſelues to be
vanquiſhed by the force of the Popiſhe
Doctors argumentes, in ſo muche that
they ſhould renounce and forſake the
doctrine before tyme preached to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:19335:11"/>
Churches in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Which
I doe teſtify and maynteyne to you to be
falſe: for there was neuer any but my
ſelf. The other Miniſters of the ſayd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
were better aſſiſted of God,
then to haue committed ſuch an offence.
Being then theſe twoo Princes through
my falſe perſwaſions drawen in a ſhort
ſpace to the profeſſion of Poperye, with
the ſubmiſſions to the ſame required, I
abode a certeine tyme at <hi>Paris,</hi> during the
which I was lead vp and downe (as a
byrde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> call) to certeyne noble Ladyes
and Gentlewomen of the religion, who
not long before had hard me preache the
word of God, or els had knowen mée in
particuler communication to haue exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to perſeuer in the doctryne of the
goſpel, who were al maruelouſly abaſhed
to ſée me thus tranſformed into an other
ſhape, &amp; they could not be perſwaded that
in that which they vnderſtoode of mée. I
ſpake as I thought. Neuertheleſſe I tolde
them all indifferently that I ſpake euen
as I did beléeue in my hart touching the
opinion ſo ſtifly maynteyned of me, that
the Romiſh Church was the Catholyke
<pb facs="tcp:19335:12"/>
Church beſide other poyntes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> do depend
therof. And not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to ſerue their turn
at all aſſayes that did thus employe mée
here and there. I went of myne owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to diuers of myne acquayntance or
els to thoſe that them ſelues did ſéeke me
or by fortune mette with mée: to whom
generally I gaue this counſel to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this Church, albeit that I did grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
her to be full of ſuperſtitions and errors
ſo that ſhée had more then néede of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
with ſundry ſuch other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles
of falſe <hi>Nicodemites</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizers</hi>
or (to ſpeake vprightly) of ypocrits
and enemyes to God by outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And when I founde any diſpleaſed
with them ſelues for the faute that they
had commited to their great grief, I dyd
by and by laye before them the foreſayde
reaſons lulling them a ſléepe therwithall
and laying Pillows vnder their elbows
as ſayeth the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> Namely
I went one day of purpoſe to a certeyne
good and vertuous Lady fearing god, and
to her daughter boothe nobly deſcended.
To conclude, I left no body with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I
might talke familiarly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I did not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb facs="tcp:19335:12"/>
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this pernicious counſell: ſaying
that albeit the body of the Lord be not in
that which is ſhewed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſſe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on might lawfully knele
downe to it, becauſe there is a certeyne
remnant and trace of the trewe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that precious body: and that in
beholding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament (although it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
farre from the inſtitution of Chriſt, &amp;
the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the auncient church)
it ſuffiſeth to lift vp our hatts to heauen,
in which place only is the trewe liuing
body where our Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>deth reigne &amp; ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
at the right hand of God his father.
Thus in this place did I moderate al ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
and went about to playſter this
old ruinous buylding of popery, to make
there appeare a certeine likelyhoode of a
goodly tabernacle. And ſo I did entyce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt
my conſcience al thoſe that I could
to goe to maſſe the very heape of all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and renouncing of Ieſus Chriſt; yea
&amp; I wrote letters to <hi>Madame de Buillon
at Sodan</hi> by the commaundement of the
<hi>Duke Montpenſier</hi> her father to drawe
her to the ſame opinion: making her a
ſorowfull and ſimple recompence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:13"/>
curtiſy &amp; liberality receiued at hir hands
as wel by me as by diuers others during
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troubles of the yeare of our Lord God
1568. And albeit that I felt in my ſelfe
the condemnation of myne owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for the poynts now a dayes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie,
and that no reaſons could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
me to approue the doctrine ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
and exerciſe of the popiſh religion,
and, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ words">

               </gap> that diuers perſons had ben

                  <desc>〈◊◊…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſléepe, that I myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to make my abode any wher but
at <hi>Paris:</hi> now and then ther came vppon
me a certeyne grief of mynd to thinke of
that which was paſt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the inuocation and ſeruice of God of
the pure adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſacraments
the preachyng of the word, and diligent
practiſe of diſcipline, and I made compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
therof with the life, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation and
exercyſe of the Prieſts and Monkes. But
I was ſo wholy in the poſſeſſion of the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:13"/>
Prince of this world, that I ſmothered
vp this fyre which vppon euery occaſion
did thus enkindle within me, laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my ſelf this reaſon emongſt others,
that they of the Church were ſo offended
at this acte of myne, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
receiue me ageyne into their ſociety.
And if I had ben let alone in ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
eſtate wher I might haue found my
ſelf occupied, there is no doubte but I had
abode euen til this houre moyling in that
filth. For after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt heat of deſire (wher
with I had ben thruſt forward to yéelde
my ſelfe to popery) was ſome thing coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
I began fourthwith to féele this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
warre within my ſelfe, eſpecially
when I was employed towards any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to bring him home ageyne (as they
terme it): But if I had remained a while
by my ſelfe, I did by little and little kill
and weare awaye that worme of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Wherfore the very way and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
means to make me bethink my
ſelf was when the ſaid Duke <hi>Montpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi>
did ſend me the tewſday the fourth
of Nouembre with <hi>Maldonat</hi> a <hi>Ieſuite</hi>
to go to <hi>Sedan</hi> to bring his daughter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb facs="tcp:19335:14"/>
de Buillon,</hi> home to the obedience of
of the Pope. For abiding with a certeine
Gentleman on the borders of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme,
whileſt <hi>Maldonat</hi> was a diſputing at
<hi>Sedan,</hi> I receiued letters aduertiſements
and aduiſe of my frindes that I ſhoulde
withdrawe my ſelfe towards them, haue
an eye to myne owne ſafegarde, and not
continewe held in that maner within the
pawes of Sathan: As for them they dyd
offer me all the meanes and aſſiſtaunce
they could poſſibly to drawe mée oute of
that curſed ſrinking puddle wherein I
was be myred. Then began I more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to wake out of this dead ſléepe and this
lethargie of my ſens, I began to bewayle
the holy houſe of my father with the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
entertaynement that his ſeruants
doo receiue ther, too acknowledge my
wretchedneſſe and vyle ingratitude, in
that I had caſt of and abandoned that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and comfortable nouriſhment which I
my ſelfe ſometime had diſtributed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Notwithſtanding, becauſe I had
left my wife and children in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> I
thought in néedefull to returne thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne
to ſée whether I could get them
<pb facs="tcp:19335:14"/>
thence, and chiefly for that I had left my
wife extreame ſicke. Therefore tarying
til <hi>Maldonat</hi> were come ageyne, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to putte this deliberation in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But he being returned gaue me to vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtand
that the Earle of <hi>Retz</hi> had ſent
for him &amp; me with him to come to <hi>Mets.</hi>
Which was to mée a grieuous delaye
wherby my enterpriſe was ſtayed. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt I go then to turne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Chriſtians oute of the right waye to
ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the which place being come
I ſpake once ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly as I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded
to declare to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as I had done els wher)
that the Romiſh Church was that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we ought to ſetlte our ſelues &amp; abyde.
The reſt of the tyme that we were there
I harkened to the Sermons of the <hi>Ieſuite</hi>
who labored hard to prooue the ſacrifyſe
of the Maſſe and Purgatory, to learne if
he taught any new thing. I hard another
alſo named <hi>Maurus</hi> who preached of the
inuocation of Saintes and worſhipping
of Images. But I was ſo farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to beléeue any whit of theſe
thinges for oughte that they did ſaye, that
cleane contrary I was farther of then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
<pb facs="tcp:19335:15"/>
becauſe I did clearely perceyue
with what violence and boldnes they did
wreſt and falſefy the ſcriptures, as by
Gods grace, I ſhall make knowen heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
hauing to that ende gathered theyr
proofes and allegations by note in my
memory. Now the fryday being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xix. of
December, the <hi>Earle</hi> being come home
from a Iourney that hée had made, gaue
vs to vnderſtand that we muſt depart the
morrow after, which was the houre that
I deſired aboue al thinges, for the cauſes
alleged. But the ſame day a little before
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates were ſhut, letters were broughte
me whereby I was aduertyſed that my
wyfe &amp; children were out of the Realme,
that I ſhould looke to my ſelf and beware
howe I did returne thither where I had
nothing to doe. Hereuppon I conſidered
that it was not without the ſinguler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God that ſuch aduertiſement
was come euen as I would wiſhe, and
that I ought not to let ſlippe ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Therfore after I had prayed to God
at night for the danger that was in ſuche
an enterpriſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morrow after accordyng
to the meanes that God had offered mée
<pb facs="tcp:19335:15"/>
vppon the ſodayne, I ſet forth about nine
of the clocke in the morning without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knowen, ſtayed or caught ageyne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there were men ſent after mée. By
this meanes GOD hauing drawen mée
thenſe hath in the end conducted me into
this citie making an end of the ouerlong
abode which I made in the middeſt of
Idolatry.<note place="margin">Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Behold my brethren the tragicall and
miſerable diſcourſe of my fall, treachery,
and rebellion ageynſt my God, wherein
there are ſo many circumſtances y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> make
it offenſiue and deteſtable, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are now preſented before myne eyes, I
doe not thinke all my whole lyfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to acknowledge and comprehend the
ſame as it ought to bée. There is not any
one at this daye among ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doe ageynſt their conſcience ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to that Idole, but he ought to confeſſe
that he doeth offend god horribly in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring
hym by that means, and in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the creature in ſteade of the
creator. And although there bée none
but maye allege weakeneſſe and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye
in thys acte, (and in déede it is not
<pb facs="tcp:19335:16"/>
likely but that many doe beléeue in their
hart that which they are compelled to doo
outwardly) yet notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their
allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not ſerue for an excuſe, but
rather for their condemnation &amp; reproch,
becauſe it is to ſette God behind himſelf,
to loue more this tranſſitory life than the
glory of God, it is to feare thoſe that can
kill the body, and not him that can caſte
both body and ſoule into euerlaſting fire.
To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, it is plainly to renounce Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt before that ouerthwart &amp; baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
generation. What may one ſaye of
mée then, who haue not only ben of the
Church of God, a partaker of thoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bleſſings that are there diſtributed,
but alſo haue therin borne the moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable

more then ten yeare, that haue ben of on

the which within this foure or fiue yeare

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
wherof the inhabytants haue yet

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal hear of this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue done?
Is it not as if I did condemne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe for
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ſo many godly men haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
what a trouble of conſcience haue I

their Parentes and frinds prayſing god,
who had done them this honour to ſuffer
for his name? Now are they grieuouſly
tempted to miſtruſt the vprightneſſe of
the cauſe, becauſe they can not bée reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
on the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that men ought to haue
of the honorable death that ſo many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Martyrs haue abiden through the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
of Antichriſt &amp; his Suppoſts. Héere
behold an ineſtimable iniury done to the
dead (of whom the memory ought to be
bleſſed for euer) to the liuing, &amp; to Chriſt
him ſelf for whoſe treuth they haue ſhead
their blud. And if I had long abidden em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
honger, darkenes and rough
handeling, &amp; that to conclude this frayle
fleſh ouerwhelmed with ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
had made the ſpirit to yelde &amp; ſtoupe
to ſuch perſecution, it might wel haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb facs="tcp:19335:17"/>
of ſome humane fraylty, to haue
moued compaſſion thereof. But I at the
very firſt rumour of the ſlaughter reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to ſaue this myſerable lyfe to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
yea &amp; to renounce the treuth. Trew it
is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not long before my minde was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſquieted touching the perſonall
ſucceſſion of the Church. In ſo much that
I ſtode in doubte whether it were not a
dangerous matter, to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church
of <hi>Rome</hi> in the which I founde this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
Neuertheleſſe this is the trewth,
that as ſone as I had intelligence of that
which was bruted, the feare of death, the
loue of this lyfe and commodities therof
ſeruing their turne of this my trouble of
mind, cauſed me to yeld more force ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
then the thing required: Inſomuch
that I was cleane out of taſt with that
doctryne in generall, which for al that, I
neither did nor could doubt of. But I loſt
all will and inclination to confeſſe and
maynteine the ſame: And albeit that I
had rather haue eſcaped out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realme
(as in déede I had prepared my ſelfe ther
vnto) tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ſtayed ther any longer,
&amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of myne own méere diſpoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:19335:17"/>
any maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulſion, I had neuer
the affection to bend my ſelfe againſt the
doctryne: Yet notwithſtanding I was
vtterly diſcouraged to take in hande the
defence of the ſame, &amp; I rather tooke this
reſolution, to doe what ſoeuer was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
me at the inſtant to cleare me of al
ſuſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery wher wher I ſhuld paſſe.
So the great and righteous Iudge did
not fayle on his part to handle me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
For hauing ben ſo many yeares
together taught by him the nature of the
Goſpell of his ſonne, which is called the
word of the croſſe, it had ben my part,
to haue ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more and more aſſured of
my vocation, and of the trewth of his
Church, becauſe I ſawe the croſſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
ſtill, and the perſecutions to grow
dayly more violent. But perceyuing
the affliction to excéede the meaſure that
I would haue preſcribed to GOD, I
fell to doubte, not of the doctryne in it
ſelfe, but of the Church in the reſpect of
the perſonall ſucceſſion. For this cauſe
GOD did iuſtly deliuer me to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer
of myne owne harte, to committe
a faulte not onely foule and deteſtable,
<pb facs="tcp:19335:18"/>
but alſo cleane ſounding ageynſt reaſon
and mans iudgement: that is to ſay: to
immagine I had ſome reaſon not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
a trewth whereof I was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.
Others that fal by infirmity doe
acknowledge that they doe ageynſt that
they ought to do, in inpugning &amp; deniyng
a knowen and vndoubted trewth, but I
toke it to be a pointe requiſite in my ſelf
to ſpeake ageynſt mine owne conſcience,
and ageinſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſured knowledge of mine
owne harte. Thus in the iudgement of
God thoſe that thinke them ſelues wyſe
are prooued fooles: neither did god in this
beginning ſuffer mée to ſcape awaye ſo
lightly, but ſithens I would néedes dally
with him, thinking that I ſhould be eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet at liberty, he payed me the iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of my firſt leudnes and treachery,
puniſhing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former offenſe by later enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
as ye haue vnderſtoode. The firſt
prancke of my deloyaulty was that I did
ſhewe my ſelfe not a hyreling that doeth
Abandon hys charge when hée ſéeth the
Woulphe come, but I was my ſelfe a
Woulphe yea &amp; a rauening Woulphe,
ſcatering and diſſipating mine own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre
<pb facs="tcp:19335:18"/>
flock. For I wrote immediatly to the
principalls of that aſſembly where I had
ben, admoniſhing them to acknowledge,
&amp; follow the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I dyd the
lyke to myne owne famyly which I had
before inſtructed in the feare of God: and
my little children conſecrated to Ieſus
Chriſt, were by this meanes plonged in
the popiſh filthy polutions, to proſtrate
them ſelues before the Idole of Idoles.
Being thus foundred in this firſt quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myre,
I ceaſed not to wade from euill to
worſſe: and after I had betrayed myne
owne flocke, myne owne fleſh and bones,
and the little young imps that God had
geuen me, no maruell, if I played ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
parts towards others. Neyther
then did this falſe dealing of myne kéepe
it ſelfe within theſe bounds. For I was
brought to <hi>Paris</hi> to be tyed as a carthorſe
to the Charet wher Sathan ſate in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ageinſt the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Ieſu Chriſt
bringing them after him conquered and
captiues. Theſe two young princes buds
of the flower de Luce royall, vertuouſly
and faythfully inſtructed in the doctrine
of the trewth, conſecrated to the glory of
<pb facs="tcp:19335:19"/>
God, called to be nurces of the Church, of
whome ſhe might one day hope for ſome
comfort &amp; perfection, wer by me diuerted
from the trew reformed Church, brought
(as touching their perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) to go to Maſſe,
and conſequently to ſet vp ageyne &amp; reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
that curſed Idolatry within the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and lymits of their dominion &amp; ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neury.
To be ſhort, they were by me deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vp as it wer, to the tyrannical clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
&amp; grypes of Antichriſt, to ſweare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him, and to make war ageinſt
the children of God. For although they
had great occaſions to ſhrink: conſidering
the murders that they ſawe committed,
the practiſes that wer vſed to terrefy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and although that the brute was already
ſpread that they went to Maſſe, yet had
they continewed pure and conſtant vntil
my arriuall. Wherfore ther is no doubt,
but that my tongue trayterous &amp; vntrew
to my God did more preuayle with them,
then all the threates, dangers, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſlaughters which they hard and ſawe
dayly before theyr eyes: whereof alſo, if
they be now wholly changed with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mynde to perſecute the Goſpell,
<pb facs="tcp:19335:19"/>
(which God forbid) I am alas the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
cauſe. If they do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynſt
their will, they may chiefly laye
the faute in me, for that payne and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of mynde wherewith they be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
            <p>Touching this poynte be ye aduertyſed,
(ye that reade this) to praye to GOD
for thoſe perſonages, that it will pleaſe
him to take pytie vpon them, and when
he ſéeth good to repayre that ineſtimable
loſſe. In the meane ſeaſon, I was not
without remorſe and trouble in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ſéeinge the pytteous woorke
that was a building, whereof I was an
inſtrument, or rather ſeing the ruine and
ſubuerſion of the Churche, where I my
ſelfe gaue the greateſt blowes to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
it. And manye tymes there
came to my memory a verſe of a certeyn
poet alleadged by <hi>Tertulian: Vſ<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ad eòne
morj miſerum eſt?</hi> I felt my ſelfe mooued
with heauenly inſpirations to mainteyn
gods trewth. I dyd after a ſorte conſider
of the wounde that was made by my
meanes, ſome tymes the force of reaſon
and trewth did pricke me forewarde to
<pb facs="tcp:19335:20"/>
ſpeake againſt the doctors of Sorbona in
certeyne points: but the ſame vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
immediatly, becauſe that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſſed furth to the chiefeſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
hauing a vowed theirs for the trewe
Church. And certenly I remember that
being often preſſed with my ſelfe, &amp; fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a kinde of conuiction in that I dyd
let paſſe ſo many falſe things ageinſt the
trewth, at night I prayed to God that he
would not ſuffer me to liue to the day fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
forſéeing that the morrow after
I ſhould yet be driuen to conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
to many things which I thought and
knew to be falſe, but this was not a well
ordered prayer becauſe I ſhould rather
haue craued his ſpirit of ſtrength &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie
to ſuſteyne and defende that
which he had reuealed to me to be trewe,
&amp; referre to him the iſſue and falling out
of the whole. Neyther was I hard of him,
but was ſtill abyding in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of the
enemies of his poore afflicted Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to heare the ſcoffes and ieſtes
that they did ſpewe out, laughing at the

when they reioyſed at the deſtruction of
<pb facs="tcp:19335:20"/>
               <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Thus went I cleane depriued
of all ſens &amp; féeling to enure my ſelfe lyke

but in the meane tyme the ſoules are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
and paſſed from trauel to reſt. But
I haue ben a murderer of ſoules ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the fayth of many through my word,
and taking from their vnderſtanding the
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; knowledge of the euill which
they went about to doe. And beſyde thoſe
that haue hard me ſpeak with myne own
propre mouth, there are infinite others y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
may haue read that which I had ſundry
tymes written touching the ſame, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
wherof were ſpread all abroade, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied
with prety gloſes and additions,
wher I had not written playn enough to
the contenting of the papiſts, as I my ſelf
haue both ſéene and perceyued. And thoſe
that haue not read them might therof be
informed by others: In ſuch ſort that I
can not expreſſe nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend how great
a ruine and decay hath enſued of this my
fal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From al the which miſhaps one only
death had at one inſtant preſerued me if
<pb facs="tcp:19335:21"/>
I had abyden it after the example of ſo
many poore ſhéepe of Ieſus Chriſt layed
furth to the ſlaughter without mercie.
Such a death had béen precious before
God, honorable for me and myne, and
of a good ſauour to the congregation of
the Lorde. And yet for any thing that I
haue done I ſhall not eſcape death, which
ſhall come at the houre and in the maner
that God hath appoynted it after I haue
lyued in ignomyny in the ſight of all good
men. Wherfore when I conſider all the
circumſtances, I can hardlye pycke out
an example to be ballanced with this acte
of myne. Sainct <hi>Peter</hi> did renounce
Chriſt, but it was in his firſt weakneſſe
before he was yet fortyfied, whereas I
ought to haue ben a leader and a captain,
conſidering how long I had ben called to
the ſeruice of God. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
withdrew him ſelfe and went out
to wéepe: as for me I was in a good way
to haue continewed all my lyfe long in
the botomleſſe pitte of perdition. Sainct
<hi>Paule</hi> did perſecute the Church of God,
but it was in ignoraunce and through an
vnaduiſed zeale, hauing not the fayth,
<pb facs="tcp:19335:21"/>
wheras I did put my helping hand to the
réedifying of that which before I had pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe, declaring my ſelfe a ſinfull
tranſgreſſour. <hi>Iohn Marke</hi> left of his
labour and the voyage that he hadde in
hands, for the which Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> did not
thinke it reaſonable that hée ſhould be
afterwarde employed. <hi>Demas</hi> forſoke
his vocation for the loue and deſyre of
this preſent worlde. But none of theſe
did for all that perſecute the trewth as
I haue done. Touching the facte I finde
but one comparable to my ſelfe, and that
is he that layed his head together with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſacryficers and tooke money of them to be
traye and make ſale of the innocent blud
as he confeſſed himſelf. Euen ſo did I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainte
my ſelfe with ſuch kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the very ſucceſſors of the <hi>Pharyſeyes,</hi>
ſweare my ſelfe into the hands of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
and receyued the hyre of vntrewth
as did <hi>Balaam,</hi> with a promiſe of a yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
penſion in time to come.</p>
            <p>Briefly, I ſée my ſelf paynted out in that
which Sainct <hi>Peter</hi> ſayeth: that this
man hath ben the leader of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue
taken Ieſus, who (ſayth hée) was
<pb facs="tcp:19335:22"/>
accompted in the numbre of vs, and had
receyued his parte of the adminiſtration
of his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sée here then (my brethren)
on part of thoſe enormities that I do note
in mi reuolt. I did not only giue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
men to yelde to the infirmitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh,
but more then that I did fill the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of the weake with troubleſome

ageyne: to the ypocrites I did ſerue for
a maſke and cloke to couer them ſelues,
in aſſiſting to thoſe things that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
to the open enemyes I gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

I be excuſed, but that I did leudly and vil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenouſly
to refuſe to witneſſe that treuth
with my mouth which I did verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
in my harte, &amp; to exhort thoſe that I
could ageinſt my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to go to Maſſe,
and to yéeld obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Now
as I doe by this preſent writing make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
confeſſion of my to too haynous enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
for a piece of amends and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the offence publikely geuen: ſo am
I determined (God willing) to write of
this matter of the Church to take away
all doubt and ſcruple from the wauering
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences that be not yet fully reſolued,
for that they haue hard the ſayd reaſons.
To conclude, being now at full liberty to
ſtick boldly without feare to that Church
which in my harte I doe alowe of, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before god to recognyſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that for the trewe Church whiche
hath for the rule of her fayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the old &amp; newe Teſtament, the
olde conteyned in the lawe, Pſalms, and
Prophets (as our Lord him ſelf doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
it) the newe in the writinges of the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:25"/>
               <hi>Euangeliſtes</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> anowyng
for trewe markes of the Churche not
the ſucceſſion of perſones and of menne,
but of the Doctryne of the Prophetes
and <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> Sithens it is manyfeſt
that we can not acknowledge any for
the houſe of GOD, but that which
is the piller and ſtaye of the treweth,
nor anye to bée of the folde of Chriſt,
but thoſe only that heare hys voyce and
follow him: and that ſhée is the trewe
Spouſe, that hath Chriſt for her Spouſe:
briefely that it is neceſſary to goe out of
that Church wherein one can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
wythoute renouncyng of Ieſus
Chriſt, and to be ſhorte without loſſe
of bodye and Soule by diſhonoring and
offending of GOD.</p>
            <p>According whereunto I doe alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the confeſſion of Fayth publiſhed
in the name of the reformed Churches
of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> acknowledging and auowing
the ſame to be a Chriſtian confeſſion
by the conformitye and agréement that
it hath with the holy Scripturs, and
ioyntly the Eccleſiaſtycall diſcyplyne
to bée the conducte and gouernement
<pb facs="tcp:19335:25"/>
of the people of GOD. Wyth lyke
aſſuraunce I holde and beléeue with
all my harte, and confeſſe as well by
mouth as by writyng, that thoſe which
for thys reformation haue a fewe yeares
ſence ſuffered death, eyther by order
of Iuſtyce, or by the late blouddy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
more cruell then thoſe of the Gotes
or Vandales, are trewe and bleſſed
Martyrs of Ieſus Chriſt, dead for hys
name, and his holy trewth. And for the
commendation and prayſe of them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for their comfort and conſolation
that are yet liuing, women, children, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
and frindes, this ſentence of
Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> maye
by good right be applyed: yée are made
followers of the congregacions of GOD
that are at Iudea in Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe
yée haue ſuffered the ſelfe ſame thynges
by them of your owne natyon as they
dyd by the <hi>Ievves.</hi> Who likewyſe haue
kylled the Lorde Ieſus and their owne
Prophetes, and haue banyſhed vs, they
pleaſe not GOD and are aduerſaries
to al men, not ſuffering vs to ſpeak to the
<pb facs="tcp:19335:26"/>
Gentils for their ſaluation: to the ende
that they may dayly heape vp their ſins,
for the wrath of god is come vppon them
to the vttermoſt.</p>
            <p>Wherfore O ye faithful paſtors of the
Chriſtian Church, Stewards of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of god, that hath giuen you the word
of reconciliation, to the end that ye maye
be <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> for Chriſt, ye that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
haue taken me for your fellow in
the work of the Lord, continew in that
holy vocation, wayting for the rewarde
promiſed in that great day, wherin thoſe
that haue inſtructed many to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſhall ſhyne lyke ſtars. God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
the greateſt part of you whole and
ſound, ſo well, that ye haue not ben at all
apprehended, or els ye haue gotten out of
the enemyes handes, without any thing
done that might ſéeme vnworthy the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience
of a Chriſtian man. A fewe are
fallen and bent ageynſt the Goſpell, and
I miſerable wretch was the firſt in that
ſmall numbre. I haue darkned and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the beuty and excellency of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
doctrine that I had my ſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
preached. But ye know the aſſured
<pb facs="tcp:19335:26"/>
foundation whero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is grounded. Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be he that ſhall announce any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary
thing yea were he an Angell in heauen.
O ye happy and bleſſed of God, that haue
in your harts the teſtimony of an vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
conſcience, to haue walked in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and playnnes: bleſſed that ſhal heare at
the later daye, enter into the ioye of thy
Lord, thow good and faythfull ſeruant, for
that thou haſt increaſed the talents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to thée, whereas I haue not onely
buried in the earth the talent that I had,
but haue employed the ſame in making
warre ageynſt the trewth. God graunt
you the grace to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew and gyue a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſucceſſe to your godly trauells. Aſſiſt
me with your prayers that the heauenly
father may receyue me now that I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to him after this horrible ſliding and
reuolt, and pardon me my ſo grieuous
enormity. O Lord almighty and wholy
wiſe, how eaſy is it for thée to entrappe
the crafty in their deceypte. O how thy
iudgements be iuſt and righteous.</p>

               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19335:27"/>
To good, to pure, to cleane of harte</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Euen ſo haſt thou drawen out of the
bottome of my hart that which was ther
hyd, not ſuffering that I ſhould beguylé
the world any lenger. For hauing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my charge and to ſlipps
thens couertly for certeyne doubts and
difficulties that I had in my mynd, to
the end to continew as it were a neutre
touching thy outward profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thou haſt
iuſtly caſt me of to myne owne ſens. By
that meanes gyuing more force to myne
owne illuſions, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thy word.
I am fallen where I well deſerued. For
in ſteade of being but a forſaker of the
charge where thow haddeſt placed me,
I became a formall enemy, reproouing
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning it: of the other ſyde being
willing to authoryſe and alowe the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them that doe teache popiſh ſcyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb facs="tcp:19335:27"/>
and errors, thow diddeſt cauſe me to
come ſo neare it, that I was driuen to be
better acquaynted with them then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred.
Such was the puniſhment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou
diddeſt caſt vppon thy people in tymes
paſt: who when they wold not kéepe them
ſelues pure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idolatry after long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
thou diddeſt in the end deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp into thy enemyes hand, who brought
them into <hi>Babilon,</hi> where they were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with the fight of falſe Gods.</p>
            <p>But the ſame did ſerue this people to
take theſe idoles in ſuch diſdayne and hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror,
that they neuer fell into that faute
ageyne, after their returne into <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
Euen ſo my GOD graunt me this
grace, that the diſpleaſure &amp; grief that I
haue of ſo greate a faute, doe engendre in
my ſoule ſuch a hate and deteſtation of
the euill that I haue committed, that I
may beſtowe my whole lyfe in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and bewayling the ſame, crauing
thy mercy, to the end that thou mayeſt
forgyue it me. Thou haſt brought me
meruelous lowe, puniſhing the pryde
wherwith I was fully infected, and the
conceyte that I had of my ſelf: as thou
<pb facs="tcp:19335:28"/>
art accuſtomed, to take from him that
hath nothing, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which he thinketh
to haue. To thée be all glory, and to me
confuſion of face. Notwithſtandinge
my God, who haſt put in my harte the
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to acknowledge the danger of the
horrible and euerlaſting perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where
into I did throw my ſelf hedlong, reſtore
me thy ſpirite that may comfort me, and
gyue me hope of mercy. And in this tyme
of extreame affliction, graunt me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace
to follow the exaumple of thy ſeruaunt
<hi>Moyſes</hi> who choſe rather to be afflicted
with thy people, then to enioye for a time
the pleaſures of ſinne, eſtéeming the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
of Chriſt to be greater ryches then
the treaſors of <hi>Egypte.</hi> Thy Church
is at this day ſtraungely oppreſſed and
threatned with an vtter and perpetuall
ruyne and deſtruction: but by thy ayde
and aſſiſtance I doe mind to accompany
her, and to drinke my parte of her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
praying thée to this ende O Lord,
to make me féele in what miſerable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
they be that doe withdraw them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
towards the enemyes of thy trewth
euen then when they thinke themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:19335:28"/>
moſt in thy fauour. Strengthen &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
this deſyre in me to the end: that if
I be once more called to the profeſſion of
thy name, I doe abandon my ſelfe in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce
for that godly quarrell as I am
bound. Take compaſſion of thy poore and
deſolate Church, and mollefy the ſtrypes
wherewithall at this day thou haſt ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her. Appeaſe thy wrath towards thy
people, for whom thy deare ſonne hath
ſhead his bloud, and with thy ſpirite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
thoſe that are at this day vnder the
Croſſe for thy ſacred trewth, giuing them
hope ageynſt all hope, and making
them inuincible ageynſt all
the aſſaults and violent
enforcements of thy
aduerſaryes.
