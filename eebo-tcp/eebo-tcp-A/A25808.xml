            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CHremylus</hi> an honest decaied Gentleman, willing to become rich, repaireth to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> to enquire how he might compasse his designe: The Oracle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth him to follow that man whom he first met with, and never part from his company. The man he met is the old blind <hi>God of Wealth</hi> disguised. After this, <hi>Chremylus</hi> calleth his poor (but honest) Neighbours to partake of his happinesse. The honest party rejoyce at the news; Rascals only and vitious persons are discontented. <hi>Plutus</hi> is led to the Temple of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> by whose art and help he recovereth his eye-sight. At this Knaves are even mad, they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lastly, to vexe them more, the <hi>God of Wealth</hi> is introduced married to <hi>Honesty.</hi>

                     <p>To be rich is the daintiest pleasure in the world; especially, to grow rich without ventring the danger of <hi>Tiburn</hi> or Whipping. Every Cupbord is full of Custards, the Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads replenished with sparkling Sacks. The veriest <hi>Gippo</hi> in the house will not drink a degree under Muscadine. All the Porredge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots are arrant <hi>Barbary</hi> gold. All the Vessels in the house, from the Bason and Ewer to the Chamber-pot and Vinegar-bottle, are of <hi>Middletons</hi> silver. The Kitchen and Buttery is entire Ivory, the very purity of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants tooth. The Sinke is paved with the rich Rubies, and incomparable Carbuncles of Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle</hi>'s Nose. The Conduit runs as good Rose-water as any is in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> Well. The Dish-clouts are cloath of Tissue, and from the skirts of every Scullion drop melting streames of Amber grease. We the poor servants play at Even and Odd with arch-angels, and at Crosse and Pile for Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobusses, in a humour, to out <hi>Philip</hi> the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> My Master is sacrificing a Sow, a Goat, and a Ram for joy; But J could not endure the house, there is such a smoak from the reaking of the roast, that though it please my stomack, my eyes are offended with it.</p>

Alas poor woman! since the shop of <hi>Plutus</hi> his eyes has been open, what abundance of misery has befallen thee! Now the young Gallant will no longer kisse thee nor imbrace thee: but thou poor widow must lie comfortlesse in a solitary pair of sheets, having nothing to cover thee but the lecherous Rug and the bawdy Blankets. O that J were young again! how it comforts me to remember the death of my maidenhead! Alas poor woman, they contemn old age, as if our lechery was out of date. They say we are cold: methinks that thought should make um take compassion of us, and lie with us, if not for love, for charity. They say we are dry: so much the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>Cupids</hi> fire; while young wenches, like green wood, smoke before they flame. They say we are old: why then experience makes us more expert. They tell us our lips are wrinkled: why that in kissing makes the sweeter titillation. They sweare we have no teeth: why then they need not fear biting. VVell, if our lease of Lechery be out, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we might purchase a Night-labourer for his dayes-wages. I will be reveng'd of this same <hi>Plutus,</hi> that wrongs the orphans, and is so uncharitable to the widows. Ho, ho, who's within here!</p>
