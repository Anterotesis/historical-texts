            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The fourth theefe is Symonie, a notable theefe standing at the Church doore, like <hi>Iudas</hi> with a bag in his hand. If <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> the Patron be doore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the Temple which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls a house of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, the other three Evangelists call a den of theeves. Such money-changers then, or theeves deserve to be whipped out, and

their tables overthrowne. The fifth theefe is Poperie, an old theefe, and therefore small reason hath he to plead for his antiquitie, even as much as an old robber to plead for pardon, because his forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have beene theeves time out of memorie; this theefe hath feloniously stolne away the cup from the people in the Eucharist, yea, hath robbed God himselfe, and stolne away one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by his two pick-locks of Purgatorie and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, still rob ignorant people of their money, lands, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. The sixth theefe is Libertinisme, a lawlesse theefe, and yet would be thought a good member of the Church hee under pretence of an unbounded libertie, will be subject to no order nor discipline, but what pleaseth his owne phansie; he steales from God his honour, in making him the author of sinne, he robs the morall law of its use, affirming it to be needlesse; He robs Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination of its meanes saying, that men shall bee saved without them; He robs sin of its guilt, affirming his owne actions though never so vitious to be no sinnes; and hee robbes good workes of their dignitie, thinking to be saved by faith alone. The seventh theefe is Hypocrisie, a cheating theefe, who under the mantle of holinesse cousins the world, the neerer he drawes to the Altar, the farther he is from God; Like the foxe he lyes as if he were dead, and pretends mortification, but it is to cheat the birds, honest minded men, he can with <hi>Proteus</hi> and the Camelion, change himselfe into all shapes and colours, and with the ratle Mouse in the fable, when hee is amongst the birds hide his feete, and stretch out his wings; but among the beasts hee hides his wings and shewes his feet, so deceiving both is hated of both. Such a cunning theefe should have his linsie woolsie garment stript from him, and be whipt out of the Temple. More theeves there be, too many indeed, with which Gods house is prophaned: as the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous theefe that maliciously steales away a mans good name, and none thus more theevish then they, that would monopolise all holinesse to themselves; There is pride, extortion, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Atheisme, gluttony, drunkennesse, and indeed a whole legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the poore Church of Christ is in no better case then the poore man that fell among theeves betweene <hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> With what a multitude of hereticall theeves, even from
