            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my last to you, I signified to you, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which were like to befall us by the releeving of <hi>Droheda,</hi> but God by his infinite mercy hath freed us (I may say miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) from that hazard: for when our men there were driven to that extremitie to eat horse-flesh, Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> sallied out of the Town with onely fortie Musketiers, and fortie Horse, and beat off foure hundred of the Enemies, killed above threescore of them, recovered fourscore Cowes and Oxen, and two hundred sheep; burned foure Towns, and brought home two of their Colours. Besides, I must relate unto you Gods abundant goodnesse unto us, in that the night before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and succours which we sent by Sea from <hi>Dublin</hi> to them, should have entred into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64009:4"/>
of <hi>Droheda,</hi> (which was strongly fenced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a Chain and severall boates) there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a storme which broke their chaines, and gave our men so free a passage, as with little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie they came safely to the Town. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels were gathered at <hi>Kilshalgham</hi> within seven miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> above two thousand men, where they were setled in a verie strong wood. My Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> carried out part of our Armie, and beat them out of that great strength (for they would not come into the Champaine) and killed above a hundred of them, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable losse of our side, onely Captain <hi>Iames Rochfort,</hi> a most gallant and couragious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This was an act of great braverie, wherein Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> did, (as he doth alwayes) beyond expectation, exposing his person to as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as any man living could; and in truth he is a gallant man, full of courage and good affections, and deserves great incouragement from that side. Our Souldiers are in great want of money, which causes a generall want of all other necessaries, yet notwithstanding God hath infused such courage into them (for undoubtedly it is his work) that they think there is no danger so great, but they may attempt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64009:4"/>Colonell <hi>Munke</hi> is arrived here with my Lord Lieutenants Regiment of fifteen hundred foot, and Sir <hi>Richard Grevill</hi> with neer foure hundred. Horse, which puts much heart into us, and makes us look big upon our neighbours, yet we grieve we cannot be able to releeve our friends in other parts; but I hope when our full succours shall come, we shall not onely defend this place, but adde comfort to our poore distressed friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>The enemy though their numbers be verie great, even beyond beleef, yet their hearts begin to faint, and I beleeve they repent their furious madnesse.</p>
            <p>If my Brother be in <hi>London,</hi> I pray you impart this Letter to him, I would have written to him, but that I thought he was at <hi>Chester,</hi> or in his way thither; By the next he shall hear from me at large, and I shall likewise trouble you.</p>
            <p>I must now onely tell you, that I thank you for your care of those things which concern me, and that I am, Sir, your most affectionate servant,</p>
