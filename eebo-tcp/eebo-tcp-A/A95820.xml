            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat for his oppoſing the illegall Taxes laid by the late King as the Royall Loan Kinghthood money, Coat and Conduct money and
Coſtomes; your Petitioner endured ſeverall Impriſonments and commitments into Cuſtody of many Meſſengers, and to the Marſhal ſeys,
Fleet, and Gatehouſe for about 16 years: Untill the Parliament was to be called, your Petitioner could not be freed out of the Gatehouſe,
and your Petitioners goods being taken away from him, were never reſtored to this day. All which loſſes and ſufferings he endured for the Liberty
of the Subject, ſtill living in hope of a Parliament wherein your Petitioner ſhould be relieved, and accordingly the Parliament referred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of his loſſes to a Committee, upon whoſe report this Honourable Houſe was pleaſed to Vote him 10445 <hi>l. 12 s. 2 d.</hi> for his dammages;
and alſo Voted they would take him into their further conſideration for his Impriſonment and Charges in Suits of Law; of all which your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
hath never had one penny. Beſides there is due to your Petitioner 2591 <hi>l. 17 s. 6 d.</hi> for moneys lent the Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> in their great
ſtraights (as by the Votes of Parliament appears) placed upon the Exciſe with Intereſt, which hath been ſtopped without any cauſe known to your
Petitioner. There is alſo due for one of his Ships ſervice called the <hi>May Flower, 3328 l. 2 s. 7 d.</hi> as appears by the Books of the Treaſurers of the
Navy. Alſo he hath part of three Ships which were in the Service, and are yet unpaid.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prayeth, That this Honourable Parliament will appoint him the money already placed on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
as alſo his money due for the ſervice of his Ship <hi>May Flower,</hi> that he and his Poſterity be not ruinated by their hands, for whoſe
ſakes, and in obedience to whoſe Commands he ventured his life, and utter ruine of his Poſterity; and for that the Parliament was
pleaſed to Vote him, That your Honours will be pleaſed to give him leave to bring in ſo many French wines as the Cuſtome and
Exciſe may pay him, or any other way that your Honours ſhall thinke fit.</p>
