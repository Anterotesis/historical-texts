            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>DOwn in a Cypreſs Grove as I was lying,</l>
               <l>to hear the Nightingals innocent ſong;</l>
               <l>I ſaw a beautious Nymph weeping and crying,</l>
               <l>and beating her breaſt as ſhe walked along:</l>
               <l>She made ſuch complaints that would ſoften a ſtone,</l>
               <l>She made the Grove ring with her pittiful moan.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In this condition a Gallant youth ſpy'd her,</l>
               <l>as like to her he was walking alone;</l>
               <l>He ſo aſtoniſht was when that he ey'd her,</l>
               <l>that he did ſtand like a ſtoek or a ſtone:</l>
               <l>But at laſt he drew nigh, and he ask'd what did grieve her,</l>
               <l>And proffer'd his ſword and his life to relieve her.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Kind ſtranger, ſaid ſhe, O there is no redreſſing</l>
               <l>of my misfortunes but only by death,</l>
               <l>O! if the Heavens would grant me that bleſſing,</l>
               <l>how willingly would I reſign up my breath?</l>
               <l>But ſince I muſt live I will weep till I dye,</l>
               <l>And from all joy, and all comfort will flye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then, ſaid the noble youth, i'le ſit down by you,</l>
               <l>and keep you company in your ſad grief:</l>
               <l>I'le ſigh when you do weep, and never flye you,</l>
               <l>till you can find to your ſadneſs relief:</l>
               <l>Tell me the cauſe of your ſad diſcontent,</l>
               <l>I'le help you for to weep, grieve, and lament.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O then, ſaid ſhe, give ear to my ſad ſtory,</l>
               <l>I was belov'd, and belov'd much too well</l>
               <l>By a moſt beautious youth, he was the glory</l>
               <l>of all man-kind, for he did ſo excell</l>
               <l>In valour and wiſdom, and vertues of mind,</l>
               <l>That the whole world his like could not find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He did love faithfully, for he did languiſh,</l>
               <l>he griev'd and he pined, conſum'd with loves flame,</l>
               <l>And I lov'd him as well, and had great anguiſh,</l>
               <l>to ſee him ſuffer, but I was to blame;</l>
               <l>For I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oy, forſooth, and for to try him,</l>
               <l>I ſeem'd for to ſcorn him to ſlight him and flye him.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>HE came one day, and he told how he lov'd me,</l>
               <l>he threw himſelf down at my feet all in tears;</l>
               <l>He ask'd if his conſtancy had not yet mov'd me,</l>
               <l>at which I ſeem'd for to ſtop my falſe ears:</l>
               <l>O then, ſaid he, ſince I no longer can live,</l>
               <l>I'le dye by your hand if my deaths wound you'l give.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ſo he gave me his ſword for to ſtrike him,</l>
               <l>but I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather have ſtab'd my own heart;</l>
               <l>When I would neither ſtrike, nor ſeem to like him,</l>
               <l>he ſpoke theſe ſad words as from me he did part:</l>
               <l>Since by the hand that I love I can't dye,</l>
               <l>I'le fall by the hand of ſome brave enemy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'le to the wars go, and in bloody battle,</l>
               <l>teach the world how a ſcorn'd lover can fight;</l>
               <l>With Lance and with ſword will I thunder &amp; rattle,</l>
               <l>he fears no death whom his Miſtris does ſlight:</l>
               <l>In the midſt of my foes will I yield up my breath,</l>
               <l>And end my ſad life by a nobler death.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ſo he parted, and I ſeem'd to leave him,</l>
               <l>with great content, but when that he was gone;</l>
               <l>I ſent to call him back, and undeceive him,</l>
               <l>and for to tell him I had lov'd him long:</l>
               <l>But he to Sea was got, for he did hate</l>
               <l>The Country that gave him ſo cruel a fate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I run down to the Shore weeping and wailing,</l>
               <l>and to the waves and the winds I did cry;</l>
               <l>Bring back my love again, for he is ſailing</l>
               <l>from a poor Maid that does languiſh and dye:</l>
               <l>But the Ship ſoon was got out of my ſight,</l>
               <l>And then I fainted and ſwouned out-right.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I ſaw my folly, and curſed my madneſs,</l>
               <l>for which I ever will ſit down and cry;</l>
               <l>And until death i'le perſever in ſadneſs,</l>
               <l>my mournful eyes they ſhall never be dry:</l>
               <l>O hold, ſaid the ſtranger, give me but one kiſs,</l>
               <l>I'le bring back your dear, for I know where he is.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I'de give the world, ſaid ſhe, wer't in my power,</l>
               <l>but ſince it is not, i'le give what I can:</l>
               <l>You'l have him for leſs, ſaid he, this very hour,</l>
               <l>and ſo here take him for I am the Man:</l>
               <l>So into her arms the youth preſently flue,</l>
               <l>She look'd upon him, and found he ſaid true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Nymph ſhe wept for joy, fainted and ſwouned,</l>
               <l>and felt thoſe joys which can ne'r be expreſt;</l>
               <l>Her Lover felt as great, for his heart bounded,</l>
               <l>it leapt and it caper'd almoſt out of's breaſt:</l>
               <l>She wept, and he kiſs'd, and then he did tell</l>
               <l>How he came thither, and what him befell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We ſcarce were got to Sea, when we diſcover</l>
               <l>ſix Turkiſh Ships, ſaid he, all under ſail;</l>
               <l>At which we ſtartled were, but your ſad lover</l>
               <l>perſwaded them for to fight without fail:</l>
               <l>And ſo I ſhot off the challenging Gun,</l>
               <l>And then we all unto battle did run.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I fought like one that all life had deſpized,</l>
               <l>I leapt into one of their Ships all alone;</l>
               <l>I only fought to dye, 'twas death I prized,</l>
               <l>I ſtood them though they were hundreds to one:</l>
               <l>Then our Ships were ſoon ſever'd by wind &amp; by wave</l>
               <l>And I was carry'd away for a ſlave.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then for to work like a beaſt I was forced,</l>
               <l>heavily loaded with an iron chain:</l>
               <l>But my great torment was to be divorſed</l>
               <l>from my beloved, O that was a pain,</l>
               <l>Much greater than ſtripes, than fetters, or gives,</l>
               <l>Than being a ſlave, or loſing of lives.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when that I could no longer endure it,</l>
               <l>away one night from the Turks I did flye;</l>
               <l>Here in your ſight by my death for to cure it,</l>
