            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Too birdes and beasts both wyld and tame, both too and fro agen:</l>

            <l>Before the Sea and Lande were made, and Heauen that all doth hide.</l>
            <l>In all the worlde one onely face of nature did abide,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Chaos</hi> hight, a huge rude heape, and nothing else but euen</l>
            <l>A heauie lump and clottred clod of séedes togither driuen,</l>
            <l>Of things at strife among themselues, for want of order due.</l>
            <l>No sunne as yet with lightsome beames the shapelesse world did vew.</l>
            <l>No Moone in growing did repayre hir hornes with borowed light.</l>
            <l>Nor yet the earth amiddes the ayre did hang by wondrous slight</l>
            <l>Iust peysed by hir proper weight. Nor winding in and out</l>
            <l>Did <hi>Amphitrytee</hi> with hir armes embrace the earth about.</l>
            <l>For where was earth, was sea and ayre, so was the earth vnstable.</l>
            <l>The ayre all darke, the sea likewise to beare a ship vnable.</l>
            <l>No kinde of thing had proper shape, but ech confounded other.</l>

            <l>The moyst with drie, the soft with hard, the light with things of weight.</l>
            <l>This strife did God and Nature breake, and set in order streight.</l>
            <l>The earth from heauen, the sea from earth, he parted orderly,</l>
            <l>And from the thicke and foggie ayre, he tooke the lightsome skie.</l>
            <l>Which when he once vnfolded had, and seuered from the blinde</l>
            <l>And clodded heape. He setting eche from other did them binde</l>

            <l>The substance of the heauen it selfe, bicause it was so light</l>
            <l>Did mount aloft, and set it selfe in highest place of all.</l>
            <l>The second roume of right to ayre, for lightnesse did befall.</l>
            <l>The earth more grosse drew down with it eche weighty kinde of matter,</l>
            <l>And set it selfe in lowest place. Againe, the wauing water</l>
            <l>Did lastly chalenge for his place, the vtmost coast and bound,</l>
            <l>Of all the compasse of the earth, to close the stedfast ground.</l>
            <l>Now when he in this foresaid wise (what God so ere he was)</l>

            <l>And here and there he cast in seas, to whome he gaue a lawe:</l>

            <l>Moreouer, Springs and mighty Méeres and Lakes he did augment,</l>
            <l>And flowing streames of crooked brookes in winding bankes he pent.</l>
            <l>Of which the earth doth drinke vp some, and some with rest lesse race,</l>
            <l>Do séeke the sea: where finding scope of larger roume and space,</l>

            <l>With tender leaues: and stonie hilles to lift themselues on hie.</l>
            <l>And as two Zones doe cut the Heauen vpon the righter side,</l>

            <l>Betwéene these two so great extremes, two other Zones are fixt,</l>

            <l>Against hir sister and the God. And furthermore in fine</l>
            <l>How that the golde which <hi>Mercurie</hi> had giuen hir for hir méede,</l>
            <l>Would make hir both in welth and pride all others to excéede.</l>
            <l>She goes me straight to Enuies house, a foule and irksome caue</l>
            <l>Replete with blacke and lothly filth and stinking like a graue.</l>
            <l>It standeth in a hollow dale where neyther light of Sunne</l>

            <l>And with hir Iauelin point did giue a push against the doore.</l>
            <l>The doore flue open by and by and fell me in the floore.</l>

            <l>It lothde hir to beholde the sight. Anon the Elfe arose</l>
            <l>And left the gnawed Adders flesh, and slouthfully she goes</l>
            <l>With lumpish leysure like a Snayle, and when she saw the face</l>

            <l>She gaue a sigh a sorie sigh from bottome of hir heart.</l>
            <l>Hir lippes were pale, hir chéekes were wan, and all hir face was swart:</l>

            <l>And if they haue, she frettes and fumes within hir minde no lesse</l>

            <l>And worke distresse to other folke, hir selfe she doth destroy.</l>

            <l>And winding from that wicked wight did take hir flight anon.</l>
            <l>The Caitife cast hir eye aside, and séeing <hi>Pallas</hi> gon,</l>

            <l>And as she sate beholding still the King of <hi>Candies</hi> tent,</l>
            <l>She said: I doubt me whether that I rather may lament</l>

            <l>And safely to King <hi>Minos</hi> Tent from this same Turret slide.</l>

            <l>I set my shéeld betwéene him and his foes, and him bestrid:</l>
