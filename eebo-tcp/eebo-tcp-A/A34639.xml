            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so far as to infringe them of their liberty, I cannot well
imagine. For he stood not then in fear of the fiercest, they
having neither will nor power to molest him; neither did
the most shy and wild shun his society: so that he might
have a fair prospect of them, without cooping of them
up, or putting an inclosure about them. Man had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

made of them for Clothing, he then having no need of
it, either for ornament or necessity; nor for Food, for we
suppose him not in that state to have ever prey'd upon any
of them: he was more tempted with the Fruits of the field,
than the Beasts of it; and though he knew his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
would never exercise it in the way of Cruelty. He
knew not then what Death was himself, and therefore we
may suppose him never to have attempted to deprive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in this place: however, I am apt to believe, we now use
a greater cruelty towards them, than we are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;

their Beast.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> Worshipt any thing that was monstrous, as
vast Mountains, cragg'd and precipitous Rocks, over-grown
Trees and Plants; thinking some Divinity in all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
which were not obvious or common. See <hi>Bry</hi>'s
<hi>America.</hi> Things that are great and vehement, people are
subject to suspect they rise from some supernatural cause;
insomuch that the Wind cannot be more than ordinarily
high, but they are prone to imagine the Devil raised it.
So rude Antiquity conceived a kind of Divinity in almost
any thing that was extraordinary great. Whence some
have worshipped very tall Trees, others large Rivers; some
a great Stone or Rock; others, some high and vast Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> confound Great and Holy, in that

the Cedars of God, the Mountains of God, the Spirit of
God, and the like, understand high Cedars, great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and a mighty Spirit or Wind. Dr. <hi>More</hi> in his Tractate

For the novelty and pleasingness of Poetry, did presently
insinuate it self into the minds of Men, and thereby drew
them to a venerable esteem, both of the persons and
practices of those who were the Authors of them. Thus
<hi>Orpheus</hi> was exceedingly acceptable to the people for his
skill in Musick and Poetry; which the <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
were much delighted with: from which arose
the Fable of his drawing Trees and wild Beasts after him,
because his Musick and Musical Poems, had so great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the civilizing that people, who were almost
grown rude through Ignorance and Barbarisme: and so
<hi>Horace</hi> explains it.</p>

            <p>I Consider them at that time to be in a state of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Mankind, but not Captivity: they being no more infringed of their liberty, than those who being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wholesome Laws, may be said to loose their Title of Freemen. I deny not but Man was their Superiour, and had dominion over them; but which way he should have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to exercise that Authority, in his state of Innocence, so far as to infringe them of their liberty, I cannot well imagine. For he stood not then in fear of the fiercest, they having neither will nor power to molest him; neither did the most shy and wild shun his society: so that he might have a fair prospect of them, without cooping of them up, or putting an inclosure about them. Man had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for their service, neither in Peace nor War, neither for Pleasure nor Profit; neither to till the Ground, the Earth yielding all things abundantly, of its own accord; nor yet in War, there being no grounds for enmity in that state of Innocencie; neither for Pleasure, except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There was no use to be made of them for Clothing, he then having no need of it, either for ornament or necessity; nor for Food, for we suppose him not in that state to have ever prey'd upon any of them: he was more tempted with the Fruits of the field, than the Beasts of it; and though he knew his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would never exercise it in the way of Cruelty.

That the World is mixt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,
