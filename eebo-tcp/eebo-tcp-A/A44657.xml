         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been the usuall custom
of Epistles, to give the
Reader an account of the
causes that brought those
writings into publick, that
were onely intended for a
private Closet; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
it has been at the request of friends, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with mingled truth and designe, to prae-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the judgments of many, by telling the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of some, so to preserve their modesty as
much in the pretence, as they could have done in
the concealment of their Writings.</p>
            <p>Though I cannot pretend such a cause as this,
I can yet free my self from that vanity that others
would avoid, by assuring the Reader, I had not
stock of confidence enough to shew these things
privately to many friends, much lesse to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with enough, to make them publick to all
<pb facs="tcp:47341:3"/>
indifferent persons, had not the desires of the
Book-seller prevail'd with me: to whose civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
I believ'd my self so far engag'd, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him nothing that he thought a kindnesse,
which could not be severely prejudiciall to my
self: Yet I doubted not, but that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the censures of many; which, upon the
granted principle of prejudice, appear'd not a
reasonable argument to prevail with me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
his request, since the same should as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
me not to live, for life and conversation
render man in Print more than letters can do;
and is made more publick by that way, than he
can be by this. His life is mingled more with his
defects and passions, than probably his writings
are; and whether they are equall, or exceed
others, need not trouble him that writes: He
may be satisfied, the production of retir'd hours
are the best of himself. I had no great reason
then to deny his request, that imagin'd he ask'd
his own advantage, when he desired nothing
that I believed contrary to mine.</p>
            <p>Yet I wish that it may so far give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all, that they may as little repent the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as I did the writing; whilst in these gentle
studies I found a diversion from greater follies;
and by that comparison they received obliging
natures. Perhaps, there's few that read them, may
<pb facs="tcp:47341:3"/>
not as well be conscious to themselves, to have
spent some time not so innocently; and for that
cause forgive that, which for its own sake they
cannot admire.</p>
            <p>For the severall subjects which here make
one bundle, there is not any of them that have
not layn by me these many years (two or three
copies of Verses onely excepted); and had been
wholly perhaps laid aside, but for the reasons
given, applying my self now to, more serious
studies, according to the severall s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yet I should a little be dissatisfied with my
self to appear publick in his praise, just when he
was visibly restoring to power, did not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

it, and, besides my affirmation, assure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

from the Power; which was about three years
since, when I was Prisoner in <hi>Windsor-Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being the best diversion I could then find for my
own condition; to think, how great his Vertues
were for whom I suffered, though in so small
a measure compar'd to his own, that I
rather blush at it, than believe it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were never directed to any particular
Beauty, which may (to the Amorous Reader
at least) be a just excuse, if they want Perfection,
to remember I wanted Passion, and had onely
my own warmth, unassisted by the influence of
a Mistresse. Nor shall I envy him that writes
better, by being much in love, if he must
purchase the advantage of Wit by the losse of
Freedom.</p>
            <p>For the Translations, the Authors have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received those Characters from the world,
that they need none of mine, especially <hi>Virgil,</hi>
of whose works I have onely publish'd this
one Book, that lay finished by me; not judging
it convenient to perfect those other Books of his
<hi>Aeneid's,</hi> which I have rudely gone through,
having long since laid aside all designes of that
nature; and this little of it rather grew publick
from accident, than designe, the Mingle it had

that it received its share in the publick Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

               <l>AS there is Musick uninform'd by Art</l>

               <l>Who better taught at home, yet please us lesse:</l>
               <l>So in your Verse, a native sweetnesse dwells,</l>
               <l>Which shames Composure, and its Art excells.</l>
               <l>Singing, no more can your soft numbers grace</l>
               <l>Then Paint adds charms unto a beauteous Face.</l>
               <l>Yet as when mighty Rivers gently creep,</l>
               <l>Their even calmnesse does suppose them deep,</l>
               <l>Such is your Muse: no Metaphor swell'd high</l>
               <l>With dangerous boldnesse lifts her to the sky;</l>

to whom they owe</l>
            <l>Their Inspirations, differing as
the times,</l>
            <l>Unhappy Vertues, or successfull
Crimes.</l>
            <l>The greatest Choyce is, where the most Successe</l>
            <l>Makes Fears as great, nor their Ambitions lesse.</l>
            <l>With the Usurped Crowns they strive for Bays;</l>

            <l>Not brought you by Successes or a Throne;</l>

            <l>So much 'tis easier to be Great than Good.</l>
            <l>Which knows no end, or change by human things,</l>
            <l>But like the world (Eternall) whence it springs.</l>
            <l>Greatness is, as forbidden Pleasures are,</l>
            <l>Reach'd by th'impious hands, that will but dare</l>
            <l>Attempt all Crimes, still scorning a retreat:</l>
            <l>Onely the Bad can be unjustly Great.</l>

                     <l>Fierce Lions and wild Tigers to have tam'd.</l>
                     <l>And so <hi>Amphion</hi> with his Harp was fam'd</l>
                     <l>To raise the Theban walls, and at his choice</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So perhaps the Fable arose, from his reducing a savage people to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47341:101"/>
live under a form of Government; and for their safety (than which,
no argument can be more prevalent) perswading them to compasse
in their City with a Wall. And herein, in my opinion, he was
much more judicious than <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who believed the
breasts of valiant Citizens defence enough. And so also thinketh
<hi>Plato, l. 6. De leg.</hi> For these reasons, <hi>Orpheus</hi> was said to have made
wild beasts gentle, and <hi>Amphion</hi> to have moved stones, that is,
men of savage lives, and obdurat natures. <hi>Macrobius</hi> in <hi>Somn. Scip.
l. 2. c.</hi> 3. keepeth closer to the Fable; for setting forth the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Musick, he saith, That from it, the Universall Soul of the
world took its originall; and that by it therefore all men, not onely
the civill, but the barbarous also, are either animated to vertue, or
dissolved into pleasure; <hi>quia anima in corpus defert memoriam Musicae,
cujus in coelo fuit conscia;</hi> Because the soul, though in the body, still
retaineth a memory of that harmony which it enjoyed in heaven.
And hence he conceiveth the Fables of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> had
their Originall. See <hi>Clemens Alexandr. Admonit. ad Gentes,</hi> p. 2.
<hi>Amphion</hi>'s excellency proved his ruine: For contemning <hi>Latona,</hi> by
her revenge he saw all his children slain, and at the last added him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the number. <hi>Sandys Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metam. l.</hi> 6.
<q>
                  <l>For sad <hi>Amphion</hi> wounding his own breast,</l>
                  <l>Had now his sorrow with his soul releast.</l>

            <p>13. <hi>Trojan Swain</hi>] This <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>title is usually given to <hi>Paris,</hi> by reason
he was brought up among the shepheards. The story is thus, <hi>Hecuba</hi>
being great with <hi>Paris,</hi> dreamed, she should bring forth a flame
that should consume <hi>Troy, Cic. l, 1. de divinat.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Priam</hi>
consulted the Oracle; and being told, his Queen should bear a son,
who should be the Incendiary of his Country, he gave order the
child should be destroyed. But <hi>Hecuba</hi> desirous to preserve her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
conveyed him to mount <hi>Ida</hi> to be bred up among the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.
Where at length, being grown up, he pretended love to
<hi>Oenone,</hi> and made every Tree witnesse of his Amours; as the Nymph
is made to complain by <hi>Ovid</hi> in her Epistle to <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>His casting off this Nymph was occasioned by the three goddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
repairing to him, about determining their controversie, as <hi>Oenone</hi>
in the following Verses complaineth. Each goddesse endeavoured
to bribe the Judge, <hi>Iuno,</hi> by promising him Empire, <hi>Pallas,</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<hi>Venus,</hi> Pleasure. This last was pronounced the rairest, and
went away with the golden Apple: And in requitall, she directeth
her Umpire to receive his promised reward in the fair <hi>Helen:</hi> Whom
having seen he loved, and ravished from <hi>Sparta,</hi> where he had been
kindly entertained. <hi>Coluthus</hi> and others say, He had her consent;
but <hi>Seneca, Troad. v.</hi> 917. bringeth her on the Stage excusing her
self, by pleading Enforcement: And <hi>Gorgias,</hi> in his defence of <hi>Helen,</hi>
saith, <hi>Venus</hi> commanded her to suffer the Trojan to enjoy her.
Others say, that <hi>Paris</hi> being sent to demand <hi>Hesione,</hi> the daughter
of <hi>Laomedon,</hi> whom <hi>Hercules</hi> had carried from <hi>Troy,</hi> had order given
him, That, in case the Greeks resused to deliver her, he should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
from them whatsoever considerable Lady he could light on. So
<hi>Dares Phrygius,</hi> who reporteth also, That <hi>Antenor</hi> was first sent to
fetch home <hi>Hesione,</hi> but returned without her; and that all the
Grecian Princes deny'd to make any satisfaction. Yet that <hi>Hector</hi>'s
advice was not to revenge the Rape, by warring against their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Confederates. And that afterwards <hi>Paris</hi> having received that
encouragement from <hi>Venus,</hi> undertook the Voyage; and, by chance,
arrived at the Island <hi>Cythera,</hi> at a time when <hi>Helen</hi> was there, in a
Town bearing her name: Who had no sooner heard of the Trojan
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47341:102"/>
Prince's arrivall, but she had a desire to see him: And so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both enamoured of one another, <hi>Paris</hi> took her that night after
his arrivall, out of <hi>Venus</hi> Temple, and brought her with him to
<hi>Troy.</hi> And thus he proved that Fire-brand his mother dreamed of,
kindling a flame that burnt <hi>Troy</hi> to ashes.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Laconian.</hi>] The Poets word is <hi>Oebalio,</hi> from <hi>Oebalus</hi> a King
of <hi>Laconia,</hi> a region of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> bordering on <hi>Messenia, Argia,</hi>
and <hi>Arcadia, Strabo lib. 8. Pausanias, in Arcadicis,</hi> saith, it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from part of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> by the River <hi>Alpheus.</hi> In this Country,
stood <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> on the West side of <hi>Eurotas,</hi> beneath the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Taygetus: Strabo, l. 8. Polybius, lib.</hi> 5. But the proper name
of the City was <hi>Sparta; Lacedaemon</hi> being more commonly used for
the Province, so called from a King of that name, who sometimes
reigned there, and married <hi>Sparta</hi> the daughter of <hi>Eurotas,</hi> whose
name the City received. To the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Ionathan</hi> High
Priest of the Jews wrote a Letter; saying, <hi>It was found in writing,
that the Lacedaemonians and the Iewes were brethren, and that they
were of the stock of Abraham,</hi> 1 Macc. 12. 21. <hi>Ioseph, Antiq. l. 13. c.</hi> 8.</p>

him into this Sea; Others alledge different reasons, but none worth

there prostitute her body to any one that would throw her down a
piece of mony, which was to be given to the Temple, and to the
honor of the goddesse. The manner was for the women to sit down
in the Temple, distinguished by little lines or cords, which he that
had a mind might take away, or break, if the woman seemed coy,
and so take the strumpet out of the Temple into a by-corner. This
is expressed in the Epistle ascribed to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> at the end of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

aime, than to set forth the praises of his <hi>Achilles,</hi> as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the envy of the gods. But I have observed <hi>Statius</hi> to be a
great imitator of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who was still wont to omit no occasion
of interwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning his Learning with his Poetry: wherein <hi>Macrobius</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:47341:110"/>
strongly justifieth him. Since these words therefore will afford it, I
hold it not amisse to interpret them to the more learned sense.</p>
            <p>There was a generall Tradition among the Heathen, That the
gods envied any perfection or happinesse in Mankind. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Devill's policy, who from the beginning of the
world endeavoured to represent God envious unto Man, in that he
denied him the knowledge of good and evill; as <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Diodate</hi>
observe on <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Learned <hi>Merick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asaubon,</hi> in his <hi>Cause of temporall
Evills,</hi> saith, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> sets down this opinion, <hi>That God is</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but protesteth against it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should be so;</hi> yet saith, That if it were so indeed, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God could be envious, that Envy must needs consist in his
denying of men the happinesse of certain knowledge and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.
That impious Philosopher <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> directly chargeth
God with envy, for forbidding the Tree of Knowledge: Who is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by Greg. Nazianzen, <hi>Orat.</hi> 38. Such impious men perhaps
take offence at <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22, 23. I forbear to produce further. Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
to prove, there was such an opinion among the Heathen,
I do not think them needfull; since it is certain, the Devill would
let slip no occasion of raising prejudice against God, and charging
him with his own crime. <hi>Through envy of the Devill came death into
the world,</hi> Wisd. 2. 24. It was the Devil's envy that made Man
lose Paradise, and not God, who placed him in it. Another reason
why the gods were conceived to envy men, was, Because all their
prosperity and happinesse, is at length required with crosses and
calamity. Examples of such change are frequent in all times:
Among all, scarce is there any more notable then that of the once-Great

            <p>Another instance of the mutability of Fortune, was that great
Souldier, <hi>Hannibal;</hi> whose prophetick spirit was sensible of this,
almost fatall, necessity: as we may see in that incomparable speech,
which <hi>Livy</hi> maketh him speak to <hi>Scipio;</hi> advising <hi>not to trust the

<hi>Fortune had never yet deceived him.</hi> Thus he spake to move his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to accept peace, conceiving no argument of more force, then
the consideration of the vicissitude of human affairs. And his
words, though then flighted, <hi>Scipio</hi> himselfe afterwards found true,
and had sad experience, both of the inconstancy of Fortune, and
of the ingratitude of his Country. To these, I might adde the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

was a custom among the Grecians, to sing the praises of their

saith, They were wont to sing the praises of their gods, while the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

And that, after Supper, the Harp was wont to be played on;
Which when <hi>Themistocles</hi> refused to take in hand, he was for that

10. 9. And this is the reason why some held <hi>Bacchus</hi> the same with
<hi>Pluto, Pluto enim defunctorum animas venatur &amp; captat.</hi> Bacchus was
also called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>an Hind's Calf,</hi> because himself
and his frantick adorers were usually clad with Stags skins. This
also hath relation to <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s being termed <hi>an Hunter:</hi> And <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
sheweth <hi>Nimrod</hi> and <hi>Nebrod</hi> to be all one. <hi>Bacchus</hi> was said to
be born of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s thigh: Now some will not have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to signifie
<hi>a thigh,</hi> but to be the name of an Hill where he was born, by <hi>Nysa</hi>
in <hi>India;</hi> so Mela, <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 7. and Plinie, <hi>lib. 6. cap.</hi> 21. Others
conceive, it signifieth <hi>the side</hi> of a mountain, as <hi>Iudg</hi> 19. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>in the thighs, or sides, of mount Ephraim.</hi> And
2 King. 19. 23. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>to the thighs,</hi> or <hi>sides, of Libanus.</hi>
So perhaps Bacchus was said to be born out of his father's thigh,
because he was born on the side of some mountain, not that of
<hi>India.</hi> But I much rather believe this part of the Fable arose from
mistake of the originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>femur,</hi> that is, <hi>the thigh,</hi> or <hi>the
leg,</hi> which the Scripture useth for a modest expression of the place
of generation, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> teacheth on <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. where he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth
also the words, [<hi>from between his feet</hi>] to signifie his posterity.
Gen. 46. 26. it is said, <hi>All the souls that came with Iacob into Egypt,
which came out of his loins,</hi> &amp;c. And Exod. 1. 5. <hi>All the souls which

<hi>thigh,</hi> as the Marginall Notes in our Bibles shew. And
learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> saith, the Phoenician words, which properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>the thigh,</hi> signifie also the generating parts. Thus <hi>Bacchus his

that it may appear most reasonable, to apply this worship to the

to be thought on, 1. That the Devill no sooner fell from Heaven,

2. That he found, all men would be apt to adore most, what they
knew here, and from which they received most benefit; Which
was the sole reason, that <hi>Plato</hi> and other Heathens give for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Heroes. And in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> there being none
besides him and his sons to leave beneficiall directions for the
succeeding age, it is likely, that they were the first, who, by the
Devil's means, were worshipped as Heroes: To whose worship,
the Daemons joyned their own. That their worships were the same,

for the deceased; which grew a part of the religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we read, <hi>Lev. 19. 28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh
for the dead.</hi> So <hi>Lev. 21. 5. They shall not make baldnesse on their
heads, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.</hi> This cutting off hair, we
find often an expression of sorrow among the antient Poets; And
its being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orbidden by God, is a plain Demonstration, that it was

               </gap>dolatrous worship of Daemons or <hi>Heroes.</hi> Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it was used onely, for an expression of sorrow, See <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 37.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47341:141"/>
with knives and lancers, till the blood gushed out upon them.</hi> Thus
have we seen the worship of of Baal or Jove; that is, Cham or
Ham the son of <hi>Noah;</hi> Whose ill mind, it is probable, was easily
enticed by Spirits, to cause himself to be worshipped when dead.
We shall find his son Bacchus to have had no other rites but those
of his. I will not stand to dispute when Bacchus lived, whom Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens

down the reasons of learned <hi>Vossius,</hi> who saith he was Moses. This
would be too large a field to walk over, and at this time not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to my purpose. I will onely shew, that his worship was the same
with that of Daemons or Heroes, as Baal's or Jove's was. First, it
will not be amisse to take notice, that Bacchus had the title of
<hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And, by the way, this perhaps was the cause why in these
rites they used to be crowned with Ivy: This, being always young
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perhaps these sad ceremonies of wounding themselves, were by some

<hi>Bacchus.</hi> Thus have I made it appear, that the worship of Bacchus
was exactly the same with his father Jupiter's, and both no other
than that of Heroes and Daemons. And herein was there an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the worshippers of the true God, as may be gathered from
<hi>Ier. 41. 5. There came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and
from Samaria, even fourscore men, having th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their
hand, to bring them to the house of the Lord.</hi> And because the Lord
saw that this would be converted to Daemon-worship, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perhaps forbidden in the above-quoted places of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and
<hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
            <p>254. <hi>Doth not Sperchios.</hi>] A river in Thessalie, to which <hi>Peleus</hi>

But I read of no such custom. I have rather given an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this in the precedent Note, where I shewed, that
the cutting off of hair was a sacred ceremony, performed to Heroes
or Daemons. And no River antiently being thought to be without a

But, that the Romans and the Greeks were wont for expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their grief, to let their hair grow, and onely their women to
shave theirs. Hence it appeareth, that the Antients thought it the
greatest expression of grief to take away those Ornaments, which
they preserved in conditions of better satisfaction. That which he
saith of the Greeks, is to be understood of the later Greeks, who, by
letting their hair grow long, did expresse an alteration from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
And because that could be no expression in women, they still

times, it hath been usuall to neglect our selves, when the World
or Fortune have seemed unkind to us, letting our hair grow to
rudenesse and undecency, quitting vanity upon no other cause but
misfortune, nor ceasing to care for our selves, till Fortune appear
carelesse of us.</p>

the Temble of Janus, which in Peace was ever shut, and
open in War. From <hi>Ianus</hi> the gates of any private house
were called <hi>Januae.</hi> The gates of Janus were shut but twice
before the time of Augustus. <hi>Ianum Quirinum semel atque

Suetonius, <hi>in Augusto, c.</hi> 22. That is, The Temple of Janus,
from the beginning of the City, was but twice shut before the
reign of Augustus; but in his reign, in a much lesser space,
he being at peace with all the world, it was thrice shut. The
first time it was shut was in the reign of Numa Pompilius;
The second, when T. Manlius Torquatus, and Attilius Balbus
were Consuls: but it was opened again (as many say) the
same year, and so continued till Augustus. Perhaps <hi>Rome</hi>'s
not enjoying peace was not the least cause of its prosperity.
For in troublous times, mens endeavours commonly are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the publick safety, but pursue private interests in
times of peace and idlenesse; so hard it is to make true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of God's greatest blessings. Augustus first sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Antonie; Himself the fifth time, and Sextus Apuleius being
Consuls. Four years after he shut it the second time, M. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Silanus being Consul with him. The third time he shut
it was about the time of our Saviour <hi>CHRIST,</hi> the Prince of
peace. The next time we read of its being shut, was, when
Nero, and Valerius Messala, were Consuls, <hi>Anno V. C.</hi>
DCCCXI. which Tacitus and Orosius reckon not, because
Nero shut it upon no just grounds. So Suetonius in his life,
<hi>Ianum geminum clausit tam nullo quam residuo bello;</hi> which Faer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
readeth, <hi>Tanquam nullo residuo bello:</hi> that is, <hi>He shut the
