            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The Ocean of her fish; for e're a Swabber</l>

               <l>Kenn'd Storms far off, knew whether they had more</l>
               <l>A mind to come to Sea, or stay a shore:</l>
               <l>But to be short, and plain, he knew as well</l>
               <l>The Sea, as Beggar doth his Dish, cou'd tell</l>
               <l>What the least Cockle did in's shell, and guess</l>
               <l>How many arms length where 'twas bottomless;</l>
               <l>Such was the man for sway, you'l think him now</l>
               <l>Worthy as Roman newly ta'ne from Plow:</l>
               <l>Yet know his praises I have not begun,</l>
               <l>Fine Gentleman <hi>Leander</hi> was his Son,</l>
               <l>With whose most gen'rous inclination he</l>
               <l>To's cost (few Fathers doe so) did agree,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101711:4"/>
And bound him Prentice to a worthy Barber,</l>
               <l>The best, not such another in the harbour,</l>
               <l>Unless our poor <hi>Leander</hi> had liv'd to't</l>
               <l>Most probable opinion to confute.</l>
               <l>He was so handy, nimble, tight, so neat</l>
               <l>In's person, and his implements compleat:</l>
               <l>His Towels, like his skin, were white, and fine,</l>
               <l>Nought but his face his bason could out-shine;</l>
               <l>So pickt, so wash't his Combes of Ivory,</l>
               <l>Unless his teeth their whiteness nought came nigh,</l>
               <l>With others that were made of horn, or box,</l>
               <l>He often wou'd compare his golden locks;</l>
               <l>With whom (if none had too much beard) he'd play,</l>
               <l>And innocently sport out half the day;</l>
               <l>But when you did sit down, with such a grace</l>
               <l>Handled your throat, your ears, your nose, your face,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101711:5"/>
Tickled where others pain; Maids who did eye him</l>
               <l>Wish'd themselves Satyrs to be trimmed by him:</l>
               <l>Cou'd dive into the channels of your brain,</l>
               <l>And with a feat dexterity make plain</l>
               <l>The passage, though before 'twas nere so rough,</l>
               <l>Yet with less pain to you, then taking snuff;</l>
               <l>For he wore nails as long as bill of Bittern,</l>
               <l>For that to scrape teeth, and to play on Cittern;</l>
               <l>Nay he had all good qualities, cou'd tye</l>
               <l>A Cuff-String, or Crevat so jantyly:</l>
               <l>With all had conscience, and for copper spanker</l>
               <l>Wou'd make Sea-faring beard look like an anchor.</l>
               <l>For's mettle, and agility, with which</l>
               <l>Writers are bound their Heroes to inrich;</l>
               <l>I must confess I can't say much, but know</l>

For throwing of the Bar he never car'd,</l>
               <l>Cudgels, nor wrestling, that I ever heard,</l>
               <l>Or any brutish sports, which make men wrangle;</l>
               <l>On Holy-days he went alone to angle;</l>
               <l>Lov'd swimming well, and swam like any Duck;</l>
               <l>But where most skill there ever is least luck:</l>
               <l>And Arts, like women after a long wooing,</l>
               <l>Oft shame our industry, and prove undoing.</l>

Whereat <hi>Leander</hi> once more did look big,</l>

               <l>While she with Court'sie said, no one exact is</l>

But wou'd endeavour to please you alone,</l>

               <l>With that she pump'd some tears into her eyes,</l>

               <l>Therefore took out crack'd Groat from Purse of Leather,</l>

And then with single Knuckle; and no more,</l>

               <l>For on Love-Errands oft she made her trudge,</l>
               <l>Indeed, she was an honest careful Drudge,</l>
               <l>Loves painful Char-woman, and ever did</l>
               <l>Help on all Bawdy work in time of need.</l>
               <l>When she had let <hi>Leander</hi> in, she made him</l>
               <l>Pull off his Shoes ere she to <hi>Hero</hi> led him:</l>
               <l>For by the door of <hi>Hero</hi>'s Mothers Chamber</l>
               <l>To <hi>Hero</hi>'s Garret he was bound to clamber.</l>

That of four or five steps, he made but one,</l>

To which, <hi>Hero,</hi> and he were both beholden,</l>
               <l>For modest Lover it did soon embolden,</l>
               <l>To take her by the sweaty hand, and sip</l>
               <l>Far stronger Nectar from her Blabber-Lip.</l>
               <l>And when she had made him drink off his rest,</l>
               <l>He cou'd begin a Brimmer to the Best.</l>
               <l>But subtle <hi>Hero</hi> in her over-tunning</l>
               <l>Of empty Lover, was but over-cunning.</l>
               <l>For quite contrary to her wise intent,</l>
               <l>All she tunn'd up in him had a false Vent.</l>
               <l>Indeed she made him ready for the Bed,</l>
               <l>And had the Drunkards sport to hold his head,</l>
               <l>But she unfortunate, meant something else,</l>
               <l>And ere she was aware, o're-turn'd the Bells;</l>
               <l>So oflewd expectation quite did miss,</l>
               <l>As now chaste Reader doth I'm sure, of his.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:101711:35"/>
But be not angry, ere Cock-crowing season,</l>
               <l>To you, and <hi>Hero</hi> too I'll see done reason.</l>
               <l>But let her put <hi>Leander</hi> first to Bed,</l>
               <l>And on Flock-Pillow rest Lop-heavy Head;</l>
               <l>Then fit it with a Coifin stead of Cap,</l>
               <l>Tuck up the Cloaths in order to his Nap,</l>
               <l>And then let her a while but pick her Toes,</l>
               <l>And Lamp goes out, and into Bed she goes.</l>
               <l>Then (as I told you) ere the Cock crow'd thrice</l>
               <l>And <hi>Hero</hi> had piss'd once, <hi>Leander</hi> twice,</l>
               <l>(But forward Sir, pray do not now mistake)</l>
               <l>Did yawn, and stretch, and civilly awake</l>
               <l>At the first Summons of her Elbow, which</l>
               <l>On purpose lent his side a plaguie stitch.</l>
               <l>Then did he puff, and belch, and sigh, and groan,</l>
               <l>And to the Gods make lamentable moan:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101711:36"/>
But <hi>Hero</hi> for her sake took pity on him,</l>
               <l>Did stroak him, feel his Pulses, and bemoan him,</l>
               <l>And charitably too his Stomack settle,</l>
               <l>By help of Life-restoring Pewter Bottle:</l>
               <l>So by her Aid, Directions, and Dalliance,</l>
               <l>As well's he cou'd he made out's new Alliance.</l>
               <l>But spiteful Jade <hi>Aurora</hi> strait intruding,</l>
               <l>There was an end then of the Secret Wedding:</l>
               <l>And glad <hi>Leander</hi> in such hast arose,</l>
               <l>That out of Bed he tumbled on his Nose;</l>
               <l>And for his own Stockings put on <hi>Hero</hi>'s:</l>
               <l>Fate's still contriving Lovers to disclose.</l>
               <l>Nor staid to wash his stinking hands, or put on</l>
               <l>His Azure Band, or Shamey Doublet button:</l>
               <l>But with a Kiss took leave of his dear Bride,</l>
               <l>Resolving for her not to lose his Tide;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:101711:36"/>
For from the Shore was heard thrice, <hi>Eastward hol</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And with his Towns-folkes he was mad to go:</l>
               <l>So lost no time; but while he was let out,</l>
               <l>To the old Nurse made this true Lovers doubt,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Hero</hi> wou'd procure her self some <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who many a good time and oft wou'd bounce her</l>
               <l>Ere he shou'd get o'th' t'other side 'oth' water.</l>
               <l>To which she said Fie, Fie man, no such matter.</l>
               <l>Though heavy Judgments fall upon ye, you men</l>
               <l>Will never leave your base thoughts of poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</l>
               <l>But time will come (and she or none cou'd tell,</l>
               <l>For she in Magick Art had devilish skill,</l>
               <l>And on a Col-staff oft had gall'd her Breech,</l>
               <l>Was tri'd, and got off'cause she was a Witch)</l>
               <l>When all men shall for something be afraid,</l>
               <l>And for your Jealoufie be soundly paid.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:101711:37"/>
When Love incens'd, won't tyrannize alone</l>
               <l>In Lovers heart (as now he doth) but bone:</l>
               <l>When Lover for his Miss obtain'd shall groan,</l>
               <l>And through a single Nostril tune his moan:</l>
               <l>And jealous man shall envy happy Brute,</l>
               <l>Who without fear, or shame does go to Rut.</l>
               <l>To this <hi>Leander</hi> nothing cou'd reply,</l>
               <l>For Prophesies must give themselves the Lie.</l>
               <l>But Pox upon her soul for her Record,</l>
               <l>All the World knows she was as good's her word.</l>
               <l>She wou'd have farther spun the Pockey Riddle,</l>
               <l>But Youth in hast did break't off in the middle,</l>
               <l>And left her, and Town <hi>Sestus</hi> 'till dark night,</l>
               <l>When he was to return by Candle-light;</l>
               <l>The same that was as Sea-light in that Entry</l>
               <l>Where marking <hi>Hero</hi> in the Bar sate Centry;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:101711:37"/>
As he, and <hi>Hero</hi> had contriv'd, was his</l>
               <l>To keep him in his way where no path is.</l>
               <l>And by her means he did not run aground,</l>
               <l>But in the right Port whither he was bound</l>
               <l>Unladed safe, and sound his precious Stowage,</l>
               <l>And made (as Folkes do say) a happy Voyage,</l>
               <l>Nay some (at least) say half a dozen, but</l>
               <l>Dame Fortune first, or last, doth prove a Slut.</l>
               <l>She did contest with the more faithless wind,</l>
               <l>Which should be more false to him, or unkind,</l>
               <l>For in the Window of vex'd <hi>Hero</hi>'s Garret</l>
               <l>Five or six long Watch-lights in vain did blare out,</l>
               <l>Ere he cou'd put to Sea; and when he did,</l>
               <l>It had been better he at home had staid.</l>
               <l>But though the huffing surly Winds did nose him,</l>
               <l>And strutting Billows crowded to oppose him,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:101711:38"/>
From's Mistress he no longer wou'd be kept,</l>
               <l>But like a drunken Heroe headlong leapt</l>
               <l>Amidst his Foes, resolving to come at her,</l>
               <l>Though Seas on Seas were set, and hills of Water</l>
               <l>On watry hills to intercept his course;</l>
               <l>But Death old-fashion'd Lovers can't divorce.</l>
               <l>As Reader (if you've any patience) you</l>
               <l>Too soon, too soon, alas, alas! shall know:</l>
               <l>But Gossip first I know you wou'd be prying</l>
               <l>Into the manner of our Lovers dying:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Leander</hi> wou'd not give his head for th' washing</l>
               <l>You may be sure, nor was afraid of Dashing:</l>
               <l>He cuff'd the Waves aside, and through did break</l>
               <l>His way, in spight of Northern Blubber-Cheek;</l>
               <l>Mean while ('tis said) they made e'ne nothing of him,</l>
               <l>And while he puff'd, and sputtred, did but scoffe him.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:101711:38"/>
And as in Blanket you wou'd toss a Whelp,</l>
               <l>Tost him, while he no more himself cou'd help.</l>
               <l>And though he sprawl'd, and kept on going still,</l>
               <l>It was, as one may say, e'ne but up hill.</l>
               <l>So to his Oars of Flesh such chearing words,</l>
               <l>Was fain to use, as Errants to their Swords;</l>
               <l>And told them, if they wou'd row stoutly on,</l>
               <l>They shou'd embrace his naked Miss anon.</l>
               <l>But finding soon that Harangue prov'd but idle,</l>
               <l>He turn'd his Stile, the wind and waves to whedle:</l>
               <l>And vow'd if they wou'd please but to reprieve him</l>
               <l>From drowning 'till he came back, he'd forgive 'um.</l>
               <l>But Fate whose slaves they were, cou'd not be chous'd,</l>
               <l>For all his Vows he still was soundly dous'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:101711:39"/>
Yet sneering Fate but to augment her sport,</l>
               <l>Permitted him almost to touch his Port.</l>
               <l>So Tyrant Puss of Mouse does make a Fool,</l>
               <l>And let's him get again half into's hole.</l>
               <l>But then <hi>Leanders</hi> time was come, when Lamp</l>
               <l>Went out, or when his left Leg had the Cramp.</l>
               <l>For he so much in Love was you may see,</l>
               <l>He quite forgot a String about his Knee,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hero</hi> mean while who in her Bed had tost</l>
               <l>As much as he at Sea had, or almost.</l>
               <l>For she had dream'd of Flowers all the night,</l>
               <l>Shrewd sign that some body is to turn Spright.</l>
               <l>So weary of her Dreams, awak'd and rose;</l>
               <l>But some say she awak'd ta'ne by the Nose</l>
               <l>With the rude Haut-Goust of deceased Lamp,</l>
               <l>Which <hi>Omen</hi> seiz'd her heart with pannick Damp</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:101711:39"/>
For her Sweet-heart, but ah! when she did hear</l>
               <l>The Winds and Sea so loud, she was past fear,</l>
               <l>And by her croaking bowels then cou'd tell</l>
               <l>(Were he at Sea) all with him was not well,</l>
               <l>So grown impatient, to the Window flew,</l>
               <l>And from her Eye-lids proking off the Glew,</l>
               <l>Into the boiling water fell a staring,</l>
               <l>Where she perceiv'd her dear Duck dead as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</l>
               <l>But Day but just had shewn her Scarlet Snout,</l>
               <l>So she had time for comfortable doubt,</l>
               <l>And took her poor <hi>Leander</hi> for a Whale;</l>
               <l>But prying to find out the proof of's Tail,</l>
               <l>She out of Window thrust her self so far,</l>
               <l>That Tiptoes slipt, and ere she was awar</l>
               <l>(Some do dispute it though) she tipt clean over</l>
               <l>Into the Brine upon her pickled Lover.</l>
               <l>

Now hasty Lover do not damn the River,</l>
               <l>Which though a while true Lovers it did sever,</l>
               <l>Yet did unite 'um afterward for ever.</l>
