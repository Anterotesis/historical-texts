         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the courſe is broken of at <hi>Terahs</hi> death: and ſoone after a new order is taken: how many dayes or monethes after I dare not diſcuſſe. But preſently thence in the narration, from the promiſe of Chriſt the Epoche goeth: and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> age is tolde what it was then: which can not be exactly gathered, how from his fathers age it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: as the Learned caſt all from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Charans</hi> byrth, at <hi>Terahs</hi> ſeuentyeth yeere exactly. From the perigrination vpon the promiſe of Chriſt, vnto the Lambe, the yeeres are to the very day: and lykewyſe thence to the Temple: what day of what yeere from the Lambe it was buylt: in what yeere of the king the buylder, and how long he reigned: and how long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diuiſion, euen to what day of what moneth it was brent, for idolatry. Then the exact accompt for day and moneth is not layde downe, though the whole Captiuity be recorded for the iuſt yeeres: VVhen it is ended, thence a new, vpon a rare occaſion, to a rare man, by an Angel, the <note n="*" place="margin">Ieruſalemy in Roſh haſhana.</note> onely of any created that hath a proper name of Angel, the tyme is pared out in a rare phraſe of ſpeach, vnto the death of Chriſt, our ſauiour, vnto the very tyme of the euenyng offeryng, when he offered vp him ſelfe. The ſpeach and the matter is ſo heauenly and precious, that as of olde tyme that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was openly read of all the Iewes, and knowen of all the Eaſt: (it doubtles <hi>Ioſephus</hi> meant. <hi>bell.

So all the worlde from their Childhood ſhould read it, and all the learned ſhoulde ſtyll reduce the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto it, and expounde the olde Teſtament by it.
<pb facs="tcp:17078:3"/>
For it is the abridgement of the New, and the key of the Olde. The ſtate after our Lordes death, is called A new Heauen: And his death ended the laſt <hi>Olam,</hi> or Iubilee, or yet the later part of the olde worlde: as that part before the flood is tearmed of <hi>S.

Certaine obſeruations I haue writted for this ſpace, regiſtred by the wyſedome of God: to keepe the holy text in his natiue cleareneſſe, agaynst entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of Iewes and Gentiles. I coulde wyſh the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of <hi>Daniels</hi> wit. For the matter is worthy. And that which my paynes coulde breede, I was deſirous to commende to your Lordſhyp. Some remembrance I woulde leaue, how much I am beholdyng to your Honour: though none writes in a Calender all good thinges done to him. Of your Lordſhyp I may ſay out of<note n="‡" place="margin">Odyſſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Homer,</hi> that you haue been vnto me, as a father to the ſonne: and I wyll neuer forget that tenderyng. I founde many honourable Patrons, but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyps charges were the greatest. The Archbyſhop of Canterburies grace was the meanes, ſone after my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Cambridge in my young yeeres, to procure me a continuall profesſion of Homers tongue: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon with al ſpeede, the rest of my ſucceſſe proceeded, vntyll Sir VValter Mildmayes Lecture in Greeke, with the gyft of ſix Scholerſhyps as I woulde, and his fatherlike fauour, better encoraged my paynes. And I ſhoulde iniury all the Gouernoures of Cambridge, yf I woulde not acknowledge continuall ſinguler cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing: and one poynt in offering, whether Lecture I woulde of <hi>Iapheth</hi> and <hi>Sems</hi> chiefe tongues. But there
<pb facs="tcp:17078:4"/>
to me your Lordſhyps charges was fiue and twentie times more then the priuate Greeke profesſion, and about ten tymes the Value of a Felowſhyp by yeere. The greateſt alowance that any Noble man graunted any Scholer. So great a deſire you had that my paineful and chargeful race of ſtudy, which you iudged by your experience able to go through the pikes agaynſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errours, ſhoulde there haue practiſe and tryall. And when good deſart, and the beſt then, taken in hand vpon graue requeſt, and orderly vſed, was leaſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and worſt recompenced in all mens ſight, by a good mans errour, not of yll wyl, yet ſo that you heard, and hundreths more ſaw an iniury: the ſame alowance you continued to my priuate labour: VVhereby my Greeke tranſlation of the Hebrew Prophetes was wrought. That diligence calling all East and VVest forces of study togeather, Hebrew, Babylonian, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Syrian, Arabian, &amp; al together mixt in the Cabala: Greekes of all ſortes, Latines of all ſortes, all (vſed ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) ſeruantes to the Temple: That diligence made me enterpriſe the Herculean labour of the Harmony. I thinke you remember D. Penyes cenſure vttered to your Lordſhyp, of the Table, entituled, <hi>A Sinay ſight,</hi> how by conference in thoſe poyntes, he thought that he learned the whole frame of the Bible, better then by all his Englyſh and foraine paynes, and conference: and that one yeere vpon ſuch tryed groundes, woulde doe more then ten from the common courſe. The learned D. tolde me what he told your Lordſhyp, to harten me, agaynst the buſy: but hartened already enough by rare olde tendering. I muſt heere craue leaue of a further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresſion, to leaue a memoriall of tenderyng ſhewed to my young studies. For as ſone as I coulde be Graduate,
<pb facs="tcp:17078:4"/>
vpon ſodayne diſputations in the Greke tongue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the readieſt of the ancient Maiſters came to reply, &amp; many were encoraged to the tongue: worde was ſent me, that I ſhould chooſe where I woulde be Felow. I chooſe to be, where firſt an election was: euen foure dayes after I was eligible, and to that Colledge I was choſen: a Colledge which regarded learnyng as much as any coulde. Some partes of a reuerent man, the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Maiſter Shepheard I can not omit. He, when I ſtoode to be Felow: At the election, tolde, that he woulde haue no ſtranger but one: and eyther him, or no election, and ſoone had a generall conſent. And thence ſoone I was allured to Chriſtes Coledge, to be Sir Walter Mildmaydes profeſſour. M. Shepheard perceauing that, to ſtay me, founde meanes to doble the alowance for all the Felowes. This I did not know vntyll I departed thence: and the nyght before the election, ſent for all the Seniores, and me, to ſupper, and mooued them to promiſe out of their alowance, and doble from his, all, doble to my Felowſhyp. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not to goe from them. On the morow I went to thanke the other Colledge for their good wyll. They taking in griefe that I ſhoulde refuſe their ſuch willing fauour, requeſted me one thing: onely to be admitted with them, and after to choſe. I not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng how admisſion to one houſe, did cut off the right of an other, was content: but with theſe wordes: I proteſt it is agaynſt my wyl, onely to ſatisfie your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The admisſion being done, the learned man D. Still (now reuerent Byſhop) ſayd, S. Iohns is loſt. M. Shepheard hearing of it, was ſicke for griefe, as many did report, and tolde for whom he toke all the paynes to amende the Felowſhyps: yet hearing how I prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
<pb facs="tcp:17078:5"/>
and was deceaued, ſent to the Viſitor the Byſhop of Ely to expound the Law, whether it were an admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when the admitted ſayth, it is agaynſt his wyl. He reſolued the admisſion lawful, and my place loſt with them. Then they offered to choſe me anew. That I refuſed: But promiſed to eſteeme of their good wyl, as much as yf I came to vſe their fauour. I aſked them, why they ſhould ſo much regarde my young ſtudy, of foure yeres? They ſaid: ſuch a courſe of making Ebrew and Greeke as natiue in yeres ſo young (at 20. of age) wyll twelue yeeres hence doe that with eaſe, which all our paynes can not come by. And yf publike cheriſhyng encorage: I muſt teſtifie, that my actes there were ſo accepted of the Ancient, that none euer could take more delight in paſtime, then their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation myght make delyght in ſtudying. Of mine owne ſucceſſe, will let others iudge: friendes deſartes, I may write into a Calender: which alſo ſtirred yours. For, to returne to your Lordſhyps fauour: My labour was bred vp by your Lordſhips charges: I meane the laſt tyme of it: and vpon it, the trauell in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Scripture: which I thought to be more then <hi>Hannibals,</hi> making a way with pickaxes ouer the Alpes. But I know that I haue not lost my labour: but haue ſoone ſeene ſome fruite of it. For ſince, men of trade, quiet and thriftie, haue ſhewed vnto the worlde greater ſkill in the holy story then any, as they, euer haue done in our nation. So that few wyl beleeue their workes to be theirs, but ſuch as do talke with the men, and ſee their dexterity. They may thinke, and thanke your Lordſhyp, the paymaister, for their ſkill. Some Scholers ſayd, that yf all tradeſmen were ſo cunning, preaching woulde not be regarded. They forgate the
<pb facs="tcp:17078:5"/>
prouerbe: <hi>Knowledge hath not an enemy, but the ignorant.</hi> I am ſure that yf all Scholers in the Realme did ſo far paſſe them, as by profesſion they are bounde, and all the common people match them: it would be farre better with them. Your Lordſhyp, hath had this ten yeeres a wonderful deſire, to ſee the Prophets ſpeake to our eares, their owne meaning: and expounded in the margent with their owne notes. No man vnlearned coulde thinke vpon ſo celestial a paynes, to regarde it: But would rather folow custome, to let vs styll confute our ſelues, not knowing how the mistaking of a fewe places in Scripture, in ſome poyntes hinder much: and many yeeres may well be ſpent vpon ſome one lyne, which is more. This my lytle paynes wyll tell them of that: How the not marking why <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth that, <hi>Terah</hi> dyeth (two dry wordes) hath made vs, and many nations tranſlate, with flat vntruethes, in ſo weighty thinges as any can be, of collaterall articles. I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the men of great light &amp; ſight into Diuinity, moſt eſteeme of a Diuine: and I for my part, more honour one ſuch, then all companies of all other. And thinke my ſelfe more beholding to your Lordſhyp, for your bountifulnes in the due tyme of my ſtudy, for the benefite of the Church, then I coulde be to any for an Earledome, when yeeres to ſet foorth Religion can not ſerue. And not I onely, but all Diuines muſt honour you, for this your opinion knowen to many: That you thought a learned Diuine equall to an Earle. Diuines be Carls, yf they wyll not requite that reuerence. As, of my former Patrones in my Homerique dayes, when <hi>Homer</hi> was my profesſion, I ſpake in particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after the Poets maner, for ſome ſpeciall occaſions,

               <p n="2">2 But <hi>Abrabbaneel,</hi> and <hi>Iarchi,</hi> and the <hi>ſeder Olam Rabba,</hi> and the more ancient the <hi>Middras,</hi> and the other troupes, they begin the 430. yeeres from the tyme of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacrificing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and feigne that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was twyſe called from <hi>Charan</hi>: once fiue yeeres before that which is mentioned. But this is nothing els then to bring a leproſie vpon Scripture, to feigne a ſtorie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Moreouer the blynde may ſee, that the ſpeech had in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. was after the ſlaughter of the kinges, and after the promyſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Rabbine</hi> wittes can not make the 400. yeres agree with <hi>Iſaaks</hi> byrth, and the 30. with any ſtory at all, in their ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ralbag</hi> deteſtyng theſe errours, ſpeaketh otherwyſe, and is confuted in <hi>Abrabbaneel,</hi> whoſe wordes be theſe. <hi>Ralbag writeth, that the</hi> 400. <hi>yeeres begin from the birth of Iacob, and the bleſſed God bastened the ende, and brought it to paſſe before the tyme which he promiſed.

               <head>An explication of S. Stephens wordes.</head>
               <p>S. Stephen ſayth: <hi>The God of glory appeared to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, being in Meſopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran. And ſayd vnto him: Get thee out of thy lande, and out from thy kinred, and come into a land which I wyll ſhewe thee.</hi> This text of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> hath been thought to be taken from <hi>Geneſis</hi> the twelueth, becauſe wordes much alyke are there: But theſe wordes folowyng haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that text: <hi>And thence after his fathers death, God remoued him into this land, in which you now dwel. Moſes</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by what ſpech the latter was done, in theſe wordes. <hi>And Terah dyed in Charran: and God ſayde vnto Abram, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers houſe, vnto the lande that I wyll ſhew thee. And I wyll make of thee a great nation, and wyll bleſſe thee, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17078:12"/>
make thy name great, and thou ſhalt be a blesſing. I wyll alſo bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and curſe them that curſe thee, and in thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed. So Abram departed, euen as the Lord ſpake vnto him, and Lot went with him. (And Abram was ſeuentie and fiue yeeres olde, when he departed out of Charan.) Then Abram tooke Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers ſonne, and all their ſubſtaunce that they poſſeſſed, and the ſoules that they had gotten in Charan, and they departed, to go into the land of Chanaan: and to the land of Chanaan they came.</hi> Now the former text of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> is relied vpon <hi>Gen.</hi> 15, 7. where the Lord ſaith: <hi>I am EL, (the Lord) that brought thee out of VR of the Chaldees, to giue thee this land. Moſes</hi> in the <note n="‡" place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> due place cloſely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ouer the appearing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he doth the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of <hi>Terah.</hi> And to ſhew <hi>Terahs</hi> repentaunce, he maketh hym as principall of the iourney, ſaying. <hi>And Terah tooke Abram, Lot, and Sarai: and they went forth with them from VR of the Chaldeans, to goe into the land of Chanaan. And they came to Charran, and ſtayed there, and Terah died in Charan.</hi> Here only cloſely he maketh <hi>Abram</hi> autour of the iourney, when he ſayth: <hi>And they went foorth with them,</hi> not <hi>with him.</hi> When <hi>Ioſuah</hi> ſayth, <hi>Our fathers beyonde the Riuer woorſhypped ſtrange Gods, euen Terah the father of Abraham</hi>: he maketh <hi>Moſes</hi> more cleere: that to <hi>Abraham</hi> in VR God appeared, by whom <hi>Terah</hi> was mooued to goe with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> mentioneth onely the appearyng to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the bringing of hym out of <hi>VR,</hi> but leaueth the ſpeach to be gathered by the argument: whence <hi>S. Stephen</hi> doth frame it, by the lyke from <hi>Geneſis</hi> the .12. ſauing that <hi>after Terahs death, God biddeth him leaue his fathers houſe, and not his lande and kindred onely.</hi> They who referre the latter ſpeach to the firſt callyng, make the departure from <hi>Charran</hi> to haue no calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though

firſt Sabboth, but of the late ten Sabbathes of yeres paſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſhoulde haue no ſeaſon in it: but num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from the delyuery out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> vnto the dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery from death by our Lord. So it concludeth all by a moſt pleaſaunt ſabbatique accompt (as elswhere I haue ſhewed) from the buriall of <hi>Moſes,</hi> vnto the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of his ceremonies. And thus, I truſt, all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent readers wyll confeſſe, that recorde is in Scripture, how often the Sunne went his courſe, before he loſt his lyght: that the Sonne of glory in the great cloude of our lyfe, myght ſhyne to all men: and his worde might haue a moſt conſtant bryghtneſſe.</p>

thraues of the Hebrew DD. I maruell that a learned man woulde needes be blamyng of this ſpeach, in mee onely. I thought it lawfull, and duetie, to ſpeake as other men dyd. The proofe of the ſeauen yeeres is cleere by <hi>Calebs</hi> age: the Hebrew note that plentifully, and <hi>Theodoret</hi> for Greekes. His wordes lappe the text within them. <hi>The ſpeach of</hi> Caleb <hi>ſhewes, that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warred ſeauen yeeres ſpace, deuided the lande. For thus be ſpake: Fourty yeeres olde was I, when Moſes the ſeruant of the Lord ſent mee from Cadeſh Barne to vew the land. And now, the Lord hath kept mee aliue, as he promiſed. This is the fourty fift yeere ſince the Lorde ſpake vnto Moſes. Now after Gods ſentence vpon the ſixe hundreth thouſande, they continued thirtie eyght yeeres in the Wilderneſſe: then, ſeauen remayne of the fourtie fiue. And this much did the Lord of the whole worlde foretell by</hi> Moſes: <hi>When the Lord thy God bringeth thee into the lande which he promiſed to thy fathers, after ſeauen yeeres, thou ſhalt read this Law to all the people.</hi> The malicious Iewes ſay, that ſeauen yeeres the lande was in partyng, for their deceit in caſtyng <hi>Ezekiels</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: which was in a middle of a Iubilee, vnto the iuſt Iubilee. VVhereby diuiding all by fifties, they ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Kinges 17. yeeres, and torment the ſtorie: and begin the Iubilees not preſently vpon the conqueſt, but from their owne rancorous heades after a full other ſeauen. <hi>Rabbi Leui ben Gerſon</hi> playnely confeſſeth, that he ſaw no reaſon why they ſhould do ſo. This I note, becauſe my learned friende <hi>M. Henry Wolphius</hi> folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth them herein: not foreſeeing their malice: yet in other poyntes he coulde tell that they laboured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure all. The holy ſtory telleth vs (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> noteth) that in the ſeauenth yeere the lande was parted. And the Iewes confeſſe, that the next yeere to the partition muſt begin the reckonyng of fiftie yeeres for the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee.

All Hebrewes and Greekes rightly agree, that a full fiftie goe to euery Iubilee.<note place="margin">Rambam in Iobal.</note> So that the fiftie one muſt be the firſt of a new ſeauen. Here <hi>Beroaldus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doman,</hi> and <hi>Wolphius,</hi> may not be folowed for 49. yeeres to a Iubilee. <hi>Moſes</hi> is playne, and hath playnely been vnderſtoode.
