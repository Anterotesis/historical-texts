            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

with me at the
<pb facs="tcp:34983:3"/>
time of my travelling through
thoſe Countries, about the
true and neereſt way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto perfection in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
is ſtill freſh in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:
And upon that Quaere,
I propoſed unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for anſwer, the golden
Doctrine of the ſharp-ſighted
Philoſopher <hi>Helmont, ſunt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet
Sulphura quaedam,
quibus correctis atque per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectis,
tota morborum cohors
auſcultat.</hi> The truth of this
Doctrine I did then demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrate
with strong Arguments
of the <hi>Anima Antimonii,</hi> and
if my occaſions had permitted
me to remain there for ſome
<pb facs="tcp:34983:3"/>
longer time, I would have
cleared the ſame by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
proof; Now although
this great <hi>Encomium</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Helmont</hi> unto ſome Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs,
may with truth be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the Sulphur of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
yet the Tincture of
the Copper deſerveth it much
more, as having obtained of
Nature a higher degree of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
than the former; and
and therefore its <hi>Anima</hi> is
called <hi>Sulphur Philoſopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
by <hi>Paracelſus, Baſilius
Valentinus,</hi> and others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of its great Vertue and
Power in relieving the ſick in
their pains and great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb facs="tcp:34983:4"/>
which many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
clearly apprehended from
the Writings of <hi>Helmont,</hi>
and therefore greedily ſought
for the ſame, but none almoſt
hitherto found it. Hence great
complaint is made by them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, that they cannot
attain unto this great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor ſever the Golden Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
from its Leprous Body.
And therefore I counted it to
be my duty as a Christian, to
ſet upon the Table that little
light of my knowledge in this
Mystery, which God in his
Mercy beſtowed upon me, to
the end that all that are
choſen for it by God and
<pb facs="tcp:34983:4"/>
born to it by Nature, may ſee
my gift, and look into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelf, alſo together with
me may find out this precious
Jewel of Health, and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the ſame, and thence
much profit may ariſe unto the
ſick. In regard therefore, that
your Highneſſe was at that
time well pleaſed with my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucidation
concerning the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Antimony, I thought
good to dedicate this alſo to

               <p>GOd in his great mercy having
lighted unto us unworthy
Men in this Age a ſpecial clear
light in Phyſick, to the great
comfort of the ſick, by the highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<hi>John Baptist Helmont,</hi> and the
ſame having been alſo acknowledged
and highly eſteemed by many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
truth-loving Phyſitians, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34983:6"/>
therefore have diligently read and
pondered his relict deeply grounded
Writings: Yet at length almoſt all do
complain of the obſcurity of thoſe
Books, eſpecially in what concernes
the preparation of thoſe High Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and above all touching the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
or Sulphur of Copper, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one deemed, and deſervedly too,
of all the moſt neceſſary in Phyſick;
Hence by many correſpondencies, one
Friend ſought of another the clearing
of this ſecret, and every one buſied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
extreamly for the getting of this
golden <hi>Arcanum;</hi> of which diſeaſe <hi>I</hi>
my ſelf alſo lay ſick a long time: for
having diligently read the learned
Books of our Philoſopher, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to frame any conception from
thence, how to unriddle this Myſtery,
I reſolved with my ſelf to attain unto
it by the ſifting of Wiſe and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Men; and therefore declined
no difficulty of travelling into divers
Kingdomes, though often with great
hazard of my life, where <hi>I</hi> enquired
for experienced men in this ſecret Art,
and conferred with them about this
high and weighty treaſure of Health,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34983:6"/>
but could find none, who could looſen
this faſt-tyed <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum,</hi> or
give me as much as the leaſt hint of it;
Yea even of the moſt famous <hi>I</hi> found
not a few, who were not able clearly
to ſever the <hi>Anima</hi> from <hi>Antimony,</hi>
much leſſe from Copper. Whereupon
I was forced to take another Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo followed the faithful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Philoſopher, left unto us
in his book <hi>de Venatione ſcientiarum,</hi>
and ſought the truth of Nature no
more from men, but from the Creator
and Beginner of Nature, by my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prayers, whereunto I joyned a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
induſtry in reading our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Writings, accurately obſerving
his words and meaning, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one place with another, and then
alſo worked diligently, and at length
truth appeared unto me by the bleſſing
of God. Now he that hath been ſick,
being beſt ſenſible of the condition of
another which is ſick of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and not being ignorant of the
great longing ſearch and expectation
for this <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> by the

charity to communicate unto my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
what I diſcovered through the
grace of God, with much labour, time
and expences, and clearly to unfold
the way which I went my ſelf, and
thereby attained unto this knowledge,
to the end that they may follow this
little light ſet up for them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
penetrate into this Myſtery, and
do good unto their neighbour in his

Metallick Bodies, as Gold, Copper,

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34983:7"/>
not only common Sulphur, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Sulphurs of Minerals, which are

or diſſolved; to the end that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

ſame, thereby as by ſteps we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
higher, and advance to the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thoſe much faſter coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sulphurs: for all the Metallick
and Mineral Sulphurs being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of one and the ſame Nature, and
called by the Philoſophers the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Fire, and being of a Fiery
Nature, it muſt needs follow, that
their ſolution muſt proceed from one
and the ſame ground; in regard that,
as to their firſt riſe, they are of the like
Subſtance and Nature, juſt as an old
Man and a new-born child are quite of
one and the ſame ſubſtance, only that
the one is more perfect than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore for the finding
out of the ſolution of the firmly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
Metallick Sulphurs, we muſt
firſt enquire after the ground and
means to unlock the meaner Sulphurs,
for in this manner <hi>I</hi> have traced the
truth and found it. Firſt then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what it is which radically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locketh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34983:8"/>
common Sulphur, we find,
that Oyl, and all that is of a fat and
Fiery Nature doth open the ſame, as
being of a like fiery ſubſtance, and
diſcovereth to our very eyes its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
occult blood-red ſoul. Which
though it be a common thing, and
daily practiſed by many, yet it is of
ſuch a depth and weight, that from
this very ſource ſpringeth forth the
ſolution of all Metallick ſouls, yea of
the gold it ſelf, as you will hear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Therefore if we pretend
to be Diſciples of the Philoſophers,
we muſt with other eyes than thoſe
of an Idiot look upon Sulphur, when
by boyling with Oyl it is mollified in
ſuch ſort, that its inward red Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur
is turned outward; The common
crew contents himſelf with this, that
after they have done with their boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the ſame doth take away the itch
and ſcab, cureth wounds, and the
bruiſed and inflamed limbs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
other wholeſom operations:
But a ſearcher of the hidden wiſdom
goeth deeper to the ground, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
whence it cometh, that of all
things the Oyl only hath power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34983:8"/>
the Sulphur ſo ſweetly, and ſo
naturally, turning its interiour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
whereas the ſtrongeſt corroſive
cannot do it; and upon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
we find, that this ſolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the likeneſs or identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Oyl and Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Oyl or fat, as being a fiery thing,
doth cover, lay hold on, and embrace
the Sulphur as a like fiery ſubſtance,
and ſo ſoftneth the ſame, and openeth
it to its very inmoſt Center, which is
done by Sympathy, like loving its
like, and imparting their Virtue to
each other. In ſo much, that Oyl, as
a fiery moyſture is the right foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſource, from whence the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of all Mineral and Metallick
Sulphurs doth flow: Now if we go on
from common Sulphur to the other
Sulphur of Minerals, which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to a pretty hard coagulation
by the coction of Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the foreſaid experience, we find,
that though Oyl hath no power to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and open the Embryonat Sulphur
of any Mineral, as being too weak
for this performance, yet for all that,
the ſolution muſt proceed from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34983:9"/>
ſame ground, if it ſhall be radical,
and conſonant, and friendly unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but in regard that the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are faſt lockt up, and ſo do not
yield to ſuch a gentle power as that
of the Oyl, therefore the power of
the Oylie ſubſtance muſt be exalted
and increaſed in its fierineſs, and
then it will open and ſever the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
from Minerals as eaſily, yet
with more expedition than Oyl doth
unlock the common Sulphur: This
exaltation of the fiery power and
quality in Oyls muſt alſo be done by
its like, if we will work according to
Nature, and not contrary thereunto;
which is performed by a burning fire,
which by its fiery and vehement pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
turneth the Oylie ſubſtance into a
fiery ſalt, which ſalt not only retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its former Oylie mollifying power,
but alſo is highly exalted in the ſame:
for wood, which is full of Oyl, being
thrown into the fire and burnt,
though the greateſt part of the Oyl
be conſumed by the fire, in regard
that of its waſt or conſumption the
flame and heat hath its riſe, yet a great
part thereof (which cannot be burnt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34983:9"/>
in ſuch haſt, the volatile ſalt, which
alſo is in the wood, beſides the Oyl, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the ſame, and melting together)
by the ſharp and vehement power or
burning fierineſs, is turned into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fiery, fixt, Oylie ſalt, which is called
<hi>Alcali,</hi> or <hi>Lixivial</hi> ſalt, whereof the
common people make their lye: and
this ſalt hath ſtill perfectly its former
ſoftning Oylie property, only that by
the fierineſs it is tranſlated from a
Volatile to a fixed condition; yea is
grown far more fiery and powerfull,
than it was before: Now if you will
know, whither this fiery ſalt be ſtill
a true Oylie ſubſtance, then put ſome
common Sulphur and ſome of this ſalt
and water in a pot, and boyle them
a little, and you will ſee, that the
Sulphur will in like manner melt in
it, and yield its red Tincture, as if it
had been done with Oyle, yea with
more expedition, becauſe it is now
much ſtronger in its ſoftning fierineſs,
than it was before, being yet in the
forme of an Oyl. Now as this fiery
ſalt is nothing elſe, but a fiery Oyle
much exalted in its virtue, ſo it hath
the more vehement power now to lay
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34983:10"/>
hold on, and to unlock that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being yet an Oyl, it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
overcome; ſo that being in this
exalted condition it hath now the
power to take Minerals aſunder, and
to ſeparate their Soul or Sulphur. To
perform the ſame yet eaſier and with
more expedition, ſuch a fiery <hi>Alcali</hi>
may be yet further exalted in its fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs,
by being mixt with the like
fiery things, and ſo burnt together;
ſuch a fiery thing is unquench't lime,
which by the ſtrong power of the
burning fire hath attained to its great
fierineſs, and ſo is able to communicate
the ſame by fire unto the <hi>Alcali's.</hi>
Take therefore well purified <hi>Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
ſalt or ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which is the
fierieſt of all, mix it with lime, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
it ſtrongly for the ſpace of a day,
then Lixiviate it again from the lime,
your <hi>Alcali</hi> will be notably increaſed
in its fierineſs, and have then power
to looſen the Sulphur from Minerals,
and ſever it from their bodies with
much expedition; as you may ſee for
example in Antimony, the chiefeſt of all
Minerals, which being made into fine
powder, and mixed with the foreſaid
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34983:10"/>
fiery ſalt, and water powred on, and
ſo letting it reſt in a warme place for
ſome dayes, ſtirring it about oftentimes
in a day, the fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> then attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Sulphur by Sympathy and ſo
looſeneth it, and uniteth it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
the extraction decanted and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and Acid things powred into it,
the Sulphur of Antimony will preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
of a fair Orenge colour, and
burn like other Sulphur, but that
which falleth laſt of all, is beſt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
By theſe two ſteps, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of common Sulphur in Oyles, and
the ſevering of Embryonate Sulphurs
from Minerals in a fiery <hi>Alcali; I</hi> went
up higher to the looſening of Metallick
Sulphurs, they being of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with Mineral Sulphurs; and as in
a clear glaſs, by the Light of Nature I
ſaw, that in like manner as Oyle was
not of efficacy ſufficient to ſever the
Sulphur from Minerals, but that it was
needfull to advance the Oyle firſt to a
far higher degree of fierineſs, before
it was capable to performe that work:
So likewiſe the Metallick Sulphurs,
being faſter tyed to their Mercurial
bodies, and advanced to a far harder
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34983:11"/>
coagulation than Minerals, require a
much more penetrating fire, then the
fixed <hi>Alcalies</hi> are, but yet in regard that
the Sulphurs are of the ſame ſubſtance,
their ſolution muſt ſpring ſtill from the
ſame ſource, and there wants nothing
elſe, but that this fiery ſalt be made
yet more penetrative, more ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
more vehement and powerful,
which muſt be obtained by freeing
thoſe fiery Salts and <hi>Alcalies</hi> from their
groſſe corporeouſneſſe, raiſing them
by the ſtrong force of the fire, and
making of them a penetrating, fiery,
volatile ſpirit, being not only of ſuch
a fierie nature and force as before, but
alſo much increaſed in its penetrating
and mollifying quality, becauſe it is
freed from all groſſe ligaments, and
turned into a through-ſpiritual, very
fiery, volatile Water. According to
this knowledge I worked, and had good
ſucceſſe, in ſo much that the Sulphurs
of Metals readily yeilded to ſuch a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
volatile ſpirit, delivering up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
all their virtue and power, as
hereafter ſhall be mentioned. So the
ſumme of this ground is this, that for
common Sulphurs, Oyles for Embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34983:11"/>
Sulphurs, the fixed fiery <hi>Alcalies;</hi>
and for Metallick Sulphurs, yea for that
of Gold it ſelf, the Volatilized <hi>Alcalies,</hi>
as a ſpiritual, very fierie, penetrating
Water are required for their central ſolution,
mollification and liquefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Let none think it ſtrange, that I
ſaid, that Gold it ſelf muſt yield i
blood-red Soul or Sulphur to this fierie
penetrating Spirit, for Experience hath
taught me ſo, and ſheweth forth the
ſame daily, notwithſtanding that the
deeply Learned Philoſopher <hi>Cormopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
in his Preface of his XII. tract. doth
hold the contrary, and many others
at this day do count it impoſsible.</p>

Now this being to be done
by <hi>Salt-Armoniac,</hi> you may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
think to make uſe of the ſame as
it is in it ſelf, as <hi>I</hi> my ſelf alſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſo at firſt, and ſublimed the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
many times with <hi>ſalt Armoniack,</hi>
but all in vain. And therefore at
length after many fruſtraneous labours,
<hi>I</hi> begun more accurately to heed our
Philoſophers far-reaching words, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that the Vitriol of the Copper
muſt be made into a very highly volatil
ſpirit; conſequently the <hi>Salt-armoniack</hi>
it ſelf, becauſe it is to performe this,
muſt firſt be turned into ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
volatil Spirit; for how could
the Copper poſſibly be transformed
into ſuch a very volatil ſpirit, if that
ſame which is to transform it ſo, be
not firſt it ſelf ſuch a volatil Spirit?
And therefore the <hi>Salt-armoniack</hi> muſt
firſt be turned into a very volatilſpirit,
and then by the means thereof the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34983:14"/>
Copper turned into Vitriol; But you
muſt not think (as I did at firſt; but
my endeavours proved addle) to take
natural, or by art prepared blew Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol
of Copper to ſublime it with <hi>Salt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi>
and ſo turne it into a Spirit:
for this is as much loſt labour, as to
take the Copper filed or calcined, in
regard that the ſpirit of Vitriol or any
other corroſive ſpirit, which made the
Vitriol of Copper, do not only not
ſerve for this purpoſe, but alſo are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
and a great hindrance; in ſo
much, that if one would according to
our Philoſophers Doctrine extract the
Tincture or Sulphur, either of Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grown or artificially made common
blew Vitriol of Copper, he muſt firſt
diſſolve the Vitriol in Water, then
precipitate the Metallick Subſtance
with an <hi>Alcali,</hi> and free the ſame quite
from its coroſive, ſo that not the leaſt
of this remain with it, and then he
muſt afreſh make this precipitated and
dryed <hi>Calx</hi> into Vitriol by ſpirit of
<hi>Salt Armoniack;</hi> elſe he would get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for ſuch difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the common and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Vitriol, as betwixt black and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34983:15"/>
white, as you will hear by and by.
Now concerning the transformation of
the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> into a Volatil <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
the Reader muſt not think, that
the ſame is to be done after a common
and known way; or that ſuch a way
hath been known hitherto: as that the
<hi>Salt armoniack</hi> is to be diſtill'd with
Wheat-flower, as ſome do, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely
count the <hi>Acid</hi> water that
comes over for the true ſpirit of <hi>Salt
Armoniack,</hi> it being nothing elſe but the
acidity of the flower, mixt with ſome
atomes of <hi>Salt armoniack,</hi> after which
alſo, ſoon all the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
and ſublimeth in its former
weight; for all Vegetables yield ſuch a
ſowre ſpirit when they are <hi>distill'd:</hi>
Alſo the fiery urinous ſalt, which is
got by means of the ſalt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or
any other <hi>Alcali,</hi> is not that ſpirit
which the Philoſophers require for this
work, in regard that the ſame is but
the ſmaller part of the <hi>Salt Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
but the bigger part remaineth
in the bottome, in ſo much that the
foreſaid ſalt is wrongfully called ſpirit
of <hi>Salt Armoniack;</hi> for the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing conſiſting of two parts,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34983:15"/>
as the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> doth, pertaineth
alwaies and chiefly to the bigger or
greater part, as they are wont to ſay,
<hi>à potiori parte fit denominatio;</hi> Now
experience witneſſeth, that if you
take a pound of <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> and
mix it with an <hi>Alcali,</hi> that about three
ounces, or three and a half ounces do
riſe of the urinous Salt (which indeed
is no ſpirit, but only a volatil Salt)
and more then twelve ounces remain
with the <hi>Alcali</hi> in the bottom, which
twelve ounces, as being the greater
part merit rather the name of <hi>Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi>
then thoſe three ounces and a
half which ſublimed; hence alſo the
wiſe alwaies mean it of the greater
part which remained in the bottom,
which they forced into a volatil ſpirit
to ſerve their turne; and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath taught me, for <hi>I</hi> ſaw
that the urinous Salt is uſeleſſe for
this matter, not being able to produce
that which the wiſe require, and ſo
ſought and found it in the greater part
<hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid greater part, which
after the ſeparation of the urinous ſalt,
remains in the bottom with the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
being forced over by a ſtrong fire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34983:16"/>
to Art, you will get not only
a Volatil, but alſo a double ſpirit: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Volatil I ſay, for it will come over
in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and is able to make other
bodies to be very Volatil: Double it
is, for when the Urinous Salt ſevered
it ſelf thereform, it embraced then
and united with the <hi>Alcali,</hi> from
which it is not to be ſevered but by a
very vehement fire, and then it forceth
part of the <hi>Alcali</hi> over with it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its intimate union therewith,
in ſo much that without the ſame it
cannot come over; ſo there ariſeth a
double or ſatiated ſpirit, which ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
its hungry corroding nature
with the <hi>Alcali;</hi> and ſo doth no more
corrode other bodies, nor ſeeketh to
inſinuate it ſelf into them, being ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
already with the <hi>Alcali;</hi> as much
as its corroſive had need of; hence this
double ſatiated very Volatil ſpirit is
of a wonderful nature, and unlocketh
Metallick bodies after a far other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
than the common corroſives do;
for theſe being hungry and deſirous to
ſatiate their corroſive, do fall upon the
Metals with great fury and noiſe, and
do corrode them and adhere unto them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34983:16"/>
outwardly: but this double corroſive,
being ſatiated already, doth not
corrode the Metal, nor ſeeketh for to
dwell with it as others do, but doth
mollify it, and adhereth not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereunto, nor performeth its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſuddenly like the others, but
gently in ſome dayes, penetrating to
the very inmoſt of the Metal, and
turning outward what was lock't and
ſealed up in its inmoſt center, by the
vertue of its double nature, wherein
the Metal melteth like ice in water.
Therefore be careful and diligent to
make this ſpirit of the <hi>Salt Armoniack;</hi>
and be not diſmayed therefore, that
much Labour is required for it, and
ſpecial care, but think upon the end,
that the ſame will recompenſe thee
with gladneſſe and joy: If you hit
this right, then you have overcome
the greateſt and difficulteſt point in
this buſineſs, and the reſt will be but
as it were a play or ſport.</p>
               <p>Take therefore this very Volatil
Spirit, and poure it upon the filings
of fine Copper, and in a cloſe glaſſe-Veſſel
in a gentle heat, digeſt it for
manydayes, and the Metal will lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34983:17"/>
melt in it, and the ſpirit will be
very green of the Metal: continue
this ſolution with freſh ſpirit, untill
your metal be all diſſolved; then coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
it, and you will get a very green
Vitriol, which as it differs from the
common blew Vitriol in colour, ſo
likewiſe in Nature and Vertues; for
the blew <hi>Vitriolum Cupri</hi> is very bitter
and nauſeous in taſte, but this as
ſweet as ſugar of Lead; the other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
vehement vomits, but this
ſtrengtheneth Nature, begetteth reſt,
taketh away pain: it may be given e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the ſmalleſt children, and hath
ſuch Verture in Phyſick, that it is to be
admired. The other being Calcined,
is a harſh and hard ſubſtance, but this
is fufile in the fire like wax, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like unto Rozin, and may be cut
like a gumm; for its balſamick ſoul is
totally turned outwards by this ſecret
double corroſive, and therefore alſo
doth it ſmell ſo fragrantly, like <hi>Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous</hi>
ſpice, eſpecially being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in ſpirit of Wine (in which it
will melt totally and very ſuddenly)
and digeſted for ſome dayes, to ſay
nothing of other many more properties
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34983:17"/>
for brevities ſake. Lo now, what great
difference there is betwixt the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
Vitriol, and that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is made of Copper, truly as
much as betwixt white and black:
And as its vertue is great as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
medicine, ſo its efficacy is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and not to be commended ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
in Chirurgy, by reaſon of
its Balſamick ſweetneſs, whereby in
green wounds, dangerous ulcers, and
incurable tumors it ſheweth forth ſo
great power, that it ſhameth all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known oyntments, balſomes,
oyles, plaiſters and poultiſes: Of
which I will preſcribe you a plaiſter
and an oyntment, whoſe mighty opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you will admire, and have reaſon
to rejoyce at it in many dangerous
Symptomes:</p>
               <p>The plaiſter is compoſed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Take Sulphur of Antimony, ſuch
as above taught, put it into a Phiol,
poure upon it Linſeed-Oyl new
drawn, that it reach ſome inches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
let it boyle moderately together
for a whole day, and the Linſeed-Oyl
will turn as red as blood, and is the
true Balſome of Sulphur in Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34983:18"/>
this Balſome put into a Copper
veſſel; if you have one pound of it,
add unto it halfe a pound of Litharge
in fine powder, boyle it, ſtill ſtirring
it about, until the Litharge be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
then add of greaſe (be it of
Men, Hogs, Geeſe, or Butter alſo, &amp;c.
according to your uſe) half a pound,
and of the ſweet Vitriol of Copper
one ounce and a half, and as much
wax as is needfull for conſiſtency, and
make it into a plaiſter, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its great Virtues may well be
called the golden plaiſter. The Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
make thus: Take of Honey well
clarified four Ounces; of the juyce
of <hi>Polygonum latifolium</hi> twelve Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
of the ſweet Vitriol of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
two Ounces; boyle all gently
together, untill it be almoſt as thick
as an Oyntment; then add of the beſt
Saffran made into fine powder, half
an Ounce: take it ſtraight from the
fire, mix the Saffran well with it, ſo
that it be very well incorporated
therewith, and it is done. If in thoſe
caſes where fat things may be uſed,
you will add ſome of the former Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of Sulphur, and incorporate it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34983:18"/>
well, it will be ſo much the better.
And theſe two things being well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and rightly adminiſtred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Art, will be very uſeful for
you in aſſiſting the diſtreſſed, and gain
you much credit, as you will know
by experience.</p>

all that pertaineth to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Vitriol of Copper, yet
the propoſed matter may ſeem to the
Reader partly obſcure, and partly
impoſſible, eſpecially becauſe <hi>I</hi> make
mention of ſuch a ſorts of ſpirits,
(ſuch as double and ſatiated) whereof
hath not been heard, nor read in any
Author hitherto, ſo that this my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
may peradventure be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a fable, as if <hi>I</hi> offered violence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34983:19"/>
the Philoſophers Doctrine, when
they do ſo highly commend the <hi>Salt
Armoniack</hi> for to unlock and prepare
Metals and Minerals, perverting their
words to another ſenſe, which they
never intended. For to prevent this
ſuſpition, and to make the matter ſo
clear and palpable to the Reader, that
he may ſee the bare and naked ground
of this ſecret, I will ſo digeſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
unto him to the nature and whole
ſubſtance of the <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> that
he cannot chooſe but agree thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and acknowledge the truth of the
matter: Firſt, let none take offence,
that <hi>I</hi> produce a new ſort of ſpirits, or
that <hi>I</hi> name them by a new name, in
regard, that the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> of
its ſelf is nothing elſe but a double
and ſatiated ſpirit, for elſe it could
never have ſuch great Virtues to fit
and prepare Metals and Minerals, and
ſo readily elevate, and take them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if it were not a ſatiated and
double ſpirit, which with a double
force performeth, what no ſingle cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
poſſibly can do. But that the <hi>Salt
Armoniack</hi> is a ſatiated and double
Spirit, the <hi>Mechanica</hi> will teach you;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34983:19"/>
for if you take the ſpirit of Urine
(which to ſpeak properly is no ſpirit,
but only a fiery ſalt, in regard that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rectified and ſevered from all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous
Phlegm, it is and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
alwayes a Volatile and fiery ſalt,
and no ſpirit) and poure it upon Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
the corroſive in the Vitriol will
unite preſently with this fiery ſalt,
and leave its Metallick Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it dwelled before, and ſo layes
hold on this fiery ſalt, having more
inclination to this, than to the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Body: this Vitriol, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with the ſo called Spirit
of Urine, being put into a Retort and
forced by fire, preſently there will
appear a dry, Volatile double ſalt,
taſting neither of ſpirit of Vitriol,
nor of ſpirit of Urine, becauſe they
worked into one another, and changed
themſelves on both ſides, which action
and reaction may well be called ſatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
where the one ſatiateth, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and reſts it ſelf in the other, both
quietly dwelling together and in each
other, and therefore two being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there is <hi>virtus unita,</hi> and their
force ſo much the greater, as they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34983:20"/>
ſay, <hi>virtus unita fortior,</hi> for from this
united Vertue proceedeth the great
power, which the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi>
hath in preparing of Metallick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
The foreſaid double ſalt being
examined, you will find that its taſte
is no other then that of the <hi>Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi>
and that it hath the ſame
operation in Phyſick alſo. Now after
the ſame manner, as you have heard
of the ſpirit of Vitriol and the ſalt of
Urine, ariſeth alſo the common <hi>Salt
Armoniack</hi> and from the ſame ground,
only that inſtead of Vitriol they take
common ſalt, and inſtead of the ſalt of
Urine, they take common Urine that
ſuffered no ſeparation, and other
things, which contain the like Volatil
fiery ſalt, as Urine doth: as ſoon as
theſe things are mixed together, they
preſently work one into another, each
one layes hold of the other; inſomuch
that this dry mixture being forced by
fire, the Volat il ſalt by reaſon of its
Volatility is neceſſitated to riſe, but
being intimately united with the ſalt, it
cannot riſe alone, but forceth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of ſalt to go along, and ſo both
aſcend, as a double ſatiated ſpirit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34983:20"/>
or ſpiritual Salt; and if you doubt ſtill
whither it be ſo or no, then take Spirit
of Salt, and Salt of Urine, mix them
together in ſuch a quantity, that you
can perceive no taſte of either, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
or middle taſte betwixt both, then
coagulate it, and force it to aſcend, and
you will have juſt ſuch a Salt-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack
as is commonly ſold; whence you
ſee plainly, that common Salt-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack
is nothing elſe but a double and
ſatiated Spirit, or rather a Spiritual
Salt; and beeing of ſuch a double na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it hath the precedency before all
common and known Spirits, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives,
and ſo openeth Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
as no other Salt can do the
like, whereof I will give you a clear
Demonſtration at the end of this
Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> of its great power to
manifeſt that which is occult: and
therefore <hi>Baſilius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentinus</hi> ſaith well
of the ſame; The Salt-Armoniack is not
the meaneſt key to unlock Metals; and
therefore is compared by the Antients
unto a flying Fowl; it is able with its
ſwift Feathers to carry on high the
Tincture and colour of Minerals, and
ſome of Metals, and you will finde it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34983:21"/>
of force ſufficient to prepare, and
fit Metals for Tranſmutation; for
without preparation no Metal can be
tranſmuted, &amp;c. Note this Doctrine of
<hi>Baſilius,</hi> for I have ſet it down not
without cauſe. Now although by
this my demonſtration you will be
convinced, that the name of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſatiated Spirit is not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
given unto the Salt-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,
and that this term is not newly
invented by me, but according to its
real being hath been in the Salt-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,
although the name was not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
hitherto: yet you may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
if Salt-Armoniack be ſuch a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſatiated Spirit, why is it not
ſufficient of it ſelf to reduce the Copper
into a Volatile Spirit, but there muſt
be made another double Spirit of the
Salt-Armoniack, and the <hi>Alcali?</hi> For
anſwer know, that the Spirit, or rather
Salt of Urine, whereof the Salt-Armoniack
conſiſteth, is the only cauſe
of it, for it alwayes retains the nature
of Salt, and cannot be reduced into a
true Spirit: hence it raiſeth the Spirit
of Salt, Vitriol, and other Corroſives
(which are true Spirits) not in the
Form of a Spirit, but according to its
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34983:21"/>
own nature like a Salt, yea by its Saltie
nature turneth them alſo into Salt, or
into the ſhape of Salt, ſo long as it is
united with them: But now our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
as alſo <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and others
before him require, that the Copper
ſhall come over, not like a Volatile
green Salt, but like a very Volatile
green Spirit, as our Philoſopher ſaith
<hi>de Lithiaſi, Cap. 8. §</hi> 21. that it muſt be
<hi>Cupri liquamen Volatile;</hi> and in his
<hi>Duumviratus</hi> he ſaith, that the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Viridis</hi> ought to be <hi>inſigniter vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilis,</hi>
to the end that the body of
the Copper may be rightly prepared
and fitted, that it may yield its tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
afterwards; and therefore it muſt
be ſo forcibly torne aſſunder, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the ſmalleſt atomes, <hi>viz.</hi>
into a ſubtle ſpirit; for without this
proceeding, its <hi>anima</hi> cannot be got,
as he ſaith expreſly, <hi>loco jam citato d<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lithiaſi § 5. Non potest autem haberi ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Veneris, niſi cum plenaria (NB)
Cupri destructione corporiſque mercuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
ipſius Veneris Volatiliſatione:</hi> but
the <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> though it be a

performe this, although the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<hi>Vitriolum Veneris</hi> or <hi>Cuprum lima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>

or <hi>uſtum,</hi> be never ſo often and ſo
many times elevated therewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is but a dry ſalt, but not a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
and attenuating ſpirit, which
is far more ſubtle and efficacious to
unlock, penetrate, and ſpiritualize than
ſalt, though it be never ſo volatile.
Now although the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> be
not ſuch a double ſpiritual ſubſtance,
as to have power to do the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
work, and to reduce Copper
into a ſubtle penetrating, Volatile
Spirit, yet the nature and ſubſtance of
the <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> as being really a
double ſpiritual ſalt, hath given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
unto the Philoſophers, though
after another manner, yet from the
ſame ground, whereof the <hi>Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi>
conſiſteth, to find out, and to
prepare another ſort of ſatiated and
double ſubſtance, which alwaies is and
remaineth a very Volatile and flying
Spirit. For they conſidered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the parts, whereof the <hi>Salt Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi>
as being a double ſubſtance, doth
conſiſt: and they found, that (as <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
above at large) it conſiſteth
of a fiery and of a corroſive ſubſtance;
but ſeeing that the fiery ſubſtance in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34983:22"/>
its nature is no true ſpirit, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not ſerving their turne, <hi>viz.</hi>
to reduce Copper into a volatil Spirit;
therefore inſtead thereof they choſe
ſuch a fiery ſalt, as being diſtill'd is a
true ſpirit, and never aſcendeth in
the forme of Salt, much leſſe changeth
the adjoyned corroſive into the forme
of a dry ſalt, as the ſalt of Urine doth
To find out the ſame they conſidered
the property and efficacy of the ſalt of
Urine, <hi>viz.</hi> that its nature is, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
or ſatiate all corroſives, by which
vertue it doth precipitate metals diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in a corroſive, eagerly falling
upon the corroſive, ſatiating it ſelf
therewith, and ſo freeing the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
metal from it; and becauſe they
found that the ſame power, yea more
effectual, reſideth in the fiery fixed
<hi>Alcalies,</hi> they judged them fit for the
purpoſe, that as in the preparation of
<hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> the fierineſs of the
Salt of urine doth ſatiate the corroſive,
ſo as to their purpoſe the <hi>Alcalies</hi> lay
hold of the corroſive, and that of them
both there ſhould ariſe a <hi>tertium, dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,
ſatiatum ſal:</hi> and conſequently
by diſtillation ſuch a double ſpirit; they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34983:23"/>
alſo firſt diſtilled the <hi>Alcalia</hi> by a very
ſtrong fire, according to art, and
found that they aſcended not like a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt, but like a true, very ſubtle
and penetrating ſpirit (of mighty
great power and vertue in Phyſick)
and therefore they mixt the <hi>Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi>
with the <hi>Alcalies,</hi> and the
corroſive having more inclination to
them, than to the fiery ſalt of Urine,
preſently aſſociated it ſelf with the
<hi>Alcali,</hi> leaving the ſalt of Urine, and
ſo making a new double ſatiated ſalt,
taſting neither of the <hi>Alcali</hi> nor of the
corroſive, but as a mixture of both, as
experience doth teſtify to this day.
Now becauſe both the corroſive and
the <hi>Alcali</hi> being forced over by fire,
turne into a true ſpirit, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
follow, that of this double ſalt
no other but a true ſatiated and
double ſpirit muſt come; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it ſelf confirmeth it, that a very
volatile ſpirit cometh thence; having
ſuch a property as no other corroſive
hath, which fall upon the Metallick
bodies with great fury and ebullition,
corroding them, and adheering out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
unto them, ſeek to get their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34983:23"/>
therein: but in regard that
this double ſpirit is already ſatiated in
himſelf, and is of a double and mighty
force, therefore it openeth the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
bodies in a clean other way than
the common corroſives do; for by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its double and volatile nature it
pierceth and penetrateth to the very
inmoſt center of every atome of the
Metals, and turneth outwards all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
colour, tincture and vertue; yea
quickneth them, and maketh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
which before lay hidden and
dead as it were. Now upon this elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation
you may ſay, ſince in the
<hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> there is no other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive,
but the Spirit of Salt, whether
it be not all one, to make firſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Salt, and to joyn it with the
<hi>Alcalies,</hi> and in this manner to get a
double volatile ſpirit? For Anſwer
whereunto, know that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
had reaſon, yea were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make uſe of the <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi>
becauſe that its corroſive (though as to
its firſt riſe proceeding from Salt) by
reaſon of its union undergone with the
fiery Salt of Urine (where they did
act into one another, and change one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34983:24"/>
another in their nature) hath got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and far more excellent nature
than it had before; and hence the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
were neceſſitated to acquieſce
in the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> and thence got
their corroſive. And I muſt confeſſe,
that after I had learned to underſtand
and know the ground and root of the
<hi>Salt Armoniack, I</hi> thought my ſelf alſo
that the Spirit of Salt might be uſed
for this intent: So I tryed it, but
could get no ſuch ſpirit, as I had from
the <hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> whence it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to me, why the Philoſophers
eſteemed alwaies ſo highly of the <hi>Salt
Armoniack:</hi> And therefore I deſired
to ſee and taſte this corroſive naked and
by it ſelf, and to trye its vertue, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alone and of it ſelf, it would ſhew
it ſelf more excellent and powerful,
than the common ſpirit of Salt, and I
took much pains about it, trying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deceitful proceſſes, which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the obtaining of this corroſive, or
ſowre ſpirit, amongſt which the moſt
fallacious and perverſe is that which
teacheth to mix <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> with
Wheaten flower, and to diſtil it, and
ſo to get this deſired corroſive, the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34983:24"/>
fooliſhneſſe whereof I have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the former Chapter, and is
therefore needleſs to make any further
mention of it. And becauſe I could
not attain thereunto by the means of
thoſe big-ſpeaking, or boaſting proceſs-books,
and the like writings, I ſearcht
for it diligently and earneſtly, and
with great care pondered and obſerved
the nature of things, untill I found it;
which in regard of its Simplicity I
might have found out long ago and
very eaſily, if I had but ſtuck to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and its Simplicity, and avoided
the miſguiding Writers, which afford
little truth, but much confuſion
and error. The ground for to obtain
this corroſive conſiſteth in this, that
the fiery Salt of urine be firſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and ſevered, elſe it is impoſſible
to get the ſowre ſpirit alone, for they
dwell in each other. This ſeparation
of the fiery Salt, though it may be done
by joyning of an <hi>Alcali</hi> unto the <hi>Salt
Armoniack,</hi> for ſtreight by a gentle
heat it will totally be gone, but yet
this ſerveth not our buſineſs in hand,
for then 'tis again mixt and ſatiated
with the <hi>Alcali;</hi> from which it cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34983:25"/>
be ſeparated bare and ſingle in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but if it be forced according to
art, it forceth the <hi>Alcali</hi> to come along,
and ſo is not ſingle in its Nature; the
reaſon is, becauſe that the <hi>Alcali</hi> it
ſelf alſo is of a ſalty nature as well as
the corroſive, and therefore their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ſo accurate, and their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto one another ſo great, that it
is impoſſible to ſever them, becauſe of
the likeneſs or the ſameneſs of their
natures, being both of a ſalty nature,
whence their tye is not ſoluble: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ſtead of the <hi>Alcalies</hi> other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
muſt be taken, ſuch as are of no
ſalty nature, and yet being kept in the
fire together with the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi>
have power to retain the corroſive, and
to diſmiſs the fiery Salt. There are
divers ſuch ſubjects which will perform
this, yet ſtill one better than the other;
for one attracteth or holdeth faſt more
of the corroſive than the other, and
the beſt of all is the <hi>Lapis Haemathites,</hi>
by the means whereof this ſowre ſpirit
is got beſt, and in moſt quantity, as the
<hi>Mechanica</hi> will teach you; for if you
mixe the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
with the Blood-ſtone, and diſtill
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34983:25"/>
it, preſently, there cometh a great
deal of the fiery urinous ſpirit, and ſo
much as there is looſened of the ſame,
ſo much of the corroſive is tyed unto
the blood-ſtone; and if at laſt you give
a little ſtronger fire, a part of the <hi>Salt
Armoniack</hi> will aſcend alſo in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
and former nature; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of double vertue, it carrieth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the ſubtleſt vertue and beſt <hi>flores</hi>
of the blood-ſtone, and thence is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
ſo fair like an Orenge, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to behold; which, after the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is finiſhed, make into fine powder
and throw it in highly rectifyed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wine, and keep it till <hi>I</hi> teach
you what further to do therewith: The
fiery Spirit that came over, you may
uſe in all points, as they do other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> of an urinous
odor, for betwixt this and the other
there is no difference: but the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
or acid ſpirit you muſt ſeek in the
<hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> into which this corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
hath ſo inſinuated it ſelf, and is
ſo faſt lockt up in it, that although
you force this <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> with
never ſo ſtrong a fire, yet you cannot
get this corroſive, yea not ſo much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34983:26"/>
as one drop of it, but if this <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
be duly purified, the deſired cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
will come eaſily to light, yea in
Sand alſo: to attain unto this, beat
the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> into very fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and throw it ſtraight into good
Spirit of Wine, which will take into
it ſelf all the corroſive, and the ſubtleſt
parts of the bloodſtone, which the
corroſive laid hold on, uniting it ſelf
therewith, and you will ſee it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tinged of a Gold-colour, which
decant, and poure on other, repeating
this proceſſe until no ſpirit more be
tinctured, then draw off all the ſpirit
in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and being all come over,
you will find in the <hi>Cucurbit</hi> a <hi>balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic,
aromatick Salt,</hi> for the moſt part
ſmelling like Saffron, which put into
a luted glaſs Retort in a wind furnace,
and diſtil with a gentle fire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the corroſive, which was in the
<hi>Salt Armoniack,</hi> will come over; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this diſtillation with a gentle fire,
till no drops more come, then ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the fire by degrees, and there
will come, very fair <hi>flores,</hi> as light as
down feathers, gliſtering and of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fair colors, as red, of gold colour, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34983:26"/>
many others very pleaſant to behold; &amp;
take heed that you make not too much
haſt in the beginning, nor exceed with
the Fire, for it will not be done with
violence, but requireth time, for if you
force it before the time, all will be
gone, and you will get nothing, and
therefore I do give you fair warning:
The diſtillation being done, rince
off with your corroſive all the <hi>flores</hi>
which are in the neck of the Retort,
and poure them together with the
Corroſive, in a glaſs Retort, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
the Corroſive with a gentle fire,
and all the <hi>flores</hi> remain in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and the deſired Acid Spirit of
the <hi>Salt Armoniack</hi> is in the Receiver
clear and white, of excellent Virtues,
and of as much greater power in its
operation beyond the common ſpirit
of ſalt, as a ſtrong well grown Man
in compariſon of a Youth of eighteen
years of age, as by diligent enquiry
you may know experimentally; and
thence you will know, why the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
in preparing of their double
Spirit kept to the Corroſive of the <hi>Salt
Armoniack,</hi> and preferred it before
the ſpirit of ſalt. And although my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34983:27"/>
intent is not to ſpeak of any thing elſe,
but what ſerveth to confirm my elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation,
which hitherto hath been
done to the full, yet I cannot paſs by,
becauſe in the demonſtration of the
excellency of the Corroſive from the
<hi>Salt-Armoniack</hi> the aboveſaid golden
<hi>flores</hi> of the blood-ſtone accompanied
the reſt: to mention their great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
to the end, that they as a
Noble Treaſure may be employed
for the benefit of the diſeaſed. Take
therefore, the ſpirit of Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you have thrown the ſublimed <hi>Salt-Armoniack,</hi>
mixt with the Gold-like
<hi>flores,</hi> decant it, and poure on other,
repeating the ſame forth and forth,
till it be tinged no more: Abſtract
all the ſpirit of Wine in <hi>Balneo (NB</hi>
in <hi>Balneo,</hi> for in aſhes or ſand it
will not come over, of which you
may conſider further) and in the
bottom of the <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> you will
have a very fair ſalt, of a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
colour, inſomuch that the ſight
can hardly leave looking upon it,
and of a very ſtrong Odour, like unto
Saffran, which mix with the other
<hi>flores</hi> which in the rectification of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34983:27"/>
the Corroſive ſpirit remained in the
Retort, mix them well together, and
lay them in a Cellar for to diſſolve,
and you will get a very fair Liquor
far ſurpaſſing the choiceſt Gold in
Colour, and take good heed, that
when at laſt the drops begin to grow
pale, that you let them not come to
the other, but keep them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for feavers; but the firſt keep
by it ſelf for a rare Medicine (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being mixed with <hi>Gumme Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi>
and made up in pills) <hi>in
Hydrope, quartanâ, ſcorbuto, plueritide,
renum calculo, colicâ, obſtructione men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium,
Melancholiâ Hypochondriacâ, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibus
ventriculi variis,</hi> and many
other grievous infirmities; and it
hath alſo <hi>vim anodynam &amp; ſomniferam,</hi>
by reaſon of its Gold and Saffran-like
Tincture, and Aromatical ſmel. Whence
you may perceive the great power
which the Salt-Armoniack hath in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
and inverting of Metals; for
who ſhould have thought, that ſuch an
excellent Balſamick ſmell ſhould be
hidden in ſuch a hard harſh and groſs
body as the blood-ſtone is, if the Salt
Armoniack had not diſcovered it unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34983:28"/>
us. Therefore ſeek and you will find,
to the end that the hidden virtues of
Nature may be manifeſted, and thence
much praiſe may redound unto the
moſt holy Creator of theſe virtues.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the ſweet Vitriol of Copper is to be
distilled into a green Spirit.</head>
               <p>THe Philoſophers Writings manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that of Vitriol and Copper
there may be made a green ſpirit, of
very great virtues, there were alwayes
found ſeekers of truth, who took ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great pains to obtain this Noble
green Spirit, and to delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in its power and Virtue; but
when they ſaw that Vitriol, however
diſtilled, will not yield ſuch a green
Spirit as the Philoſophers Writings do
promiſe, they thought that the old
Wiſe Men would not be underſtood of
Common diſtillation, but conjectured
that by ſome ſundry ſubtle way, or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34983:28"/>
by ſundry unknown ſleights ſuch green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is to be obtained; and therefore they
begun to invent all ſorts of wayes, how
to attain unto their purpoſe. And
firſt there were ſome which that they
might obtain a greenneſs, took the
ſubtleſt Spirit of Vitriol, and diſtilled
it from ſome Vegetables, ſo many
times, and ſo often, untill by manifold
Cohobation it carried along over the
greenneſs of the hearbs, and ſo pleaſed
themſelves with a greenneſs borrowed
from Vegetables, ſo ſetting their
heart at reſt, which had as much effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
as the Virtue of the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hearbs did extend it ſelf. Others
when they ſaw, that the greenneſs
of the Vitriol will not aſcend, inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, and forced it downwards, and
ſo with great ſhouting they conceived
to have caught the truth of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
whereas in that manner part of
the Vitriol falls through with it,
whereof the Liquor muſt needs turn
green; for the vehement vomiting,
which ſuch a pretended green Spirit
cauſeth, ſufficiently doth ſhew, that
the groſs corporal Vitriol is in it, in
regard that it is, and remaineth alwayes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34983:29"/>
the quality of Vitriol to cauſe much
vomiting. Others followed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who acknowledging this way
of forcing <hi>per deſcenſum</hi> too groſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
ſomewhat, that hath ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a ſundry, ſo tearmed Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
diſtillation, and of a ſundry
ſecret Philoſophical Vitriol, which is
not common; pretending that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
have not uſed common Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
nor Copper for this purpoſe,
but uſed their own proper, hitherto
unknown, Vitriol, which they made of
the ſeed of all Metals, and that this
ſeed is a ſort of round ſtones found
in the fatteſt beds, which as it is a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
matter of a ſecret Vitriol, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that it muſt be diſtilled after a
ſecret and no known way, but that
after this ſeed is impregnated by the
Air with ſufficient moyſture, ſo that
it can Liquefie in water, they purified
that green Metallick juice which
came thence from its Corporeouſneſs
by filtration, and they interpreted
filtration to be the Philoſophers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
and ſo they did not only
violence to the word Diſtillation,
forcing it to be the ſame with filtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34983:29"/>
but alſo vented their feigned firſt
matter, or <hi>ſemen metallorum</hi> (which
yet by its right name is called <hi>Pyrites,</hi>
and indeed ſhewes it ſelf to be ſuch)
for to be the Matrix of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Vitriol, whereas experience
witneſſeth, that ſuch a pretended Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Vitriol hath not the nature
and quality which the true Vitriol of
the wiſe hath, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is ſweet, and
procureth reſt, as a true <hi>domicilium
veri anodyni Philoſophorum;</hi> but the
pretended Philoſophers Vitriol, is as
groſſe violent, bitter and nauſeous,
as common Vitriol, and indeed is
none other but common Vitriol, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that it hath the ſame riſe with
the common, <hi>viz.</hi> from the fire-ſtone.
And as this pretended <hi>Vitr. Phil.</hi> is
falſe, ſo is alſo their Diſtillation, <hi>viz.</hi>
Filtration, meerly a feigned pretence,
and preſumptious perverſion of the
words of the wiſe: And this perverted
Philoſophical diſtillation (elſe called
Filtration) yields a much more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
greenneſs than that <hi>per deſcenſum,</hi>
in which not all the Vitriol falleth
through, but only ſome ſmall quantity;
but in the perverted Philoſophical
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34983:30"/>
Diſtillation all runneth through the
Filter, and yet they vent it, for ſuch
a curious and ſpecial Philoſophical
green ſpirit.</p>
               <p>There were others, and thoſe beſt of
all, which remained in the genuine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
ſence of Diſtillation, and there
they ſought for it, and in regard they
could get no ſuch greenneſs from the
Vitriol by no manner of way, they
conjectured that the Philoſophers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſomething unto Vitriol, which
they had concealed from us, and
therefore out of two ſeveral Retorts
they forced the Vitriol and Saltpeter
by quick and ready ſleights into one
Receiver, where theſe two Spirits
working into one another, there aroſe
a green Liquor or Spirit, as to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and herein they did acquieſce,
and truly this laſt way is yet beſt of all;
not in regard of its aſſumed greenneſs
(which is but a Reflexion as it were,
riſen from the action of the two
Spirits, and ſo only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
painting) but becauſe of the
union or copulation of theſe two ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whence one ſpirit ariſeth of a very
ſubtle, penetrating, and attenuating
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34983:30"/>
Vertue, whereby it is of a quick ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and is not to be deſpiſed in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſia,</hi>
but meriteth commendation:
and you need not ſuſpect (as I did in
my firſt ignorance, and therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the uſe of it) that this Spirit
is an <hi>Aquafort,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Aquafort</hi>
is likewiſe made of Vitriol and Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,
by no means; for the caſe is
clean other with the <hi>Aquafort</hi> in regard
that not ſo much as the leaſt part of the
vertue of Vitriol can come into the
<hi>Aquafort,</hi> becauſe that all its vertue
and acidity as ſoon as the Saltpeter
joyneth thereunto and groweth hot
with it, is fettered and tyed as it
were by the Niter, by reaſon of the
ſpecial love betwixt them both, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
much might be ſaid and plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
which for brevities ſake
is now paſſed by; inſomuch that it is
impoſſible that any part of the Vitriol
can come over, its nature being altered
inſtantly, ſo ſoon as the Niter groweth
hot with it: but becauſe this ſhining
green very Volatil ſpirit conſiſteth of
the true eſſential parts and Spirits of
Vitriol and Niter, therefore it is clean
of another Nature then <hi>Aquafort,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34983:31"/>
which is but a ſingle acid Spirit of the
Saltpeter, and therefore not to be
abhorred, which <hi>I</hi> counted very fit to
be mentioned, reſerving the reſt for
another time; and waving alſo other
more ſorts of conceited greenneſſe,
got by Diſtillation, to avoid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity.</p>
               <p>The riſe of theſe and all other errors
is only thence, that the ground of the
double or ſatiated Spirits was unknown
unto the Seekers of truth, without
which Spirits the Copper never can
come over and turne to a <hi>liquamen vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,</hi>
which ground if it had been
known, the true green ſpirit would
have been diſcovered long ago, which
<hi>I</hi> clearly enough have expounded in
the two former Chapters. Now this
double corroſive, having reduced the
Copper into a green ſweet Vitriol,
doth not adhere outwardly thereunto,
as the other corroſives, for this is the
only reaſon why the others cannot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over the Copper; becauſe they do
not reach to the inmoſt center of the
Copper; but only, as hungry corroding
ſpirits, fall outwardly upon the Metal,
and do but adhere unto it, hence it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34983:31"/>
comes to paſſe, that being forced by a
ſtrong fire, they are conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
their habitation, and the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
remaineth behind of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as before, in regard that it may
be quickly melted again into a body.
But the Double corroſive, as hath
been often mentioned, doth not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
the Metal, nor falleth upon it
with ſuch an hungry fury, much leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth
outwardly unto it, but ſofteneth
it throughly, and penetrateth to its
very inmoſt, yea uniteth it ſelf ſo
firmly and ſo deeply with the Copper,
that it cannot leave it, being forced by
the fire; but in regard that it is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
Volatil Spirit, the Copper muſt
alſo come over with it, as a flying Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil
Spirit, in ſo much that not one
grain of the Metal remaineth behind;
for if you put ſome of it in a Crucible,
and let it ſtand in a ſtrong fire for ſome
houres, the Metal will quite evaporate
that not the leaſt <hi>Veſtigium</hi> of Vitriol
remaineth to be ſeen; but in a cloſe
Veſſel or Retort it cannot be done with
ſuch eaſe and expedition as in an open
melting pot: For the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and there is required a far ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34983:32"/>
fire, and many Cohobations, as
our Philoſopher ſaith, <hi>loco citato, per
repetitas cohobationes inſigniter volatilis
factus Spiritus,</hi> before all will come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which will coſt time, labour, and
patience, and there muſt be no haſte,
but all muſt be done with diſcretion,
without violence; and great care and
conſideration muſt be had of the nature
of things, how they will be uſed, that
you do them right, and according to
Nature; which you muſt learn from
experience and from the nature of
thoſe things which you have in hand;
for here all information ceaſeth, which
one man can impart unto another,
here we muſt go into the School of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſharpen our judgment and
underſtanding for to penetrate the
ſubjects in hand, but above all, by
prayers made in a child-like ſimplicity
and humbleneſſe, obtain the bleſſing of
a good ſucceſſe from our God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>I</hi> have mentioned of Copper,
the caſe is the ſame with Gold, which
being put into its double and ſatiated
corroſive melteth therein, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition,
like ice in warme water;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34983:32"/>
And becauſe this corroſive ſofteneth
the Gold to its very inmoſt parts, it
alſo cometh over with it readily by
manifold cohobations, with very fair
colours, for the tinging ſpirit or <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the Gold, is very much exalted
in its tincture and colour by this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
corroſive, inſomuch that it cometh
over in a far more glorious ſplendour,
than the beſt gold looketh of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and it is very like unto the
ſplendour and beauty of the Sun riſing
over the Horizon, which is no ſmall
delight to the eyes to behold: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
both it and the Copper may eaſily
be reduced again into a body, and
therefore it is but a preparation or
fitting of the Gold and Copper, that
they may be made fit to yield after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their ſtrength and blood-red
juice unto the artificial hand of the
Philoſopher, as we ſhall now further
underſtand.</p>

               <p>ALthough the Copper, as even now

of a Volatile green Spirit, let none
therefore conceive that Copper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

is ſo far unlockt and opened, that it
muſt alwayes remain ſuch a ſpiritual
Subſtance, and that it cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

no means: for although the whole
Crew of all common Chymical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
in their Books do unanimouſly
teach (yea rejoyce highly in it, though
indiſcreetly) that when they forced
over a Metal with corroſive, or acid
Liquors, by means of many cohobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they count the ſame to be the true
<hi>quinta eſſentia</hi> of the Metal, or the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

alſo highly boaſt, and glory, thereof,
and ſo hitherto ſeduced one another,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34983:33"/>
and by ſweet words perſwaded the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
or Readers to applaud it: of
which ſort of proceſſes I could ſet down
a great number, which might be taken
out of their Books, if I did not ſpare
the pretious time and Paper; yea our
Philoſopher himſelf (in thoſe years of
his <hi>Tyrocinium)</hi> lay ſick of this diſeaſe
of Ignorance; conceiving, when by
means of certain corroſives and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
cohobation he fetcht over the gold
<hi>in forma punicei olei volatilis,</hi> that he
had the true <hi>aurum potabile:</hi> But the
matter is clean otherwiſe; for there
is a twofold Solution of Metals: the
one Friendly and Natural; the other,
violent; the former is fundamental
and radical, and the <hi>ſolvent</hi> and the
<hi>ſolutum</hi> can never be more ſevered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
but by reaſon of the great
ſimilitude of both their natures, they
twane come to be one, and remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
unchangeably and unſeparably one:
but in this <hi>viz.</hi> in the violent ſolution
it is not ſo, but although it hath ſome
ſemblance of a radical ſolution, yet
the event doth ſhew that there is ſuch
a difference betwixt this and the other
and that they are as unlike unto one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34983:34"/>
another, as the ſubſtance it ſelf, and
the ſhadow of the ſubſtance, in regard
that in this the ſolvent may be
throughly ſeparated from the <hi>ſolutum</hi>
by Art, and the <hi>ſolutum</hi> being melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a ſtrong fire, will return to be
what it was, before it ſuffered that
violent ſolution; but in the other,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the natural ſolution, not only
the ſolvent can never be ſeparated
from the <hi>ſolutum,</hi> but alſo the <hi>ſolutum</hi> in
this ſolution becometh alwayes more
precious, more noble, more excellent
and far higher in its virtue, than it
was before; but in the violent ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the <hi>ſolutum</hi> remains in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Nature and ſubſtance, and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fitted for the true eſſential, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,

<hi>nodus enodandus,</hi> in regard that

and ſhamefully deceived in this,
that they count violent ſolutions for
to be natural, and ſo delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and acquieſce therein, thinking
then to have already apprehended
the truth of the matter, and taking
no further care to inquire after the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34983:34"/>
ſincere and genuine condition of the
true natural ſolution, therefore I
muſt lay down the buſineſs clearly
and nakedly, to the end that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
ſeekers of truth may be no
more gulled by the deceitfull, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
lying and painted Proceſſes,
wherewith all common Chymical
books are filled up, and abound, and
by the ſearchers of Nature with great
expences are tryed in vain, but that
they may open their eyes themſelves,
and begin to ſee with their own eyes,
and rightly ponder and examine the
Nature of things they are about, and
ſo work according to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not credit ſo lightly hereafter
thoſe ſweet lying promiſes of boaſting
Authors, nor ſpend their precious
time, hard labour, and great coſt upon
them. To the end therefore, that the
truth-deſirous Reader may ſo much
the better comprehend and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this highly neceſſary ground, I
will lay it down unto him, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
two ſorts of ſolutions, ſuch as are
of a quite different nature: and firſt
let him conſider the ſolution of the
Copper by the double or ſatiated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34983:35"/>
whereof I have taught in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter, where not only the
Metal, <hi>viz.</hi> Copper, is diſſolved ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
gently, ſweetly, without any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition
in its double <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> but
alſo afterwards ſo intimately adhered
thereunto, that it went over together
with it in forme of a very Volatil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which may ſeem therefore unto
the ignorant to be a natural, and for
the future, inſeparable ſolution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that it is done friendly, and
proveth inſeparable from its ſolvent;
for that the <hi>ſolutum</hi> according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, by reaſon of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
harmony and likeneſs betwixt
them, accompanieth its ſolvent on
high; and <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs, that this is
ſuch a nice matter, as that it may fool
not only <hi>Tyrones,</hi> but alſo thoſe who
conceit to have experienced and tryed
a great deal, into a belief, that this
ſo ſpiritual and Volatil Metallick va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
is the true <hi>quinta eſſentia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
experience ſheweth to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that if this pretended <hi>quinta eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia
Metallica</hi> be thrown upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
all that is Metallick ſeparateth
it ſelf from the ſolvent, and being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34983:35"/>
put into a melting fire, turneth again
to ſuch a Metal as it was before.
Whence the Reader plainly ſeeth, that
it was but a ſemblance of an eſſential
or radical ſolution, and that not the
leaſt change or exaltation hapned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Metal, unleſs that by an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
hand it be preſerved in its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility,
ſo that it return not to its
former compactneſs, as hereafter ſhall
be taught. Now on the other ſide,
let the ſeeker of truth look upon
Sulphur, how the ſame being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockt
in diſtilled Oyl doth turn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its inmoſt red Tincture, and
ſo is opened to the very Center and
inmoſt root, and then how firmly thoſe
two not only cleave together, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they both turn to be one,
but alſo never, no not by any manner
of way, can again be parted aſunder;
yea this is not all, but the Sulphur
becometh ten times more precious,
excellenter, and more powerfull in
its virtues, than it was before, all
which you may experiment thus;
Take common Sulphur, or elſe the
Combuſtible Sulphur of Antimony, or
of any other ſubject, and diſſolve it in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34983:36"/>
a diſtilled Oyl, ſo that the Oyl turneth
very thick or blood-red, put this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
into a Retort, and draw the
Oyl over very gently, and it will come
over clear and white; and when none
more will come over clear, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the fire ſtrongly, and at length
cometh the laſt Oyl, and carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
part of the diſſolved Sulphur
like a red Oyl; then poure the firſt
clear Oyl, that came over firſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
upon the remaining dark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brown
ſubſtance, Cohobating the ſame from
it again, and repeating the ſame ſo
often, untill moſt of all your extract
be come over, and all your Oyl be
diſtilled over very red and rich of the
Tincture; and your ſolvent and <hi>ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
will be ſo united, that by no art
they are to be parted aſunder; they by
reaſon of the likeneſs of their ſubſtance
ſo delighting in each other, and ſo
intimately being united together, that
they both are come to be one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and ſo either both flee together
away, being driven by the force of
fire, or elſe by diſcreet wayes may be
fixed together into a permanent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
yea, not only are they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partible,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34983:36"/>
but alſo the diſſolved and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized
Sulphur, is of far greater power
and efficacy in Phyſick, than before, as
dayly experience may teach every one:
and although this ſolution of Sulphur in
oyl be not properly a Philoſophical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
but only the ground and right
ſource of the ſame, yet it is ſufficiently
demonſtrative, and therein as in a true
pourtraicture, the eſſential, radical and
natural ſolution of the Wiſe may be
repreſented and compared with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
violent Solution, to the end that
by comparing together theſe two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſolutions, the truth of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may be made manifeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that
although the forementioned ſolution
of the Copper reſembleth much to a
radical ſolution of the metal, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the natural and true ſolution
in theſe two points, that the ſolution
of the metal is done gently, ſweetly,
and without ebullition; and then that
the Metal readily aſcendeth on high
with its Solvent, and ſo ſeemed to be
turned into one ſpirit, and one indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſubſtance therewith; yet becauſe
the Metal can be ſevered again from its
<hi>ſolvent,</hi> it is evident that this volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34983:37"/>
of the Copper is but a violent
elevation, and not a ſpontaneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance,
ariſen from the likeneſſe
of nature, as it happened with the
Sulphur and Oyle, and as it is the
condition of all true ſolutions, having
their riſe from ſimilitude of nature.
And therefore not only the now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Solution and Volatil green ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Copper, but alſo and much
more the Putatitious Oyles, <hi>Spiritus</hi>
or <hi>Eſſentiae Metallicae</hi> of your common
Chymical Writers <hi>(viz. Hartman, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notus,
Crollius, Libavius, Agricola,
Beguin, Rhenanus, Faber Monſpelien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
Glauber, Keſler,</hi> and many others
of the like ſtamp, whoſe books are in
the hands of every one) are nothing
elſe, but (as our Philoſopher calleth
his formers fooleries in Gold in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymnaſmate
meteori §. 6.) mentitus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi>
a deceitful eſſence, which hath a
reſemblence of the eſſential ſolution,
but in effect is nothing leſſe than ſuch,
in regard that it can readily returne
again to what it was before, and a
ſeeker of truth darkneth himſelf not a
little, by doating upon ſuch ſpecious
and deceitful eſſences, and remaining
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34983:37"/>
thereby; For here we muſt not ſtay and
acquieſce, in that the Copper is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a ſpiritual condition and Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but here we muſt but now truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and endeavour (in regard that it is
evident by this my deduction, that the
Copper is not eſſentially or according
to nature unlockt as yet, but only fitted
for further ſolution) how to get the true
<hi>Anima</hi> thence, by a true radical and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſolution: Therefore, knowing, that
moſt men are blind in this point, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in thoſe putatitious Metallick eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I counted it neceſſary, in imparting
the Doctrine of Volatiliſation of the
Copper, to admoniſh, that ſuch and the
like ſolutions of Metals ought not to
be valued higher than they are, and
that none deceive himſelf, thinking
that he hath a treaſure of health,
whereas it is but a ſhadow: and ſuch a
putatitious <hi>Eſſentia metallica</hi> may be
reduced again by an artificial hand in
a ſhort time, yea in few houres, to ſuch
a groſs Metal, as it was before, as the
experienced <hi>Chymiater,</hi> and diligent
ſearcher of Nature <hi>Zwelfferus</hi> doth
confeſſe in his Writings, that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
known Tinctures, Eſſences, &amp;c.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34983:38"/>
of Metals, are nothing elſe but ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Metallick bodies, but not at all
true ſeparations of the Tincture or
ſoul from the body.</p>
               <p>However it being very neceſſary,
that the ſame be effected, if we mean
to enjoy the Metallick <hi>Arcana,</hi> and
next the bleſſing of God rely upon
them in grievous diſeaſes; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
going on further, and enquiring
how to get and ſeparate the pure Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
(which is the only thing we aim
at) from the fitted and prepared Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
We find, that our Volatil Copper
is ſurrounded with a great quantity of
the double corroſive, which of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
muſt be ſevered from it firſt, if we
intend to get the pure <hi>Anima</hi> without
heterogeneous mixture; eſpecially the
corroſive having already acted its
part as much as it could do, <hi>viz.</hi> rent
the Copper into the moſt ſubtle volatile
parts, and reduced it to the ſmalleſt
duſt; Now the ſeparation thereof from
the Copper, muſt not be done by the
means of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or the like Volatil
things, which having a greater affinity
with, or inclination to this double
corroſive than the Copper hath, do
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34983:38"/>
quickly unite therewith, and being
alſo Volatil, by one only diſtillation,
do rent this double corroſive <hi>per</hi> force
from the Copper, and ſo leave the
Copper in the bottom as a groſſe dead
powder, which is hardened again and
fit for nothing; by no means, for ſo
all your Labour which you beſtowed
upon the Volatiliſation would be loſt,
and ſuch a dead powder would not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from another common <hi>Crocus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi>
made by common <hi>Aquafort,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Regis;</hi> for in regard that the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
corroſive hath not only quite turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the inſide of the Copper outwards,
and ſo perfectly fitted it for extraction,
but alſo the ſweet <hi>Anima</hi> of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
by this corroſive and its power, as
by a reſuſcitative and quickning means,
doth ſhine forth; and without ſuch a
pertinent means this Tincture could
not play forth; therefore this corroſive
muſt be ſevered and abſtracted from
the Copper very leaſurely and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly
as it were, to the end that the
Copper may remain turned outwards
with its ſweetneſſe, and unchanged in
its forthſhining quality, and poſture of
ſolubility, wherein it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34983:39"/>
if ſo be that this corroſive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Copper is as it were raiſed from
death, be abſtracted from it <hi>per</hi> force,
and at once, by <hi>Mercury</hi> or the like; for
in this manner each atom of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
would be as hard compacted, and
lockt up again as before, its reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
corroſive being taken thence by
force, and at once; But there muſt be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
other more properthings, ſuch as 1.
may carry the corroſive thence, not at
once, and by violence, but by degrees,
gently and ſweetly; 2. which do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
the Copper, and ſever it from
its double corroſive, but prove a <hi>ſolvent</hi>
both of the Copper, and of the double
corroſive; and ſo, notwithſtanding that
in every cohobation ſome of the double
corroſive goes along, yet preſerve the
Copper in its former nature, <hi>viz.</hi> in its
ſolubility, and in this manner the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and all its atomes are preſerved in
the ſame condition; which only and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is performed by the ſpirit of wine,
as our Philoſopher teacheth us, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words, <hi>Sal Armoniacus inde poſt
modum auferri debet per ſpiritus vini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitas
distillationes, in Duumviratu, §. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Therefore you muſt take highly recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34983:39"/>
ſpirit of Wine, and mix it with
the green ſpirit of Copper, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
it gently, and then poure it on
again, and then abſtract it again, and
ſuch cohobation you muſt oftentimes
repeat, doing it very gently, and the
corroſive as a very Volatil ſpirit will
come over by degrees with the ſpirit
of Wine, as with the like volatil ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and let fall of it ſelf by degrees
the Copper which it contained, as you
will ſee, that in each cohobation ſome
of the Metal will be found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
in forme of a very light ſpongious
duſt, and in caſe you miſſe, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto my ſelf ſometimes, that the
diſtillation ſhould be too forcible, and
the fire too ſtrong, there chanceth
ſometime ſome of the Metal to come
over of ſuch wonderful fair colours,
that it cannot be beheld ſufficiently,
and ſuch curious colours remain in the
head, repreſenting the moſt beautiful
Peacocks tail, unleſſe the double cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
be diſtilled through this head,
for then all will melt again into it; but
that which by the violent diſtillation
is come over of the Copper, falleth
afterwards alſo to the bottom in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34983:40"/>
Receiver as light as down Feathers, and
hath the ſame colour, as thoſe <hi>atomi</hi>
have, which precipitated in the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbit,</hi>
to which alſo they are to be
added. It is alſo further here to be
known, that the double corroſive not
only therefore lets fall its Metal, the
Copper, becauſe that it comes over
gently with the Spirit of Wine, but
alſo for this reaſon, becauſe the great
ſharpneſſe and edge of the corroſive is
blunted and abated by the Spirit of
Wine, inſomuch that it is not able to
hold the Metal any longer, becauſe it
hath loſt its ſtrength or corroſiveneſſe;
whereof you may be convinced by this
experiment, that if you mix this
green ſpirit, with a ſufficient quantity
of Spirit of Wine, and ſet it together
in continued digeſtion for a competent
time <hi>(viz.</hi> for a great ſpace of time of
many moneths) the Metal will alſo
precipitate ſlowly and by degrees, in
forme of a very ſpongious light duſt:
But this being too tedious, the more
expedite way is by cohobation; for
then you will far ſooner attain to its
period. Now theſe cohobations being
continued to ſufficiency, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34983:40"/>
as they ought, and all the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
being got over, you have then
the true <hi>Crocus Veneris, Martis, Auri,</hi> &amp;c.
according to the Metal which you
have taken of farr higher and nobler
Vertues, than all the <hi>Croci</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Writers; and however they be
prepared, yet they cannot be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto theſe; for their <hi>Croci</hi> are
dead bodies, but here is a reſuſcitated
and quickned body, its ſoul being
quite turned outwards, and in its full
luſtre, which you may perceive by the
glorious ſplendour, which this <hi>Crocus</hi>
with its choiceſt colours leaveth in the
head, if peradventure it be driven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by too ſtrong a heat: Now by this
light turned outwards, this <hi>Crocus</hi> hath
ſo great vertue, as well for inward
Medicine, as externally to be uſed in
plaiſters, ſalves, and other ſorts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Medicaments, as hardly can
be believed, before it be experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And therefore alſo I will referr it
to the experience of the diligent ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of truth, who will find far more
Vertue in it than he is able to conceive
at preſent; But to clear this <hi>I</hi> cannot
forbear to mention, why the antient
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34983:41"/>
wiſe Authours of the highly noble
<hi>Chymia,</hi> called theſe reſuſcitated and
revificated <hi>atomes</hi> of Metallick bodies
<hi>Crocus,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Saffran?</hi> Now
he that hath but a little Enquired into
the Vertues of this <hi>Crocus revificatus</hi>
by experience will quickly know the
reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe this <hi>Crocus Metalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
doth perfectly poſſeſs thoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Virtues of <hi>Saffron,</hi> which is the
King of all Vegetables, and therefore
called the Philoſophers <hi>aroma,</hi> or ſpice,
as our Philoſopher <hi>de Lithiaſi cap. 7.
§.</hi> 14. declareth, adding that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roma
Philoſophorum,</hi> by reaſon of its
Golden Tincture, is the ſureſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
againſt the Stone. For as Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron,
1. cauſeth reſt, 2. comforteth the
heart, 3. openeth obſtructions, 4.
mollifieth and ripeneth that which is
hard and unripe, 5. healeth all that

from all Sympomes; So likewiſe, yea
in a farr higher degree, and with far
more Efficacy, this our <hi>Crocus Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicus</hi>
cauſeth reſt, and appeaſeth pain,
powerfully ſtrengtheneth weak Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
openeth the moſt dangerous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of all the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> yea ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34983:41"/>
all Fluxes, by vertue of the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Anima</hi> turned outwards, and as
well in Tumours, as Ulcers and wounds,
affordeth ſuch quick help, as no Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Medicines of the common Writers
can parallel, as the Reader having
tryed it, will find by experience. I
can alſo not omit to relate the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Vertues of the Spirit of Wine,
which carried over the double corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and is united therewith: For
in it is a double power or vertue, firſt
of the corroſive, which in its nature
by reaſon of its duplicity, and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil, doth far exceed
all Acid Liquors, and therefore alſo
is of great vertue in the Stone; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe of the ſplendour or
radiation, which this double ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceceived
from the Gold-like <hi>Anima</hi> of
the Copper; for although not the
leaſt <hi>pulviſculus</hi> of this Gold-like Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
remained with this corroſive, yet
having received its radiation and kept
it, which is as it were by a ſeal deeply
imprinted therein, and thence exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in vertue beyond what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of it ſelf. Therefore let this <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
vini eſurinus</hi> be commended to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34983:42"/>
you in all caſes, in which you uſe
<hi>Acida</hi> and <hi>Eſurina,</hi> and you will find
with joy its great power in allaying
all manner of unnatural heat, beyond
all known Acid Spirits: Alſo its great
Corroſiveneſs is much mitigated and
abated by the Spirit of Wine, and ſo
ſafer for uſe than before; and being
faſt and intimately united with the
<hi>ſpiritus vini,</hi> it quickly uniteth, by
the means thereof, with the <hi>Archeus,</hi>
and performeth its operation with
much expedition, becauſe that the
Virtue of the <hi>ſpiritus vini</hi> is readily
entertained, and ſo the power of this
excellent <hi>Acetum Eſurinum</hi> penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
alſo with it, and gently cooleth,
and refreſheth the incenſed ſpirits.</p>

in ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> which is of a like
fiery Nature as the Tincture of the

therefore called by our Philoſopher

Fire; conſequently cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
ſevered, or radically opened,
but by a very Fiery, penetrating, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement;
and ſharply ſeparating Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
ſubſtance, which alone hath
the power, out of the hard ligament
of Metallick Coagulation (performed
in the Copper by Nature) by a
ſtrong Magnetick Virtue, eagerly to
attract its like, and by its great Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
to melt, ſoften, and open it to
the very inmoſt ground, root, and
Center: ſuch a Water or <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
it muſt be, as toucheth nothing at all
of the Body of the copper, nor deſireth
to touch, much leſs to diſſolve the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34983:43"/>
leaſt of it, yea hath no power at all to
do ſo, but barely and only falleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Anima</hi> or Sulphur of the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as upon its like, and receiveth the
ſame into it ſelf: ſuch a liquor you
muſt look for in the Fiery principle,
as I diſcovered above in the ſecond
Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> in the nature of the
Oyl, which by the ſtrong power of the
Fire being turned into fiery Salt, by
Artificial operation muſt be tranſlated
from the ſeat of a fixed Salt, into that
of a Volatile, penetrating, Fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Now you may ſay, ſince this
<hi>Menstruum</hi> is ſuch a Fiery ſubſtance,
why can it not by its ſtrong power as
well extract the <hi>Anima</hi> out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Crocus Veneris, Auri, Martis, &amp;c.</hi>
as out of that which hath been made
Volatil, whereby much labour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and time might be ſaved in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of this <hi>Arcanum?</hi> For anſwer
know, that therefore it cannot be,
becauſe that the Sulphur is too faſt
tyed to the <hi>Corpus</hi> by the hard Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Coagulation, and afterwards by
the melting Fire (when the Metal
was melted into a <hi>Corpus)</hi> totally
turned inwards, and lockt up into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34983:43"/>
death, inſomuch that though the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
be ground and powdered ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo ſmall, yet this Fiery <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
cannot lay hold of its like, becauſe
it is not turned outwards again, nor
freed from its hard Coagulation, and
reduced into a Spongious, porous, light,
ſubſtance; which two properties are
of neceſſity required in a <hi>Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallicus,</hi>
that this Fiery <hi>Menſtruum</hi> may
have ingreſſe to take the Element of
Fire from the Atomes of the <hi>Crocus</hi>
into it ſelf, and eſſentially to unlock
it.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two properties, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Extraverſion of the <hi>Anima,</hi> and then
the Spongiouſneſs (in which two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſiſteth the fitting of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals)
both are obtained by Volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which is to be done by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means, but double Spirits, and
therefore the Philoſophers kept this
way of fitting or preparing the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
as ſecret, as the extraction or
ſeparation of the Tincture from the
Body; becauſe they knew, that the
one without the other will be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Volatiliſed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
without the Volatiliſed <hi>Crocus</hi> will
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34983:44"/>
avail little; on the other ſide the
<hi>Crocus</hi> without an <hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil will
not yield its pearle, ſo both opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
remained buried in the like ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
But that you may the better
underſtand this, and clearly ſee and
acknowledge the ſame, as in a printed
Image ſtanding before you, <hi>viz.</hi> how
highly neceſſary, not only the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
lightneſſe, but alſo the Volatility
is for extraction of Mineral and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick
Tinctures, and that you may
be convinced, that without ſuch a
preparation the <hi>Anima</hi> cannot be had
nor obtained, I will ſet the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you in Antimony, as in a clear
looking glaſs: Take therefore inſtead
of the now mentioned fiery water or
<hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil, a very Fiery diſtilled
Oyl, and inſtead of the Volatil
<hi>Crocus Veneris,</hi> place Antimony,
grind the ſame very ſmall, yea by
much grinding reduce it into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable
duſt: this impalpable duſt of
Antimony put into a Phiol, poure
upon it the moſt Fiery diſtilled Oyl
that you are able to get, let it boyle
for many dayes together, and you
will ſee, that the Oyl will remain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34983:44"/>
without change as it was before, and
the Antimony will alſo remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in its former nature; Lo now,
although you had never ſo Fiery an
Oyl, and although in the ſmalleſt
ground Antimony truly lyes ſome fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
thing, which hath great affinity
with the fiery Oyl, and may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
thence, yet the Oyl was not
able at this time to perform it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it touched every leaſt <hi>Pulviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
of the Antimony; But why ſo?
Truly therefore only, becauſe that
Antimony by nature being ſtated in
a hard Mineral Coagulation, the Oyl
hath no power, though it be never
ſo fiery, to untye this hard Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Coagulation, and to ſever
its like from thence, unleſs the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
be firſt prepared, and become
firſt Volatil, then alſo Spongious,
light, and ſwelled up, that is, that
each Atome of the Antimony do
ſwell big and grow Spongious, and
the Tincture, or <hi>Principium Elementi
ignis,</hi> be manifeſted therein, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
outwards; Take therefore your
Antimony, and by a very ſtrong fire
force it on high, and of a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34983:45"/>
Body you will get very light
and Spongious Atomes, which will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
yield their <hi>Anima</hi> or <hi>Elementum
ignis</hi> unto a Fiery Oyl, for if upon
theſe light Volatil Atomes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
in a Phiol, you poure a Fiery
Oyl, and boyle it together for a few
hours, then the Fiery Oyl will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
its like, <hi>viz,</hi> the Fiery <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium</hi>
in Antimony, attracteth and
radically diſſolveth the ſame, and
tingeth it ſelf blood-red of the ſame,
which before it could not do, when
the Antimony was not prepared as yet:
ſo the caſe is the ſame in this our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
in Copper, that although
our <hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil be very Fiery,
penetrating and powerfull in molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
melting and opening to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Center all what in the Copper
is of affinity with its Fierie nature,
yet it cannot prevail with it at all,
nor extract the leaſt for all its great
Fierineſs, unleſſe the Copper be firſt
inverted, and the interiour extraver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the <hi>Corpus</hi> looſened by Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſation
from its hard Coagulation,
and ſo rent into the ſmalleſt atomes,
and turned into a very light, Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

ſubſtauce, then and not before
hath the Fierie Water of the <hi>Alcali</hi>
Volatil power to abſtract its like, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Elementum ignis</hi> from the Copper,
and radically to unlock it.</p>
               <p>Take therefore your Volatil <hi>Crocus,</hi>
whither of gold, copper, ſteel, or any
other Metallick Body, put it in a Phiol,
and poure the Volatiliſed <hi>Alcali</hi> upon
it (of the preparation whereof I will
informe you by and by) ſhut the
Phiol cloſe, and let it boyle gently
together in ſand, about the ſpace of
ſix or eight hours, and this Volatil
Fiery Spirit, will extract its like,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Elementum ignis</hi> from the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and receive the ſame into it ſelf
by Sympathy, and diſſolve it radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
by its greatly penetrating power;
Now when you ſee, that this Fiery
Water is well Saturated and thickned
with the Tincture of the copper, then
let it cool, and poure off what is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and poure on freſh Spirit, and
let this alſo diſſolve as before, and
ſo continue, until there be nothing
left in the <hi>Crocus</hi> for to extract, and
the Fiery <hi>Menſtruum</hi> can get no more:
then poure the Solutions all together,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34983:46"/>
and abſtract the Fierie ſpirit gently,
which you may uſe again for the like
operation; and in the bottom of the
glaſs you will have the true <hi>Metallum
potabile;</hi> if of Gold, <hi>aurum potabile;</hi>
of Copper, <hi>Cuprum potabile,</hi> and ſo
forth of all other Metals. And ſuch
a Noble Tincture is indeed and in
truth a true potable Metallick eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
being meer ſpirit, power and
Light, and not reducible into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
alone, becauſe it is freed from all
Corporeouſneſſe, and is all ſpirit, and
virtue, as our Philoſopher ſaith <hi>de Lithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſi
cap. 8. §. 5. Ignis ſive Sulphur Veneris
non ampliùs reducitur in metallum per
ſe, quia prout nullum Sulphur est Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallum,
ita omnis Mercurius Metallicus
eſt verum metallum;</hi> And from this
Tincture you may confidently expect
all thoſe great Virtues, which in the
Philoſophers Writings are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto a true <hi>metallum potabile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But about this ſolution you may
obſerve, that when you have abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Fiery <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> at laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſome of it remaineth ſtill with
the extracted Tincture, by reaſon of
the likeneſs of their ſubſtance; for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34983:46"/>
they act into one another, inſomuch
that they lay hold of and retain one
another, and ſo turn to one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
melting into one another: yea
if this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſhould be boyled
a long time with this Tincture, it
would totally remain with it, and
turn therewith into one fixed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
for this ſolution is <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
and therefore each one tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muteth
the other into its nature, and
being both turned into one ſubſtance,
they can never any more be parted
aſunder. But let no Man think, that
becauſe that part of this <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
remaineth with the <hi>ſolutum,</hi> that
therefore the caſe is the ſame
here as it is with your Corroſive
<hi>Menſtruum's,</hi> whoſe ſtrongeſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with the <hi>ſolutum,</hi> and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
aſcendeth; by no means, for that
part which riſeth here firſt, is of the
ſame force and ſtrength in its Fieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as that which cometh over laſt;
for in this Fiery ſolvent there is no
ſuch imparity of parts as in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives,
but this Fiery <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is
totally ſimilar, and uniform in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and knoweth of no other divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34983:47"/>
but that either it remaineth
totally with the <hi>ſolutum</hi> in the bottom,
like a fixed Salt, or elſe totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth
therewith like a volatil ſpirit,
and therefore that which after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is drawn over from the <hi>ſolutum,</hi>
is not at all changed nor diminiſhed
from its former ſtrength, which it had
before the ſolution. Alſo let no man
wonder at it, that here part of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
remaineth with the <hi>Solutum,</hi>
for the Law of Uniformity in ſubſtance
doth carry it, like eagerly laying hold
of its like, and unſeparably uniting it
ſelf therewith.</p>
               <p>And this is the chief property, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
an Eſſential Natural Solution is
diſtinguiſhed from a Corroſive one,
that alwayes the Corroſive by art can
be ſevered again from the <hi>Solutum,</hi>
but the Eſſential <hi>ſolvent</hi> by no means!
Hence our Philoſopher himſelf in this
ſence confeſſeth, concerning the
Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> that it is ſtayed or
retained by its <hi>Compar,</hi> and tranſmuted
into another Nature; his words here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in <hi>in ignota actione Regiminis §.</hi> 11.
are theſe, <hi>Liquor Alkahest omnia totius
univerſi corpora tangibilia perfecte redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:34983:47"/>
                  <hi>in vitam eorundem primam, abſque
ulla ſui mutatione, viriumque diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione:
à ſolo autem ſuo compari ſubter
jugum trahitur atque permutatur.</hi> Hence
the ancient wiſe men ſaid, <hi>Naturâ
natura gaudet, natura naturam vincit,
permutat, &amp;c.</hi> And the whole Nature
and all the powers thereof do teſtify
the ſame, that like is alwaies inclined
to ſtay with its like; yea in this very
point conſiſteth all the whole groweth
which happeneth in Nature, whereof
I do not intend here to ſpeak more
largely, but only I was occaſioned to
point at it by our natural Solution of
the <hi>anima</hi> of the Copper, which as a
true fire retaineth the fiery <hi>ſolvent,</hi>
prepared of the <hi>Alcali,</hi> as its like, and
is inclined to remain inſeparably united
therewith. Now ſome may ſay, ſince
the tincture of Copper, or Element of
fire is wholly turned outwards in this
Volatil and well prepared <hi>Crocus,</hi> why
may it not as well be extracted and
ſevered by a fixed <hi>Alcali,</hi> as by an
<hi>Alcali</hi> volatil, for the other is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fiery, and of a like nature with the
ſoul of the Copper, and why muſt the
<hi>Alcali</hi> firſt be volatiliſed? for a fixed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34983:48"/>
                  <hi>Alcali</hi> might do it as well, and the
work might be ſooner ended, and
much time and expences ſaved? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that although a fixed <hi>Alcali</hi>
makes a ſhew as if it would and could
ſever this fiery <hi>principium</hi> from the
Copper, yet in effect, and in truth it
is not ſo, and that little which the
fixed <hi>Alcali</hi> ſevered from the <hi>Crocus Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri</hi>
is nothing to, be accounted of, in
compariſon of what remaineth unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated;
the reaſon is the groſsneſs of
the <hi>Alcali,</hi> it being too thick, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
and material, and not as it
ſhould be ſpiritual, volatil, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating;
hence it is, that though you
take an <hi>Alcali</hi> as fiery as that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the tongue, as much as a live or
burning coal (it being poſſible to get
ſuch a vehement burning Salt <hi>Acali</hi>
from <hi>Mars,</hi> which in a moment touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tongue but very gently, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſame, as if it were red hot iron)
and diſſolve the ſame in ſome Water,
and put therein your Volatil prepared
<hi>Crocus</hi> of Copper, and boyle it ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thinking by this great fierineſs to
ſever the Element of Fire from the
<hi>Crocus,</hi> yet for all that you get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34983:48"/>
and all your labour is loſt, the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Alcali</hi> being much too groſs and too
weak to untie this hard Metallick liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But if you mix that <hi>Alcali</hi> with
the <hi>Crocus,</hi> grinding both well together,
and Endeavour the ſeparation by fire
<hi>in viâ ſiccâ,</hi> you will reach ſo far,
that becauſe by the External fire, the
fierineſs of the <hi>Alcali</hi> is much fortifyed
and becometh <hi>intenſer</hi> than it was of
its Nature, and ſo the prepared <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
is more opened and more fitted
thereby for Extraction, that in this
manner the <hi>Alcali</hi> layes hold of
ſome of the Tincture, and ſevereth
the ſame, but being wholly material,
it reduceth the Copper on the other
ſide by its groſs fiery ſaltneſs again
into a body, inſomuch that you get
again material groſs Copper, and ſo
all your former tedious Labour is
brought to nothing. But that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
which the <hi>Alcali</hi> lad hold on,
though it be the true Sulphur and
Gold-like Tincture of the Copper,
for this <hi>Alcali</hi> being rub'd upon Silver
with ſome Moyſture, covereth it over
very fair with a Gold-colour, very
pleaſant to look upon, but there is ſo
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34983:49"/>
little of it, that it is rather to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a ſhadow than ſubſtance of the
Tincture: Moreover, though it were fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in this manner to ſever all the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
from the <hi>Crocus,</hi> yet it would be
barely ſeparated, but not eſſentially diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
&amp; become an opened <hi>oyl</hi> or <hi>juice,</hi>
for to this paſs it ought to be advanced,
that part of the natural ſolvent remain
with the <hi>ſolutum,</hi> and by its fuſile moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
this be reduced into a juice or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which the fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> is not able
to do, in regard that the ſame it ſelf is
no ſpiritual fuſile oyl or Spirit but a
groſs material Salt, which very eaſily
can be ſevered again from this ſmall
quantity of the extracted <hi>Sulphur Cupri,</hi>
if it be diſſolved in water, and a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
dropped thereinto; for then the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
uniteth with the corroſive, and lets
the extracted Sulphur fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
which after exſiccation is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but what would become then of our
Philoſophers doctrine, who will have,
that after this Gold-like <hi>anima</hi> is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the body, it is to be coagulated
and fixed; but how can it be coagulated,
if it be not firſt reduced to a Liquor by
an eſſential ſolvent, that is, ſo ſoftened,
that it remain an Oyl, or fuſile penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34983:49"/>
ſpiritual ſubſtance, after its ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the body, which is the true
mark or ſign, that this Gold-like <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
is eſſentially and naturally unlockt,
and untyed from its inmoſt center;
ſuch an excellency can the groſs mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<hi>Alcali</hi> not afford, as may be ſeen
by that ſmall quantity of the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
Sulphur, although the ſame alſo
hath its rare Vertues. Alſo let no
man fancy that ſuch an Eſſential ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be performed by the ſpirit of
Wine, that if one ſhould take this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
after it hath received that little
quantity of the <hi>anima Cupri,</hi> and grind
it very ſmall, and then poure upon it
highly rectifyed Spirit of wine, and
ſet it to extract in a warme place, that
in this manner the extracted Tincture
of the Copper ſhould come into the
Spirit of Wine, and by means thereof,
and from the ſame obtain an Eſſential
moyſture, and be changed into a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
oyl; No, you are out, the Spirit
of Wine is farr too weak, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but common Water for the moſt
part, for a whole pound of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Spirit of Wine will not yield much
above half an ounce of Eſſential Salt,
how then ſhould ſuch a far diſperſed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34983:50"/>
vertue be able radically to mollify this
concentred ſubſtance of the Copper,
there is no parity at all betwixt them
both, but there is required a concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
ſpiritual penetrating fire for this
purpoſe, ſuch as is all power, Spirit
and Life, what ſhould ſuch a watry
Vapour be able to prevail, as the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
vini</hi> is for the moſt part. And
although the <hi>Spiritus vini,</hi> ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a tinged <hi>Alcali</hi> in digeſtion;
is changed in colour and turneth very
red, yet it doth not follow therefore,
that this Tincture is from the Copper,
but is barely and only from the <hi>Alcali,</hi>
whereof it attracts, ſome ſubtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
by which it is coloured, which
you may be aſſured of by this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> pouring ſpirit of Wine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a bare fiery <hi>Alcali,</hi> which hath
not been uſed for extraction of the
Sulphur of Copper, and ſetting it in
digeſtion, for then it will be as fairly
coloured upon this, as upon the other,
containing the few atomes <hi>Sulphuris
Cupri.</hi> Therefore it is very neceſſary,
and unavoidable neceſſity requireth it,
that (if you mean to obtain this
uoble Tincture of the Gold-like ſoul
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34983:50"/>
of the Copper) the fiery material <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
be firſt made Spiritual, Volatil,
penetrating and active, which is not
to be done, as moſt Readers do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
that the <hi>Alcali</hi> being a ſalt, is
to be diſtilled and forced over as they
do other ſalts, mixing them (for to
keep them from melting) with Earth,
Lome, or the like, and ſo forcing
them over by the ſtrong power
of fire into a vapour and ſpirit; No,
ſuch a ſort of volatiliſation doth not
ſerve our turne; for although the
<hi>Alcali</hi> in this manner may be forced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into a Volatil ſpirit, and the ſame
alſo be of very great vertue in Phyſick,
yea far exceedeth all other <hi>Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,
Diaphoretica, Incidentia, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolventia,
Deopilantia, Maturantia,
Corroborantia,</hi> which are to be found in
any Apothecaries Shop, as every one
that will prepare and uſe it upon this
my recommendation will find with
admiration and great profit to the ſick,
yet this ſerveth not for the extraction
and Eſſential reſolution of the Tincture
of Copper, becauſe it hath been too
much weakned in the diſtillation,
having left the moſt part of its natural
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34983:51"/>
fierineſs with the Earth or Clay,
wherewith it is mixed for to fit it for
diſtillation, its fierineſs having acted
and conſumed it ſelf thereupon, and
ſo loſt its former fiery power, in ſo
much that by ſuch a diſtillation there
cometh over a very effectual ſpirit for
Medicine, but very mild in taſt, and
far too weak for our purpoſe: But
here the <hi>Alcali</hi> muſt be raiſed ſo, as
that it retain its fiery mollifying
Vertue, yea that it may become
much more powerful and penetrating,
which is to be brought to paſſe by its
like, <hi>viz.</hi> by an other like fiery <hi>Alcali,</hi>
but that this is to be Volatil, for if
this were not Volatil, it could not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latilize
the other, for none can give
more then he hath himſelf, or beyond
what is in his power. Such a Volatil
<hi>Alcali</hi> muſt firſt be got by art from the
ſame ſource, from which the fixed
<hi>Alcali</hi> is riſen, <hi>viz.</hi> from an Oylie
Subſtance, for a true <hi>Alcali</hi> can come
from no other, but from the Oyly
<hi>Principium,</hi> and therefore you muſt
hold to the oyly ground, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to turne the ſame into an <hi>Alcali</hi>
Volatil. Now if you would do it by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34983:51"/>
force of fire, you would get no Volatil,
but a fixed <hi>Alcali</hi> again; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt not be done by ſuch a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way, but by a friendly one, ſuch
as is according to nature, which way
and unchangeable Law is this (as I
mentioned before as much as ſerves for
our purpoſe) that like delighteth in
its like, attracteth the ſame, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the ſame with it ſelf, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it into its own Nature. Now if you
will turne and change your Oyly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
according to this immutable
rule of Nature, into an <hi>Alcali,</hi> you
muſt mix or unite the ſame with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but an <hi>Alcali,</hi> and keep
them together for a ſufficient time in a
gentle heat, and the fieryneſs of the
<hi>Alcali</hi> will powerfully act into the
ſubtle attenuated Oylie ſubſtance,
which you joyned thereunto, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute
the ſame, and becauſe it is of
the like Nature, property and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(in regard that the <hi>Alcali</hi> alſo
roſe from an Oyle) therefore it
changeth the ſame alſo by its ſtrong
fiery force into its nature, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſame from a ſubtle ſpiritual,
thin Oylie ſubſtance into a fiery ſalty
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34983:52"/>
                  <hi>Alcali,</hi> and being done gently, there
is no violence offered to the Oylie
<hi>principium,</hi> as it happeneth when the
fire <hi>per</hi> force turneth the Oyl into an
<hi>Alcali;</hi> therefore it remaineth in its
former Volatlity, inſomuch that you
have obtained an <hi>Alcali</hi> volatil. But
becauſe theſe two are very intimately
united and tyed to each other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you begin to force your <hi>Alcali</hi>
volatil by the ſtrength of fire, the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Alcali</hi> muſt alſo riſe with it, becauſe
of the ſimilitude of Subſtance, whereby
they cleave to each other, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to abide with each other: for
as before by reaſon of the uniformity
of ſubſtance the oyly ſpiritual ſubſtance
was changed by the <hi>Alcali</hi> into its ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Alcalical</hi> nature, from ſuch a ground
as is according to Nature: So now on
the other ſide the fixed <hi>Alcali,</hi> becauſe
of the great affinity betwixt them,
accompanieth the <hi>Alcali</hi> volatil, and
turnes together with it into a Volatile
penetrating, concentred ſpirit, which is
altogether power, Fire, Light, and Life,
and in this manner you obtain that
which is neceſſary for this our purpoſe
<hi>viz.</hi> for the eſſential ſolution of metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34983:52"/>
Sulphurs; whereof to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more would be unneceſſary and
Superfluous, in regard that our
faithful well deſerving Philoſopher
hath deſcribed the ſame clearly and
expreſly in divers places in his
Relict Writings; and the like
hath been done alſo by the ſharp-ſighted
and deeply Learned <hi>Raymund
Lully,</hi> where the Reader will find it
with all circumſtances: and therefore
remain but with theſe two Authors,
and do not ſeek for it further from
any other, and you will truly find ſo
much iuſtruction in them, as you
ſhall need: unleſs that by the juſt
judgement of God the eyes of your
underſtanding be blinded, becauſe of
your pride, covetouſneſs and worldly
pleaſures, for then you will truly not
apprehend any thing of it, but they
would be ſealed books and meere rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to you. Now this ſpiritual fire
and ſoftning eſſential Water ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the pure <hi>Anima</hi> from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick
Body, and diſſolveth the ſame
in ſuch ſort, that it is reduced, <hi>ad
primam materiam,</hi> ſoftned to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Center, and become a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34983:53"/>
ſpiritual ſubſtance or <hi>quinta eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia:</hi>
But this ſpiritual fire hath not
only the efficacy juſt now ſpoken off,
but alſo barely of it ſelf and alone,
hath ſuch great virtues in Phyſick,
that its manifold and innumerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacies
are highly to be admired at;
for it is ten times more powerful in
operation, than the former Spirit,
which is forced by a ſtrong Fire from
the <hi>Alcali</hi> mixt with clay, which for
all that in its Virtues ſurpaſſeth the
uſual Medecines, as the Sun exceedeth
the Moon in ſplendour; And this Fiery
Spirit is the ſame, which our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
thus highly commendeth to
all faithful Phyſitians, ſaying: <hi>In paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivâ

And he ſaith alſo further, that they
are equal in Virtue unto the great
Medicaments, and by reaſon of their
ſubtle penetrating nature do reach
to the fourth digeſtion, his words are
theſe. <hi>In poteſtate medicaminum §. 65.

of the great Virtues of the Volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

of Fire out of copper? that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt</hi> is required
thereunto; now ſince the <hi>Alcalies</hi>
Volatil do bring the ſame to paſs,
it muſt needs then follow, that the
Liquor <hi>Alcahest</hi> floweth from this
ſource, wherein I have been confirmed
ſo much the more by our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Annotation written with his
own hand in <hi>Paracelſ.</hi> his great Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgie
in the Margent. p. 102. in fol<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.
upon the preparation of the Tincture
of Gold, where <hi>Paracelſus</hi> teacheth to
poure <hi>Alcool Vini</hi> upon the <hi>Calx Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
and that the ſame will extract the

                  <hi>Anima Auri;</hi> where our Philoſopher
writ thereunto: <hi>Niſi Sal circulatum
in ſit ſpiritui Vini, Tinctura ex auro non
tranſit in eum.</hi> Now in regard the
<hi>Alcalies</hi> Volatil ſhew forth the ſame
Virtue in extracting of the Metallick
Tinctures, as our Philoſopher attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
here unto the <hi>Sal circulatum,</hi> it
muſt certainly follow, that both theſe
proceed from the ſame Foundation;
which alſo is further confirmed by
this, that our Philoſopher <hi>de febribus</hi>
cap. 14. §. 10. doth refer himſelf to
<hi>Raimund Lulli,</hi> as poſſeſſor of the
Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> in whoſe relict wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
we find the Doctrine of the
Volatiliſation of <hi>Alcalies</hi> more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
and largely handled, than in
any other Philſophers books; and
therefore <hi>I</hi> alſo commended him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with our Philoſopher moſt of
all to the Reader: from all which,
as infallible arguments, <hi>I</hi> do conclude,
that by diligently exerciſing himſelf
in the Volatiliſation of <hi>Alcalies,</hi> one
may aſcend as by a ſure ſtep unto the
Myſtery of the Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt</hi> it ſelf,
whereunto God will raiſe his Elect

               <head type="sub">How the extracted Tincture of Copper
is further to be carried on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and how it performeth its Virtue
and operation in the Body of Man.</head>
               <p>THe Copper being not ſtated in ſuch
a perfection by Nature as gold is,
therefore the way to proceed with
Copper, concerning its final perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is different from the proceſs of
gold in this point; for when the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of this is ſeparated from its
Body, it needeth no further perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but then the <hi>Anima auri</hi> is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
perfect enough, becauſe it had
obtained its perfection already by
Nature, and its Maturation, before it
came to the hands of the Artiſt; yet
hereby is not denyed, but that this
by nature perfected Tincture may be
made perfecter yet, and advanced to
a <hi>pluſquam</hi> perfection, for the ſame
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34983:55"/>
may very well be performed by the
Noble Art <hi>Chymia,</hi> as the books of
the Wiſe do abundantly teſtifie: But
this is beſides our purpoſe here, it
being my intent only, according to
our Philoſophers guidance to ſubſiſt
in the ſingle perfection and to ſet
forth the ſame, and becauſe the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Gold hath the ſame already
by Nature, there needeth no more
but to adminiſter it to the ſick and
neceſſitous; but the caſe is not the ſame
with the Tincture of Copper; for the
Copper and its Sulphur is not fixed, but
of a middle condition betwixt the
throughly fixed Gold, and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
Volatile Minerals, and therefore
its <hi>Anima</hi> could eaſily be deſtroyed
and conſumed by the Violence of fire,
if it ſhould not diſcreetly be handled;
and therefore it is neceſſary, that
according to our Philoſophers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
this Gold-like, cleanly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Anima</hi> be Coagulated and fixed,
and this by the Virtue of Fire,
which is able to ripen all imperfect
things, and to make them durable.
But the Fire muſt be ordered in this
buſineſs, according to the ordinary
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34983:56"/>
courſe of the whole Nature, which
from year to year without ceaſing
doth maturate and concoct unripe
things to their higheſt perfection,
which maturation is performed by
ſteps, beginning with a gentle and
weak degree of Warmth, and ſo riſing
till to the higheſt degree of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
heat, whereby at length perfect
maturity is obtained: And this ſame
muſt be the way of your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore you muſt know,
how to govern your Fire according to
Nature, that you do not give it too
ſtrong before the time, for elſe you
would burn and ſpoyle this Noble
Gold-like flower, inſomuch that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it could not ſhew forth the
tenth part of that efficacy, which elſe
it might, being agreeably unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
digeſted, and Fixed ſlowly and
by degrees. But that it may be the
plainer to you how to proceed, and
that you may not eaſily miſtake, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
but, and mind well the words
of our Philoſopher, <hi>in Duumviratu.
§.</hi> 9. where he ſaith firſt, that it muſt
be coagulated, and afterwards fixed;
Now you know, that Coagulation is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34983:56"/>
to be done by a farr gentler degree o<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Fire then fixation; and therefore be
but guided by theſe two words, and
firſt Coagulate ſoftly, in regard that
it is become like Oyl by the Fiery
moyſture of the Philoſophick <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
which not only reduced the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Cupri</hi> back to its firſt radical moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
that is to ſuch a State, as it
was in, at its firſt riſe or beginning;
and therefore alſo by all the Wiſe is
called <hi>Reductio in primam materiam;</hi>
but alſo this radical moyſture of the
Gold-like Tincture of the Copper
hath ſome part of the eſſential moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the <hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil remaining
with it ſtill, as I mentioned in the
precedent Chapter, wherewith the
inmoſt of the Tincture, by reaſon of
their uniformity in ſubſtance, hath ſo
united it ſelf, that each one is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
inſeparably to remain with the
other; And therefore this Noble
Oyl muſt firſt be coagulated by a ſlow
pace, to the end that it may contract
it ſelf, and ſo thicken and grow tough
and hard at length. And this being
performed, then afterwards, the other
word of our Philoſopher <hi>viz.</hi> fixation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34983:57"/>
muſt alſo be effected, and ſo the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
powder leaſurely carried on
to ſuch a fixation by the augumented
degree of Fire, that it may be able
to undergo the ſtrongeſt force of fire
without change or damage, and then
it is throughly perfect. To which
perfection it muſt of neceſſity attain
for to deſerve the name of <hi>Sulphur
Philoſophorum,</hi> and to be able to cure
all diſeaſes: <hi>Sulphuribus enim minera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
ſaith our Philoſopher p. 460.
<hi>correctis atque perfectis, tota morborum

brought to this paſs, <hi>viz,</hi> to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect, it cannot be expected that
all diſeaſes ſhould yield unto, and flee
from them, and therefore their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
unto perfection muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be ſo ordered and carried on,
as even now hath been taught. And
when you have brought your buſineſs
to ſuch an happy iſſue, you will have
ſuch a perfect Medicine, as cureth not
only <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliter</hi> all diſeaſes as a true
<hi>Panacaea,</hi> but alſo performeth its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
clean otherwiſe than all other
Medicaments, whither made of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
or Animals. For the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phura</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:34983:57"/>
or <hi>animae metallicae</hi> being a meer
fire (and therefore alſo called by the
Philoſophers <hi>Elementum ignis,</hi> in Metals
and Minerals) they alſo performe
their operation, as fire uſeth to do
according to its nature, <hi>viz.</hi> by
warming or illuminating; ſo this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tincture of Copper ſheweth forth
its vertue in warming; hence it is called
by our Philoſopher <hi>excellens calidum,</hi>
very much warming in <hi>Duumviratu. §.</hi> 9
And then ſecondly, by Illumination,
for it illuminateth and raiſeth the
life-ſpirit, called by our Philoſopher
<hi>Archeus,</hi> and mindeth the ſame of its
office, furniſhing it alſo with Light,
Power and Vertue: for although this
noble Tincture hath no combuſtible or
conſumptible Light now, nor is ſuch
as it was before in its firſt riſe, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Gold it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> a combuſtible
Sulphur, and ſo conſequently a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat
or extinguiſhable Light, and
therefore alſo now doth not light
forth after a common or viſible way,
as the kindled <hi>Sulphura Mineralia</hi> do;
yet notwithſtanding the ſame being
ſtated by art into a much higher and
more excellent condition then it was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34983:58"/>
by nature, doth now <hi>lighten</hi> in a far
more eminent way, and caſteth forth its
unchangeable and interminable light
and ſplendour; for now, as its nature is
invincible by fire, and ſo become a far
more excellent fire than the common ſo
likewiſe its light is far more eminent
and reaching than the common corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
light, becauſe that its light is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
and ſuch as will never ceaſe,
in regard that its Light anſwereth the
nature of its ſubſtance, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,
conſequently its Light alſo
is indeſtructible and <hi>inconſumptible;</hi> and
therefore being received into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
of Man, the ſtomack cannot act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, nor change it; but only ſuffereth it
ſelf and its indwelling <hi>Archeus</hi> to be
warmed, illuminated, and irradiated by
this heavenly Tincture, which done, this
Tincture without any change goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
through the natural draught, in its
former weight, efficacy and ſplendour;
and it is able infinitely again and again
to exſert and ſhew forth the ſame power,
vertue and help, which it hath ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if it be pickt out of the excrements
and made uſe of again. Our Philoſopher
teacheth the ſame very profoundly, and

               <p>By which excellent diſcourſe four
ſecrets are diſcovered: Firſt, that the
Sulphurs of Metals and Minerals, by
the Artiſts hand being corrected and
perfected, or brought to the higheſt
perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> fixation, do then uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34983:61"/>
heal all diſeaſes. Secondly,
that they ſhew forth this heavenly
vertue after the nature and manner of
a ſhining Light, enlightning all dark
places and corners, that even ſo the
Metallick fixt <hi>Arcana medica</hi> with
their ſplendour and wonderful Light
(by God beſtowed upon them) do
illuminate and irradiate the <hi>Archeus,</hi>
which is darkned and obumbrated by
Diſeaſes, injecting new powers of
Light into him, and raiſing him to a
new Life, in which ſenſe I gave this
Treatiſe the Title of a Medicinal light,
becauſe therein <hi>I</hi> plainly ſhewed (out
of our highly gifted and illuminated
Philoſopher) the way to obtain ſuch
a glorious Light, eminent for the
reſtoring of health, inſomuch that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that is choſen for it by God,
and borne to it by Nature, and ſo is
<hi>dupliciter electus,</hi> may eaſily attain to
this Myſtery of the Light of Nature.
Thirdly, this Text teacheth alſo, that
theſe Metallick <hi>Arcana</hi> of Light, after
they have afforded their great help
and ſhewn forth their power, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a whit diminiſhed either in their
ſubſtance or weight, but remain in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34983:61"/>
their former quantity, and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and incorrupted in their heavenly
vertue, power and quality, and may
be uſed again and again without end.
Fourthly, that theſe three now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
great Vertues and unexpreſſible
powers, have their riſe from the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Metallick <hi>Arcana</hi> with the
eternal infinite goodneſſe, which is
the inviſible heavenly ſubſtance,
and that as to their inward root, they
are one degree neerer to, and deeper
in the interior heavenly World, than
all other Viſible, Palpable and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
created things, us our Author
intimateth in theſe words, <hi>Adeoque
testantur ejuſmodi arcana, ſe infinitae
bonitati propinqua, &amp;c.</hi> Which great
wonder of God and Nature, hitherto
utterly unknown to, and hidden from
Men, hath by divine irradiation been
diſcovered as it were afar off, by our
Philoſopher, but not ſo genuinely and
intirely known to him as to all its parts,
as it was to that highly illuminated and

wiſdom, that one muſt be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the great and profound
knowledge, which this highly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
Man of God had, as well in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as natural ſecrets, and by the
command, inſtinct and merciful will
of God hath left unto us in his books,
whereof he writ above thirty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are comprehended the greateſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
hidden Myſteries of God, what
he is in his Eſſence, and in his holy
Trine-Number or Trinity of perſons,
how before all created viſible things
he hath created an eternal Nature, of
which afterwards he made the Angels,
and how it came to paſſe, that ſome
fell and raiſed the eternal otherwiſe
hidden darkneſſe for their eternal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;
Others, on the other ſide,
perſiſted in the place of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo are confirmed in their
ſtate of holineſs; Alſo, how God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34983:62"/>
further in the room of the fallen and
rejected Angels created Men in the
very ſame place, from which <hi>Lucifer</hi>
was thruſted forth or ejected, and how
that <hi>Lucifer</hi> envying this happineſſe
unto man, ſeduced and perſwaded him
to fall from God, and cunningly
beguiled him; all which the infinite
mercy of God knowing from eternity,
reſolved already from Eternity with
himſelf, to look in mercy upon this
poor, by the ſubtlety and fraud of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
fallen Man, and to come to his
aſſiſtance with his holy ſubſtance of the
inexhauſtible Loves-Source it ſelf, to
unite the ſame with the fallen humane
Nature, and ſo with a ſtrong might
and Divine power to deſtroy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Sathan, through the fallen
humane Nature, and ſo eternally to
poſſeſſe his former Seat or Throne;
and how all this properly came to paſs
that the eternal infinite God united
himſelf indiviſibly with humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by ſuch an union opened
again the Gate unto the Kingdom of
Heaven unto all Mankind: And how
Man muſt be born again the ſecond
time through this, and ſo united again
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34983:63"/>
with the ſubſtance and body of God,
and become a true child of God, borne
out of him, and in this manner may
eternally be and remain with him. All
this and very many other Myſteries
of the like nature; as alſo of the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Nature of Metals, and their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Vertues, of Hearbs, Beaſts, Sun,
Moon and Stars, and of the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole Nature, and all exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
viſible things, yea of the great
ſtone of the Wiſe alſo, are in his books
ſo profoundly and knowingly handled

rejoyce and delight himſelf in ſuch a
high light and expoſition of ſuch hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
unheard of, and altogether hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

that the bottomleſſe mercy of God
hath ſet up this <hi>Jacob Bohme</hi> (whom
the learned after his death by reaſon
of his great wiſdome called the <hi>Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Philoſopher) and alſo this our
Philoſopher <hi>Helmont,</hi> as two bright-ſhining
torches for this preſent age,
which is the dregs and ſinck of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs,
unbelief, wickedneſſe, and
perverſe damnable life, to try whither
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34983:63"/>
this Modern Lip-Chriſtendom, which
is quite dead as to God, and totally
alienated from the Life of God,
will open their eyes and ſee by this
double Light of his mercy ſet up, and
ſo acknowledge or own God their moſt
bleſſed Creator, walk in his light,
and bring forth the due fruit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Obedience, before the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Wrath of God ruſh in upon
them conſuming, devouring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
all ſuch unfruitful Trees,
which Vengeance is already begun:
Therefore, Happy and Bleſſed is he,
that acknowledgeth the ſame, and
followeth this Light, which God
by theſe two Men of wonders merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
granted unto us, and entereth
into the way of true child-like obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

the fruit, which God by theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

to remain only with the Copper;
but that I treat moſt of Copper in

is done therefore, becauſe <hi>I</hi> propoſed
unto my ſelf to ſubſiſt in our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Doctrine, which he left unto us,
and intended moſt of all to clear the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34983:66"/>
ſame in this Treatiſe, whom, becauſe
he maketh mention of the <hi>Anima

withall and analyſed, and the
Tincture obtained in like manner, as
here of Copper hath been taught,
which by due maturation having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto its perfection, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Philoſophers Sulphur, as

therefore the method pointed out for

may alſo be obſerved in diſſecting of
other Metallick Bodies, and it is not
neceſſary to enlarge further of it, they
being all comprehended within the

But let not the Reader think, that by

the known, and by every one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Metals, as Gold, Lead, Tin, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
&amp;c. by no means, for if this had
been my meaning, I would not have
put Metallick Bodies, but Metals in

the word Metallick Subjects I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſuch Minerals, which have the
like fixedneſs as Metals, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34983:66"/>
though they may not be melted like
other Metals, yet therefore are to be
named Metallick, becauſe they have
not only the like fixedneſs; all Metals,
but alſo approach very near unto
Gold in point of fixedneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<hi>I</hi> underſtand by the word
Metallick bodies, as well all Metals,
as alſo all that hath the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
as Metals have: But that in
ſuch Metallick Subjects the like vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

underſtand alſo my informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Now <hi>Paracelſus</hi> intending to

titulo</hi> of the ſeparation of Minerals:
Now it is further requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to treat of thoſe things whereof
Metals grow and engender, as the
three <hi>Principia, Mercurius, Sulphur</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:34983:67"/>
and <hi>Sal;</hi> alſo other Minerals, in which
the <hi>primum Ens Metallorum</hi> is found,
that is the ſpirit of Metals, as you
ſee in <hi>Marcaſites, Granats, Kakimia,
red Talck, Laſur, &amp;c.</hi> and the like,
wherein we have found the <hi>primum
ens auri,</hi> by the degree of <hi>ſublimation,</hi>
&amp;c. of this <hi>primum ens</hi> you are to
know, that it is a Volatil Spirit,
which ſtill lyes in the Volatility, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as a Child in the Womans womb,
(and therefore alſo theſe <hi>Sulphura</hi>
are called by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Sulphura Embryonata)</hi> which
ſometimes reſembleth unto a Liquor,
and ſometimes unto an <hi>Alcool.</hi> Now
he that intendeth to have the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
ens</hi> of every one of thoſe bodies,
and to ſever the ſame from thence,
muſt of neceſſity have great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Art, and have
much worked in <hi>Alchymie,</hi> elſe he
will little effect here, but rather looſe
his labour. But for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the ſeparation of Minerals,
it is to be noted, that many ſuch
things are ſeparated by the degree
of ſublimation, the fixed from the
unfixed, all ſpiritual and Volatil bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34983:67"/>
from the fixed, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as you have underſtood of Metals,
ſo with all the other Minerals one and
the ſame proceſſe is to be uſed through
all degrees, as the Spagyrick art doth
teach, &amp;c. Hitherto <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> Whereby
we clearly ſee that one and the ſame
proceſſe is to be uſed to ſever the pure,
or the <hi>Primum Ens,</hi> that is, the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſoul from Minerals (as <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
calleth them here, but by me are
tearmed Metallick bodies, not only in
regard of the forementioned reaſon,
becauſe they ſtand in the like fixity
with metals, but alſo to diſtinguiſh
them from other Minerals that are
wholly Volatil which properly are
called Minerals by me, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be made in the following
Chapter) as alſo from Metals, and
that it muſt be done by Volatiliſation,
as <hi>I</hi> have faithfully taught before.
Alſo <hi>Paracelſus</hi> teacheth us what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
thoſe are, in which as well the
<hi>primum Ens Auri</hi> (which is the true
<hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum)</hi> is contained, as
in the Metals, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Marcaſites, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
Kakimia, red Talck, Laſur, &amp;c.</hi>
which though it be certainly ſo, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34983:68"/>
experience alſo confirmeth the ſame,
eſpecially in the <hi>Garnets</hi> and red <hi>Talck,</hi>
in which an extraordinary fair Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Tincture lyes hidden, yet there
are other <hi>Corpora</hi> alſo, wherein the
<hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> is as excellent
as in theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Magnes, Smiris,
Vitriol, Rubrica, Lapis Calaminaris,</hi>
and of all moſt rich and plentifully in
the <hi>Lapis Haemathites,</hi> which is
throughly repleniſht with the <hi>primum
Ens Auri.</hi> And therefore alſo crude
and unprepared, if it be but only firſt
ground and reduced into a very fine
and impalpable powder, ſheweth forth
moſt excellent vertues in Phyſick, as
experience will verify unto the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſearcher of the ſecrets of Nature.
And it is alſo known in the famous
City of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> what great cures
about twenty years ago have been
done there by a Scotch man, who was
but an Ideot, inſomuch that all the
City were aſtoniſhed at it; but by the
envy and hatred of wicked men he was
quickly rid out of the way, and killed
with poyſon, and is much bemoaned
by all, and therefore by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
there (as I am credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34983:68"/>
is ſet a great ſumme of money to
find out him that hath committed that
murther. Now this man uſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the <hi>Haemathites</hi> ground
to an impalpable powder, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ground with oyl of Fennel ſeeds,
as the late moſt Illuſtrious Prince,
Duke <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> of happy
memory hath told me, and with much
induſtry got it from the Authour:
Theſe great Vertues of the <hi>Haemathites</hi>
are alſo known to many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people in divers countries, in ſo
much that great Territories are to be
found, in which the uſe of it is ſo well
known, and ſo highly eſteemed, that
they uſe it as a <hi>Panacaea</hi> in all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
as among the reſt appeared
unto me in the Dukedom of <hi>Boruſſia:</hi>
for travelling once from my parents
in law unto the fair at <hi>Konigsberg</hi> for to
buy ſome neceſſaries, <hi>I</hi> took a peaſant
with me for to carry my luggage for
me, and coming to a Mercers that had
all kind of Wares, as Whetſtones, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
Table-books and the like, and
mong the reſt Blood-ſtones alſo, which
the Peaſant eſpying, he made unto me
a very low curteſie, and very humble
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34983:69"/>
prayed me, that I would buy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon him ſuch a red ſtone (for he
knew not its proper name to call it by)
for a fairing, which he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for a ſingular favour and love
unto him. I demanded what he would
do with it? He anſwered, Dear Sir,
if you knew what excellent vertues are
in this ſtone, you would likkwiſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteem of it: I ſaid, what can it do?
He replyed, This is our Medicine,
when we aile any thing, then we grind
it very ſmall, and take it with a little
Vineger, and thereupon recover our
health; Afterwards coming home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>I</hi> asked my father in Law, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that there was ſuch a cuſtome
amongſt his Boores, as to take their
refuge unto the Blood-ſtone in all their
diſeaſes? To which he anſwered, yea,
adding, that not only there neer him,
but alſo in all that circuit queſtionleſs
there was that cuſtome amongſt the
Boores. This his Gold-like vertue, his
ſignature alſo ſheweth forth, not in his
outward appearance of an unfightly
brown ſtone, but being diſſolved: For if
you make a very ſtrong <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> of
the ſpirit of Salt-peter drawn off from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34983:69"/>
common ſalt (for common <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi>
made after the uſual way of <hi>Aqua fort</hi>
and <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> diſſolveth ſo little
of it, that it is not worth the pains)
and diſſolve therein the <hi>Haemathites</hi>
made into very fine powder, keeping
it in a due heat: and if you diſſolve
alſo of the choiceſt, and pure-fineſt Gold
in the like <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> and compare
the ſolutions together, you will ſee,
that the ſolution of the <hi>Haemathites</hi>
ſheweth as glorious and of as fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
Gold colour as the other of the beſt
Gold, yea rather exceeds in ſplendour.
And therefore let not the Reader won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, that <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and I alſo do
hold, that in many other ſubjects,
beſides the Gold (which deſervedly
hath the pre-eminence above all, and
its tincture is <hi>Eminenti Gradu</hi> called
<hi>Sulphur philoſophorum</hi> by the wiſe, which
none will deny, unleſſe he be quite

is to be found, their great vertues
ſhewing forth the ſame, and as expreſſed
ſeals of bountiful nature, convincing us

altogether of one and the ſame Nature,

is altogether unneceſſary in the volatil
Minerals, becauſe that they never yet
entred into ſuch a hard coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
nor were lock't up in death as
it were, but are ſtill Volatil, lively,
and active: and therefore alſo another
method of proceeding muſt be uſed
about them. Alſo the way of getting
the Medicinal Treaſure from Minerals
being not one and the ſame in all, but
Various, <hi>viz.</hi> in each Mineral a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
way, according to our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
inſtruction; therefore alſo <hi>I</hi>
will mention the preparation of one or
other by it ſelf, as farr as our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
doth give occaſion. Firſt, our
Philoſopher commendeth unto us the
<hi>Sulphura Mineralium</hi> in general and
indiſtinctly, when he teacheth that
they being corrected and perfected,
will then cure all or moſt diſeaſes,
which ſufficiently evidenceth, that
after they have attained unto that
perfection, that then they are the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34983:71"/>
                  <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum,</hi> as well as other
metallick bodies, becauſe that the
Nature and condition of the <hi>Sulphur
Philoſophorum</hi> is to be a <hi>Panacaea,</hi>
which being aſſerted by our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
of the mineral Sulphurs alſo,
they are therefore alſo of the ſame
dignity with the others, becauſe that
they cure <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliter</hi> the infirmities
of Humane bodies as well as the other,
whereof our Philoſophers words,
in his Diſcourſe quoted in the
ninth chap. are theſe: <hi>Ipſum morbum

diſcourſe our Philoſopher nameth
unto us three ſorts of the <hi>Sulphur
Philoſophorum,</hi> that is of ſuch a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliter,</hi> as a true
<hi>Panacaea,</hi> healeth diſeaſes; the firſt ſort
he taketh from the Copper, whereof
hitherto ſufficiently hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and which doth not properly
belong to this Chapter, but to the
Metallick bodies.</p>
               <p>The other ſort he ſaith, is made of
the <hi>Glaura Augurelli,</hi> which he calleth
in another place <hi>viz. inter imperfectiora,
Metallus primus, ſive maſculus</hi> (as much
to ſay as <hi>Pater Metallorum)</hi> and
<hi>inter arcana Paracelſi</hi> he termeth
it alſo <hi>Electrum minerale immaturum,</hi>
and declareth, that this Mineral hath
a combuſtible Sulphur, which is the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34983:72"/>
King of all Mineral Sulphurs, and
therefore alſo the higheſt Tincture for
health is prepared of it, which for
that reaſon is called <hi>quinta eſſentia
membrorum,</hi> and <hi>arcanum Tincturae</hi> by
<hi>Paracelſus.</hi> Now this Mineral as it is
hidden, and known to very few (and
hence not called by its proper name
by our Philoſopher, but only <hi>Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha)</hi>
as to its nature: ſo, and much
more ſecret is its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Philoſophick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
whereby its Volatil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible,
ſtinking, unripe Sulphur, is
exalted to the glory and dignity of
<hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum,</hi> yea ſo highly,
that after it hath attained unto its
higheſt perfection, it ſurpaſſeth all other
Philoſophick Sulphurs as far in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and glory, as the Sun the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stars: and therefore alſo our
Philoſopher relating and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the above mentioned three kinds,
he addeth the word eſpecially, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other, to this Sulphur; and
hence alſo numbring up the <hi>Arcana
Paracelſi,</hi> he ſets this uppermoſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
mentioning, that this <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
is the greateſt of all, ſaying:
<hi>Imprimis tinctura Lili ab Electro mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:34983:73"/>
                  <hi>immaturo in vinum vitae redacta,
cujus una pars est Metallus primus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera
verò membrorum eſſentia.</hi> But the
manner how to obtain this great
Jewel, and King of all the <hi>Arcana,</hi> he
expreſſeth thus: that firſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
Sulphur (which if it be burnt
yields a blew flame) is to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from its Mercurial body, which
may be done after that way as hath
been taught of <hi>Antimony</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter, for ſo long as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
are ſtill Volatil, open and
combuſtible, one proceſs ſerveth for
all, for to ſeparate their Sulphur
from them, <hi>viz.</hi> by a fiery <hi>Alcali;</hi>
Upon this ſevered Sulphur is to be
poured its own (pertinent and only
ſerviceable) corroſive (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the Liquor <hi>Alcahest,</hi> as
appeareth by all circumſtances) and
diſtilled and cohobated thence, until
the Sulphur come over like a red Oyl,
&amp;c. which not being practicable or
feaſible by any other but him that
is Poſſeſſor of the Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi>
therefore we will wave it, and not
fruſtraneouſly detain our ſelves there,
for he that hath that Liquor, needeth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34983:73"/>
not our inſtruction: but to him that
hath it not, it is but labour loſt to
mention any thing of it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
unto him any good conceptions.
And therefore we will paſs to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by all feaſible way, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this high Tincture of health,
which our Philoſopher alſo pointeth
out: for he knowing well, that the
partakers of the Myſtery of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<hi>Alcahest</hi> are but very few, and
yet out of his true aſſection and
hearty love to the longing ſearcher
of truth being willing, that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this moſt excellent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Sulphur might be known in ſome
ſort, he left ſuch a way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is practicable by every
one, that is but a little experienced
in <hi>Philoſophiâ Chymicâ,</hi> yet this kind
of eſſence requireth and preſuppoſeth,
that this highly commended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Subject be firſt known; for
none can have experience of its glory,
nor manifeſt its great virtues, unleſs
he know it firſt: But it ſeemeth unto
me, that our Philoſopher giveth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
information for to know it, in
that he calleth it <hi>Electrum mineral<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>immaturum, item Metallum primum;</hi>
alſo in that he ſaith of it, that it hath
a combuſtible Sulphur, and a Volatil
Mercury, his words <hi>inter imperfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
are theſe: <hi>Metallus primus ſive maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus

Mercurio nempe liquido nec digitis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerente,

it alſo that heavenly Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> to
oppoſe withcraft, and to deſtroy the
ſame, as he writeth <hi>de injaculatis §. 7.
Inprimis electrum minerale immaturum

power I have ſeen verifyed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in my own little Son, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then but ſixteen weeks old, and
forſpoken by Wicked Diabolical peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or fettered <hi>importunis ligationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
malevolorum</hi> (as our Philoſopher
here termeth it) for many dayes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34983:74"/>
inſomuch that it was a great grief of
heart unto us to behold the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
infant, for he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Mothers breaſt for many
dayes, notwithſtanding that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hungry and thirſty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was ſtarved and conſumed. Then
I remembred our Philoſophers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of this noble Subject, and
and ſo hung it to the childs neck, and
let it hang down to the very pit of
the Stomack, and ſo cauſed him to
be wrapped up in his ſwadling cloths,
and preſently he fell aſleep, after an
hour and a halfe he wakened, and
deſired and eagerly fell to ſuck the
Mothers breaſt, and ſo he amended
from that very hour, to the great
admiration of my ſelf and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in regard that the change was
ſo ſudden and ſo powerful, ſo that I
am of opinion, that others alſo by
theſe deſcribed properties will learn
to know this Royal <hi>Subjectum;</hi> and
ſo is needleſs, for the ſake of thoſe
that are worthy, to name it by a
more expreſs and ſignificant name,
than <hi>Electrum immaturum, Pater me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum
ſive Metallus primus,</hi> in regard
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34983:75"/>
that ſuch and the like names do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
expreſſe what it is, and
truly it would not be well done at all,
to deſcribe it more plainly, for theſe
Names do like a Printed Seal
Repreſent its whole Nature, Eſſence,
Riſe and Property, and he that can
not diſcover it by theſe Characters,
is neither choſen of God, nor born
by Nature for to know it, elſe he
would well underſtand this Language
<hi>Metallus primus,</hi> and the like, <hi>viz.</hi>
what the ſaid words and names do
ſpeak and expreſſe. This precious
ſubject (which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calleth the
Red Lyon, but <hi>Baſilius</hi> the God <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne)</hi>
being known, it is further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that the Sulphur be ſevered
from the Mercurial part, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as hath been done with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
for this ſolar ſplendour muſt
be firſt ground very fine, then mixed
with a very fiery <hi>Alcali,</hi> and then
for half a quarter of an hour ground
together in a Morter, then water
poured on, and afterwards filtred,
and that which is contained in the
water, that run through the filter,
precipitated with an Acid Liquor,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34983:75"/>
and then that excellent Sulphur will
fall to the bottom, which being dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is of a yellow colour, and burnes
like other Sulphur, yielding a celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or Skie-coloured flame; as our
Philoſopher mentioneth; but the
Mercurial part remains in the Paper,
which being dryed is kept for other
uſes; yet this I muſt mention here
alſo, that there is yet another way to
ſever the Mercury from this noble
Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> by elevating the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
part by means of ſuch a degree
of Fire as is requiſite, and then it
will aſcend alone, and leave its red
Companion in the bottome; but this
way is not for our purpoſe, becauſe
thereby the Sulphur which remains
in the bottom will be very much fixed
and altered from its former combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition; which ought not to
be in this work, as the following
<hi>Mechanica</hi> left by our Philoſopher
doth ſhew forth; for he will have,
that the <hi>Sulphur Metalli primi</hi> be
diſſolved in oyl of Cinnamon, which
cannot be done, unleſſe that this
Sulphur remain thoroughly Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
and Combuſtible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34983:76"/>
we muſt Acquieſce in the firſt
way.</p>
               <p>Take therefore very pure and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Oyle of Cinamon, poure it upon
the ſaid combuſtible Sulphur, put
it in a phiol, and let it boyl till
the Oyl be very red and rich of the
Tincture; then poure it into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
abſtract the oyl gently, ſo long
as it comes clear, and when by gentle
heat nothing more will come over,
then let it cool, and you will have
in the Retort a thick and red extract
like congealed blood, which keep:
the clear oyl that came over, poure
again into the Phiol, and add more
of the <hi>Sulphur Metalli primi</hi> to it, in
caſe there be not enough in it, boyle
it again for twelve or more howers,
and your oyl will be very red again,
which after Refrigeration put into
the former Retort to the firſt thick
extract, and abſtract as before the
oyl gently, ſo long as it goes clear;
the Oyl that came over poure again
the third time to the Sulphur in the
Phiol and let it boyle as before; and
being well coloured, poure it alſo
into the Retort to the other extract:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34983:76"/>
And now put the Retort ſomewhat
deeper in the ſand than before; firſt
draw off gently the clear oyl, and none
ſuch coming more, then ſtrengthen
the fire a little, but not too much,
(that this noble flower may not ſuffer
violence) and there will come over
firſt a yellow and then a red oyl,
poure all that is come over back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and diſtill in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
again, and there will come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more yellow and red oyl; this
cohobation reiterate ſo long and often
until your Oyl do come over ſo
red that it could not be redder,
which is a ſign that the Oyl can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contain and carry over any
more of the mollified Sulphur,
which you may eaſily know by its
not increaſing in redneſſe after ſeveral
cohobations. This tinged Oyl you
muſt well mix and grind together,
with a very dry pure <hi>Alcali</hi> warmed
a little, upon a ſtone warmed alſo,
work it together for an hour or two,
that it be like a thin hony, and take
heed that you put in not too much of
the Oyl, for all that Oyl which is not
exactly mixed with the <hi>Alcali,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34983:77"/>
not touched by it, but ſtandeth over
the ſame, exceedeth the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
and cannot be meliorated
by the <hi>Alcali.</hi> Then put your mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into a little <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> and let it
by day and by night, for ſome weeks,
digeſt together, in ſuch a ſoft or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
heat, that the oyl may not aſcend,
and it will at length all turne to
Salt and grow hard, which being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a ſtronger fire yieldeth a red
Salt, the vertue whereof will commend
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now we will alſo ſpeak of the third
ſubject, whereof our Philoſopher
maketh mention, and commendeth
the ſame unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> of Antimony,
and try whether in this alſo the
<hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> be hid, which
queſtionleſſe muſt be ſo, ſince it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and put in company with the
<hi>Arcanum Cupri</hi> and <hi>Glaurae,</hi> by our
Philoſopher. Now to extract the
ſame out of this ſubject, Know that
it cannot be brought to its higheſt
perfection after the ſame manner as
the <hi>Glaura,</hi> in regard that this of its
nature and firſt riſe is farr more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nobilitated than the Antimony,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34983:77"/>
and therefore alſo needeth no more
but only to be opened and ſoftned ſo,
as that it may be able to play upon
our <hi>Archeus,</hi> and communicate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
its <hi>radius</hi> and ſplendour, and
hence alſo by reaſon of the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
it hath above all other mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sulphurs, it is called by our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
the higheſt and greateſt
wonder of Nature, but the <hi>Anima
Antimonii</hi> muſt firſt be ripened and
digeſted by a due Fire, before it can
attain to ſuch an excellency. But
how to go about this work, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the genuine way to proceed
therewith, our Philoſopher hath not
left us ſufficient inſtruction, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
us unto <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> ſpeaking
of this <hi>Arcanum in Pharmacopolio &amp;
Diſpenſatorio Moderno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> §. 49. thus:
<hi>Id Paracelſus (nimirum correctionem
veneni in Antimonio) in Tincturâ Lili
Antimonii cum laude attentavit, per
ſalem ſuum circulatum:</hi> and amongſt
the <hi>Arcana Paracelſi</hi> our Philoſopher
ſets this <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii</hi>
in the third place, ſaying, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
loco eſt tinctura Lili Antimonialis,
ejuſdem ponè efficaciae, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34983:78"/>
therefore turne to <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his
Writings, and ſearch there, in what
place he taught to prepare the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Lili ex Antimonio,</hi> and we ſhall
find it in his great <hi>Chyrurgia lib. 2. tr.
3. cap.</hi> 5. where he ſpeaketh of this
<hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> thus: <hi>The
Philoſophers have tryed much with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
and prepared the ſame many
wayes, but the true way hath not been
found with them yet, but now it is come
to light, and it is ſuch a ſcience, which
all Phyſitians of right ſhould know: For
this purification is the entry and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in all Diſeaſes, whatever they be:
and if it were in uſe, there would not
ſo much be ſpoyled as is done by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Phyſitians: For therefore I call
them ſuppoſed, becauſe in all their wayes
and doings, they do but only ſuppoſe,
and know nothing of a certainty, which
is a very great ſhame to Phyſicians.</hi>
Now its preparation is this: but he
that will apprehend it, muſt be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in Alchymy, for I cannot
ſet it down in ſuch a way as is uſual
with the Apothecaries. Take An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
changed or reduced into very
fine <hi>Alcool</hi> (here the deſirous ſearcher
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34983:78"/>
of Truth is to know, that the change
or tranſmutation of the Antimony
into <hi>Alcool,</hi> doth not ſignify grinding
into fine powder, as according to the
literal ſence it doth ſound, but the
Antimony being heavy and compact
of its Nature, muſt by art and by the
power of fire be forced to aſcend in
form of a very light duſt, in ſo much
that not the leaſt remain behind in the
bottom pertaining to the ſubſtance of
Antimony; and this is to be repeated
thrice, as our Philoſopher in his
Marginals mentioneth, and left behind
him for information, (although the
ſame may be alſo gathered from
<hi>Paracelſ. lib. 3. cap. 6. de vitâ longâ.)</hi>
then reverberate it in a cloſe Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
for the ſpace of a Moneth, and
it will be Volatil, firſt white, then
yellow, at laſt red and brown, very
light and ſpungy. Being red and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated
ſufficiently, take it out,
and extract its Eſſence <hi>Lili</hi> with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine, which is to reach twenty
inches over it (Here <hi>Paracelſus</hi> playes
again with the word <hi>Spiritus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
as he did in the proceſſe of gold
in the ſecond chapter, whereof I made
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34983:79"/>
mention above in the ninth chapter,
in regard that the <hi>Spiritus Vini</hi> is far
too weak to extract this Tincture, but
as in the proceſſe of Gold, ſo here
the <hi>Sal circulatum</hi> is the means, which
muſt effect that ſolution and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as our Philoſopher in the
now quoted place §. 49. <hi>in diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio
novo</hi> mentioned, inſtead whereof
the <hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil may be uſed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that they proceed from the ſame
root and ground, as <hi>I</hi> mentioned
before) and the ſubſtance of the
Antimony being in the Spirit of Wine,
decant it, and keep the Spirit of
Wine ſo mixed together. This is the
higheſt purification of the whole <hi>Lili,</hi>
alſo the nobleſt and moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which carrieth off all that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
in Man, and moreover all that
Man can find within man. If you
find out this Medicine and <hi>Arcanum,</hi>
it will not make you a ſuppoſed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
but a knowing one. In this
manner is the <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> or
<hi>Medecina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis Antimonii</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and of its great and wonderful
vertues you may further read in the
forementioned fifth chapter of his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:34983:79"/>
Now although this way is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
good, that it cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yet it is very difficult, and one
may eaſily miſſe in it, becauſe of the
Reverberation, in which one may
quickly be out and ſpoyl all. And
therefore I will here ſet down an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
and readier way, to the end that
the Truth-deſirous Reader may firſt
trye this, as being eaſier and ſurer,
and ſo afterwards alſo imitate the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is by Reverberation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take the pure ſeparated <hi>Sulphur
Antimonii,</hi> done as taught in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter, diſſolve it with the
<hi>Alcali</hi> Volatil, and cohobate it ſo
long, untill the Salt riſe like a Rubie,
and you have a farr ſhorter and ſurer

may alſo be made of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sulphur, hence we will by no

as well as of the <hi>Sulphur Cupri &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonii,</hi>
an univerſal Medicine is to be
made, yet each in its degree and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
into which it hath been ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Nature in its firſt generation:
for although the Tincture of Copper
Univerſally cureth, yet doth it not
perform the ſame ſo gloriouſly and
ſo eminently as the Tincture of the
<hi>Sulphur Metalli primi:</hi> ſo likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Tincture of Antimony
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34983:81"/>
with that of Copper, this latter is
found farr more excellent than the
former; and ſo further the caſe is ſtill
the ſame betwixt Antimony and
common Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the former doth ſo farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the perfected <hi>Anima</hi> or <hi>Eſſentia</hi>
of the common Sulphur in ſplendour
and ſhining Light, as nature in their
firſt Generation hath more highly
Nobilitated and Stated the former
than the latter; which nature it ſelf
doth ſhew forth, and experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us; and becauſe this ſecret hath
not been diſcovered hitherto, I thought
it neceſſary to open it unto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he may rightly apprehend
the ground thereof. For although
the <hi>Sulphur Antimonii</hi> be as well Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil
and combuſtible as the common
Sulphur, and ſo no difference betwixt
them as to their Fixity or Maturity;
for all that they are ſo much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
as to their virtue, that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
Antimonii,</hi> without any further
preparation being given to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
is of far greater, quicker and
more powerful operation, than the
common Sulphur, though often ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34983:82"/>
which proceedeth from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but its inbred excellency, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it hath been endowed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and ſo the <hi>Sulphur Cupri</hi> hath
greater virtue, than that of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and ſo forth. But ſome may ſay,
that the Sulphur of Antimony being
extracted and made viſible by an
<hi>Alcali,</hi> hath been corrected and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated
by the fierineſs of the fixed
<hi>Alcali,</hi> and thence is more excellent
in virtue, but not by reaſon of
its birth: For anſwer, it is confeſſed,
that the <hi>Sulphur Antimonii</hi> and all
other Mineral Sulphurs being for a
long time united and boyled with a
fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> (as the ſame ſhall be
faithfully demonſtrated and taught
afterwards) indeed come forth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated
and amended; but in extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sulphur of Antimony, the
<hi>Alcali</hi> is but ground with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
water poured on, and in that
moment that the <hi>Alcali</hi> impregnated
with the ſulphur, doth run through
the filter, the <hi>Acidum</hi> may be put in,
and ſo the <hi>Alcali</hi> again ſevered from
the ſulphur. Now what maturation
or melioration can the ſulphur of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34983:82"/>
Antimony receive from the <hi>Alcali</hi>
in ſuch a moment of time? which I
leave to you to judge of: But put
caſe, that you could not acquieſce in
this, know that there are yet other
wayes to extract the ſulphur, ſo that
the <hi>Alcali</hi> do not touch the ſame, nor
any other thing do act upon it, and
yet it doth readily riſe from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
as if you put thereupon its
<hi>Acetum,</hi> which will admit of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at all with the ſulphur, but
preſently aſſociateth it ſelf to the
mercurial part of the Antimony, and
ſo the ſulphur is ſet free from its
Mercury, and therefore riſeth in a
very gentle heat, in colour like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common ſulphur, and not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
at all from the common, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in colour, ſmell, taſt, volatility nor
combuſtibleneſs, only that it yields
a fairer Light, being burnt, than the
common ſulphur doth being kindled,
and yet notwithſtanding that it is ſo
like unto common ſulphur, and hath
not been touched nor extracted by
any thing that could have meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame, but hath been readily
diſmiſſed from its Mercury, this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34983:83"/>
been ſatiated by ſome more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
thing, it ſurpaſſeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sulphur for all that ſo much,
that it is to be admired, that there is
ſuch difference betwixt them, as to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
and virtue, which only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from their different natures,
and that according to the firſt ſeed
of theſe Minerals Nature hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
a greater excellency upon the
one than upon the other; The ſame
is alſo to be ſeen by our Philoſophers
<hi>Mechanica,</hi> teaching, that we ſhall
extract a ſulphur from Antimony,
ſuch as to its outward appearance doth
not differ from common ſulphur,
only that it is a little greater, and
then with Mercury to make a <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi>
of it, and ſublime it ſeven times,
afterwards take half an ounce of it,
and let it hang into a barrel of wine
for xxiv. hours, whereof for ſome
dayes a ſpoonful taken every day,
will be of ſo great effect, that it will
be much wondred at, and that ſuch a
a Philoſophick <hi>Cinnabrium</hi> may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ending and diminiſhing of its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
be uſed for this purpoſe, being but
ſublimed again. Now try the ſame
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34983:83"/>
with common ſulphur, in caſe that you
cannot apprehend or aſſent unto my
former proofe, and you will find by
experience, that you will effect nothing
with it, but that the great prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and notable pre-eminency muſt
be granted unto the <hi>Sulphur Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii,</hi>
by reaſon of its inbred, more
excellent Virtues, which it hath and
poſſeſſeth according to its inbred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
although in the outward ſhew
they be very like to one another. And
herein lyes a great Myſtery, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge of the Metallick
and Mineral Kingdom, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
(for ought <hi>I</hi> have read and heard)
hath been cleared and opened by none,
and therefore ſhall not be paſſed over
with ſilence; For the nature of all
Metallick and Mineral Sulphurs is like
unto the nature and condition of the
Stars, yea the Mineral Sulphurs are
true and expreſſe images, formes and
products of the Stars; for as the Stars
are fire and light, ſo likewiſe the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs;
as thoſe do warme and lighten
ſo theſe; and as thoſe do quicken and
can do no otherwiſe, but to raiſe life,
for they are altogether light and life,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34983:84"/>
yea a ſource of quickning virtue, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Sulphur can do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no other but do
good and warm, lighten and make alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But to the end that the deſirous
ſeeker of Truth may truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this Myſtery, and rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
my meaning, I do impart unto
him according to my knowledge,
which God in his mercy hath granted
unto me, that all the <hi>Sulphura</hi> of the
whole Metallick and Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not one excepted, are created
of one ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of the groſſer,
thicker, earthy or lower fire, which
is the Mother and firſt riſe of them all,
and ſo are totally of one nature, of
one deſcent, and of one ſubſtance,
even as the ſtars are of one and the
ſame ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> created of the
heavenly, that is of the ſubtler fire,
and the Nature, both of the Stars,
and alſo of all the Sulphurs, conſiſteth
chiefly in two Vertues, in warming
and lighting. Now as the Almighty
hand of the great God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
created all ſtars of one matter
and ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of a ſubtle fiery
Light, and yet from the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their creation made the one
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34983:84"/>
more glorious, more powerful, and
and more ſplendid than the other:
So the caſe is the ſame with the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Mineral Sulphurs, which
God alſo created of one ſubſtance,
<hi>viz.</hi> of a groſſe and earthy thick
fiery Light; but yet withal hath framed
the one more glorious, and far more
vertuous than the other, and ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
unto each one its peculiar
glory, which it cannot exceed, though
it be perfected, as much as is poſſible,
in ſo much that no Sulphur can take
more vertue, than hath been given
unto it by the Creator in its firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
formation: And as you ſee
that one ſtar is much fairer and
brighter than the other, ſo likewiſe one
Sulphur ſurpaſſeth the other, as I have
clearly demonſtrated, concerning the
difference betwixt the <hi>Sulphur Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii</hi>
and the Common, that this
latter cannot reach, nor be advanced
unto the glory and ſplendour in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which the former hath, though
it be ſublimed never ſo often. And
the ſame is alſo the condition of the
<hi>Sulphur Antimonii</hi> compared to the
<hi>Sulphur Electri mineralis immaeturi,</hi> that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34983:85"/>
although it is much more glorious
as to its concreated ſplendour than
the Common Sulphur, yet can it not
attain to that height and excellency
which the <hi>Sulphur Electri immaturi</hi>
hath, <hi>viz.</hi> that by bare ſuſpenſion
from the neck it can ſuddenly looſen
the Witchcraft; no, ſuch a glorious
ſplendour it is not endowed withal;
ſo that it is ſufficiently evident, that
although theſe three be all combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and volatil, yet they are very
unlike one another, only becauſe of
their firſt generation, wherein each
got its peculiar ſplendour, Power,
light and vertue. Now as you ſee
further that among the ſtars the moſt
glorious is the Sun, which far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth
all the other with its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
light and vertue; yea as the
highly illuminated <hi>Teutonicus Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophus
Jacob Bohme</hi> in his book <hi>de
tribus principiis,</hi> as alſo <hi>de ſignatura
rerum,</hi> alſo <hi>de triplici vitâ,</hi> and others
more, according to his wiſdome and
profound knowledge granted unto
him by the Spirit of God, teacheth,
the Sun is the root, ſource, and
heart of the Stars, whence they all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34983:85"/>
did flow, and ſo of right may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and is in truth the Father of the
Stars, in regard of their ſource, and
a King of them, becauſe of its great
pre-eminence in ſplendour: Even ſo
in like manner the Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
have alſo their King and Father,
which ſurpaſſeth them all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is called <hi>Metallus primus ſive Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
(which ſignifyeth as much as
<hi>Pater metallorum)</hi> by our highly
guifted and profoundly learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<hi>Helmont,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
which have by Gods bleſſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the ſame; yea ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
with the eyes of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that this <hi>Electum minerale</hi>
hath the ſame relation to all the reſt,
which the Sun hath to all other ſtars,
and ſo of right may be called the
King of the Mineral Kingdome, in
regard that this proceedeth from it,
juſt as a tree ſpringeth from its root,
and becauſe that its ſplendour and
light is ſo excellent in its wholeſome
vertue and operation, that none of
all the Metals and Minerals can do the
like, thefore its heavenly Tincture
is ſet down in the firſt place among
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34983:86"/>
all the great <hi>Arcani Paracelſi,</hi> as on
Philoſopher doth relate in his book
and I have mentioned already in the
former chapter, as I have alſo ſhewn
a little before, how much it exceeds
the Sulphur of Antimony in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which Sulphur yet is of ſo great
efficacy, that it is to be admired, as
our Philoſophers quoted words have
mentioned, and therefore alſo this
Mineral King is called by our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> the <hi>Quinta eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
of all members, becauſe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth ſo compleatly ſtrengthen
all the Members as this Royal Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
hence alſo it is called by them
<hi>Simpliciter &amp; ſecundum excellentiam
Arcanum Tincturae,</hi> becauſe that the
Tincture of life is eſpecially and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all put into this Royal ſubject
by Nature, in which ſence our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<hi>inter imperfectiora</hi> calleth it,
the higheſt and moſt excellent of all the
wonders of Nature, yea the greateſt
and moſt effectual means for long
Life, whereupon we moſt relie; <hi>ad
vitam longam,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſolus apex &amp;
culmen ſpei;</hi> and <hi>mirabilium naturae
culmen,</hi> which commendation doth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34983:86"/>
not properly belong unto it, till it be
brought into its <hi>Arcanum,</hi> that is,
till it be ripened, compleatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
and perfected, and then it is
the <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> above all
other; and although the Sulphurs of
all the others be brought to the ſame
maturity and fixation as the Sulphur
of the <hi>Electrum immaturum,</hi> yet thoſe
cannot ſhew forth ſuch an excellent
ſplendour and luſtre as this, becauſe
that each one preſently from its firſt
generation carrieth its determinate
height and glory along, which it is
impoſſible to exceed, it being contrary
to the will of the Creator, by whoſe
Will all are made, and who would
have it ſo, that ſuch a Sulphur ſhould
light in this, and ſuch an other in
an other glory, to the end that in this
manner the manifold Vertues and
Lights (which otherwiſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
hidden) of the heavenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
whereof theſe are the expreſſe
ſtamp or print, and from which theſe
are flown, might be made manifeſt,
and ſo man might wonder at the great
variety of thoſe mighty and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
powers of Nature, and ſo be drawn
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34983:87"/>
on to praiſe the great God as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all theſe Lights. So that you
hence clearly ſee the great difference
among the perfected <hi>Arcana,</hi> and that
the name of <hi>Sulphur Philoſophorum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
more to the one than to the
other; alſo, that each one hath and
may attain unto its of Nature deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
perfection, and not higher;
and therefore alſo the Common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
(for whoſe ſake we were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
to make this ddinction) can
but attain unto ſuch a perfection, as
is attributed unto it by Nature, <hi>viz.</hi>
which is not ſo excellent as that of the
reſt, but in the loweſt degree of all,
and yet for all that yielding a true <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacaea,</hi>
as we have heard by <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
his teſtimony, and ſhall now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
further by the Mechanick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration;
for the obtaining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you muſt know, that the common
Sulphur is a ſimple or ſingle ſubſtance,
not united with a Mercurial body as
other Minerals are, but conſiſting of
altogether Similar parts, and being
Similar all over; conſequently need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no purification, nor ſeparation,
but only this, that being altogether
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34983:87"/>
Volatil, Unripe, Combuſtible, and
partly Venemous, it be maturated,
digeſted, and made perfect, and in caſe
that it had been mixed with hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
things, that it be ſublimed
once or twice firſt, and afterwards
digeſted till to its maturity. And the
Common Sulphur and its maturation
is not unlike unto a piece of fleſh or
meat, wherein is great vertue to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
and comfort man, but being yet
raw, it muſt be firſt prepared by perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
cooking, that it may impart its
vertue unto Man: Even ſo Sulphur
though it be of a great Balſamick
Virtue; yet it containeth alſo much
of that, which is contrary and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto our nature, wherewith ſo long
as the Sulphur remains ſo, it doth kill
more than it can quicken, as I have
had the experience of its virulency
in my own ſelf, about ten years ago,
having then been thrown down by
its ſtinking poyſon, that I was like dead,
and deprived of my interiour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
ſences for a whole hour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I was freed and reſtored again by
an Antidote prepared of the ſelf ſame.
And therefore its virulency ought to be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34983:88"/>
removed or rather maturated and
perfected by digeſtion; For ſuch Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
and death muſt not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
or ſeparated from the Sulphur,
but perfected and introverted or ſhut
up in death; on the other ſide the
internal hidden Light and Splendour
is to be turned outwards, as our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
ſaith: <hi>Sub Veneni ſeu Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiae
custodiâ abditur ignis Vitalis,
Archeum in ſcopos deſideratos placidiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime
deducens.</hi> Now this maturation
and perfecting by digeſtion, is to be
done in the ſame way, as a piece of
fleſh is cooked that is enough, <hi>viz.</hi>
only by the heat and power of the
Fire, and it is not neceſſary, but rather
very hurtful, to uſe heterogeneous
corroſive Waters for this purpoſe, as
the Chymick Writers in their <hi>Tyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia,</hi>
Comments, Proceſſes, and
many other ſort of Books do perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach, for ſuch corroſive things do
pervert and ſpoyle the Sulphur ſo,
that it gets another nature; for if
without addition of ſuch corroſives it
be cooked only by the Fire, it then
retains its natural, balſamick, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and mollifying moyſture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34983:88"/>
it ought to enlighten outwardly,
but the ſame is taken away from it by
addition of acid and corroſive waters,
for they penetrate thereinto, and
make it harſh, and quite other than
it was created by bounteous nature:
and although they do think, that by
this way they may the ſooner finiſh
their work, which alſo they do, yet
they do not conſider the great
hurt they do, that by ſuch Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
and contrary things they
do quite alter, pervert and ſpoyle
its Nature; Therefore follow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whoſe operations are all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and plain, preſerving every thing
in its innate condition, which you may
evidently ſee in all Metals, yea in
the Gold it ſelf, which in its firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
generation as to its <hi>Anima,</hi>
was a true combuſtible Sulphur, how
Nature preſerved this Sulphur ſo
carefully in its fuſibleneſs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it hath been brought to the
higheſt fixation, yet ſtill hath kept
its original fuſibleneſs. But by what
means hath Nature performed the
ſame? barely and only by the Fire
contained in its inmoſt boſome, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34983:89"/>
made not uſe of corroſive ſharp waters,
as the whole crew the common wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
teach now a dayes, but cooked
the ſame in a ſimple plain way, by
heat ſo long, till it came to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and fixed, as alſo all <hi>Paracelſus</hi>
proceſſes tending to this <hi>Arcanum
Sulphuris</hi> are wholy conſonant to this
foreſaid way of Nature. So we muſt
do in like manner, follow Nature,
and conſider well how it worketh,
and not invent ſuch ſtrange wayes,
whereby we work differently from,
and contrary unto Nature, and ſo
produce clean other fruit, than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth. Intending therefore to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the common Sulphur which is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
and ſimple of its nature, ſo as it may
be conſonant unto the proceeding of
Nature; put it in a phiol, having firſt
been ſublimed once or twice before,
and digeſt it only of it ſelf by ſuch
a fire as its nature requireth, untill
it do aſcend no more, nor is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible,
but wholly fixed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
which though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it require a
long time, and conſtant, and good look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to, that it hath no more heat
than is neceſſary: but on the other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34983:89"/>
ſide it is a plain and ſimple way,
which needeth no other preparation
coſtly <hi>Menstrua,</hi> and the like, but may
be done barely and only by fire, and
ſuch is the proceeding of Nature
with Metals under ground, and no
other. But in regard that this work
is of a long laſting, and requireth
much time, to the end therefore,
that in the mean time you may not
be weary nor dubious, whither the
Sulphur will come at length to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
I will lay you down a plain
and convincing demonſtration, that
you may be aſſured of the perfection
to come, and ſo hold on in your work
and finiſh it. Take therefore ſome
of your Sulphur, ſo digeſted for ſome
weeks, diſſolve it in oyl, diſſolve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome of ſuch Sulphur (as it was
in the beginning before digeſtion) in
Oyl, and you will find that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſolution ſtinketh horribly, but
the other ſmelleth very Aromatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in Teſtimony, that part of the
Venome (from whence as from a root
the horrible ſtench doth flow) is ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and changed; which you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
know by the great Vertue, which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34983:90"/>
this already for ſome weeks ripened
Sulphur will ſhew forth beyond all
other common <hi>flores Sulphuris;</hi> and
therefore chearfully go on, untill it
be quite fixed, and be not wearied
by the length of time, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the end, that it will prove joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for you, and bring unto you ſuch
a Noble Treaſure of health, and yet
doth coſt you no more, but only a
few Coales, and careful looking to the
fire.</p>
               <p>Now although this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
be quite conſonant unto that
which Nature it ſelf uſeth, in regard
that the ſame alſo ſimply and plainly
by its fire doth perfectly digeſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and Metals, tranſlating them from
Volatility into the greateſt fixity, and
that in this manner you have rightly
worked according to Nature: yet this
doth not hinder, that there may be
not a better and ſhorter way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thereunto, in regard that by
this, Art is diſtinguiſhed from Nature,
yea this is, and is properly called art,
which beginneth where Nature cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and knowes how to amend and
meliorate that which Nature work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34983:90"/>
which floweth from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Wiſdom of Men, which
hath been communicated by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable
Wiſdom of God unto the
Children of Men, all which, as well
thoſe which are of the leaſt account
with us, as alſo your high and great
works of Art, are nothing elſe but
printed Images, of the Infinite, Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
Unſearchable Powers and
Wiſdom of God, which the Man which
conſidereth thoſe Wonders cannot
ſufficiently admire, and praiſe his
God and Creator, as holy <hi>David</hi>
alſo ſaith very excellently <hi>Pſ. 111.
The works of the Lord are great, he
that regardeth them, hath his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſure
altogether in them:</hi> but he that doth
not regard them, that is, doth not look
upon them as a Man of ſound reaſon,
pondering whence thoſe wonderfull
Arts, and manifold Wiſdom of God
proceedeth or floweth, is like a beaſt,
which only enjoyes thoſe glorious
things, and maketh uſe of them, but
is not thereby as by a guide lead or
carried up to the Creator, who is
the ſource of all thoſe manifold guifts.
Now if we ſharpen our underſtanding
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34983:91"/>
and conſider, whither this former way,
which is ſo conſonant unto Nature,
cannot be amended or abbreviated;
preſently there offereth it ſelf the
daily practiſe of the Cooks, which
though according to the ſimple and
plain way of Nature they can ripen
and roaſt their fleſh only by the bare
fire, inſomuch that a Man may enjoy
it, and refreſh himſelf therewith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado; yet according to
Arts invention, which playes and
ſtirs in them like a ſource, they uſe
means for to advance this maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or cooking of the fleſh, that it may
be the ſooner ready; <hi>viz.</hi> laying the
fleſh in Vinegar for ſome weeks, the
Vinegar doth ſo prepare it, that they
need not halfe the time for the making
of it ready, which they ſhould have
needed, if it had not lain in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar;
Let us therefore ſee, whither
there be not alſo a Liquor in the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Kitchen and Shop, whereby the
ſulphur may be firſt marinated or pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and ſo fitted for the following
perfect fixation, ſuch a Liquor can be
none of the ſowre Corroſive ſpirits, in
regard that theſe have no affinity with
ſulphur, and ſo not only are not able
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34983:91"/>
to mollify the ſame, but alſo as being
its enemies, do alter the ſame in its
imbred mollfying vertue, and do
pervert and ſpoile it, and ſo deprive
it of its natural connate treaſure.
Now in the preparation of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
this muſt be aimed at, that it be
preſerved and amended in its former
natural endowment, but not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and perverted into a ſtrange harſh
ſubſtance, which is totally unlike to
its Originall. And therefore we
muſt leave all <hi>Acida</hi> and <hi>Corroſiva,</hi>
if we mean to hit the the mark we
aimed at, and thus to prepare the
Sulphur, that it may remain in its
firſt nature and quality; but ſuch a
moyſture as is for our turne we may
get beſt from ſuch things, which as to
their ground ſtand upon the ſame root
with the Sulphur, and ſo are of the
ſame, that is of a fiery nature; and
ſuch are the fixed <hi>Alcalies,</hi> which by
vertue of their fiery burning and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nature can ſo prepare the Sulphur
that the following work afterwards
falleth out much eaſier and ſhorter:
And this may be done two ſeveral
wayes: firſt by boyling the Sulphur
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34983:92"/>
with a very fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> in water for
a long time, and you muſt herein look
to the ground, and well conſider, what
ſerves your turne, the fieryer your <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
is, the more ſpeedily your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
will be ended, and therefore
be diligent to make very fiery <hi>Alcalies</hi>
and to exalt them in their fierineſſe
to the higheſt, to which end <hi>Mars</hi> will
readily yield you its fiery ſalt; In ſuch
and the like fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> boyle your
Sulphur, the longer the better, as you
will ſee by experience, that the longer
you macerate it thus, the more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
it will ſhew in Phyſick already,
before its perfect and final fixation.
Having prepared it ſufficiently thus,
precipitate the ſame then with an
<hi>Acidum,</hi> and you will have ſuch an
excellent prepared Sulphur, as you
could not have imagined before; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the <hi>Lac Sulphuris</hi> of the common
Chymical Authours, which is but once
diſſolved with the <hi>Alcali,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
precipitated, and yet by this ſmall
boyling gets ſuch an exalted power
from the fieryneſſe of the <hi>Alcali,</hi> that it
is of farr greater vertue than before it
was boyled therewith, and the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34983:92"/>
and ſimpleneſſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Chymiſts is much to be wondred
at, that none hitherto was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, which hath conſidered
of this foundation, nor begun to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
if the Sulphur in ſo ſhort a time,
by a ſmall boyling, hath got ſuch a
great amendment, inſomuch that it
becometh farr nobler and farr more
powerful than it was before, it muſt
then follow, that if we ſhould boyle
it thus for a long time, as alſo, if we
ſhould exalt our <hi>Alcali</hi> in its fierineſſe
that we ſhould alſo exalt our Sulphur
much higher in its vertue; But there
hath been none hitherto which thought
of it, but they reſted themſelves
content with their <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> and
ſo the one ſaid it, and writ it after the
other, and ſo they ſung ſtill the ſame
ſong: And this is truly the moderne,
much lamentable caſe of the noble
<hi>Chymiatria,</hi> that the moſt part of the
Chymiſts (as not only their books,
but alſo their daily practiſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth),
moſt of them advancing no
higher, nor knowing any more, but
what they find written in books,
which alſo many times falleth difficult
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34983:93"/>
enough for them to imitate) are ſo
deeply darkned in their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they do not conſider of
thoſe thing, which they work upon,
of what nature they be, whence they
have their riſe, how and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and by what power thoſe things
which they deal in, do exert their
Vertue and Power, and how the one
doth act into the other, and can either
mend or marr it, ſuch thoughts never
enter into their brains, but only,
make this ſo, and the other thus, mix
this with ſuch a thing, and that with
the other, and ſo forth without end,
and when one doth not ſucceed, then
another proceſſe is taken in hand,
and ſo they are right proceſs-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and children in underſtanding,
which know not Themſelves what
they work, but ſee with other eyes,
<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of the proceſſe; if that be
ſilent, then they know no more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know to add, nor detract, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to amend nor to alter, and yet
ſuch fellows will be counted no leſſe
then great <hi>Philoſophi &amp; Lumina mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di

this cauſe, that the Mind in which (as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34983:93"/>
in his Image) God ſhould play with
his out-flowing Wiſdom and poure
into it the treaſures of his eternity,
is groſſely darkned and obumbrated

poureth forth into their hearts, do
alſo heartily love their neighbour as
their fellow-brother, liberally and
joyfully ſharing their received gift
with him, but of this enough at this
time.</p>
               <p>Now to returne unto our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sulphur, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
way, which is not diſtinguiſht
from the firſt, as to the ground and
ſubſtance, but only differeth as to the
manner of proceeding; for here the
fiery <hi>Alcali</hi> is not by Water united
with the Sulphur, but only of it ſelf
through-dry, and ſo put together
well cloſed in a gentle heat, and
kept there ſo, that the Sulphur do
not riſe: but in caſe it ſhould happen,
it being not well poſſible to obſerve it
ſo accurately, but that ſome do riſe,
you muſt mix that which is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with the <hi>Alcali;</hi> for all that
which is without or above the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
cannot receive its preparation;
and there remaineth nothing more to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34983:94"/>
be given notice here, but as to all the
reſt, it is like unto the firſt way;
for the longer you cement your
Sulphur thus, the excellenter, and the
readier or fitter it is for the enſuing
fixation: which for to ſever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you muſt diſſolve the ſame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Alcali</hi> in Water, and
precipitate it again; Now you may
chooſe either of theſe wayes, which
you like beſt; and know for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that though this latter be
better than the former, yet it is more
laborious, and the other far eaſier, and
therefore make choice of that which
is moſt for your conveniency. As
concerning this ſo prepared Sulphur,
experience will make it known to you,
what excellent Vertues it hath, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that it hath not received
yet its ultimate fixity and perfection.
If you pleaſe you may proceed ſo with
all Minerals, that have a combuſtible,
Volatile, eaſily ſeparable Sulphur,
uſing water to it after the firſt way.
As for example, Antimony thus dealt
with and corrected, yeildeth a very
precious Sulphur in Phyſick and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgy;
but this you muſt be adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34983:95"/>
of, that having boyled your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
ſufficiently with the <hi>Alcali</hi>
according to your deſire, then let it
cool, and poure a great quantity of
cold Water to it, the more the better,
and the groſſe Mercurial ſubſtance,
which by the fieryneſſe of the <hi>Alcali</hi>
was diſſolved with the reſt, will for the
moſt part ſever it ſelf from the <hi>Laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi>
and ſo let it reſt for a day or
two; then filter it, and the Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
remaining in the filter will be very
ſpongious and pufft up, ten times big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then it was before; as to its corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouſneſſe
or bulk; rince the ſame
often by pouring on of Water upon
it, that no ſaltineſſe remain with it,
and ſo keep it for uſe in Chirurgy, it
being far better than all other <hi>flores
Antimonii,</hi> in regard that it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a main correction from the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali,</hi>
and its ſtrong power of fierineſſe.
But that which is run through the
filter, precipitate with an <hi>Acidum,</hi> but
obſerve this difference, that you keep
that which falleth firſt and is red by it
ſelf; and when it beginneth to ſink
down of an Orenge or Lemon colour,
keep this alſo by it ſelf, precipitating
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34983:95"/>
the ſame in another Veſſel by it ſelf,
the which falling laſt of all keep for
inward Medicine: but the firſt red for
Chirurgie, which is farr more Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
than the firſt undiſſolved red
Antimony, which containeth but very
little of Sulphur, but this very much.
But that we may not digreſs too far
from our mark, we muſt turn again to
our Sulphur, which in its natural
Water or Fiery moyſture we have
prepared and fitted for the enſuing
perfect Fixation: proceed with the
ſame afterwards, as you did with the
firſt crude Sulphur, and digeſt it till to
its Final fixation, whereunto you will
attain farr ſooner than before, and
uſe it afterwards for your prof<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and
delectation in the wonders of bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
nature.</p>
               <p>Now although this alſo be a way of
Maturation according to Nature, and
far ſhorter and more convenient than
the firſt, yet the truth deſirous Heart
doth not reſt in this, but ſearcheth
and inquireth further, whither it be
not poſſible for Art to perform this
perfection, and perfect maturation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a better way yet? and whither it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34983:96"/>
cannot be advanced yet to a higher
perfection? which enquiry is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the now-mentioned Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Melioration, done by the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
which although they be but groſs
Bodies, yet by reaſon of their fieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhew forth ſuch a ſtrong force
upon the Sulphurs, how much more
then might they effect, if they were
firſt made ſpiritual, and afterwards
joyned unto the Sulphur; And this
concluſion is very right and grounded
in the powers of Nature, and this
correction doth perfectly reſemble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſeaſoning of Meat, for although
one may very well eat meat, dreſſed
of it ſelf alone without all ſpice, and
thereby redintegrate his diminiſhed
Vigour of Life; yet if it be ſeaſoned
with warming ſpices (all which are
of a warming and ſtrengthning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
and ſo prepared, and reduced
to a better perfection, then they
ſtrengthen man much more, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
more comfort unto him: Even
ſo the caſe ſtandeth in truth with the
fixed Sulphur, which of it ſelf alone
maturated and digeſted into perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ſufficient to ſtrengthen diſeaſed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34983:96"/>
Nature: but if a warming Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
<hi>Aroma</hi> be joyned thereunto,
and it be digeſted therewith ſo, that
this <hi>Aroma</hi> remaineth unſeparated
with the Sulphur, as ordinary ſpice
remaineth with the Meat, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
together with it, it muſt needs
follow, that ſuch a ſeaſoned fixed
ſulphur is much more effectual in its
operation, than if of it ſelf alone it
be maturated into perfection, the
truth whereof experience will make
good unto the deſirous ſeeker of
truth. Now to effect this, take your
ſulphur prepared by the fiery <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
and diſſolve the ſame in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Volatiliſed <hi>Alcali,</hi> afterwards
by a very gentle fire abſtract your fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
water ſo long, till you ſee that
by ſuch a gentle degree of fire no clear
or white Liquor more will come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and there will remain a thick,
very red, ſpiritual, penetrative juyce
or Liquor, retaining ſo much of this
hot <hi>Aroma,</hi> as is needfull for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
of this <hi>ſolar</hi> fruit; now this
ſame digeſt and maturate with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and diſcretion, that your <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
be not forced from it, but remain
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34983:97"/>
unſeparably therewith, and together
with the Sulphur turn at length
into a fixed and perfect <hi>Elixir;</hi> you
muſt take heed, that you forget not
exactly to govern the degrees of the
Fire, that you may not overhaſten
not ſpoyle the work, until both have
attained unto compleat fixation,
whereof you will have more cauſe to
rejoyce, than of the former ſimple ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation.
And although I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
you of more far higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and more effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to ſulphur, yet I ſhall now
ſubſiſt in what hath been related, till
ſome time to come (if the higheſt
God permit)! Now this fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
as by Nature it was a burning
fire and ſhining light; ſo now it is an
incumbuſtible, not externally but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
warming and cheriſhing fire;
and as before it burnt up all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
things, ſo now by its might
it burneth up inviſible diſeaſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
them like as fire doth ſtraw:
and as the <hi>Sulphura</hi> before their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation
did lighten only externally,
ſo now they lighten to the ſpirits of
darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſeaſes, all which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34983:97"/>
are nothing elſe but Spirits or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the dark chamber of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and fore-runners of the dark death
(as the ſame could be demonſtrated
through the whole body of Phyſick
and Pathology) ſo expelling them, that
is, tranſmuting them into good ſpirits,
as they were before when the Man had
his health; ſo theſe perfected mineral
ſulphurs are like unto the ſun, which
lighteth, warmeth, and raiſeth that
which is dead into Life; which the
fixed Sulphurs, according to all their
(by the Excellency of Art) raiſed and
obtained properties do effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
But this is not to be underſtood,
as if nothing elſe at all may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
unto the ſick, ſave only this
perfected univerſal Medicine, no, this
is not the meaning; in regard that
this and any other like <hi>Panacaea</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
only to the ſource of the diſeaſe,
which alwayes riſeth from ſome qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or property of darkneſſe, this is
the thing which ſuch a power of light,
<hi>viz.</hi> the above-mentioned Tinctures
of Gold, Copper, Antimony and the
like doth tranſmute, reducing, the
infected <hi>Archeus</hi> into that State again,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34983:98"/>
which it was in before, when the
Man had his health; but if in the
mean time ſuch a ſickly ſpirit or dark
property hath effected or produced
ſomething that is material, it is not
denyed, but that then there may be
uſed alſo other as well internal as
external proper means to expel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
and remove that <hi>productum;</hi>
Much leſs are excluded thoſe needful
Manuals, in Ulcers, Luxations, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
Wounds, and the like, as every
one that will but make uſe of his
underſtanding may eaſily perceive;
as alſo, that though there be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Medicines at hand, there muſt
for all that good heed be taken, and
judgement and diſcretion be uſed;
which admonition I deemed very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
becauſe that the Enemies of
truth jeer at the like <hi>Arcana,</hi> and
uſe to deride them, pretending, that
thus the <hi>Vegetabilia, Anima, Lia,
&amp;c.</hi> had been created in Vain, for
that the word <hi>Panacaea</hi> doth exclude
all other means: but in this ſence it
was never ſpoken or underſtood by
the Philoſophers, but their meaning
is only this, that by ſuch <hi>Panacaea's</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:34983:98"/>
only the root of the diſeaſe is eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and as it were cut off with a
knife, and that the ſame is alſo to be
helped forward by other convenient
Medecines, removing thoſe Symptomes
and products, which by that ſource
were brought forth. Alſo it is to be
known, that the <hi>Duelech</hi> or ſtone in
Man is excluded from the like <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea's,</hi>
eſpecially that, which hath its
riſe and ſeat in the bladder, as our
Philoſopher doth faithfully admoniſh,
and among other places <hi>in Ignoto hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drope
§.</hi> 49. expreſly mentioneth, that
the Riſe of the ſtone in the bladder
is quite otherwiſe, than of other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
which are all ſuch ſpirits, or
qualities as are ſpoyled, infected and
darkened, and they perform alſo their
operation in the body of Man like
raging, ſtinging, painful powers of
darkneſſe; but concerning the ſtone,
as its firſt riſe is Material, ſo its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or forth flowing incommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is material, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
rough, ſharp ſubſtance lyes in
ſuch a tender very ſenſible place,
which cannot ſuffer nor bear any He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous
harſh things; and ſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34983:99"/>
Man more by its quantity than
quality, in regard that its cure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by cutting doth clearly teſtify,
that as ſoon as the body or material
ſubſtance of the ſtone is taken away
from the bladder, that preſently then
all pain, diſeaſe, and diſcomodation,
occaſioned by the ſtone, is taken away,
ſo that no man ſhould be neceſſitated
to dye of the ſtone, if the cut could
be done in ſuch ſort, that the other
parts of the body of man might not be
ſpoyled and inflamed by the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
force of the cut, which is nothing
elſe but a violent rent of that, which
Nature would have and keep whole
and intire. So the Stone is a cauſe of
the diſeaſe, yea of death it ſelf, not
as a working ſpirit, but as an obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
material ſubſtance, and therefore
alſo the <hi>Arcana</hi> can do no help in this
caſe; for though they can pacify and
quiet the enraged <hi>Archeus,</hi> yet this
pacification is of no long laſting, by
reaſon that the cauſe of diſquiet or
pain is ſtill preſent, raiſing ſtill again
new anguiſh and pain: Conſequently
ſuch a medicine for to cure the ſtone
muſt be had, which is able to liquefie,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34983:99"/>
diſſolve, mollyfie and reduce into
duſt that groſſe, hard body of the ſtone,
that the ſame afterwards may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
forth by Urine; but becauſe the
<hi>Arcana</hi> have not that power, yea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come with their ſubſtance to the
place where the ſtone lyes, but their
power and vertue conſiſteth only in
the property of light, therefore the
ſtone of the bladder is excluded, and
their great power of Light cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
unto duſt its hard groſs material
body, that it might be carryed forth;
for which end other means are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
whereof our Philoſopher hath
written a peculiar book, which may be
peruſed abut this matter.</p>
               <p>This is the whole ground of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
Philoſophorum,</hi> according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of our faithful Philoſopher, which
he left us in his writings but very dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and hiddenly, which <hi>I</hi> have opened
and denudated unto the deſirous lover
of truth, yea ſo clearly preſented
unto his eyes, as one ſeeth his one face
in a looking-glaſſe; For as the face
appearing in the looking glaſſe, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
unto the true ſubſtance of the
face ſtanding before the glaſs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34983:100"/>
So you have here a compleat
draught repreſenting the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Tincture of Health, what
ſhape it hath, and how it explicateth
it ſelf from the beginning to the end:
But as the ſhadow is not the ſubſtance
it ſelf, alſo the face appearing in the
looking glaſſe is far diſtant from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the ſubſtantial face; Even ſo
the caſe ſtandeth with this Myſtery of
the <hi>Sulphur Pholoſoporum</hi> maneſted clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by me, which although it be opened
by me in all its parts in ſuch ſort, as
that nothing is wanting which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to expreſſe the ſubſtance, but
all is repreſented in its lively colours
in all points; yet notwithſtanding
the ſubſtance of this pictured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
Myſtery will not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor effected with ſuch eaſe, as it is
underſtood and apprehended; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
many a one, eſpecially ſuch
as hereby aimes at, and ſeeketh but
himſelf, and the pleaſure of his fleſh,
will be conſtrained to content himſelf
only with the here pictured ſhadow,
and never to enjoy the ſubſtance;
And this only therefore, becauſe he
fancieth to himſelf, that becauſe that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34983:100"/>
all is opened fundamentally and
clearly, he may therewith with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen
hands, as his own will and
pleaſure, ruſh in upon theſe <hi>Arcana,</hi>
and elaborate the ſame according to his
own rational conceptions, concluſions,
conſequences and Inductions, as it is
uſual with the Modern Chymiſts, to
work at randum, conceiving that by
their imaginary cunningneſſe they
may catch the <hi>Arcana,</hi> and as Lords
proprietors poſſeſſe them; hence thoſe
Men do continually eagerly lay wait
for preſcribed proceſſes, like as the
Wolf waits for the ſheep, of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
there will not be a few, that the
ground of this great Myſtery being
ſo openly cleared by me, they will
lift up themſelves in their mind and
think; this ſhall not fail me, this
muſt not eſcape from my hands, but
that I will finiſh it, and bring the ſame
to a happy iſſue, to the end that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they may the better vaunt it,
and exalt themſelves in their haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
with the myſteries of God and
Nature, and like a proud peacock
burſt forth and triumph over the poor
and diſtreſſed, like luſtful <hi>Stallions:</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:34983:101"/>
But all this will fail, and let none
fancy, that he may obtain this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in ſuch a way, for God holdeth
his hand upon it, who will bleſſe with
an happy iſſue the labours of thoſe
only, which he knoweth that they
ſeek only the glory of his name, and
the hearty love of their neighbour,
and nothing elſe; who in reality and
truth ſhew forth by their life and
converſation that with King <hi>David</hi>
in the 119. <hi>Pſal. v. 127. They love the
Commandements of God above fine gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and with King <hi>Salomon, Prov. 8. v. 10.
Receive instruction and not ſilver, and
knowledg rather than choice gold:</hi> for <hi>that
wiſdom to them is better than Rubies, and
all the things that may be deſired, are
not to be compared to it.</hi> Such may
be confident of a good end, and none
elſe, as our Philoſopher <hi>de Febribus</hi>
witneſſeth, <hi>cap. 4. §. 9. Paucis abſolvi
ſecretum quod medicum nobilitat, at
iſtud paraſſe pro primâ vice, est ingentis
operae, pendetque ejus directio à manu
ejus, cui debetur omnis honos, quia
parvulis revelat ejuſmodi Arcana, quae
mundus neſcit, id idcircò vilipendit,</hi>
And each hungry proceſſe-monger
will find it by experience to be true,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34983:101"/>
what our Philoſopher here ſaith, that
it is a work of great moment, and
truly no childrens ſport, nor common
ſlabbering work, as now a dayes they
work; ſuch a one will find it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
in the beginning, when he
goes about to prepare the double ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
there he will ſee, that all he hath
learned and practiſed for ſo many
years will be of little uſe or help in
that work. But now to the end that
the true deſirous ſeekers of truth may
be entred into the track, how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and happily end this work, I
will ſet down unto them my way
which I went my ſelf, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I obtained it, which is but of a ſmall
compaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that all that is to be
worked upon in <hi>Chymia,</hi> be firſt
throughly conſidered, and ſifted out
according to its whole nature, before
it be brought to the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> from
what power or property the <hi>ſubjectum</hi>
(taken in hand to work upon) is
flown or proceeded forth, in what
quality it doth ſtand, what its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is towards other ſubjects, and
wherein its in moſt power and efficacy
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34983:102"/>
or the inner Kernel doth properly
conſiſt; elſe if you wave this and
work but on according to the letter,
you will not only get nothing, but
are neither choſen of God, nor born
of nature for it; for God giveth unto
all thoſe which he hath choſen for his
Labourers in the Vineyard of Nature
ſuch a mind, that they deeply conſider
thoſe things which they have in hand,
and draw the underſtanding of things
out of the inmoſt Ground of thoſe
things which they go about, as you
have an excellent pattern of ſuch a
ſeeker in our Philoſopher; how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth he ſearch out thoſe things
whereof he treateth, how accurately he
ſetteth down the qualities of thoſe
ſubjects whereof he left the truth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him? ſuch a mind and ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
befitteth every ſeeker of truth:
you muſt ſeek the truth in the inmoſt
center of every ſubject, wherein you
intend to work, but not in any book,
or from man: For inſtruction you
may receive by books or good Friends,
but the ſubſtance and power you muſt
gather from the things themſelves,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34983:102"/>
which you have in hand; and this
way I went, as I mentioned in the
very begining of this Treatiſe, that
when <hi>I</hi> found not the truth with men,
that I applied my ſelf to fundamental
and deep conſiderations of thoſe
things which I would take in hand,
and ſo at length diſcovered the truth.</p>
               <p>But ſuch a deep and fundamental
conſideration, or rather inſpection of
natural, things doth not conſiſt (as
moſt Readers may think) in penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with your underſtanding into the
ſubſtance or internal center of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and forcing as it were of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of its internal powers outwards
into your underſtanding; No, this is
not the right Way, but is the cuſtom
of perverted fooliſh reaſon; but thus
it is, that when your mind is firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with a deſire of knowing the
inmoſt power and vertue of this or that
ſubject, only for the glory and praiſe
of the Creator, and unfeigned love
of the neighbour, and yet finding no
power in your ſelf, whereby of your
own ſtrength to ſearch it out, and to
know it, you muſt then with your
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34983:103"/>
mind and deſire enter into the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ground, out of which as well
your mind, as alſo the ſubject, which
you deſire to know, did flow forth,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the creator which is highly
bleſſed above all, and in your deſire
carry your ſubject which you deſire
to know before him, and humbly
pray him, that thy ſelf being blind
and ignorant of it, but your ſubject, as
his Creature, with all its power, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and vertue being flown out of him,
that he would vouchſafe to explicate
the vertue of your ſubject in your
mind, and ſo to float it as it were into
your hungry deſires; whereupon it
will happen, that ſuch a quality as
ruleth in your ſubject will perfectly
riſe in your mind, and you will ſee,
feel, and ſubſtantially perceive in
your mind the reflexion of that vertue
which beareth rule in your deſired
ſubject, and ſo you will get a very
true and moſt certain knowledg, not
conſiſting in opinion, but in the true
ſubſtance: Now to this way of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and enquirie into Nature, and
is natural bodies I have been lead (as I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34983:103"/>
told you in the beginning of this
Treatiſe) by our Philoſopher in his
book called <hi>Venatio ſcientiarum,</hi> which
imitate you as I have done, and you
will not fail to come to the truth,
for faithfull is he and there is no
falſeneſſe in him, which created
all things by his Word, and in whom
all things are grounded, like a tree
with its root in the Earth, which
alſo moſt lovingly calleth us to
himſelf, ſaying, <hi>Ask but and you
ſhall receive, for what Father is there
among you, that will give a Serpent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Child, asking him for bread, how
much more then ſhall I your Heavenly
Father give you all good things, if you
do pray me for it.</hi> And that you may
the better attain thereunto, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
properly and experimentally know
how to walk in this way, and what
you may expect, I will ſet down out
of our Philoſopher ſome Rules full of
Doctrine, which moſt of all ſet me in
the right way, pointing out unto me,
as it were with fingers the right path:
Read therefore very conſiderately,
what our Philoſopher ſaith in the now-mentioned
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34983:104"/>
book, <hi>§. 32. 33. ſcivi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde,
