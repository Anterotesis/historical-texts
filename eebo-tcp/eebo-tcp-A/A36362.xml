            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the unexpected ſurrender of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> the City of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was aſſaulted with ſeverall Letters, Meſſages, and ſuch verball ſolicitations, by divers in the Kings Army of no meane quality, thereby pretending our good, and expreſſions of their love and care of us, but really intending their own ſiniſter ends and our deſtruction. Amongſt the reſt, there came a Letter on Friday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4. dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3. from a Captaine of a Troope of Horſe in the Kings Army, to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Alderman <hi>Pury,</hi> one of the Burgeſſes of the Parliament for this City, full of perſwaſive oratory for the yeelding up of this City, with great promiſes as heretofore of preferment, and braggs of the greatneſſe of the Army that was then on their march coming againſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> All Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Forces, from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with addition of 1500. armed Welch, and 2000 Club-men out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Armes ſufficient to arme them from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> 800 Foote with a Regimenent of Horſe from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and 5000 Foote with a Brigado of Horſe of the Queenes Forces from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and if he would ſend an anſwer, it muſt be by the Sunday-night following or not at all: But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Alderman <hi>Pury</hi> (whoſe fidelity is ſufficiently known to be ſo firme to the Parliament, that it is not to be ſhaken by promiſes or threats) thinking it not worthy of, ſo accordingly ſent no anſwer.</p>
            <p>Saturday, <hi>August</hi> 5. We received intelligence, that about 2000 Horſe from <hi>Bristoll</hi> were advanced within 10 mile of this City, whereupon ſeverall meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were diſpatched to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sunday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. Generall <hi>Garret</hi> faced this City with his Brigado of Horſe in <hi>Tredworth-</hi>Field, and ſent a Trumpeter to the Governour for 4 Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his formerly taken by a party of ours in <hi>Cotſwold,</hi> for which he offered others in exchange for them, or any other ſatisfaction. In the After-noone, a ſmall party of Horſe and Foote commanded by Captaine <hi>Blunt,</hi> and aſſiſted by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Matthewes,</hi> Captaine <hi>White,</hi> Captaine <hi>Pury</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Captaine Lieutenant <hi>Harcus</hi> iſſued forth of the North-gate, and at <hi>Wotton</hi> tooke about 10 Priſoners, and ſending home the Foote, the ſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with the few Horſe they had, went along to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton,</hi> St. <hi>Leonards,</hi> and thence to the foote of <hi>Painſwickes-</hi>Hill, on the top of which they diſcovered a party of the enemies Horſe, and ſo going round about by <hi>Matſon,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without the loſſe or hurt of any. This day we wrought hard in the amending and repairing of our Bulwarkes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54821:3"/>
Munday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 7. Newes came to Captaine <hi>Pury</hi> the younger to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> That the enemy was plundering at <hi>Tuffleigh,</hi> about a mile and halfe from <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> nowly aſſigned for his Quarters for the billeting of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who thereupon acquainted Captaine <hi>Evans</hi> therewith, reſolving to take what men of theirs they could on the ſuddaine get to ſurprize the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; But being come thither, aſſiſted with Lieutenant <hi>Pierce,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they were gone away with their plunder to Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> houſe at <hi>Brockthroppe,</hi> about a mile and a halfe further: They thereupon (having not above 40 Foote, and ſome few of Captaine <hi>Backhouſes</hi> horſe) left ſome few Foote to ſecure their retreat, and with the reſt marched forward to meete with the enemy, skirmiſhed with them, compelled them to take refuge in the houſe, killed one in the Orchard, and hurt or killed others in the houſe, and tooke one priſoner, and 7 Horſes: But perceiving a party of Horſe, that looked on on the hill all the while, to make towards them, they were forced to retreat without any loſſe, only one through his own indiſcretion taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. As they were juſt at the Townes-end, they met with the Governour and a party of Musketteers coming to their reſcue, newes being brought to Towne that they were in danger of being cut off.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, <hi>August</hi> 8. We underſtood that the King with all the Foote from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and carriages were come to <hi>Berkeley,</hi> and that they intended to ſpeed their march towards us.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9. We had intelligence that proviſion was made for the entertainement of his Majeſty at <hi>Princknedge,</hi> in the Lady <hi>Bridgemans</hi> houſe, about 3 miles off the City, and that the Foote and carriages would be there that night: we likewiſe received intelligence, that the Lord <hi>Chando's</hi> that day dined at <hi>Brockworth,</hi> at the <hi>Guiſes</hi> there, whereupon a party went out of the North-gate towards <hi>Barnewood,</hi> skirmiſhed with the enemy, and did ſome execution upon them, and amongſt the reſt a little boy of Captaine <hi>Nelmes</hi> Company, having ſhot away all his Bullets, charged his musket with a pebble ſtone, and killed a Commander therewith, we retreated without any loſſe at all.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10. His Majeſty with about 6000 Horſe and Foote as we conceived, the <hi>Welch &amp; Worceſter</hi> Forces coming after, faced us in <hi>Tredworth</hi> Field, at the foote of <hi>Ribinhoods-</hi>hill, about a quarter of a mile off the Towne; &amp; about 2000 Horſe more, faced us in <hi>Walham,</hi> within Canon-ſhot at randome of our workes. Towards the afternoone his Majeſty ſent a meſſage by 2 He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds at Armes, whereof the one being <hi>Somerſes</hi> Herald, read the meſſage at the <hi>Talſey</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Out of our tender compaſſion to our City of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>and that it may net re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive prejudice by our Army, which we cannot prevent, if we be compelled to aſſault it; we are perſonally come before it to require the ſame, and are gratiouſly pleaſed to let all the inhabitants of and all other perſons within that City, as well Souldiers as others know, that if they ſhall immediately ſubmit themſelves and deliver this City to us, we are contented freely and abſolutely to pardon every one of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54821:3"/>
               <hi>exception: And doe aſſure them in the word of a King, that they nor any of them ſhall receive the leaſt damage or prejudice by our Army in their perſons or eſtates: But that we will appoint ſuch a Governour and a moderate Gariſon to reſide there, as ſhall be both for the eaſe and ſecurity of that City, and that whole County. But if they ſhall neglect this offer of grace and favour, and compell us by the power of our Army to reduce that place (which by the helpe of God, we doubt not, we ſhall eaſily and ſhortly be able to doe) they muſt thanke themſelves for all the calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that muſt befall them. To this meſſage we expect a cleere and poſitive anſwer within 2 houres after the publiſhing hereof, and by theſe preſents doe give leave to any perſons, ſafely to repaire to and returne from us, whom that City ſhall deſire to imploy unto us in that buſineſſe. And doe require all the Officers and Souldiers of our Army, quietly to ſuffer them to paſſe accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Herald mentioned the publiſhing of this meſſage openly in the ſtreete, but his Majeſty by his meſſage not requiring the ſame, the Governour would no wayes permit it. But the Heralds being withdrawne, after ſome debate in ſatisfying Mr. Major ſcruples touching his Oath of Majoralty, an anſwer was drawne, and unanimouſly agreed unto both by Citizens and Souldiers in theſe words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We the Inhabitants, Magiſtrates, Officers and Souldiers within this Garriſon of</hi> Glouceſter, <hi>unto his Majeſties gracious meſſage, returne this humble anſwer. That we doe keepe this City according to our Oathes and Allegiance, to and for the uſe of his Majeſty and his Royall poſterity, and doe accordingly conceive our ſelves wholy bound to obey the commands of his Majesty, ſignified by both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and are reſolved by Gods helpe to keepe this City accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This anſwer was immediately ſent to his Majeſty, (who was by that time come to <hi>Tredworth-</hi>Field, attended by Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Lord Generall <hi>Ruthen,</hi> &amp;c.) by Serjeant Major <hi>Pudſey,</hi> and a Citizen who accordingly preſented the ſame and ſo returned. Thereupon his Majeſties Forces advanced forward into our ſuburbs, chiefely on the eaſt-part into <hi>Barton-ſtreete,</hi> where we killed a Commander from the Eaſt-gate: But the houſes proved too hot for ſuch inhabitants, for we had after the returne of our meſſengers, fired all our ſuburbs on the North-eaſt and South parts, as being thoſe that could and would have done us moſt harme: yet one <hi>Iſſolds</hi> houſe in <hi>Barton-ſtreete</hi> (by reaſon of a garden betwixt that and the next above) tooke not fire, ſo that the enemy played from thence with Musket-ſhot againſt us, till we by 5 or 6 Canon-ſhot from the walles, forced them to quit that place, Our Canon likewiſe from the Pen upon the Weſt-gate, diſcharged upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Horſe in <hi>Walham,</hi> and doing ſome ſmall execution there, made them goe ſeeke better quarters. Our Women and Maides wrought all this after-noone in the little meade out of our workes in the very faces of thoſe houſes, in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in Turfe for the repairing of our workes: we were forced now through want of men for the guarding of the City it ſelfe (we being not above 1400 at moſt) to quit our out-guards of the Wine-yard, and the two Sconces we had formerly made at each corner of the Iſle of <hi>Alney</hi> for the ſecuring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and the River of <hi>Seaverne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54821:4"/>
Friday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 11. Upon breake of day we diſcovered that the enemy had the night before begun their entrenchments in <hi>Gawdy Greene,</hi> on the South-part of the City, and about <hi>Iſſolds</hi> houſe on the Eaſt part, both within leſſe then Musket-ſhot of our walles. They had likewiſe cut the Pipes that conveied our water from <hi>Robinhoods-</hi>hill to our Conduits, and diverted the courſe of water that drove our Corne-mills, ſo that we were forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with Pumpe and <hi>Seaverne</hi> water, and to grind our Corne with Horſe-mills. Their Pioneeres plied their workes in their trenches, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteeres on both ſides playing hard, we loſt only a boy and a girle through their indiſcretion gazing over the walles. The <hi>Welſh</hi> Forces under Sr. <hi>William Vavaſor</hi> advanced to the Wine-yard, where after 2 houres ſolemnity, they with great valour tooke it, no body being there to make a ſhot againſt them. Yet upon their entry of the outward worke, when they ſaw another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they according to their knowne proweſſe, immediately ran out, yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heart againe, they at laſt to their eternall glory tooke it. Upon their drawing up on the ſide of the hill, our Demeculverin diſcharged from the Pen fell amongſt them and did good execution; we diſcovered them through our proſpectives carrying away their dead or maimed, and afterwards divers gazing where the Bullet grazed that durſt adventure ſo farre to kill her nowne Cozens and Countrymen. Among this crew had that treacherous <hi>Adams,</hi> once a Lieutenant Colonell under Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> placed himſelfe. They about 2 dayes afterwards leaving a ſufficient guard at the Wine-yard and the Sconſe by <hi>Mayſemore,</hi> made a Bridge of Boats there, and joyned with the Forces that had now newly come from <hi>Worceſter</hi> and quartered on the North weſt ſide of the City, at <hi>Longford</hi> and the <hi>Kingſholme,</hi> where they made their leagure in two fields there about, leſſe then halfe a mile off us. The Lord Generall <hi>Ruthen</hi> had placed his leagure at ſome grounds behind <hi>Lanthony,</hi> within a quarter of a mile of the Towne, it being ſomewhat ſheltered from our ſhot by a riſing ground that lay betweene, yet our ſhot hapned ſometime amongſt them and did ſome execution. There their Lord Generall pitched his Tent, and Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley</hi> quartered at Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> houſe in <hi>Barton-</hi>ſtreete: Captaine Lieutenant <hi>Harcus,</hi> aſſiſted by Colonell <hi>Stevens</hi> Enſigne, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night iſſued forth of the South part, with a ſmall party, beat the enemy from their trenches, and brought away many of their Shovels and Pickaxes. The ſame night the enemy making an approach in <hi>Barton-</hi>ſtreet, our Canon from the Eaſt-gate killed 6 of them, whereof one was a Lieutenant Colonell, and another a Captaine of the Queenes black Regiment under Colonell <hi>Blackwell,</hi> Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley</hi> was then ſhot in the arme. The enemy likewiſe advancing ſomewhat from <hi>Lanthony</hi> toward the <hi>Barbican,</hi> our guards there fired upon them and killed and wounded many of them, as we have received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by divers confeſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 12. Saterday. In the forenoon a party commanded by Captaine Leivetenant <hi>Harcus</hi> ſallied forth through a door we made for that purpoſe

in a brick-houſe adjoyning to the towne wall on the South Eaſt part over againſt Rignall ſtile (making a bridge of Ladders over the moat) and fell into the enemies trenches in Gawdy Green, beat them out, gained ſome working tooles, Arms and Priſoners, and retreated without loſſe of any, onely two wounded. This was a hot skirmiſh for the ſpace of halfe an houre. In the afternoon a party of about 150. Musketteers commanded by Captain <hi>Gray</hi> ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth over the works at the little Mead, and fell upon the enemies quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the Kingſholme, marched up to their Main-guard, there killed Captain <hi>Rumney,</hi> and about 8. or 9. common ſouldiers, took 5. priſoners, and divers Armes, burnt their Main-guard, and houſes they quartered in, and retreated without the loſſe of any. Theſe were the Worceſter Forces with whom the <hi>Welſh</hi> had not yet joyned. The ſame afternoon after our retreat the enemie had planted two great Culverins of between 15. and 16. pound bullet at the Eaſt ſide out of Musket ſhot point blanke, with which they made ſome ſtore of ſhot, intending to batter the Town-wall, but did no harm, although many fell into the Town. They then likewiſe began the making of a redoubt in a field neer Lanthony towards Severn, making a breaſt-work from it to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony wall croſſe the cauſey. And we perceiving by their Canon Baskets they placed in their Square redoubt in Gawdy Green that they intended a battery there, began the lining of our Towne wall from the South to the Eaſt gate, which we ſhortly after perfected; That night the enemy ſhot ſeverall great Granadoes out of their Morter pieces, they all brake, but did no harme; we have ſince received intelligence from ſome that were the whole Leaguer in the Kings Army, that their biggeſt Morter-piece brake at the firſt diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, they ſay the biggeſt in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sunday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13. The Enemy having planted three pieces of Ordnance on their battery at Gawdy Green of 15. and 23 lb. bullet weight, began to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wall and brick-houſe over againſt Rignall ſtile, killed one of our men (no ſouldier) in the ſaid Brick-houſe, as he was peeping there, but did no other harm. This day we began the blocking up of the South port, making a damme of earth againſt the draw bridge, and a breaſt-work Canon proofe againſt the wall reaching from the draw bridge to the gate, and lining the houſes on each ſide, and the Almeſ-houſe between the gate and draw-bridge with earth.</p>
            <p>Munday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 14. We had ſome ſuſpition and kind of intelligence that they were drawing Ordnance to the Kingſhome; And that it lay in ſome grounds undiſcovered between the North gate and the Margarets; wherupon a party of about 150. Musketteers commanded by Captaine <hi>Mallery</hi> ſallied forth of the North port to ſurprize it, but not finding any, retreated, without loſſe, but killed four of the enemies, and took two priſoners, and fired ſome of their quarters at the Margarets. This day the enemy played with their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from Gawdy Green, and battered the Town wall on the South-ſide of the Fryers Orchard, but we quickly made up the breach with wool-ſackes and Canon Baskets. By this time they had drawne their trench in Gawdy

Green neer the meat at Rignall ſtile, where they made a kind of Mine to drain the moat, which much ſunk the water of the moat between the South and Eaſt ports.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 15. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The enemy removed their tents and carriages to their Leaguer neer <hi>Lanthony.</hi> And in the afternoon valiant <hi>Iames Harcus,</hi> Captain Lievetenant to the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> was ſlaine in the Fryars Orchard, as he was too venterouſly looking what execution a Granado had done, which he then threw into the enemies trenches.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, 16. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> About 150. Musketteers commanded by Captain <hi>Criſpe</hi> ſallied forth at the North port, and fell upon the enemies trenches upon the Eaſt ſide of the Friars Orchard, killed above 100. men (as is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome of the enemies themſelves) wounded many, beat them out of their trenches, took ſome Spades, Shovels, and Arms, and retreated without the loſſe of any, only two wounded after an exceeding hot skirmiſh for the ſpace of halfe an hour or more, the Canon and Muskets on both ſides playing moſt furiouſly. Amongſt others a Serjeant and Corporall of Captaine <hi>Nelmes</hi> Company were obſerved to behave themſelves very bravely. The enemie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this day to intrench between Barton ſtreet and the Fryars Barne, within musket ſhot of the wals. And we imployed ſome time in lining of the houſe adjoyning to the North gate with earth, and in amending and ſtrengthening the works about the Fryars Barne.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, 17. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The enemy ſhot divers Granadoes out of their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in Gawdy Green into the Towne; whereof about four fell upon ſome houſes and brake into them, but (by Gods providence) did no harme, and one fell into the ſtreet neer the South gate, but a woman coming by with a payle of water, threw the water thereon, and extinguiſhed the phuſe thereof, ſo that it did not break, but was taken up whole: it weighed 60. pound weight. This night the enemy made divers alarmes about the City, and our Ordnance and Muskettiers plaid hard againſt them. They then likewiſe brought fagots and the like to the moate by the Fryars Orchard, but were beaten off by our mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketteers from the wals. This day a printed paper conteyning the Kings Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and our Anſwer thereunto was ſent out of the Kings Army, unto M. Alderman <hi>Pury,</hi> with a perſwaſive Letter for the ſurrendring up of the Citie the cloſe of which printed paper runs thus, <hi>Let the world now judge if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie could have ſent a more gratious Meſſage to his moſt loyall Subjects, and whether theſe deſperate Rebels deſerve any mercy, who after ſo many Offers do ſtill refuſe a pardon: but ſince their returning this rebellious anſwer they have ſet their own ſuburbs on fire; which ſurely is not to keep the City either for King or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp;c. At the ſame time there was alſo ſent unto him certain ſpecious conſiderations and reaſons ſubtilly compoſed, tending to ſatisfie Conſcience in the delivering up of the Citie not withſtanding the late Oath and Proteſtation, wherewith all the ſaid Capt. <hi>Pury</hi> being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, did not divulge the ſame till after the ſiege was raiſed.</p>

Green upon the wall on the South ſide of the Fryars Orchard, but did ſmall hurt thereunto. They having likewiſe (after the conjunction of the <hi>Welſh</hi> with the <hi>Worceſter</hi> Forces) drawn 4. pieces of Ordnance to the Kingſholme, one whereof they planted againſt the Awnyate, and the ſconces thereunto adjoyning. A partie of about 400. Muskettiers commanded by Major <hi>Pudſey,</hi> and Captain <hi>Gray</hi> aſſiſted by Captain <hi>Faulkner,</hi> and Captain <hi>Maſſie,</hi> ſallied forth of the North gate, being led by one <hi>Weaver,</hi> a ſtout fellow of Captain <hi>Pury</hi> the youngers Company as their guide, and having ſent Lieutenant <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke</hi> with about 50 Musketteers over the workes at the little meade to give them an alarme, who advancing up to their Canon (that made but one ſhot againſt them,) in the mean while they got behind their Canon and breſtwork there, and fell upon their maine-guard, killed divers of their Officers, and two Canoneers, with about 100 Common Souldiers mortally wounded, Captain <hi>Baſſet</hi> with divers others, took Lieutenant <hi>Tipper</hi> and about 4 others priſoners, nailed their Canon and retreated without other loſſe then 2 killed, and about 4 taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>Saturday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 19. The enemy having planted 3 peeces of Ordinance at <hi>Gawdy greene</hi> as afore ſaid, and now 3 more on the Eaſt ſide of the Fryars Orchard neare <hi>Rignall</hi> ſtile, within leſſe then Piſtoll-ſhot of the Town-wall, and 2 more in another Battery neare the Eaſt-gate. They began a moſt furious battery upon both ſides of the corner of the wall next <hi>Rignall</hi> ſtile, making above 150 great ſhot thereupon, wherwith they ſhrewdly battered the wall, but our earth-workes ſtood firme; by all this ſhot there was only a man and a maide hurt, and a Canon-bullet, its force being almoſt ſpent, running along the ground ſtruck down a pigge, which our ſouldiers eat, and afterwards well jeered the enemy therewith. Upon this Battery of the wall we began a breſtwork from the wall on the South ſide of the Fryars Orchard all along the middle of the ſaid Orchard, and ſo making up all paſſages into the Towne between that and the Eaſt gate. This day (as hath beene confeſſed by ſome of the Kings Army) we killed three of their principall Canoneers. This day and the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the enemy ſhot divers Granadoes into the Town, whereof one fell in at the top of M. <hi>Hathwayes</hi> houſe into his Chamber over his Kitchin, and thence obliquely deſcending through the end of the Chamber took that with it, and brake in his Court. One piece fell in the Kitchin Chimney, where three women were ſitting by the fire, but by Gods bleſſing hurt neither of them. The reſt did no other hurt then to houſes, and that not much neither. We expected that the enemy would have fallen on this night, whereupon we beat up an Alarme with our Drummes round about the City. The enemy attempted to make a paſſage over the Moat at the place they had battered, but being deſcried by our Sentinels, they were beaten off with ſome loſſe by our musketteers.</p>
            <p>Sunday, 20. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> This morning that Rogue <hi>Hatton,</hi> one of our Canoneers, ran away to the enemie. The enemy followed hard their trench-work, and carrying of Fagots. And ſome of ours, whilſt other went to Church, as at other times, to implore divine aſſiſtance, wrought likewiſe at our works within the City.</p>
            <p>Munday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 21. Two ſeverall parties were deſigned for the nailing of the enemies Canon. The one being about 200. Musketteers, commanded by Captaine <hi>Stevenſon,</hi> and aſſiſted by Captaine <hi>Moore,</hi> ſallied forth at the North gate to have fallen upon their trenches at the Eaſt gate, but their guide fooliſhly miſtaking the way, brought them round about to S. <hi>Iacob Aſhleyes</hi> Quarters at the <hi>Barton,</hi> where about 40. Muskettiers encountred with five Colours of the enemy, and having ſlaine divers of them, and taken Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and Lievetenant <hi>Trappes,</hi> priſoners, forced them to a retreat, then marching through the <hi>Barton</hi> Court, they faced and fired at eight Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors more, and ſo retreated. In the retreat two troops of the enemies horſe came upon the reere, but enſigne <hi>Matthewes</hi> facing about, charged them, and forcing them to retyre, made good our retreat. In this Skirmiſh were two killed, three hurt, and a Serjeant of Captain <hi>Nelmes</hi> taken priſoner; This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was all of Colonell <hi>Stephens</hi> Regiment, and ſome few of Colonell <hi>Devereux</hi> men. The other was of the Lord <hi>Stamfords</hi> Regiment commanded by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Blunt</hi> aſſiſted by Captain <hi>William White,</hi> who ſallied forth by boat down Severne, and marched up to the enemies quarters at Severne ſtreet, beat the enemy out of their redoubt there, (our Canon the mean while playing from the Barbican upon the houſes there) killed Serjeant Major <hi>Wels,</hi> Captain of the Watch, and ſome common ſouldiers, took one priſoner, and advanced up to the Turnepike at the upper end of Severn ſtreet. But the deſigne failing through the miſguidance of the other party, they were called off, and by the help of our Ordnance from the Barbican made a fair retreat without loſſe of any, only two wounded.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 23. About 15. Musketeers ſallied out of the North gate and gave the enemies an alarme and ſo retreated. This day the enemy received ſupply of prviſion and ammunition by water from Briſtoll. We employed our ſelves in lyning the Fryars Barne on the outſide with earth for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Canon there, &amp; in ſtrengthening of our breſtworks there, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the enemy had intended a Battery againſt it. In the evening, the enemy ſhot ſome few granadoes into the Town, which did no harme. And about 9 of the clock at night two of ours out of a Company (all the other ſallies being in like manner Commanded men out of both Regiments) ſallied out of the North-gate, and giving the enemy an allarme retreated. The enemy thereupon after our retreate ſpent good ſtore of powder and ſhot againſt the wind.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. This day there was a conference with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bell</hi> of Sanct hurſt, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hill</hi> of <hi>Tewxbury</hi> within the draw-bridge at the North gate, upon their deſire thereof by a Letter ſent that morning, intimating thereby that they had ſomething to impart unto us for our good by word of mouth, which could not be done by Letter or otherwiſe. The effect of their ſpeech was to perſwade the yeelding up of the citie in regard of the great power &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threats of the enemy, and the ſmall hopes, and in a manner impoſſibility of relief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adding the heavy burthens under which the countrey groaned, which they ſaid were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove heavier if we yeelded not. To this ſpeech they received a reſolute negative an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſo departed. The enemy made divers ſhot this day with two piece of Ordance they had newly planted at <hi>Lanthony,</hi> but did little hurt, killed none. One bullet of about 20. pound weight came through a chamber of the Inne called the Crown, c<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rried a Boulſter before it into the window, and there ſlept in it. This night came the only rain that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned during the whole ſiege, which much annoyed the enemy in their trenches. This night we diſcovered a fire upon Wain-loades hill, which gave us ſome encouragement, becauſe we had appointed a man we had formerly ſent out, if he heard of any relief, and could not come to tell us thereof, to make a fire there, which he now did accordingly. But the enemy not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the countrey ſhould take notice of it, or their ſouldiers be diſcouraged thereby, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſwade them, it was their Stratageme purpoſely made to deceive us, and to draw us out upon ſome Ambuſcadoes they pretended to have layd.</p>

Fryday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25. ſome few Musketteirs of ours this morning ſallied forth of the North port, and gave the enemy an Alarm, who through the ſuddenneſſe of the Alarm, and hurly burly thereupon, had a Barrell of Powder blowne up In the afternoone their Ordnance playd from <hi>Gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Greene,</hi> and they likewiſe from thence ſhot many Granadoes, two fell into the South-gate-ſtreete, whereof one mortally wounded a woman, but did no other harme; ſome others fell upon ſeverall houſes in the Citie, and ſhrewdly battered them, but did no other hurt; one fell-downe upon the enemies workes. They ſhot likewiſe great fire-balls, which did no harme. They alſo ſhot great ſtones out of their morter-pieces, which did little hurt, and killed none. In the evening and night following, they ſhot from their battery at <hi>Lanthony</hi> above twenty fiery melting hot Iron Bullets, ſome 18 pound, others 22; pound waight in the night wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them flying in the ayre like a ſtarre ſhooting, male of them fell into houſes and ſtables where hay was but by Gods great providence did no hurt at all. One came through three houſes, &amp; fell into a chamber of Mr. <hi>Comelins</hi> the Apothecary, and being perceived, many payles of water were caſt upon it to quench the ſame, but that little avayting, it was caſt into a Cowle of water, where after a good ſpace it cooled. This night (it being ſuſpected that falſe rumours of our being taken might be ſpread abroad to hinder our reliefe) it was ordered that ſome lights ſhould be ſet up on the Colledge-Tower, to give notice abroad of our holding our, the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof was committed to the care of Captain <hi>Pury</hi> junior, who performed it accordingly. The enemy vexed there at levelled ſome ſhot at the Tower, one whereof came cloſe by the ſaid Captain <hi>Pury,</hi> as he was looking towards <hi>Lanthony,</hi> whence their fiery Bullets came, who for all that continued the burning of his linkes till the Moone was fully riſen.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 26: The enemy wrought hard in filling up the moate (at the place they had battered with fagotts and earth making a Gallery over the head of their trench, to ſave themſelves tromour ſhot: at night they made ſome ſhot from their Battery at <hi>Gawdy Greene,</hi> upon the Town wall, on the Southſide of the Fryars Orchard but did no harm, onely two or three hurt a little by the flying of the ſtones of the wall. Divers times during this ſiege ſome of our men would go forth ouer the works &amp; fetch hay out of <hi>Walham,</hi> which to prevent the enemy this day, as often before, ſet ſome of the Cockes on fire, which ſome by reaſon of our ſhot, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, dearely repented.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 27. The enemy wrought hard in caſting earth into the Moate, and making divers trenches <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Munday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28. Wee conceived that the enemy had ſunke a mine under the Eaſt gate, whereupon we began to countermine in two ſeverall places there, but finding ſprings we left off, conceiving the enemy would be forced to doe the like for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 29. We began to undermine on the Eaſt ſide of the Fryars Orchard, to make a place to put forth a piece of Ordnance at the bottome of the wall, to batter the flanke of the enemies Gallery, there we likewiſe made ſome great ſhot upon the enemies trenches at the Eaſt gate from the Fryers Barn. This night two Intelligencers we had ſent forth on Saturday-night laſt, returned from <hi>Warwicke</hi> with newes of ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe from his Excellency and Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wedneſday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30. Being the publique faſt day, there were two Sermons preached at St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> without any diſturbance, onely a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Bullet fell into the Church, but did no harme. This day wee turned out our Cattle to graze in the little meade, and ſo continued them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, guarded by ſome Muskettiers, taking them in at night: wee made a bridge of ladders, and thereby put them in over the workes. This day and the day before, the enemy ſhot out of their Canon long loggetts of wood, which did no harme.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31. Wee againe turned out moſt of our Cattle into the little meade, guarded by ſome few Muskettiers, the enemy fretting thereat, ſent out ſome horſe and ſtraggling Muskettiers, upon whom wee did ſome ſmall execution; wee ſhould have done more, durſt the enemy have adventured againſt us, but they kept themſelves ſtill almoſt Musket ſhot at randome of us: At the Barbican three of the company of Sergeant Major <hi>Ferrer</hi> (Major of the Towne, who for his indefatigable paines, and extraordinary care and faithfulneſſe to us, hath exceedingly deſerved of us and the whole Kingdome) crept along Seavern-Bank, and gave the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my an Alarm, holding them play almoſt an houre: upon the Alarm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred of the enemies had gathered themſelves under a wall at <hi>Lanthony,</hi> upon whom wee diſcharged a Demi-culvering, ſhot from the Barbican, which lighted in the midſt of them, made the ſtones of the wall fly about their eares, and could not but doe good execution.</p>
            <p>Fryday <hi>September</hi> 1. About three a clock in the morning, a Sergeant and foure more of Captain <hi>Whites</hi> company, with one <hi>John Barnewood,</hi> of Captain <hi>Pury</hi> the elders Company (who went forth in all the other ſalies with Granadoes) crept forth of a hole made in the Dungeon at the Eaſt-gate, and came very ſoftly to the mouth of the enemies mine there. The ſaid <hi>Barnewood</hi> after he had taken aſide the board that covered it, and a pretty while viewed them, fired and caſt a Granadoe in amongſt them, our foure Muskettiers playing at them as they ran out of it, and ſo retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

without harme. Wee killed foure and hurt others. This put the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into a great fright, they crying nothing but arme, arme, for a good while after.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>September</hi> 2. Our mine in the Fryars Orchard, was early this morning perfected and a Sacre placed there. Five out of a Company were drawne out upon the walles, and ſome Granadoes provided ready. About eight a clock in the morning we playd thence with our great Gunne upon their Gallery, our Muskettiers fending plenty of ſhot into their trenches, and caſt divers Granadoes thereinto. The enemy played with their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon the top of our wall, with which hitting one of our Blinds, they killed one of our men, as he was diſcharging his Musket againſt them. They played likewiſe with their Canon in <hi>Gawdy-Greene</hi> upon the South gate to little purpoſe. Wee battered their Gallery with our Bolt ſhot, but towards the evening the enemy had ſunke a peice againſt the Port-hole of our mine, ſo that we were forced to withdraw our Sacre thence. About night they ſhot ſome Granadoes into the Towne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one fell upon a Stable in the Eaſtgate-ſtreet, neer whereunto ſtood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horſes, but hurt none of them. Our men skirmiſhed this day with ſome ſtraggling men in <hi>Walham,</hi> where they killed a Corporall that refuſed quarter. We diſcovered that the enemy for all the Springs went on with their mine at the Eaſt-gate, whereupon wee renewed our countermine there. The Welſhmen at the Wineyard had likewiſe now at laſt gotten the heart to advance as far as the Towne <hi>Ham,</hi> where placing themſelves in a ditch, they played upon our maides and workmen that were fetching turffes out of the little meade, but our great Gunne at the pen ſpeaking ſome harſh language to them, frighted them away, bereaving ſome of their owne native language.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>September</hi> 3. In the forenoone the Congregation aſſembled at the Church to performe holy duties, but the Miniſter being informed of our great danger conceived at the Eaſt-gate, the enemy having planted ſtore of Canon-baskets there, within leſle then halfe Musket-ſhot, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a battery there, as we conceived, upon the ſpringing of their mine, diſmiſſed the Congregation without any Sermon. Whereupon we began the lining of the houſes over the Eaſt-gate, and the making of a very ſtrong Breſtworke croſſe the Eaſt-gate-ſtreete, with a large trench before it, filled by ſome ſprings there, intending to raiſe it up to the eaves of the houſes, and to plant ſome Canon there. Wee alſo this day finiſhed the Sconce we began <hi>September</hi> 1. upon the Mount in the garden by the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars Orchard, where we could plant foure pieces of Canon, to ſcoure the Fryars Orchard, and all along the Eaſtgate. The enemy with ſome ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling horſe and foote vapoured this day in the <hi>Walham,</hi> but durſt not

come within the reach of our Muſquetiers, upon the retreate of the horſe a peece of Ordnance from Captain <hi>Pury</hi> the elders Sconce, fired and fell in the midſt of them, a white horſe was ſeene to fall. In the afternoone a paper was ſhot upon an arrow into the Towne, the contents whereof was this; <hi>Theſe are to let you underſtand your god</hi> Waller <hi>hath forſaken you, and hath retired himſelfe to the Tower of</hi> London, Eſſex <hi>is beaten like a dog, yeelde to the Kings mercie in time, otherwiſe, if we enter perforce, no quarter, for ſuch obſtinate traiterly rogues.

            <p>Munday, <hi>September</hi> 4. We perceived divers carts loden with ſick and maimed Souldiers going from <hi>Lanthony</hi> to the water ſide at <hi>Sudmeade,</hi> where ſome boats attended to carry them to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> The enemy had taken up all their horſe about the Towne, ſo we had ſome hopes of their raſing the ſiege. This morning early our Miners had gotten as far as the outward part of the Eaſt-gate, where by the working of the enemies we perceived their mine to bee ſunk a great deale lower then ours, ſo that we were above them, whereupon we ſet workemen upon the making of great borers with which wee intended to bore through our mine into theirs and ſo to drowne the enemies mine. We underſtood likewiſe that the enemy had by the direction of that Jeſuitticall Doctor <hi>Chillingworth</hi> provided great ſtore of engines after the manner of the Romane <hi>Teſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines cum Pluteis</hi> with which they intended to have aſſaulted the parts of the City, bbtweene the South and Weſt Gates. Theſe engines ran upon cart wheeles with a blinde of plankes Muſquet proofe, and holes for foure Muſquetiers to play out of, placed upon the axeltree to defend the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers and thoſe that thruſt it forward, and carrying a bridge before it the wheeles were to fall into the ditch, and the end of the bridge to reſt upon our Breſt-workes, ſo making ſeverall compleat bridges to enter the City. To prevent this we intended to have made another ditch out of our workes, ſo that the wheeles falling therein the bridge would have fallen to ſhort of our Breſtworkes into our wet moat, and ſo fruſtrated their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54821:8"/>
intentions. After the raſing of the Seige, we tooke all theſe Engins, and brought them into the Towne. This night we diſcerned two Fires upon <hi>Waynload-Hill,</hi> made by two Meſſengers, we had the night before ſent out to give us Intelligence if reliefe was comming: We anſwered them again with lights in the Colledge Tower. The enemie made about ſix great ſhot from <hi>Lanthony</hi> barn, whereof one of 25 l. bullet weight came through ſome houſes into Maſter <hi>John Halfords</hi> kitchin, where his children were a little before, but did no hurt. We now perfected the lining of the houſes over and by the Eaſt-gate.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>September</hi> 5. was appointed for a publique faſt to be kept within this Citty by ſuch as might be ſpared from labour In the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſermons we diſcouered their carriages from <hi>Lanthony</hi> making vp <hi>Tredworth Feild</hi> and afterwards we perceived their foote and horſe marching after, yet we were not aſſured of their rayſing of their ſeige or that our releife was ſo nere at hand, till we perceived their rere guard to fire their Hutts and their men to be drawn out of their Trenches, which we perceiving, ſome of our men ventured foroth into their Trenches, and fired their Gallery and Canon Baskets. And preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an honeſt countrey man came tunning into the Towne, and told us that his Excellencie had beaten P. <hi>Rupert</hi> about <hi>Stow,</hi> and that the reſt of the Army roſe to ſuccour him. We therupon perceived that God had delivered us, and that we were now freed from the hands of thoſe that had ſo long thirſted after our blood. To him therefore be the honour and glory, <hi>dmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was admirable to obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. The conſtancie of reſolution in Citizens and Souldiers amidſt ſo many temptations by reaſon of promiſes, threats, delay of ſuccour, and want of intelligence even to the very end, although we had not in the whole town above 50 ſingle barrels of powder at the beginning of the ſiege, and not above three or foure at the raiſing thereof. We kept two powder-mills going, and with them made three barrels a week.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The vigilant care and unwearied endeavours of our valiant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and moſt worthy Serjeant Major, and the Officers and Souldiers of both Regiments, in keeping the guards day and night without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and the courage and good ſucceſſe they had in their many ſallies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The cheerfull readineſſe of yong and old of both ſexes, as well of the better as inferiour ſort of people by day and night, to labour in the further ſortification of our Citie. Nay, our maids and others wrought daily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works in the little Mead, in fetching in turſe in the very faces of our enemies.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54821:9"/>
4. The little hurt done by the enemy with their Cannon, Muskets and Mortar peeces, that ſent ſo many terrible meſſengers amongſt us All that we loſt (either taken or ſlain) amounted not to the number of above 50. men, yet we killed of the enemy (although they never durſt venture an aſſault againſt us) above a thouſand men, as hath been confeſſed by ſome priſoners and renegadoes, and is generally confirmed by the voice of the whole cuontrey, that continually heard the muttering of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at their return to their quarters, ſome ſay 1500. ſome more: we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led likewiſe moſt of their Canoniers, ſo that they were forced to ſend to Briſtoll for more, five whereof the King valued before 500. men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The libertie we had in this ſtrait ſiege for holy duties, though wee were continually neecſſitated to bodily labour, and that the ſiege was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon a day of ſolemne humiliation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How opportunely his Excellencie came with reliefe unto us, through the great care of the Parliament and Citie of <hi>London,</hi> even then when the enemy thought themſelves ready to devour us: for they had made many ſtrong works and Batteries within leſſe then piſtoll ſhot of our walls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined our gate, and wrought themſelves quite over our Moat, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their Engines and Bridges in readineſſe. In all theſe they ſhewed and uſed extraordinary skill and induſtry.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The plenty and ſtore of proviſion we had in the town of all ſorts, ſo that we turned out even to the very laſt houre they ſtaied before us, above 200 head of cattell over our workes to graze in the very noſes of them, beſide others we kept in the town upon hay.</p>
            <p n="8">8. How confident our enemies were of prevailing, and how often they vainly promiſed to themſelves victory: yet though they conceived miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, they brought forth a lie, their deſignes were blaſted, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectation delivered.</p>
            <p>Which gracious acts of divine providence do deeply engage us to praiſe the Lord of Hoſts with our hearts, lips and lives, who hath gone out with our Hoſts, whoſe eye hath watched over us, and whoſe ſtrong hand was with us. He made us a Citie of refuge to others, and hath now been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to us in the time of our diſtreſſe. What hath been done by us in our juſt defence againſt unlawfull violence, hath not proceeded from any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty to our ſoveraigne Lord the King (whom God preſerve) but out of our endevours to defend true Religion and Juſtice, the main pillars of the Kings Throne: And therefore we far leſſe deſerve to be ſtiled deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rebels, then thoſe that pretend themſelves good ſubjects, and are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, their practices wholly tending to the ſubverſion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and the deſtruction of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Our cauſe wee commit to him that judgeth righteouſly, upon
<pb facs="tcp:54821:9"/>
whom we only depend for our protection, and to whom we daily pray, that he would be reconciled to Prince and people, and reconcile each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there may be no more ſhedding of innocent blood, nor bitter complaining heard in our ſtreets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laus Deo in aeternum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the ſiege September 12. we received intelligence, that there was ſome Ammunition come from <hi>Briſtoll</hi> in a Bark to <hi>Newnam</hi> (about ten miles from <hi>Gloceſter)</hi> for <hi>Hereford;</hi> wherupon we ſent out a party of about 45 Foot, and a troop of Horſe, to ſeize upon it for the uſe of our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who according ſeized upon the ſame, being two tun of Match, and ſome ſtore of wine, and ſuch other Merchandize, and brought it in wains to <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> ſent out ſome horſe to prevent us, but they durſt not come within a mile of us.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe affection which I bear you in particular, and the Citie in generall (and no ſiniſter end I call God to record) extorteth theſe lines from me: for ſhould I be ſilent when the deſolation of that place (I ſo dearly affect and where I have bin ſo dearly beloved) is at hand; I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive the very ſtones of that Citie being ruined, will riſe up againſt me for ingratitude: But if my advice be not taken, and miſery befall both the place and its neighbourhood, the fault ſhal then reſt on you and the now inhabitants, and my conſcience cleared. You well know, or at leaſt may have heard, that the Citie of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> is taken, twelve ſhips at ſea yeelded, two ſhips of Ammunition from <hi>Rochel</hi> newly come into the Harbour ſeized on, one ſhip with great Artillery and Ammunition coming from the Parliament for reliefe of that Citie, taken. And this I know, that there are great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations made for the taking of your Citie: All Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> forces from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with addition of 1500. armed <hi>Welſh,</hi> and 2000 Club men out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Arms ſufficient for to arm them from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> 800. foot from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> with a Regiment of Horſe, 5000. Foot with a Brgade of Horſe of the Queens from <hi>Oxon.</hi> But I much fear that this will hardly ſink into the beliefe of ſome amongſt you, yet when you ſhall hear of the particular Randevouzes, and your Town ſurrounded, nay, your Houſes fired over your eares; then, when it is too late, I much fear, will be the time of repentance. Wherefore I deſire you, as you love God, and the good of your Citie for which you ſerve, and the which is committed to your charge and protection, to take into conſideration your ſad condition if the Citie be taken by force (moſt of the Army being ſet againſt you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitterly:) And if it be not taken, in what condition of poverty and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery both your Citie and Countrey will fall into. Is not your proviſion

of corn out of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> your commerce (wherein moſt of your live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods and being ſubſiſted) both up and down the River, taken quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? And if you will not conſider your own good, yet in conſcience think on your neighbours in the country, who have alwayes bin aiding &amp; aſſiſting to you for your protection, who muſt expect nothing but ruine, if by no other way, yet by the very lying of ſo mighty an Army amongſt them; and if they be ruined, whence can you expect future ſupplyes, and the very laying of a ſiege before your town, muſt neceſſarily produce a deſtruction to your corn and proviſion of cattell; and who will be loſers thereby but your ſelves, I know not: But this I further know, that your Ammunition is not over-much, your places of ſupply no where, your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy continually at your doore, and able to retire to his own home at pleaſure, and your friends farre, and utterly unable, or at leaſt not capable to ſend you preſent reliefe. I know you to be a conſcientious honeſt man, and one whoſe aimes (as I have thought) have tended to the publick good, and now is the greateſt time and opportunity to demonſtrate your affections by uſing ſome courſe for an accommodation between your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and his Majeſty (who now is here at <hi>Briſtoll)</hi> and from whom I dare boldly affirme by ſome great friends I have neer him at Court, I can procure any favour either for the Citie in generall, or your ſelfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: and of this you may be confident; but if once the forces come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, you muſt expect no manner of mercie, but preſent ruine: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you intend any thing, let it be done with ſpeed, and ſend to my quarter at <hi>Charvild,</hi> where you may ſend any one to me without ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I beſeech you ſeriouſly to weigh theſe things in your breaſt, and to weigh them as coming from one that dearly loves you and your Citie.
