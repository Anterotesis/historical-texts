         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yet she never fell <hi>sans recource</hi> as they

rays'd up her crest again, whence it

translating of the Imperial Court by
<hi>Constantine,</hi> to <hi>Bizantium</hi> (which he

first Principles, and to have pass'd
from one <hi>Shepheard</hi> to another,
<hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Romulus,</hi> to <hi>Sylvester;</hi>
But ther were a world of vicissitudes
and revolutions of goverments inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd,
and pass'd between; Her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive,
and original way of Ruling
was by Kings, but, after a hundred

upon that, which surfett may
be sayed to have proceeded from the
Peeples wantones rather than from
<hi>Tarquins lust;</hi> Then, she was govern'd
a while by <hi>Consulls,</hi> so call'd a <hi>Consulends</hi>
carrying a memento of their duty is
their names; Then followed the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirs</hi>
who were put down for the
same <hi>vice</hi> that destroyed the <hi>Kings</hi>
After that, the Supremacy was delated
to two <hi>Tribunes;</hi> Then it revolv'd to

more than <hi>two,</hi> which lasted a good

came <hi>Consuls</hi> in again the third time,
after that Dictators, untill <hi>Caius

the first <hi>Emperour,</hi> though it cost him

            </p>
            <p>Thus after so many rotations or

of Rulers, the <hi>Imperial</hi> was Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with the consent of the <hi>Senat;</hi> now, it
was the most unpolitique act that ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98449:8"/>
the Roman <hi>Senat</hi> committed, which
prov'd so fatal to so many of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Emperours who held not their
<hi>security</hi> as much as their <hi>lifes</hi> from the
<hi>Soldiers,</hi> which took them away at
plesure; for after that the Election
pass'd from the <hi>Senat</hi> to the <hi>Sword,</hi>
ther were above thirty Emperours
that were put to <hi>violent</hi> deaths, and
som of them very tragical, fower mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
themselfs, many also of those
that were adopted <hi>Caesars,</hi> and design'd
to succeed in the Empire were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
made away, being <hi>rays'd to
that pitch that they might perish the sooner,</hi>
as an Author sayes.</p>
            <p>But to go more punctually to work
we will muster up here most of those
<hi>Emperours</hi> that came to immature and
violent deaths; <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in the <hi>Senat. Octavius</hi> the first
<hi>Augustus</hi> (called so <hi>ab augendo Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
from enlarging the Territories of
the Empire) was made away by his
wife <hi>Livia; Tiberius</hi> by <hi>Macro; Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>
by <hi>Cassius Chereas; Claudius</hi> poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
by his wife <hi>Agrippina; Nero</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98449:8"/>
               <hi>Otho</hi> slew themselfs; <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi>
were done away by the Soldiers; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>
by <hi>Stephanus; Commodus</hi> by <hi>Letus,</hi>
and <hi>Electus; Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Iulianus</hi> by
the Praetorian bands; <hi>Caracalla</hi> by
<hi>Macrinus</hi> command; <hi>Macrinus, Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,
Alexander, Maximinus, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and <hi>Balbinns</hi> by the Soldiers;
<hi>Hostilianus</hi> by <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Aemilianus,</hi>
and they by the Legions; <hi>Valerianus</hi>
died in <hi>Parthia; Florianus</hi> waas ccessary
to his own death; <hi>Aurelianus</hi> murther'd
by his own meniall servants; <hi>Gallienus,
Quintillus, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Probus</hi> by the
militia, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, that which heighned the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Soldiery to such infolences,
was the largesses, and encrease of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
that the Praetorian bands us'd
to receave from the new Emperour,
which pernicious kind of bounty was
begun first by <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> and is
now practised by the <hi>Turk:</hi> for evry
new <hi>Sultan</hi> useth to enhance the pay
of the <hi>Spahies,</hi> and <hi>Ianizaries</hi> to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
aspers more for fear of mutinieng,
which in time may be the bane of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98449:9"/>
               <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, for such hath bin
the presumption allready of the sayed
<hi>Ianizaries</hi> of late yeers that they have
murther'd two of their <hi>Emperours</hi> in
lesse than five and twenty yeers.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
bands came to such an exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of power, that somtimes they did
prostitute, and put the Empire to sale
by publique outcry, as we read how
<hi>Sulpitianus</hi> offerd twenty <hi>Sestertiums</hi>
(which are neer upon eight pounds
sterling apeece) to evry Soldier, but
<hi>Iulianus</hi> rays'd the market higher, and
out-bad him; But <hi>Constantine</hi> the great
(the first Christian Emperour and a
<hi>Britain</hi> born) found out the policy to
regulat, &amp; lessen the Praetorian bands,
till at last he quite casheerd them, at
least reduc'd them to such a nomber
that they could do no hurt.</p>
            <p>The removal of the Imperial Court
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though it prov'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
had the Citty transferr'd unto him by
way of a pious donation from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
about his departure from <hi>Italy</hi> to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98449:9"/>
the <hi>Levant,</hi> as the Church Annals
affirm, though some by way of
drollery, and derogation to the <hi>Pope</hi>
do say, that he hath the same right
to <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Venice</hi> hath to the dominion
of the <hi>Adriatique Gulph,</hi> and that they
are both inserted in one patent,
though that patent cannot be found
upon any record; I say though this
removall was an advantage to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet it prov'd very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to <hi>Italy</hi> in general, and to all
the Western parts of the Empire, for
many rough-hewn Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that desir'd to come neerer
the <hi>Sun,</hi> took the advantage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to rush in, not only to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and harasse her so often, but
like so many fwarms of Locusts they
cover'd other Countreys, (And some
fear'd the like of the late <hi>Swedish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
had they prosper'd in <hi>Poland</hi>)
The <hi>Huuns</hi> took such firm footing that
they gave the name to <hi>Hungary;</hi> The
<hi>Longobards</hi> to <hi>Insubria,</hi> and the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about <hi>Milan;</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi>
piercing the very heart of <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98449:10"/>
overcame <hi>Spain,</hi> and denominated
<hi>Andaluzia,</hi> Insomuch that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
King of <hi>Spain</hi> doth acknowledg
himself to be <hi>de la sangre de los Godos,</hi> to
descend from the Goths, wherby som
wold inferr that he is a <hi>German</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by extraction from the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> but also from the <hi>Gothique</hi>
race, who were a branch of the
<hi>Teutons,</hi> or <hi>Germans,</hi> taking the word
in the largest sense; but more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may <hi>Germany</hi> challenge the <hi>French,</hi>
and <hi>English</hi> to be her Children, the
first comming from the Territories of
<hi>Franconia,</hi> the other from the lower
Circle of <hi>Saxony</hi> wherof they bear the
names (<hi>Saissons</hi>) among the <hi>Welsh</hi> and
<hi>Irish</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>But to proceed from the main sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Eastern part of the Roman
Empire bore up many ages after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
with som lustre in the Levant,
though the Northwest parts suffred
many Eclipses, being so pittifully
dilacerated, and torn by the fury of
forein Nations; Now the chiefest
cause therof may be ascrib'd to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motenes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98449:10"/>
of the Emperours person at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> who by reason of so
incommunicable a distance could not
reach a timely hand to assist them
with auxiliaries; But about the yeer
eight hundred a new kind of auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
star appeer'd in the <hi>West,</hi> which
was <hi>Charlemain,</hi> whom the <hi>Germans</hi> do
claym to be their Compatriot,
though they go a great way back and
fetch him from <hi>Pharamond,</hi> or the first
race of the Kings who invaded <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and by way of conquest call'd it
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemain</hi> was the Gran-child of
<hi>Charles Martell,</hi> who being <hi>Maire of the
Palace,</hi> or chief Steward and Surinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Kings Court gott his Son
<hi>Pepin</hi> to be crown'd King of <hi>France</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the head of <hi>Chilperic</hi> his liege lord
and master, <hi>Martel</hi> giving out that he
did not follow the <hi>ambition</hi> of his
heart, but the <hi>inspirations</hi> of heaven
in this act; So the <hi>Scotts</hi> stories tell us
that the Family of the <hi>Stewards</hi> came
to be Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> by taking their
Surnames from their office, for as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98449:11"/>
               <hi>Charles Martell</hi> was in <hi>France,</hi> so the
first of them was <hi>Steward</hi> of the Kings
Court in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pepin</hi> though a little man did great
exploits, for he cross'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and
recover'd <hi>Lombardy</hi> where a race of
<hi>Goths</hi> had bin Kings above 200 yeers,
And at his return to <hi>France</hi> conferr'd
the <hi>Exarcbatship,</hi> or Vicegerency of
<hi>Italy</hi> upon the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemain</hi> his Son did higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments,
for he clammer'd ore the
<hi>Pyreneans</hi> and debell'd the <hi>Saracens</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> discomfited the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and
confirm'd the conquest of <hi>Italy,</hi> so
that he was solemnly saluted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of the West at <hi>Rome</hi> by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
voice, and wonderfull acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the peeple, and so confirm'd
by the Popes benediction (<hi>Leo</hi> the
4th. on Christmas day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicehporus</hi> in <hi>Constantinople</hi> stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
extremely at first ther shold be
another Emperour besides himself,
alledging that he was the sole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperour, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
us'd to send his <hi>Exarques,</hi> or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98449:11"/>
to govern <hi>Italy,</hi> but not knowing
how to remedy it, he complied at last
with <hi>Charlemagne</hi> who then kept his
Court in <hi>Germany,</hi> where he died, and
was buried at <hi>Aquisgrave,</hi> leaving
<hi>Ludovicus</hi> his son to succeed him, who
partitioning the Empire afterwards
twixt his three Sonns did wonderfully
enervat and enfeeble it, as a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cutt out into many armes, and
sluces must needs grow weaker and
shallower in her first bed.</p>
            <p>Now, though <hi>Charlemain</hi> was an
extraordinary heroique, and a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
gallant man as his actions
tell us, yet his children for fower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents
together did strangely degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,
and prov'd but poor spirited men,
His Son <hi>Lewis</hi> was call'd the <hi>Gentle</hi> for
his <hi>soft</hi> nature, <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald was
of a baser alloy than hee, <hi>Lewis</hi> the
stuttring inferior to both, <hi>Charles</hi>
the grosse the last Emperour and
King of <hi>France</hi> died a most disastrous
death; After him the Empire was
soly devolv'd to the <hi>Germans; Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>
and his Dependants enjoy'd it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98449:12"/>
118 yeers, then it came to the House
of <hi>Saxony</hi> who held it 117 yeers, The
House of <hi>Suevia</hi> 110, other families
(wherof the House of the <hi>Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
of the Rhin, and of <hi>Nassaw</hi> were
somtimes) held the Empire 112 yeers,
untill it came to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
who have held it longer than any one
<hi>Family</hi> ever did.</p>
            <p>Now, ther is a remarquable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
how the House of <hi>Austria</hi> came
to that comble of greatnes, which
they report thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rodulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Habspurg</hi> returning
homeward fromhunting one day over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a Priest that had the Eucharist
under his habit, comming from visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a sick body, The Earl finding he
was tyr'd alighted, and help'd the
Priest a horsback, and holding the
bridle in his hand wayted upon him
as a lacquay till he came to the
Church, and replac'd the Host upon
the Altar, The Priest sang an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Masse (where the Earl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
attended all the while) and
pronouncing the Benediction at the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98449:12"/>
end, he cross'd the Earl, saying that
for so signal, and a sweet Act of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
His <hi>House</hi> shold be one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and most glorious Families that
ever was upon Earth, which prov'd
tru, for a while after not only the
<hi>German</hi> Empire, but the East, and
West Indies, with all the Dominions
of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherof some are the tother
side of the world, came to that Family.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, I will proceed
to the <hi>Septemvirat,</hi> or Colledg of <hi>Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
(wherof I promis'd an account in

'twas a prerogative of Hers <hi>de jure

procuring a Cosen of his to be created
<hi>Pope</hi> by the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the fift,
who being a <hi>German</hi> born, was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable

by the title of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ninth: <hi>Otho</hi>

<hi>Rome,</hi> which open'd her Gates

            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> being victoriously return'd to

so after many mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Bull</hi> the <hi>grand Charter</hi> of the Empire
(so call'd because 'twas confirm'd by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98449:16"/>
the <hi>Pope</hi>) is saluted by the Title of
<hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and not Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
till he be crown'd with three
Crowns, <hi>viz.</hi> with the <hi>golden</hi> Crown
representing <hi>Rome,</hi> with a <hi>sylver</hi>
Crown representing <hi>Germany,</hi> and
with an <hi>Iron</hi> Crown representing
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> which ceremony useth to
be perform'd at <hi>Aquisgrave</hi> for all the
three places, But he is not to be call'd
<hi>Augustus</hi> till confirm'd by the Pope.</p>
            <p>At the first day of the Emperours
Inauguration, the foresayed <hi>Electors</hi>
were to give their personal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in the Emperours Court, but
now they are dispens'd withall to do
it by proxy.</p>
            <p>Before the Palace Gate ther us'd to
stand a heap of Oats to the breast of
a Horse, then comes the Duke of
<hi>Saxony</hi> mounted, having in his hand
a sylver wand, and a sylver measure
stood by, which was to weigh two
hundred Marks, he fills the measure,
sticking his wand afterwards in the
remainder, and so goes to attend the
Emperour; The three <hi>Arch-bishopps</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98449:17"/>
say Grace; The Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
comes also on hors-back with a
sylver bason of water, of the value
of twelve Marks, and a clean towell
which, being alighted, he holds to the
Emperour; Then comes the Count
<hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin</hi> a hors-back also,
and being alighted he carries fower
dishes of meat, ev'ry dish of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of three Marks; Then the King
of <hi>Bohemia</hi> comes with a napkin on his
arm, with a cover'd cupp of twelve
Marks which he presents.</p>
            <p>Touching the precedence of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
among themselfs one may judg of
it by the maner of their session with
the Emperour, when he sitts in Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
which is thus.</p>
            <p>The Arch-bishop of <hi>Tryers</hi> high
Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> sitts over against
the Emperour; The Arch-bishop of
<hi>Moguntia</hi> or <hi>Mentz,</hi> as high Chancelor
of <hi>Germany</hi> sitts on the right hand of
the Emperour; The Arch-bishop of
<hi>Collen</hi> on the left hand; The King of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> hath his seat on the right hand
of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and next
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98449:17"/>
him the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin;</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> fitts on the left
hand of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Collen,</hi>
and by him the Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover when they us'd to go in
procession with the Emperour 'twas
ordain'd in the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> that
the Arch-bishop of <hi>Tryers</hi> shold go
before his Imperial Majesty, and
neer him on both sides one of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Electors; The King of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> was to go alone after the
Arch-bishops, and after him the
Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> with the naked
Sword of the Empire in his hand,
having on his right hand the Count
<hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> carrieng the
golden <hi>apple</hi> which denotes the world
to be under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire;
And on the left hand of the Duke
of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
was to march with a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his hand, then followed
the Emperour himself.</p>
            <p>By what hath bin spoken the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98449:18"/>
Reader may judg who had
the priority of place, the Count
<hi>Palatin</hi> of the Rhin or the Duke of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> a Contest that hath gravell'd
many.</p>

            <p>COncerning the Character, and
title of <hi>Emperour,</hi> it is of a

and among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was in

Commander in chief of the <hi>Militia,</hi> nor
was it neer of such a transcendency

<hi>tutoyè</hi> he was but <hi>Thou'd</hi> when he was

the <hi>Churchmen</hi> began to magnifie,
or rather deifie him with sublime at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributs,
as we read in <hi>Symmachus</hi> in his

wherin his stile unto them is <hi>Vestra ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitas,
vestrum numen, vestra perenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,

to be call'd <hi>Divus Imperator;</hi> but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the title of <hi>Majestas,</hi> which was
given <hi>ab augendo Imperium</hi> (as was
touch'd before,) or as some wold have
it a <hi>majori statu,</hi> it is an attribut of
no great antiquity, for it is not found
among the old Authors, and it came

the <hi>prime potentat</hi> and Prince
<hi>paramount</hi> among Christians, and not

only among them, but the <hi>Turk,</hi> next
himself accounts the <hi>German</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
the greatest Monark upon Earth,
and esteems him accordingly, which
appeer'd in the person of <hi>David Vng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadius,</hi>
who being not an age since
Ambassador in <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the

for audience to the Duana in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi>
the <hi>Perfian</hi> Ambassador had come

            <p>Some <hi>Civilians</hi> exalt the Emperour
with divers transcendent titles, wherof
one is, <hi>Dominus totius terrae,</hi> the lord of the

to acknowledg a kind of subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by way of Complement; but <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the third of <hi>England</hi> wold not
kisse the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s
feet at their Enterview in <hi>Colen,</hi> and
the reason he alledg'd, was, because
he was <hi>Rex inunctus habens vitam &amp;
membrum in potestate sua, &amp;c.</hi> because
he was an anointed King having life
and limb in his power, &amp;c. which <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
as the <hi>German</hi> Annals attest, <hi>Ab
Electoribus fuit vocatus, et nominatus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius
Imperii,</hi> he was call'd, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<hi>Vicar</hi> of the Empire, and as
some have it, was offer'd to be Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98449:21"/>
in regard of his acquests, and
glorious Exploits in <hi>France,</hi> whence
he brought the three flower <hi>de luces</hi>
upon his Sword, after the French had
sent him that geering answer that <hi>la
Couronne de France n'est pas liee a la que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noville,</hi>
that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> was
not tied to a distaff.</p>
            <p>Add herunto that the Emperour
cannot be call'd so pure, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a Monark as some other Kings,
for besides that he is but Tenant for
life and govern'd by <hi>Diets</hi> which are
Imperial Parlements, the Electors
may be sayed to be his <hi>Associats,</hi> and
to have a share in the goverment;
Nay, the Emperour by the ancient
customs of the Empire may be
brought to answer <hi>in causis pro quibus
impetitus fuerit,</hi> sayeth the Bull, before
the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> but he

            </p>
            <p>Ther want no examples that some
Emperours have bin depos'd for their
mal-administration, an instance shall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98449:21"/>
be made in <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> in the yeer

theater in the plaines of <hi>Brubach</hi>
neer the river of <hi>Rhin</hi> by a judicial

Prince Elector and Archchancellor of the
German Nation, in the name of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Electors, Dukes, Landgraves, Counts,
and other Lords, Barons, and Potentats of
the Empire, in regard of divers dommageable
interests, and for the special importance of all
the Empire, we do depose, and deprive by
common consent, and Mature deliberation,
<hi>Wincestaus</hi> as negligent, unprofitable,
and unworthy of the Roman Empire; We
degrade him of all the dignities and of all
the honors which were due to him from the
Empire, and we publish him in the presence
of all the Princes, Barons, and Potentats of
the Empire for a prophane person, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of such an honor, and dignity; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
Evry one of what quality or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever he bee, not to yeeld him obedience
as Emperonr, prohibiting evry one to payhim
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98449:22"/>
any kind of tribut, fief, or forfeiture, either by
Right or by covenant, or any office appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Empire, Nay, we will that those
perquisits be reserv'd untill God doth give
us the grace to elect an Emperour, that may
be for the benefit of the whole Empire, and
the Christian Common-weale. And it is
well known how often he hath bin admonish'd
by the Princes Electors both in publique and
privat, and particularly by ev'ry one of our
Order that he wold leave his unworthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
and carry himself as his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
requir'd.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>King of the Romans,</hi>
it is but a modern title, peculiar to him
who is declar'd Heir apparent, or the
design'd Successor of the Empire; But at
first, he who was so chosen was called
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and it was the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi>
who first cal'd <hi>AeliusVerus</hi> by that title,
insomuch that the family of <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
being extinct in the person of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Nero</hi> who was the sixt in descent
(as afore was told) the name <hi>Caesar</hi>
ceas'd to be us'd as the name of a <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or blood, but it was us'd as a name
meer <hi>honorary,</hi> and precedent to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98449:22"/>
Empire; Afterwards the design'd
Successor to the Empire was call'd
<hi>Despote,</hi> after that he was call'd <hi>King of
Italy,</hi> then <hi>King of Germany,</hi> and lastly
<hi>King of the Romans, Romischer Konig</hi> in
high Dutch, and the Emperour himself
was only call'd <hi>Caesar Keyser</hi> in Dutch,
wch appellation continueth to this day;
And it was <hi>Charles the</hi> 5 who introduc'd
the title of <hi>King of the Romans,</hi> who since
is acknowleg'd the immediat, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
apparent Heir and to
succeed in the Empire, whether it be
by <hi>Resignation,</hi> by <hi>deprivation,</hi> or <hi>death,</hi>
being in <hi>proximo fastigio collocatus</hi> to the
Emperour; Nay som <hi>Civilians</hi> hold
that the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> may make
<hi>Edicts</hi> without the regnant Emperour,
being bound only as they say, <hi>Majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
Imperialem comiter observare,</hi> making
him hereby to owe a duty of <hi>reverence,</hi>
but not of <hi>superiority</hi> to the <hi>Keysar</hi> or

a solemn yeerly convention at <hi>Lubeck</hi>

<hi>Hans</hi> or Hansiatique Association is of
long antiquity; touching the <hi>word,</hi>
some wold fetch it from <hi>hand,</hi> because
they of the <hi>Society</hi> plight their faith
when they enter into the fraternity;
others derive it from the word <hi>Hansa,</hi>
which is <hi>Counsell</hi> or advice in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thique</hi>

from <hi>Hander see</hi> which signifieth a

that all their Townes are so situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,

the old <hi>Hans</hi> was from the <hi>Nerve</hi> in

they had any other Protector (unles of

to pay but <hi>one per cent</hi> custom, which
continued till Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, and
by the advice of King <hi>Philip</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
she Enhanc'd the <hi>one</hi> to <hi>twenty per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent;</hi>
The <hi>Hans</hi> not only complain'd,
but clammor'd allowd for breach of
their ancient privileges confirm'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by long prescription from
<hi>thirteen</hi> successive Kings of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98449:25"/>
which they pretended to have pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
with their money; King <hi>Philip</hi>
undertook to accommodat the busines,
but Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dieng, a ltttle after
(out of a conceit of the lesse of <hi>Calais,</hi>
which she sayed upon her death-bed
should be found Engraven in her heart
if she were open'd) and he retiring
hence, there could be nothing done;
Complaints being made afterwards to
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> she answered, that,
<hi>as she wold not innovat any thing, so she
would protect them still in the immunities,
and condition she found them.</hi> Hereupon
their navigation, and traffic was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
awhile, which prov'd very
advantagious to the <hi>English,</hi> for they
tryed what they could do themselfs
herein, and after som adventures they
thrive so well that they took the
whole trade into their own hands, and
so divided themselfs to <hi>Staplers,</hi> and
<hi>Merchant adventurers,</hi> the one residing
constant in one place, the other stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and adventuring to divers towns
abroad with cloth, and other manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures;
This so netled the <hi>Hans,</hi> that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98449:26"/>
they devis'd all the wayes they could
to draw upon them the ill opinion of
other Nations; Moreover the <hi>Hans</hi>
towns being a body incorporated in
the <hi>German Empire,</hi> complain'd to the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> who sent over Ambassadors
to mediat the busines, but they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd
still <hi>re infectâ;</hi> Herupon the Queen
caus'd a proclamation to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
that the Merchants of the
<hi>Hans</hi> shold be intreated, and us'd as
all other strangers within her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in point of Comerce, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mark of distinction.</p>
            <p>This nettled them the more, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they bent their forces more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly,
and in an <hi>Imperial Diet</hi> at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
they procur'd that the <hi>English</hi>
Merchants who had associated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
in corporations both in <hi>Embden,</hi>
and other places, shold be adjudg'd
<hi>Monopolists;</hi> whereupon ther was a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitial
Edict</hi> procur'd against them
that they shold be exterminated,
and banish'd out of all parts of the
<hi>Empire,</hi> which was done by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of <hi>Suderman</hi> a great <hi>Civilian;</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98449:26"/>
Ther was there at that time for Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> Mr. <hi>Gilpin,</hi> as nimble a man
as <hi>Suderman,</hi> and he had the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of <hi>Embden</hi> to countenance and
second him, but they could not stop
the <hi>Edict</hi> wherby the society of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Merchants adventurers were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
a <hi>Monopoly;</hi> yet <hi>Gilpin</hi> played
his cards so well that he wrought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand that the sayed Imperial <hi>Ban</hi>
shold not be publish'd till after the
dissolution of the <hi>Diet,</hi> and that in the
<hi>interim</hi> his Imperial Majesty shold
send an Ambassador to <hi>England</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
the Queen of such proceedings
against her Merchants; But this
made so little impression on the Queen,
that the sayed <hi>Ban</hi> grew to be rather
ridiculous than formidable; for the
town of <hi>Embden</hi> harbour'd our
Merchants notwithstanding, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the town of <hi>Stode;</hi> but they,
being not so able to protect them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Imperial <hi>Ban</hi> removed, and
settled themselfs in <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> After
this the Queen commanded another
proclamation to be publish'd, that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98449:27"/>
               <hi>Hansiatique</hi> Merchants shold be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd
to trade into <hi>England</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same <hi>conditions</hi> and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as their own Subjects did,
provided that the <hi>English</hi> Merchants
might have the same privileges, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and trade peaceably in <hi>Stode</hi> or
<hi>Hamburgh,</hi> or any where else within
the precincts of the <hi>Hans;</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
them more, therupon endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were made to cut off <hi>Stode,</hi> and
<hi>Hamburgh</hi> from being Members of
the <hi>Hans,</hi> or of the <hi>Empire,</hi> but they
suspended this dessein till they saw
what successe the great <hi>Spanish Armada</hi>
shold have which was then preparing
in the year 88, for they had not long
before made their addresse to the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> which had done them som
good offices; Wherfore to this day
King <hi>Philip</hi> and his Councell were
tax'd of a great oversight, that ther
was no use made of the <hi>Hans</hi> towns in
that great Expedition against <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> finding that they of
the <hi>Hans</hi> were not contented with that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98449:27"/>
               <hi>Equality</hi> she had offer'd to make twixt
them, and her own Subjects, put out
a Proclamation that they shold tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport
neither corn, victuals, arms, tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
masts, cables, metals, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
materials, or men to <hi>Spain,</hi> or
<hi>Portugal;</hi> And after, the Queen grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more redoubted, and famous by
the overthrow of the Fleet in 88, The
<hi>Hans</hi> began to despair of doing any
good; Add herunto that another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
befell them, which was the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of 60 <hi>Sayles</hi> of their Shipps about
the mouth of the River of <hi>Lisbon</hi> by
the <hi>Queens</hi> Shipps, that went laden
with <hi>ropas de contrabando,</hi> or goods
prohibited by her former Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into the Dominions of <hi>Spain;</hi>
And as these Shipps were ready to
be discharged, she had intelligence
of an extraordinary Assembly
at <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which had purposely
mett to consult of means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
of her, therupon she made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
prize of the sayed 60 Shipps,
only two were freed to bring home ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
what became of the rest; Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98449:28"/>
the <hi>Pole</hi> sent a ranting Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
in the behalf of the <hi>Hans,</hi> who
spake in a high tone, but the <hi>Queen</hi>
herself did suddenly answer him in a
higher.</p>
            <p>These premisses being well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it prov'd an advantagious thing
for <hi>England</hi> that this clash fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Her and the <hi>Hans,</hi> for ever since
the <hi>English</hi> Merchants have beaten a
peacefull and an un-interrupted trade
into <hi>High and Low Germany,</hi> with their
Manufactures of Wool, the Golden
fleece of <hi>England,</hi> and found also a way
through the <hi>White Sea</hi> to <hi>Archangell,</hi>
and <hi>Mosco,</hi> which may be sayed to
have been the chiefground of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Shipping, Mariners, and
Merchandising which she is come
unto.</p>
            <p>Now, ther is one passage in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
observable, that the <hi>Hans-towns,</hi>
do not tie themselfs to obey the <hi>Bans,</hi>
and Edicts of the Imperial <hi>Diet</hi> no
further than it conduceth to their own
interest, as it appeer'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of <hi>Embden, Stode</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98449:28"/>
in the traverses of this busines, which
towns stuck stil to the <hi>English</hi> Factories,
notwithstanding the publique transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
&amp; prohibitions of the <hi>Diet</hi> to the
contrary, <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> hath a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
critical saying of the <hi>German Diets</hi>
when he sayeth <hi>omnes Germanorum Dietas
esse valde faecundas, et quamlibet in ventre
habere alteram, Ac credible est quia fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineum
sit nomen libenter impregnari, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
est parturire.</hi> All the <hi>German Diets</hi> are
fruitfull, in regard ev'ry one hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commonly in its belly, and 'tis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
because <hi>Diet</hi> is of the Faeminine
gender she is more willing to be got
with Child; wherunto alluded also the
saying of (<hi>harles</hi> the fift, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
<hi>German Diets</hi> were like vipers, for as
these destroy their Damms, so the
latter Decrees of <hi>Diets</hi> destroy the
former.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt longer upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
than my propos'd brevity
requir'd, but the <hi>Hans</hi> being that
part of the <hi>Empire</hi> with whom
<hi>England</hi> hath most <hi>correspondence</hi> in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98449:29"/>
point of negotiation and comerce,
I suffred my self to be transported
till my pen came to a full period.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> when she was
at the highest altitude of greatnes, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98449:30"/>
glory, may be sayed to have had no
horizon, while she sate upon her <hi>seven
Hills</hi> she may be sayed to have <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd</hi>
the World; She was once <hi>fifty</hi>
miles in circuit, and <hi>five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi>
free Citizens were computed to
be within her Walls, by that famous
cense which was made that <hi>Vopiscus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
The <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle fix'd his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
upon the Banks of <hi>Euphrates East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
on the <hi>Nile</hi> South, on the <hi>Danube</hi>
and the <hi>Rhin</hi> Northward, and flew
West as farr as the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>German</hi>
Seas; Her annual revenues were then
computed at a <hi>hundred and fifty millions,</hi>
wherof the salary of her <hi>legionary</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
amounted to above twenty Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
some of her Generals usually
brought ten thousand talents into her
<hi>aerarium,</hi> her <hi>Exchequer,</hi> at their return
from abroad, and <hi>Gabinius twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;</hi>
Som of her <hi>Emperours</hi> are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have strew'd the Amphitheater
with <hi>gold sand</hi> in their publique spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,

               <hi>Aquila, Electa, Iustè, Omnia, Vincit.</hi> But
she may be sayed to have shrunk since
from a <hi>Giantess</hi> to a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> Insomuch
that he who hath the Empire now may
be sayed to have an <hi>Eagles</hi> feather on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Capp, for he must have som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own to support the sacred
<hi>Caesarian</hi> Majesty, els he may be put to
live upon Alms; Take all the tributes
of the free Towns, they come but to
<hi>five thousand</hi> Crowns a yeer, but for
any tru <hi>fundum,</hi> or Real estate ther's
none; He depends meerly upon the
plesure of the <hi>Diet</hi> for all publique pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary
erogations, and taxes; And
wheras we read that <hi>Charles the fift</hi> had
once <hi>ninety thousand foot,</hi> and <hi>thirty five
thousand effectif horse</hi> against <hi>Solyman,</hi>
and above that nomber against the
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> most of those were leavied
in his own Dominions, and patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Territories, Insomuch that if
the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles were not imp'd with
<hi>Austrian</hi> feathers they wold be as bald
as a Coot.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Almain,</hi> as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
statists have delivered their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98449:31"/>
is a continent of that large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion,
and so well peepled, that
take the whole bulk together she is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to rayse two hundred thousand
effectif men, and maintain them by a
general unanimous contribution.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, if you desire to
know the reason of this so great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
and decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
ther were many causes concurr'd
therunto, the main cause was touch'd
before, <hi>viz.</hi> the translation of <hi>Caesars</hi>
Court from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
wherby <hi>Italy,</hi> and the rest of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
parts of the <hi>Empire</hi> were left obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and as a prey to other Nations;
Add herunto the dismembring of the
<hi>Empire</hi> into East and West, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accidents pointed at before.</p>
            <p>But for the declination of the <hi>Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental</hi>
Empire founded by <hi>Charlemain,</hi>
ther was a greater concurrence of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes;
First the unhappy partition that
<hi>Lewis the Gentle Charlemains</hi> Son, made
of the <hi>Empire</hi> to find a-pannage and
portions for his Sons, wherof he had
three; Adde herunto, that when the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98449:31"/>
Empire came to be within the <hi>German</hi>
pale, and <hi>Italy</hi> became but a <hi>Province</hi>
to <hi>Germany,</hi> being to be dispos'd of by
the Colledg of <hi>Electors,</hi> They who
aspir'd to be Emperours, or to have
their Sons to succeed them us'd to
prepossesse, and oblige the <hi>Electors</hi> by
donatifs, and indeed no lesse than
bribes, as <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth to make
his Son <hi>VVenceslaus</hi> capable to succeed
him, offer'd them a <hi>hundred thousand
Florins apeece,</hi> as <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> hath
it, but having no ready money to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
them, he transferr'd, and pass'd
over som <hi>Imperial</hi> townes unto them,
wherof the Count <hi>Palatin</hi> of the <hi>Rhin</hi>
had three for his share at one time,
<hi>viz. Openheim, Inquelien,</hi> &amp; <hi>Keyserlausen.</hi>
It is recorded in the Imperial Annals
that <hi>Gerardus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi>
was call'd <hi>pro pola Imperii,</hi> the Hucster
of the Empire, and having conspir'd
with others of his Complices against
<hi>Albert</hi> the first, and design'd to elect
another Emperour, the sayed <hi>Gerardus</hi>
having a hunting horn about him, and
being a potent popular man, he wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98449:32"/>
out these words <hi>In hoc cornu complu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
gesto Caesares,</hi> In this horn I carry
many <hi>Keysars, viz. Caesars;</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
taking this in indignation, by
the speciall benediction of Heaven, he
was quit with him, and his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
afterwards, by making them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>doggs</hi> about the Countrey so many
miles, which is acccounted in <hi>Germany</hi>
the disgracefullest and most oppropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
kind of punishment that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon a <hi>Nobleman,</hi> or <hi>Gentleman,</hi>
wheras a <hi>Boore</hi> or <hi>Plebean</hi> is condemn'd
according to the quality of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to carry only a <hi>Chair</hi> from one
County to another; such a peculiar
punishment ther was of old in <hi>France,</hi>
for wheras ther was a law call'd <hi>la loy
de la chevelure</hi> that none shold wear
long hair but the <hi>Nobles,</hi> he who had
committed any degenerous offence
was adjudg'd to have his <hi>hair</hi> cutt off
before the tribunal of Iustice, and so
was degraded from being a <hi>gentleman,</hi>
his <hi>honor</hi> going away with his <hi>hair,</hi>
and so made a <hi>Roturier</hi> or <hi>Yeoman:</hi> The
story tells us that the Emperour <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derique
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98449:32"/>
Barbarossa</hi> made <hi>Hermannus</hi>
Count Palatin of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and ten
Counts more to carry <hi>doggs</hi> above
one <hi>German</hi> mile, for the praedations,
and ill balancing of dollars, with other
insolences they had committed while
he was in <hi>Italy</hi> warring with the Pope,
against whom we read he had twelve
pitched battails.</p>
            <p>Such another clash the Emperour
<hi>Conradus</hi> had with <hi>Guelphus</hi> Duke of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> who bore up a good while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, at last the Emperour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruting
his Army with <hi>Italian</hi> Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries,
shut up the Duke in <hi>VVinsberga,</hi>
and beleagred him so close that he
was ready to famish; And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
having bin provok'd so farr
that he had vow'd to put all to fyre and
sword, The Duchesse being a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
couragious Lady went through the
throng of the army into the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
tent, and made such a flexani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
speech which so melted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
that he publish'd a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that for her sake all the Women
of <hi>VVinsberga</hi> shold have safe conduct
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98449:33"/>
to depart and carry away upon their
backs as much of their most precious
wealth that they could bear. Herup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Dutchesse took the <hi>Duke</hi> upon
her back, and evry wife by her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
her husband, mayds and unmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
women took up their brothers, and
kindred, and so all marched out; The
Emperour being much taken with
this witty peece of humanity, publish'd
a generall act of <hi>Amnestia,</hi> and so the
Duke was redintegrated into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.
This memorable story I couch'd
once into <hi>verse,</hi> being a task impos'd
upon me, and the Epigram runns
thus.</p>

            <p>But to return where we left, another

being often reduc'd to som exigents for

to the richest <hi>Imperial towns</hi> for a

<hi>money</hi> back with <hi>immunities;</hi> Many
towns in <hi>Italy</hi> got their necks out of
<hi>Caesars</hi> yoak this way, and som of them
very cheap, as <hi>Florence,</hi> for it cost her
but <hi>six thousand Crownes,</hi> and <hi>Luca ten
thousand; &amp;c.</hi> In so much that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of most of the free Citties of <hi>Italy,</hi>
much more of <hi>high and low Germany,</hi>
sprung out of the necessities of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98449:34"/>
Emperours, wherby their power as
well as their glory did daylie decline;
Adde herunto that the Bishopps of
<hi>Rome</hi> feather'd their nests from time to
time with the <hi>Eagles</hi> plumes, specially
in <hi>Italy,</hi> for besides the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Countreys adjacent, such was
the high reverence the <hi>Church</hi> had in
those daies that many other territories
were given to the <hi>Apostolical</hi> See, and
since, by well devoted Princes, Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the <hi>Pope</hi> is grown herby to

of the <hi>Church</hi> extends above <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara, Bologna, Romania,</hi>
the Marquisat of <hi>Ancona, Sabina, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi>
with a part of <hi>Toscany,</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of Saint Peter,</hi> and <hi>Latium;</hi> in

He doth signorize also over the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of <hi>Spoleto</hi> and the <hi>Exarchat</hi> of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi>
he hath the Towns of <hi>Beneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the
County of <hi>Venisse</hi> in <hi>France</hi> call'd <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
he hath title good enough to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98449:34"/>
               <hi>Naples</hi> also herself, and <hi>Calabria,</hi> but
rather than incurr the diplesure of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> his Champion, and chief
supporter of his Chair, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with an annual heriot of a
white Mule with a pursfull of pistols
about her neck; He pretends also to be
Lord paramount of <hi>Sicily, Urbin, Parma,</hi>
and <hi>Masseran,</hi> as also of <hi>Norway, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> since King <hi>Iohn</hi> did
prostrat our Crown at <hi>Pandulpho</hi> his
Legats feet: His Dominions reach
from one Sea to another, <hi>viz.</hi> from
the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> to the <hi>Adriatique,</hi> and these
Territories run through the center of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which enables the <hi>Pope</hi> to do
good or harm to the Princes about him,
and makes him capable to be an <hi>Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
or a potent <hi>Enemy,</hi> his authority
being mixt twixt <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi>
for he can use the sword, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt
of Excommunication at ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
And (to return to our chief
subject) most of the Countreys point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at before being feathers of the <hi>Eagle</hi>
did much decrease her strength.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98449:35"/>
this way impair the power of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
so the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> and the
difference of Religion in <hi>Germany</hi> did
much enfeeble it; For those Princes
who turn'd <hi>Lutherans</hi> daylie encroach'd
upon, and impropriated the demeans
of the <hi>Church,</hi> which was a great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to the Emperour, being more
devoted to <hi>him;</hi> than to the secnlar
Princes.</p>
            <p>But to go a little more particularly
to work, we will not rove in <hi>Asia</hi> and
<hi>Afrique</hi> where so many mighty parts
of the Continent fell from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, nor will we look so farr back
in Europe as to speak of the defection
of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
which was the first Province that fell
from <hi>Rome,</hi> though indeed <hi>Rome</hi> may
he sayed to have fallen first from <hi>Her,</hi>
being not able by reason of warrs she
had in other Countreys, to protect the
<hi>Britains</hi> against the <hi>Picts,</hi> as <hi>England</hi>
sayes now in point of <hi>Religion</hi> that she
had never fallen away from <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Rome</hi> had fallen from her self; I
say we will not look so fart back, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98449:35"/>
come to more modern Times since the
Empire came within the <hi>German pale;</hi>
The <hi>Suisses</hi> were one of the last that
revolted, who being summon'd to the
Imperiall Chamber at <hi>Spire,</hi> they sent
a rough hewn Ambassadors totell the
Imperial Councel in these words, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
confaederati Heluetii vos vicinos suos
salvere jubent, mirantur verò quod tam cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris
citationibus, &amp;c.</hi> The Lords Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederats
of <hi>Switzerland</hi> do greet you
their Neighbours, but they wonder
that by your so frequent citations you
wold disquiet <hi>Them,</hi> therfore they
pray and <hi>exhort</hi> you, that you would
no further molest <hi>Them.</hi> In <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifts time the <hi>Livonians</hi> fell off, and He
summoning them to their obedience,
and menacing to reduce them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by force, they sent him a geering
Answer, <hi>That they beleev'd his Horse
wold tyre before he could reach the skirts of</hi>
Liefland, as <hi>Thuanus</hi> hath it. A <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Author hath it upon record, that
since the reign of <hi>Rodolph</hi> the first, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two hundred States and Princes
have un-membred, and emancipated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98449:36"/>
themselfs from the <hi>German</hi> Emperour,
who were us'd to obey his summons, &amp;
make their apparance accordingly.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Germany</hi> it self, 'tis tru,
that it is a huge Continent, and full of
Princes, which make som compare
her to a Firmament spangled with
<hi>Stars;</hi> Others compare the <hi>Emperour</hi> to
a great Luminary incircled with the
seven Planets, meaning the <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat,</hi>
or the Colledg of <hi>Electors,</hi> and
not improperly, for this agrees with
the <hi>Caesarean</hi> Arms, which are <hi>Sol, Saturn</hi>
arm'd, and crown'd <hi>Mars,</hi> and the
Eagle displayed with two heads; yet,
though therby the Emperour be call'd
<hi>Rex Regum,</hi> these Princes are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to his greatnes, wherof <hi>Ibraim</hi>
Ambassador to <hi>Solyman</hi> the great <hi>Turk</hi>
gave a hint by an ingenuous Fable
which was thus; When <hi>Maximilian</hi>
the second was chosen Emperour, the
foresayed <hi>Ibraim</hi> was then at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
who having bin a Spectator to
the ceremony, and observ'd what
great Princes attended the Emperour
that day, and being told that som of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98449:36"/>
them could rayse an Army of them
selfs, and maintain it against any
power, The Ambassador smilingly
sayed, That he doubted not of the
puissance of <hi>Germany,</hi> but he observ'd
that the Minds and Actions, the
Counsels and Interests of the <hi>Germans</hi>
were like a beast with many heads,
and tayls, which in case of necessity
being to pass through a hedg, and
ev'ry head seeking to find a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
hole to pass thorough, they
were a hindrance one to another,
ev'ry head drawing after his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and so hazarded the destruction
both of all the heads body &amp; tayls: But
the Empire of <hi>Solyman</hi> his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was like a beast with many tayls,
yet she had but one head, which head
being to get thorough or over any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
without any confusion, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of fancy, all the tayls, and the
whole body follow'd smoothly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the fatallst cause of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of <hi>Caesar</hi> was the monstrou; succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> whose <hi>half Moon</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98449:37"/>
fill'd out of the <hi>Wane</hi> of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
both East and West, It being a sad
saying, that whersoever the <hi>Turks
horse sets once his foot, ther's no Christian
grasse will ever grow there again.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Crown was first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

as well as out of the fidelity
and alleageance he ow'd the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
declin'd it; Then they reflected upon
the Count Palatin of the <hi>Rhin</hi> as a
Prince that might be <hi>par negotio,</hi> and
able to go through-stitch with it, In
regard of his powerful alliances,
The King of great <hi>Britain</hi> being his

his Onckle, the states of <hi>Holland</hi> his

was call'd the old <hi>Ardenian fox</hi>) being
also his Oncles, which <hi>last three,</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him first unto that great Attempt,
though he paus'd a good while upon
it, and resolv'd twice to decline it, till
his <hi>lady</hi> seem'd to reproch his pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity,
telling him, <hi>Had you Sir, the
courage to venture upon a King of great</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<hi>sole Daughter, and will you not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon a Crown when 'tis offer'd you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count Palatin then was look'd
upon as one of the fortunatst Princes in
<hi>Germany,</hi> Having the best <hi>lady in his bed,</hi>
the best <hi>stable of horses,</hi> the best <hi>library of
Books,</hi> the best <hi>cellar of wine</hi> of any of

            <p>
               <hi>Maximilian</hi> the old Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
stuck close to the <hi>Emperour</hi> in this
quartell, for by his assistance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
an army of 25000. was routed by
lesse then <hi>fifteen</hi> thousand, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Prague</hi> with the whole Kingdom
was recover'd for the <hi>Emperour;</hi> On
the otherside by the arms of the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> and the conduct of <hi>Marquis
Spinola</hi> the <hi>Palatinat</hi> was conquer'd,
though the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Vnion</hi> had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98449:39"/>
an Army of forty thousand effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctif
men under, the Marquis of <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back</hi>
and others to defend it, but
'twas sayed that <hi>dolus versabatur in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralibus,</hi>
that the Generals were
corrupted, and that the acquest was
made more by <hi>Spanish pistolls,</hi> than by
<hi>Spinola's Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herupon at a solemn Assembly of
the Electors at <hi>Ratisbon Anno</hi> 1623,
the <hi>Electorship</hi> of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidapifership,</hi>
with all the prerogatives,
and perquisits, the authorities and
enfranchisements, and honors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
therunto was conferr'd upon the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> for term of life; But
in another Assembly 1628, which was
five yeers after at <hi>Prague,</hi> this great
Grant was not only confirm'd unto
him during his own life, but entayl'd
upon his Heirs to Perpetuity, and
withall, the upper <hi>Palatinat</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
unto him, with the <hi>County of
Cham</hi> in consideration of his expences
in the wars, which amounted to <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:98449:39"/>
But in the Treaties at <hi>Munster</hi> and
<hi>Osnabrug Anno</hi> 1652, fower and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeers after, this Grant was quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that in case the <hi>Gulihelmian</hi> line
which is the House of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did fayl
without Masculine issue, the <hi>Electorship
of the Rhin,</hi> with the <hi>Archidapifership</hi>
and all the prerogatives therof shold
revert to the <hi>Rodulphian line</hi> which is
the <hi>Palatin,</hi> being the elder House of
the two.</p>
            <p>Now, concerning the <hi>Gulielmian</hi> or
<hi>Bavarian line</hi> ther are but 4 living,
wherof two are Churchmen, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Archbishop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Frizing,</hi> which can leave no is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
behind; Then is ther the now Duke
of <hi>BAVARIA</hi> and his Brother, nor
are they also likely to get issue, for as
the Tradition in <hi>Germany</hi> goes <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>
the former Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
maried the last Emperours Sister
who was young, and the Duke being
old and crazy having 5 issues then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his body, ther were some Jesuitts
that brought such a prolifical cordial
from <hi>Italy</hi> that enabled the old Duke
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98449:40"/>
to get children, but those Children
shold be impotent and barren, as it
hath hitherto prov'd tru, insomuch
the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> is in fair hopes to get
the Electorship of the <hi>Rhin</hi> again
in a short time, and then the eighth
Electorship must be extinguished.</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>publicae tranquillitatis causa,</hi>
as the <hi>Instrumentum pacis</hi> hath it, for
setling a firm and general everlasting
peace in <hi>Germany</hi> which had bin so
miserably depopulated and torn by
the late wars, which had not only
scratch'd her face, but rent her very
bowels, for about thirty yeers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as also for diremption of all strife
for the future, The Count <hi>Palatin</hi>
was created the <hi>eighth Elector,</hi> which is
term'd in the Instrument by a new
coynd Epithet or logical term <hi>simul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanea
Investitura,</hi> a joint or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Investiture; And because ther's
an office annexed to ev'ry <hi>Electorat,</hi> he
was made <hi>Arch-treasurer</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi>
which he executed at the Election of
the last King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
of the Empresse at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:98449:40"/>
by throwing Medaills some of Gold,
some of Sylver among the peeple; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this notion he hath a session and
suffrage in the Colledg of Electors,
but he must be content to sitt last
of all; Moreover by the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Accommodation at <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
he was to renounce all right <hi>pro tempore</hi>
not only to the upper Palatinat,
and the County of <hi>Cham,</hi> but he was
to part with the <hi>Bergstrad</hi> (one of the
best parts of the lower Palatinat) and
re-deliver it to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Mentz,</hi>
who had oppignorated, and pawn'd
it to his Ancestor <hi>Anno</hi> 1463 for a
sum of money, but <hi>cum pacto perpetuae
reluitionis,</hi> with a proviso that it might
be redeem'd at all times.</p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third,
being not long since dead ther arose a
contest, which continues still unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
'twixt the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> and
his Cosen, and Co-elector the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> about the <hi>Vicarship</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire; And to illustrat this
point the better it must be understood
that by the fundamental laws of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98449:41"/>
               <hi>Empire,</hi> exemplified in the <hi>Aurea Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
it is enacted, that in the absence of
the Emperour (who was us'd oft in
former times to crosse the Alpes to
<hi>Italy</hi>) or after his death during
the vacancy or Interregnum, ther
were two <hi>Vicars</hi> or Imperial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
appointed to manage the
affaires of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to witt the
Count Palatin of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> for the
jurisdictions of <hi>Franconia, Svevia,</hi>
and the Country about the <hi>Rhin,</hi> And
the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> for those large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
that lay within that <hi>Circle;</hi> The
<hi>Bavarian</hi> alledgeth that this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Vicarship appertain'd unto the
Count Palatin of the <hi>Rhin ratione Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi>
by vertu of the Electorship, &amp; the
office of <hi>Archidapifer</hi> or chief Sewer of
the sacred Empire, for which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> both in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Latin, and also translated into
<hi>Dutch;</hi> Hee takes also the great Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Munster</hi> for his <hi>buckler,</hi> wherin
the sayed <hi>Electorship</hi> of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> and
the ofice of <hi>Archsewership</hi> with all the
prerogatives, perquisits, and appendix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98449:41"/>
therunto belonging, wherof the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carship</hi>
is the chiefest, is totally trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
uuto Him and his Issue Male to
perpetuity.</p>
            <p>The Count Palatin utterly denies
that, and positively affirmeth that this
office and prerogative of <hi>Vicariat</hi> was
conferr'd upon him and practis'd by
his progenitors before ever the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of <hi>Electors,</hi> and the subsequent
<hi>Aurea Bulla</hi> was constituted, which
<hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was not the <hi>Donor</hi> but confirmer
only of that great <hi>Ancestrial prerogative</hi>
which <hi>inconcussa consuetudine,</hi> by an
unshaken custom belong'd to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
Avouching further, that it is an
<hi>Annexum inseparabile Comitatus,</hi> That
it is an Heirloome of the <hi>County Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> in which County he
was formally and plenarily reinvested
in the yeer 1652: He excepts likewise
against the translation of the sayed
<hi>Aurea Bulla</hi> into the <hi>Teutonique,</hi> or
High <hi>Dutch,</hi> alleadging it is erroneous
in many passages; And lastly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that his Progenitors enjoyed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98449:42"/>
this prerogative of <hi>Vicariat, ratione Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus,</hi>
not <hi>Electoratus,</hi> as may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
out of the politicall reason why
that office was conferr'd upon his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was in regard of the positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ditions &amp; Territories which

still indecided; In the <hi>interim</hi> the
<hi>protestants</hi> of those parts make their
addresses to the <hi>Count Palatin,</hi> and the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> as
their occasions require, either for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing

some glances upon the present Estate
of <hi>Germany,</hi> together with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Interests</hi> therof.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship hath read before
that the Office of <hi>Emperour, in statu
quo nunc,</hi> is meerly a Title, and like
a feather in one's capp, whosoever
undertakes it must have pillars of his
own to support it; Now among the
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
next after the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> is
thought to be best able to bear the
three Imperial Crowns, and at the
late Emperours death he began to be
much spoken of, but (as an Observing
gentleman, who came lately thence,
told mee) all the peeple that are under
his subjection did rise up, and with
open mouth protested against it, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
out that they wold put themselfs
under the protection of another
Prince, if he wold be the <hi>Keysar;</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:98449:43"/>
Now, the reason is, that if the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
of <hi>Saxe</hi> were Emperour, he must
of necessity enhance their tolls and
taxes to support the Dignity.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> since he hath
bin invested in the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> and
the <hi>County of Cham,</hi> is grown very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
and to be able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
the <hi>Saxe</hi> in power, their yeerly
revenues amounting to above a million
of rich dollars apeece; Besides, the
<hi>Bavarian</hi> Sylver mines have wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
thriven of late yeers both for the
purenes, and quantity of <hi>Bullion;</hi> And
if <hi>Maximilian</hi> the former Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>
could lay out thirteen millions
for the service of the Emperour, in
consideration wherof he had at first a
part of the Territories of <hi>Austria</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothequ'd
unto him, and afterwards
the upper <hi>Palts</hi> and the County of
<hi>Cham</hi> transferr'd unto him, together
with the Electorship of the <hi>Rhin</hi> in full
and valuable satisfaction of the said 13
millions, I say if the former Duke was
so powerfull, it may be well inferr'd
that the present Duke is much more,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98449:44"/>
by the new acquests he hath made,
and so might be capable of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but notwithstanding that the
<hi>French</hi> is sayed to spurr him on,
and that the Elector of <hi>Colen</hi> be his
Oncle, yet 'tis not probable he will
make any competition with his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin-germin
the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> his
peeple like them of <hi>Saxony</hi> being also
very averse therunto, though his pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be in a surer way of subjection and
vassalage unto him, than other <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
are, ther being no great ones in
his Dominions to clash with him.</p>
            <p>Touching the Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
though he be great Master of
the <hi>Teutonique</hi> Order, and hath such
spacious and large Territories that he
can go upon his own demeans above
500 miles from <hi>Cleve</hi> to the furthest
parts of <hi>Prussia,</hi> yet is he thought to be
inferiorto the other two in revenues, &amp;
wealth, therfore the lesse able to bear
the weight of the <hi>German Empire;</hi> Adde
herunto that of the eight Electors,
<hi>five</hi> are still <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, so that
it is improbable, a <hi>Protestant</hi> shold be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98449:44"/>
chosen, for ther are such ceremonies
to be perfotm'd that are incompatible
with a <hi>Protestant,</hi> besides the <hi>Pope</hi> wold
never <hi>confirm</hi> such an Emperour, and
without his confirmation no Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
can be call'd <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
though he be capable of the Empire
being a kind of <hi>German,</hi> yet the nature of
those Kings and peeple hath bin rather
to <hi>preserve</hi> what they have than to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
their Country further; Moreover
the present King is ingag'd in an open
war against the <hi>Swed;</hi> Ther is also a late
clash 'twixt him, and the town of
<hi>Hamborough</hi> about the <hi>Huldygen,</hi> which
is an Inauguration to be her Protector,
as his Father was: for <hi>Hamborough</hi> was
built upon, and stands still upon the
King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> ground; yet she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to <hi>Huld</hi> him, alledging that she
bought him out for great summes of
money, And so pretends to be now
an <hi>Imperial</hi> free Town, and to hold so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the <hi>Keyser;</hi> Wheras others
averre that she is meer <hi>Hansiatique</hi>
within the Verge of <hi>Lubeck</hi> her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98449:45"/>
which is the chiefest of the first
Precinct of the old <hi>Hans,</hi> as was
touch'd before.</p>
            <p>Adde herunto that the last King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> hath some particular obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> his great
Gran-mother having bin <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifts Sister. Besides, when General
<hi>Tilly</hi> was like in the eye of human re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with a Veteran victorious Army
to overcom all <hi>Holsteyn, Ferdinand</hi> this
King of <hi>Hungaries</hi> Gran-father made
a friendly, and favourable peace with
<hi>Christian</hi> the fourth, who had invaded
<hi>Germany</hi> with a considerable Army,
but with little successe, in the behalf
of the Count Palatin of the <hi>Rhin</hi> his
Nephew.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swed</hi> mought have bad fair for
the Imperial <hi>Golden Apple</hi> had he took
firmer footing in <hi>Poland,</hi> and succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his notable designs further;
Nay, his Army being compos'd of
Soldiers of Fortune, might still by new
recreuts as they push'd on their hopes,
have prov'd in time as formidable, and
fatal to the test of Christendome as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98449:45"/>
their Ancestors the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandales</hi>
were of old, who pierc'd the very cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Europe to find warmer habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>Swed</hi> altogether inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to have stood for it in regard of
those Territories which <hi>Gustavus</hi> got,
and annexed to the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi>
within the pale of the Empire, <hi>viz.
Pomerland,</hi> and <hi>Breme;</hi> But the <hi>Dane</hi>
entring into a new warr with him,
and the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
him, and having the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Moscovit</hi> his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
enemies besides, 'tis thought his
hopes are blasted for enlarging his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
at this time, but 'tis well if he
can now secure <hi>Sweden</hi> it self, much
more the new acquests aforesaid in
<hi>Germany;</hi> specially his friends <hi>(viz.
England</hi> and <hi>France)</hi> being so remote
from him, and his enemies so neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he be in despair to have it
himself, he being <hi>Exterus &amp; non Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
a Scranger and no <hi>German,</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98449:46"/>
ther being a fundamental Law that
no Forrener be Emperour, as ther is a
Sanction in the Conclave among the
Cardinals, that no <hi>Tramontane, viz.</hi> one
born this side the <hi>Alps</hi> can be Pope,
I say, though the King of <hi>France</hi> looks
not for it himself, yet he spends all
the interests he hath, and is like to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the power he can with all the
Artificies besides to cajoll, I will not
say, <hi>corrupt</hi> the Electors for the seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the young King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and
that the <hi>Empire</hi> shold not be alwayes
a prostitut to one <hi>Family.</hi> But <hi>France</hi>
they say hath few real Friends in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
among the Princes; 'Tis true
the Elector of <hi>Tryers</hi> being perpetual
Arch-chancelor of <hi>France,</hi> hath always
bin, and is still <hi>Fleurdelizè,</hi> he is Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliz'd
and Frenchified all over, and
<hi>France</hi> alwaies sticks to him also upon
all occasions; 'twas about <hi>him</hi> that ther
was such a counterbuff 'twixt <hi>Lewis</hi>
the thirteenth, and <hi>Gustaphus Adolphus,</hi>
because he had invaded part of his
Territories; 'twas for his sake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the still growing greatnesse of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98449:46"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> that this present warr was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
by sound of Herald against the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> by the last French
King: Moreover, 'tis tru that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> while he lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
to the <hi>Swed</hi> was devoted to <hi>France,</hi>
but since he hath accommodated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with the <hi>Pole,</hi> he hath chang'd his
interest, and is like to enter into
the general league they speak of to be
made between the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
for preserving the common peace
of <hi>Germany</hi> against all that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to disturb it; And besides the
<hi>Electors</hi> themselfs, The Duke of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Anbalt, Luneberg, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburg,</hi>
the <hi>Landgrave of Hesse, Darm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad't,
Baden, Newburgh, Wittemburgh,</hi>
though the last, and some of the other
smell rank of the French interest, yet
to prevent a new warr in <hi>Germany</hi> they
are like to enter into the foresayed
<hi>Patrial</hi> league, together with all the
Imperial and Hansiatical Towns.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> or Prince
Palatin of the <hi>Rhin,</hi> 'tis tru that ther
hath bin a great deal of intimacy, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98449:47"/>
reciprocal leagues twixt his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and <hi>France,</hi> but the last Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and his Son the King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
oblig'd him (and his brother
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>) by many recent civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
At the Treaties of <hi>Osnabrug,</hi> and
<hi>Munster</hi> the Emperour wold have <hi>his</hi>
busines to be dispatch'd first, and
was very indulgent of him all along
the while; The fower hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dollars which were assign'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to make portions and apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
for his younger brothers, the
twenty thousand dollars that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
the Lady <hi>Dowager</hi> his mother
<hi>pro victalitio,</hi> and the ten thousand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which were assign'd for dowries
to evry one of his Sisters, were all
granted as the words of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
run <hi>pro benevolo suae Majestatis Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sareae
affectu ergo domum Palatinam,</hi> for
the benevolent affection his Imperial
Majesty bore to the family of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin,</hi>
which summes the Emperour
punctually payed; Moreover at the
coronation of the Empresse, and the
creation of the last King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98449:47"/>
the <hi>Prince Palatin</hi> officiated in
person, and ther were many Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pass'd twixt the Emperour, and
him; In so much that 'tis thought he
will be no back frend to his son the
now King of <hi>Hungary</hi> when the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Election comes to be canvas'd.</p>
            <p>These Premisses, &amp; particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
being well considered, in the eye
of all humane probality 'tis thought,
that the last Emperours son <hi>Leopoldus
Ignatius,</hi> now King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
&amp;c.</hi> and being one of the Electors
himself, and chiefest of the <hi>Temporals,</hi> is
like to be the man, and make the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinth
Emperour of a direct <hi>Austrian</hi>
line; And they who think thus, ground
their conjectures upon divers reasons
deduc'd from the present posture of
things.</p>
            <p>First, because the Iunta, or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Princes Electors is stil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
and like to be so, till the sayed
King of <hi>Hungary</hi> be come to his Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which by the <hi>German</hi> law in this
point is at eighteen yeers, and this
will be in <hi>Iune</hi> next; then being out
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98449:48"/>
of his bassage, or minority, he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
both to be King of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and to have a suffrage among the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
as he is King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and
Archbuttler of the sacred Empire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because if the King of
<hi>Hungary</hi> have the canvas, and be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ther will be an inevitable warr in
<hi>Germany,</hi> which she will avoyd if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>she</hi> can, having had not only her
face scratch'd, but her very entrails
rent asunder for so many yeers by a
cruentous lingring warr, and the
deep wounds she receav'd thence are
not yet consolidated in som places.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because ther is no Prince
so potent and proper to bear the
weight of this great burden than the
King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> or to keep out and
encounter the Common Enemy, to
witt, the <hi>Turk,</hi> as <hi>Hee,</hi> for he hath not
only most of the Dominions of <hi>Austria,</hi>
but two Kingdomes besides situated
on the confines, and serving as ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
against him by land, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique
of <hi>Venice</hi> doth by sea; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that both the <hi>danger,</hi> as well as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98449:48"/>
               <hi>security</hi> of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
with the Empire it self, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Now we shall
find all these Countreys in the title of
the last Emperour, which runns as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> tertius divinâ favente
clementia electus <hi>Romanorum</hi> Imperator,
semper <hi>Augustus,</hi> Ac <hi>Germaniae, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariae,
Bohemiae, Dalmatiae, Croatiae,
Slavoniae,</hi> &amp;c. Rex, Archidux <hi>Austriae,</hi>
Dux <hi>Burgundiae, Bragantiae, Stiriae,
Carinthiae, Carniolae,</hi> &amp;c. Marchio
<hi>Moraviae,</hi> Dux <hi>Lucemburgiae,</hi> ac supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris
&amp; inferioris <hi>Silesiae, Wittembur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae,
&amp; Teckae,</hi> Princeps <hi>Sveviae,</hi> Comes
<hi>Haspurgi,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gloritiae,</hi> Langravius <hi>Alsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
Marchio sacri Imperii <hi>Romani, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaviae,</hi>
ac superioris, et inferioris <hi>Lusatiae,</hi>
Dominus Marchiae <hi>Slavonicae,</hi> portus Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,
&amp; Salinarum, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this accumulation of eight and
twenty titles ther are but two that he
had from the Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the stile
of <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Ring of Germany,</hi> all
the rest are appendixes of the House
of <hi>Austria;</hi> And the King of <hi>Spaiu</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98449:49"/>
who is of the elder House hath many
more, being great granchild to the
Emperour <hi>Charlesle Quint,</hi> who made
a spontaneous Resignation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his second brother,
though as a privat Author hath it, the
<hi>second day after his resignation, was the first
day of his repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to rayse up the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>
to this altitude, six of the greatest
Families of <hi>Europe</hi> concentred in one,
viz. <hi>Austria, Burgundy, Castile, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
Hungary, and Portugal,</hi> so that
it may be call'd a palace six stories
high, (though as Emperour he hath
not a house to hide his head in)
<q>Austriacûm Domus Armipotens sex ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
columnis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, because the House of
<hi>Austria</hi> hath the good wishes of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Iesuitts,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
do good offices for him, though
the Pope dare not appeer publiquely
in the busines for fear of giving any
distaste to <hi>France;</hi> For he may be
sayed to hold <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:98449:49"/>
also, as one doth a Dog by the ears,
fearing they shold run away from him
to Patriarks of their own making;
Nor hath any King in Christendom a
greater temptation to fall away from
<hi>Rome,</hi> in regard the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
by a late computation which was
made, hath above three hundred and
forty millions of liures in annual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
which, shold he renounce the
Pope, wold devolve most of it to the
Crown.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this Gentleman told
me that the Electors, with the
Princes and Cities of Empire, are
more and more sensible to find
the King of <hi>France</hi> shold appeer so
much, and as som write, intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into this busines, by sending Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
with such gawdy trains,
whose rich liureys are like to be worn
out before the Election day, so that
they had needed to have brought a
Lantern and Candle with them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
so long <hi>before day,</hi> as one made
a Pasquill of them in <hi>Frankfort,</hi> who
with som difficulty did open her Gates
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98449:50"/>
unto them, it being an ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Empire, that none
shold be admitted to lodge in the
Town where the Election is to be
held, but the Princes Electors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs
and their train, which come to
nere upon two thousand horse; But
the <hi>Germans</hi> are more sensible and
startled, that the <hi>French</hi> shold draw
such forces to their Frontires as to
<hi>Metz, Philipsburg,</hi> and <hi>Brisack</hi> (for <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack</hi>-bridg
makes now <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
one continued piece,) as if ther
wer a design hereby to controul the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
in their choice, and embroyl
<hi>Germany</hi> again in a warr; which puts
the young King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
expences, of making new levies,
Insomuch that he will have by the
next Spring, as they write, an Army
of 50 thousand effectif men, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed it may be wondred ther
shold be any ambition at all, of aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the <hi>Roman German</hi> Empire <hi>in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu
quo nunc,</hi> it being but an ayrie bare
shadowy title, or a Skeleton of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98449:50"/>
part of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy,
Therfore a late <hi>German</hi> Author confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>Quod nobis est magnum momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
politicum, Exteris est magnum deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculum,</hi>
That which we make to be
of so high political a consequence,
seems to Forreners to be but a thing of
laughter, alluding to that adoe ther
is us'd about the election of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
as in <hi>Venice</hi> to creat a <hi>Doge</hi> who
in point of power is no other than <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
di legno</hi> a head of wood.</p>
            <p>Nor are those who live under the
Empire tyed to so strict an obedience,
ther is not that exact relation, and
reciprocation of subjection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
'twixt the Emperour and his
Vassals, as useth to be 'twixt Prince
and Peeple in other places, where the
<hi>Liegeman</hi> is bound to submit, and the
<hi>Liegelord</hi> is bound to defend; Touching
the later, he spoke like a Statist, that
sayed, <hi>Defendere subditos est attributum
naturale inhaerens visceribus Regiminis,
est qualitas infixa ossibus, et indivisibilis,
ita utregimen, &amp; protectio unum &amp; idem
judicatur indivisible.</hi> Defence of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98449:51"/>
Subject is a natural attribut inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the very bowels of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis a quality infix'd in the very
bones therof, Insomuch that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Goverment is adjudg'd to
be the self same indivisible thing: 'Tis
not so in the <hi>Imperial</hi> Government,
wher ther is a looser kind of Clientele,
and Protection; Nor is the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Liegeman</hi> so absolut,
for an Imperial Ban is not so much
obey'd there as an <hi>Edict</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
a <hi>Prematica</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a <hi>Proclamation</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> or a <hi>Placart</hi> in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
wher ther is a more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
obligation 'twixt Prince and
Peeple, the one to obey, the other to
defend their persons, and maintain
their privileges; Though som do hold,
that a Country giving her self to a
Prince, what privileges soever the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reserve to themselfs by contract,
they are all lost when they enter into
subjection, which by its nature makes
a man subordinat to another without
any exception, whensoever the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good is concern'd, and that those
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98449:51"/>
privileges by the sayed subjection pass
into the nature of concessions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
afterwards, which they may stretch,
restrain, or revoke according to the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of their publique occasions; And
when ther is a necessity to do so, the
Peeple are not allow'd to revolt, or
right themselfs by violence; 'Tis tru,
that in all privat particular Treaties
the unobservation of the Conditions,
acquitts the parties from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the contract, but this doth not
reach to Soverain Princes, when the
Peeple have once chosen them for their
advantage, and security. But to return
to our chief matter, the Princes, and
Towns of the Empire, though they
acknowledg the <hi>Keyser</hi> for their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
yet are they not oblig'd in that
strictnes of obedience to him, as their
own peeple are to them; These Princes
may be sayed to be rather his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues,
and <hi>Associats</hi> in governing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>Snbjects;</hi> It being a Rule in
<hi>Germany,</hi> that <hi>Quilibet Imperii status
in suo Territorio tantum possit, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Imperator in toto Imperio,</hi> Ev'ry
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98449:52"/>
state of the Empire within his own
Territory, may do as much as the
Emperour in the whole Empire; They
have power of life and death, they
may coyn money, send Ambassadors
abroad, and make confederacies, and
leagues with forren Princes, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Territorial</hi> prerogatives; But
that power of making leagues was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
in the late Treaty at <hi>Osnabrug,</hi>
for the <hi>Instrument</hi> sayes, <hi>Ius faciendi
faedera liberum esto, Ita tamen ne ejusmodi
faedera sint contra Imperatorem, &amp;
Imperium, pacemque ejusdem publicam,</hi>
Let it be free to make confaederacies,
provided that the sayed confaederacies
be not against the Emperour, and the
Empire, with the publique peace ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
Nay further, the Princes of the
Empire have such a latitude of power
that they write <hi>se regnare Dei gratiâ,</hi>
that they Raign by the Grace of
God; And that within the verge of
the Empire the Princes Electors are
not to give precedence to any other
forren Prince, or potentat whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
Therefore when <hi>Charles</hi> King of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98449:52"/>
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> was a few yeers since at
<hi>Frankfort,</hi> the Count Palatin of the
<hi>Rhin</hi> sent him word that he desir'd to
give his Majesty a visit, but by the
constitution of the Empire he was not
to give priority of place there to any, it
being an <hi>Imperial</hi> Town, but if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
wold please to come to any of his
own Territories he wold then respect
his Majesty in that point accordingly.</p>
            <p>The states of the Empire have also
a territorial authority, to change their
Religion at plesure, by a late Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
where 'tis sayed, <hi>Religionis muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
est sequela Territorialis Iurisdictonis, ac
inhaeret Territorio sicut nebula paludi;</hi>
The alteration of Religion is a sequele
of Territorial Iurisdiction, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent
in the Territory as a clowd in
a pond. By what hath bin spoken it
appears what a small extent of power
the sacred <hi>Caesarean</hi> Majesty hath over
those that professe obedience to him;
Nay, when ther is a King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
'tis a question who hath the
greater power the Emperour or Hee;
For the Emperour and the King of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98449:53"/>
               <hi>Romans</hi> may be sayed to be like two
Sunnes in one Firmament, the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
the other rising, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath more eyes upon it than the
former.</p>
            <p>By those particulars that have bin
pointed at in this Section, a conjecture
may be made, if not a judgment, who
stands fairest to be the next Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
But they who harbour some
doubts of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> have
one shrewd argument that he may go
without it, which is his late encrease
and amplitude of power, for he hath
not only the large Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi>
with the great Territories annex'd
therunto now as hereditary by way of
conquest, but ther is an ovverture, if
not an offer and privat Treaty a foot
that the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl'd
upon him, and his successors
for the future; Though this augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of power be good for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Common-Wealth in general,
because it enableth the Emperour
to bear up the better againgst the
Common Enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> yet not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98449:53"/>
only the Electors, but some other
Princes of the Empire conceave
some jealousie of this enlargement
of the Imperial power, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some apprehensions of fear,
that if the Eagle shold ranew his
bill, and have his <hi>feathers come
home</hi> to make his wings <hi>full
summ'd</hi> again, hee might seaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and make a prey of sundry
Towns, and Territories which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the sayed Princes hold from
the Empire but by crazy weak ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;
Nay it putts a flea in the
<hi>Venetians</hi> ear also, who have bin
alwayes jealous of the <hi>Austrian</hi>
greatnes, in regard of contiguity of
Territories they both have in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,
Croatia,</hi> and other places.
But it may be well expected that
the <hi>Princes Electors</hi> will rather look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>generall</hi> good and incolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Christian Common-Wealth,
as their Oath doth bind
them, which is as astringent,
and conjuring kind of Oath as
possibly the witt of man can
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98449:54"/>
draw, or devise, for they are not
to be transported by any <hi>Pact,
