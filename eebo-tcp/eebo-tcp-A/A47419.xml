            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With that there was ſuch a lamentable
groan heard, enough to turn ice into aſhes,
which cauſed the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the reſt of the
Bench, to demand what the matter was;
it was replied, that the grave old Gentleman
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> did ſound at the naming of the
Jury; then it was Commanded that they
ſhould give him air, and comfort him up,
ſo that hee might plead for himſelf: and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38302:5"/>
here I cannot paſſe by in ſilence the love that
was expreſſed by the Country people, ſome
ſhreeking and crying for the old man; others
ſtriving to hold him up, others hugging him,
till they had almoſt broke the back of him,
others running for Cordials and ſtrong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
inſomuch that at laſt they had call'd
back his wandring ſpirits, which were ready
to take their laſt farewell.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the <hi>Judge,</hi> old man, what's the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christm.</speaker>
               <p>Ah good my Lord! I have

            <sp>

               <p>But mee thought I heard ſome

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chriſtm.</speaker>
               <p>I heartily thank your Honour,
and this favour which your Lordſhip hath
granted me, hath encouraged me to crave
another, and that is, That you be pleaſed
to grant mee the benefit of a Councel, in
regard of mine Age, and defect of memory
and expreſſion. Beſides, the Jury are all
ſtrangers to mee, as well as enemies: and
therefore I deſire my Councel may be one
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38302:5"/>
of this County, that ſo he may deſcribe the
Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
               <p>Well <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> in regard that
thou wert a merry old man when I was but a

            </sp>
            <p>Then the old man whiſpered to a Friend,
to deliver a Fee to Councellor <hi>Crab,</hi> and
deſire him to decypher the Jury, and as
occaſion did offer it ſelf, to Plead his
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Fee being delivered, and accepted,
the Councellor after this manner ſpake to

               <speaker>Councel.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, may it pleaſe your
Honour, this Jury which is now impanneld,
and to paſs their Verdict upon old <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
is illegally choſen, there is not one of
them a Free-man, and all mortal enemies to
this old Gentleman.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all here is Mr. <hi>Starve-mouſe,</hi>
I wonder how hee dare ſhew his face in
Court, the very Cats cannot abide him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here is Mr. <hi>All-pride,</hi> I muſt

               <l>

               <l>And when at any time a feaſt he'l keep,</l>
               <l>He in Bravado will kill half a ſheep.</l>
               <p>Here's another my Lord cald <hi>Eat-alone,</hi> a
Malefactor my Lord, and ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> where it is to be
found, that one of the Lord chief Juſtices
own Clerks being accuſed, was forc'd to
free himſelf, and get it recorded, that he eat
not his morſel alone.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort my Lord,</p>
               <l>To eat his breakfaſt he a corner ſought,</l>
               <l>And in his pocket hath his dinner brought.</l>
               <p>There's another of them cald <hi>Give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little,</hi>
hee may well be called give nothing,
yet the Fool will ſometimes bragge of his
Charity; if he kills but an Egge, and give the
offall to the needy: he is, my Lord, a great
benefactor to the poor, but will beſtow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon the Beggers; and as for Maſter
<hi>Cold-kitchin,</hi> here is his man <hi>Sam Servant,</hi>
is ready to give Oath, that hee hath almoſt
ſterved him to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:38302:6"/>
And for Mr. <hi>Hoord-corn,</hi> the people in
general all curſe him, it is he that makes the
Epha ſmall, and the ſhekel great; good my
Lord, let Juſtice be done upon him, unleſſe
he will ſave <hi>Gregory</hi> the labour, and follow
the ſteps of his father, who the laſt cheap
year hanged himſelf.</p>
               <p>There's another of them cald Mr. <hi>Grutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat,</hi>
he may be termed grutch cloaths too,
for his cloathes were never young in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
they may be ſet down in the Almanack
with the dear year, and the great froſt: he is
one that never gave Almes in his life, the
houſe of his owne body he will not keep Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantable,
but it had been irrecoverably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed;
had it not been for the reparations of
other mens Tables, where hee hoords up
meat enough for a month; in a word, my
Lord, he is a baſe fellow, and ſo I leave him.</p>
               <p>There's another of them cald Mr. <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi>
he dwells at the ſigne of the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock;
he hath a glove for every hand, he holds
it moſt ſafe to do as moſt do, right or wrong,
he'l be on the harder ſide.</p>
               <l>And when a hunting goes, I have been told,</l>
               <l>He with the Hare will run, and Hound will bold.</l>
               <p>So my Lord not ſit for a Juror, becauſe he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38302:7"/>
makes conſcience of nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
               <p>Were there ever ſuch a brood of

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sheriff.</speaker>
               <p>Surely my Lord it was Sir <hi>Hica
Buſy</hi> that gave me the Liſt, and told mee,
it was the Countries deſire that theſe men
ſhould bee the Jury; and I was induced to
beleeve it, in regard I know him to bee a
popular man.</p>
               <p>With this the Jury began to murmure, and
told the Judge that the Councellor had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed

appeal, or ſtand to juſtification.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>My Lord, here are ſome witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to prove the truth of what I have ſpoken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>My Lord, I am convinced, that all
that hath been ſpoken by the Worſhipfull
Councellor is true, but eſpecially I can ſpeak
ſomething more againſt Mr. <hi>All-pride</hi> than
hath been yet declared: for may it pleaſe
your Honour, hee hath indeavoured to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38302:7"/>
mee, and my Neighbour <hi>Patience:</hi> all
his practice is in brave cloaths, bigge looks,
ſwearing and ſwaggering, and inſulting over
his poore Neighbours, there was one Mr.
<hi>Good-work</hi> lived in the houſe before this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
threw him out of the doores; he ſpent
more in Muſtard every year, than this gaudy
Gentleman doth in Beef, hee keeps two
wicked men to his Servants; the one is call'd
<hi>Stony-heart,</hi> the other <hi>Bribe,</hi> and theſe help
to keep him up in his wicked courſes.</p>
               <p>My Lord, here are many more witneſſes if

               <p>No, no, this is no <hi>Joſhad's</hi> day; Mr.

               <p>My Lord, much hath been already
ſpoken, and much more I can ſay, this Old
man hath been one chief inſtrument that I &amp;
my Children have been abuſed. I have three
Daughters, My Lord, the firſt is called <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
the ſecond <hi>Temperance,</hi> and the third
<hi>Chaſtity,</hi> &amp; one ſo named <hi>Sobriety,</hi> all theſe
by this <hi>Chriſtmaſſes</hi> means, are injuriouſly
dealt withall, and violently handled: which
before his coming, were in good eſtimation
in Gentlemens houſes; my daughter <hi>Patience</hi>
is an admirable good ſervant, ſhe uſes to
look to the Children, and ſervants, &amp; would
keep them in love, peace, and quiet, if at any
time ſhe were reviled, ſhe would not revile
again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſephs</hi> words were often in her mouth,
<hi>ſee that yee fall not out by the way:</hi> ſhe is an
excellent Labourer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the winter time
of adverſity, no Chriſtian able to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her, yet this naughty fellow, hath much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38302:11"/>
wronged this my Daughter, and cauſed her
to be thrown out of doors: for whereſoever
he is entertain'd he carries a very baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
called <hi>Gameſter</hi> with him, and he hath
two companions, the one called <hi>Spendall,</hi>
and the other <hi>Careleſs;</hi> theſe will ride abroad
night times, vizarded to glean money, to
maintain their play, and make men ſtand,
that would fain be going, and leave the
ſtranger with a heavy heart, and light purſe:
This <hi>Gameſter</hi> hath alſo one chief man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Anger,</hi> and alſo two Pages, the one
called <hi>Swearing,</hi> the other <hi>Curſing,</hi> and
when there is any difference about their
Maſters play, theſe two preſently call in
two others as good as themſelves, one
named <hi>Quarrelling,</hi> the other named
<hi>Fighting;</hi> and theſe murder my daughter
<hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my ſecond Daughter <hi>Temperance,</hi>
ſhe is a very abſtemious maid, and uſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to wait upon the Table, before this
wicked wretch comes, &amp; then ſhe is baniſht,
or choaked, at the beſt thrown out of the
doors: and then perhaps, muſt lye without in
the ſtreet, no entertainment can get, if he be
in the Town, unleſs it be at ſome honeſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſmans
houſe, it may be at the Miniſters, if
he be one of the laſt edition.</p>
               <p>My third Daughter <hi>Chaſtity</hi> is as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as the Sun, and ſhe is a Chamber-maid,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38302:12"/>
and this fellow is the cauſe that ſhe is abuſed
alſo, for <hi>Gluttony</hi> hath two Aſſociates,
<hi>Chambering &amp; Wantonneſſe,</hi> and theſe kick
my poor Daughter diverſe times down the
ſtaires; Thus my Lord, my Children whom I
have ſo educated, as they are fit Companions
for Princes, are by this vile Varlet abuſed:
my Lord in few words, he is the cauſe that
many men make their Tables and Alter to
their belly, and a ſnare to their ſouls.</p>

               <p>And firſt my Lord, I am wronged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indited by a wrong name. I am corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> my name is <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi>
or time.</p>
               <p>And though I generally come at a ſet time,
yet I am with him every day that knows
how to uſe me.</p>
               <p>My Lord, let the Records be ſearcht, and
you ſhall find, that the Angels rejoyc'd at
my coming, and ſung <hi>gloria in excelſis:</hi>
The Patriarcks, and Prophets; longed to
ſee me.</p>
               <p>The fathers have ſweetly imbraced me,
our modern Divines all comfortably cheriſht
mee, O let me not be deſpiſed now I am old.
Is there not an injunction in <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
that commands men to inquire for the old
way, which is the good way: many good
deeds do I do, O why do the people hate me?
we are commanded to be given to Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and this hath been my practiſe from
my youth upward: I come to put men in
mind of their redemption: to have them love
one the other, to impart with ſomething here
below, that they may receive more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38302:13"/>
things above: the wiſeman ſaith, there
is a time for all things, and why not for
thankfulneſſe? I have been the cauſe, that
at my coming Miniſters have inſtructed the
people every day in the Publick: telling
the people how they ſhould uſe me, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delights, not to effeminate or corrupt
the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bid them abhor thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
from which they ſhould not uſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and that they ſhould by no means
turn paſs-time into Trade: And if that at
any time they have ſtept an inch into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
to puniſh themſelves for it, and be ever
after the more carefull to keep within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
               <p>And did alſo adviſe them, to manage their
ſports without Paſſion: They would alſo tell
the people, that their feaſts ſhould not be
much more than nature requires, and grace
mederates: not pinching, nor pampering:
And whereas they ſay that I am the cauſe
they ſit down to meat, and riſe up again
graceleſſe, they abundantly wrong me: I
have told them, that before any one ſhould
put his hand in the diſh, he ſhould look up
to the owner; and hate to put one morſell in
his mouth unbleſſed: I tell them they ought
to give thanks for that which is paid for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
knowing that neither the meat, nor
the mouth, nor the man, are of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
I bid them fill their bellies, not their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38302:13"/>
eyes, and riſe from the board, not glutted
but only ſatisfied: and charge them to have
a care, that their guts be no hinderances to
their brains, or hands: and that they ſhould
not looſe themſelves in their feaſts; but
bid hem be ſoberly merry, and wiſely
free. I alſo adviſe them to get friendly
thrift to be their Caterer, and Temperance
to Carve at the board, and be very watchfull
that Obſcenity, detraction, and ſcurrility, be
baniſht the Table: But let their diſcourſe
be as ſavoury as the meat: and ſo feed as
though they did eat to live, not live to eat:
and at laſt, riſe as full of thankfulneſſe, as
of food: This hath, this is, and this ſhall
be my continuall practiſe: now concerning
the particulars that theſe folks charge me
with, I cannot anſwer them, becauſe I do
not remember them; my memory is but
weak, as old mens uſe to be: but me
thinks they ſeem to be the ſeed of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
they ſend forth of their mouths, whole
floods of impious inventions againſt me,
and lay to my charge things that I am not
guilty of: which hath cauſed ſome of
my friends to forſake me, and look upon
me as a ſtranger: My Brother <hi>Good-works</hi>
broke his heart, when he hear don't: my
ſiſter <hi>Charity</hi> was taken with the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Palſy,
ſo that ſhe cannot ſtretch forth an
hand: O tell it not in the City, nor publiſh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38302:14"/>

Orator, therefore I humbly deſire your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

               <p>Me thinks my Lord, the very Clouds
bluſh, to ſee this old Gentleman thus egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
abuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if at any time any have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves by immoderate eating, and
drinking or otherwiſe ſpoil the creatures, it
is none of this old mans fault; neither ought
he to ſuffer for it; for example the Sun and
the Moon are by the heathe is worſhip'<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are
they therefore bad becauſe idolized? ſo if any
abuſe this old man, they are bad for abuſing
him, not he bad, for being abuſed: Theſe
Baſtards of <hi>Amon,</hi> have abuſed him, and
therefore now would baniſh him: far beit
from my Lord, to caſheir a good thing, with
the baſe uſe annexed thereunto: They term
his charity waſting and ſpoiling, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Idlers, and encreaſing of Beggers:
But where too much charity hath ſlain her
thouſands, too little hath ſlain her ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
ſome of theſe witneſſes did hint at
Religion, but I believe they are maidens for
that, the firſt that wooes them may win them
they tax him of Rebellion, and ſedition, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38302:14"/>
how can love and peace be the Author of
that: for that is his Motto:</p>
               <p>As for Mris. <hi>Prudence,</hi> becauſe your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is pleaſed to give more credence to her
teſtimony, than to any of the reſt; I ſhall
anſwer her in particulars: and firſt for her
children, I muſt confeſſe as ſhe ſaid, they are
fit Companions for Princes, but ſhe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Old Father <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to ſay that he
ever wronged any of them: no, he ever had
a good eſteem of them, it was one <hi>Anger,</hi> a
fiery fellow, with <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Rage</hi> his Sons;
that threw her daughter <hi>Patience</hi> out of
doors, and not he and for her daughter
<hi>Temperance</hi> it was <hi>Gluttony,</hi> and unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
appetite, that abuſed her and not this old
man.</p>
               <p>And for her daughter <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> it was a
ſcurvy ſcabby fellow, called <hi>Carnal Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence:</hi>
that forced her, therefore I beſeech
your honour; give not any ear to theſe falſe
reports: then ſaid the Judge, Mr. <hi>Sheriffe</hi>
give order for the apprehending of theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and preſently after apprehending of
them, execute them.</p>
               <l>Then aragg them to the ditch, where let them lye,</l>
               <l>So long as one man hath a memory.</l>

to his old father at the barr: but for
mine own part, I will ſpeak upon my oath;
that I had ſuffered more than an <hi>Egyptian</hi>
bondage had it not been for him.</p>
               <p>I had had a Sabbathleſſe purſuit of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Labour, had it not been for him: the
very beaſts that groan under the burden are
beholden to him for eaſe, for when the Oxe
and the Aſſes neck, ſeem'd married to the
yoak, he divorc't them, the very <hi>Jews</hi> had
their Jubilees, times of reſt, therefore good
my Lord, if you give us nothing, keep not
our brick and ſtraw from us.</p>
