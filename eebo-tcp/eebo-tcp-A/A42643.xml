            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PARLIAMENT. The most humble Remonstrance of Sr. <hi>Balthazar Gerbier</hi> Kt.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas your humble Remonstrant after his long and incessant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the leasure of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (once appointed by the Councel of State) to receive such of his tenders as doe concern this Common-wealths service; and that he cannot be perswaded that some of his said tenders may any longer remain with him unreflectedon: He doth therfore enbolden himself (in all due reverenee) to present in this humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, a Summary abstract of the severall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which by the foresaid Committees order he was enjoyned to prepare for their serious inspection, and by them to be reported unto the Councel of State; that so they might seasonably be offered unto the Parliament. And whereas, the Councel of States last Order, dated the 19 of <hi>October</hi> 1650. appointed that the former Committee, should consider of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants proposals; and make a speciall report
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63413:2"/>
unto them of the state of the <hi>Flanders</hi> Debt: Your humble Remonstrant, doth therefore conceive that particular to be the most properest for him to begin withall: And therefore humbly saith thus much thereon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, That as the Inhabitants of certain Cautionary<note place="margin">The state of the Flanders Debt consisting of seven milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pounds.</note> Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> (as well as the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Heirs of such as were in those times) the States of those parts, are obliged to make payment unto the the English Nation of such moneys (together with its Use) as were lent unto them by Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> So in like manner, that the said Debt must of necessity be claimed, at every change of Government as long as it is unpaid; for that orherwaies the said Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Towns, and the Debtors heirs will plead a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and consequently a Non-vallity.</p>
            <p>Therefore Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the late King observed the same necessary course; and caused their Agents to lay a publick claim to the Debt. And whereas the said Debtors apprehending the said Debt exorbitant increase by reason of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so long unpaid (when as they had cleared such like debts which at the same time they had made with other Princes) they having been legally sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by late Mr. <hi>Trumball,</hi> the English Agent in those parts; And finally by your humble Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant, during his being Resident at <hi>Bruxels:</hi> Those which aimed at the best husbanding of that Debt, did make a proposition by secret friends of theirs, to come to a composition with the late King thereon; and they were some of those who treated in secret with your humble Remonstrant, about the putting off those Provinces into the protection of the English
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63413:2"/>
Nation: And as it seems, the said propounders had some particular Interest therein; for that they prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto your humble Remonstrant, no lesse then a gratuity of 30000 pounds in case he could move<note place="margin">Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds gratuity offered for a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Flanders debt.</note> the late King to have condescended unto a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able composition, on the totall; for that by reason of the many years, wherein the said moneys were lent unto them, the non payment thereof (and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the double Use) hath raised it to such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Summe, that those Cautionary Towns, nor the said States Heirs might perchance not be able to make it good; although the said Towns, and the said States Heirs stand obliged to all perpetuity, to make payment thereof: When as they neither can, nor will be born out of the non payment of the same by their King, nor by any of his Governours in those parts; for that they did formerly passe the said Debt in their accounts, to their said King, who allowed thereof; and whereby the said Cautionary Towns, and the Heirs of those States made it their own. In which regard, it happened that the late Arch-Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse<note place="margin">The late Arch Duchesses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Debt.</note> 
               <hi>Isabel,</hi> (taking notice of the justice of the late kings claime) declared unto the said Debtors, That they were bound to give a present satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the English Nation; for that she neither could nor would excuse them in the contrary.</p>
            <p>Now the exorbitant Summe whereunto the said Debt doth at present amount (by reason as aforesaid of the long forbearance, and of the Use upon Use) is Seven Millions of pound; as it doth appear by an exact Arethmetical calculation thereon.</p>
            <p>And whereas the renewing of the said claim is but a matter of for mality, of no considerable charges,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63413:3"/>
nor disadvantagious consequences to this State; For that when as the said claim shall have been renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the same may as then, at its own leasure presse the Debtors to make payment thereof, or defer the same as long as they shall think fitting.</p>
            <p>Your humble Remonstrant hath therefore so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly attended to give this due account thereon; to the end, that the Parliament being truly informed thereof, might as then doe therein, as unto their great wisdome it should seem best.</p>
            <p>So likewise did your humble Remonstrant insert his humble proffer on this particular, in the account which he was to give them, <hi>viz.</hi> That if so be the Parliament (who in all its proceedings hath manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a matchlesse care, in the heeding of all the rights which are due to the English Nation) would be pleased to permit, that their Act (not inferiour to the decrees of the <hi>Parthes</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi>) allowing a certain proportion to such as shall disclose and recover any concealed Debt, may stand in force, and extend it self as well to your humble Remonstrant as to others;<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants request on the Flanders Debt.</note> who by their fidelity and zeal, have rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves capable of the Parliaments Justice and Favour; He might as then, to wit (after the claime of the said Debt shall have been renewed) undertake (at his own cost and perill) to procure a due satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this State for the said Debt.</p>
            <p>But in case the Parliament should not conceive the said Debt to come within the Verge of concealed Debts (although your humble Remonstrant disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same; and that by his care and dilligence the Original Bonds were brought unto the Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Councel of State: Your humble Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63413:3"/>
doth thereon submit himself to the sence of his<note place="margin">The original Bonds secured by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants means.</note> betters; and cannot choose but again represent (as he formerly did) his readinesse to manifest unto any person in whom this State can best confide, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants offer concerning the Flanders Debt.</note> particulars for the said Debts recovery. And if such a one shall be thought fit to accompany your humble Remonstrant unto <hi>Machlen</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> he may be both an Eye and Ear witnesse of your humble Remonstrants proceeding, in the renewing of the said Debts claim in the high Court of Justice there and be brought acquainted with those secret Persons, who once before proffered the thirty thousand, pounds gratuity for a Composition; to the end that by their means (in case they are as wise and wary now as they were then) the said Debtors might be wrought into a fair composition for the capital with this Common-wealth; since as above said, the State is in possession of the Original Bonds.</p>
            <p>And in this manner, all such advantages as the Debtors might make use of, to prevent this Nation in its right to the said Debt, will be renewed; as also their pleading that this Common-wealths silence therein hath rendred the same invalid; so likewise will it preserve this Common-wealths Title, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure against any one whosoever, that shall be found to be in possession of the said Town.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas your humble Remonstrant did<note place="margin">A French se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret design agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Councel against the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish by the means of the Port of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</note> during his late being in <hi>France,</hi> observe how that there was a secret design much insisted upon, in the Cabinet Councel concerning the Town and Port of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> in case their affairs, (which have been much imbroiled ever since) should permit a breach with this Common-wealth, to wit; how that Harbour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63413:4"/>
might be made use of, especially the Channel, which in Dutch, is called the <hi>Scheurken,</hi> to contain Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of Men of War, as well as of fire and massonned mine Ships, thence for to set upon the English Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sea; or, on the Coasts, as well as into Ports and Havens of this Land: Nay, to make up as high as <hi>London</hi> bridge (as <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane once did) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Block-houses, and several men of War which guarded the River: But also to make use of the Massoned Mynes in Ships, for to blow up that part of the Town, which is adjacent to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; in the same manner, as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> did at the siege of <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereon your humble Remonstrant had in those<note place="margin">A former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to destroy the Port of Dunkirk.</note> Papers (which were by him prepared for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees inspection) mentioned an expedient which he was to have put in practice, during the last breach between <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> whereby that Port of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> (as also the Channel, called the <hi>Scheurken</hi>) might have been rendred incapable to receive any Vessels, especially, such as might have proved destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their Christian neighbours;</p>
            <p>The which he thinks fit now again to reiterate, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants proffers concerning the Port of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ktrk.</note> with his zealous proffers to endeavour the same at all time; when as this Common-wealths ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice shall require it: The aforesaid expedients ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in former times been approved of by the then Cabinet Councel, unto which the Lord <hi>Belface</hi> was called: And they had at the same time been put in execution by your humble Remonstrants direction, had not the Wars between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> been terminated whilest they were a preparing. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Massoned Myne Ships were by your humble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63413:4"/>
Remonstrant prepared, and would have taken the expected effects on the Dyke of <hi>Rochel,</hi> had they been conducted thither by men who minded actions more then discourse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as your humble Remonstrant hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">The French &amp; Hollanders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of the English Cloath trade.</note> both in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Holland;</hi> That the French by their erecting of a Cloath Manufacture at <hi>Zedan,</hi> and the practising of the same in many parts of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> especially have begotten such an esteem of their Cloathes among many Nations, as that in the very City of <hi>Paris,</hi> there are yearly vented more then eight thousand packs of cloathes: When by the transportation of Fullers-earth (contrary to the Parliaments prohibiting the same) the English cloath-trade is likely to be much impaired:<note place="margin">A Spanish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Cloath trade may be made more worth to the English then the gold Mines are to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Your humble Remonstrant hereon called to minde a secret overture, which had been made by one <hi>Don Hennin</hi> (a Flemming by birth) one of the Secretaries for the forreigne Languages in <hi>Spain,</hi> during the late Kings being at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and whereby the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade might be made more worth to the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the Golden, Mynes ever were or can be to the Spanyards: Besides, that by the said expedient, the Spanish Interest would be so considerably, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disolvably fixt to that of the English Nation, as that the said Spanyards should never engage, or side with any other, on what consideration soever.</p>
            <p>Now this being so great a concernment (and that the profit thereof would prove matchlesse) when as<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants proffer on the Cloath trade.</note> it would prevent all other Nations in any of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes against the English Cloth Staple: Your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remonstrant, by the aforesaid Committees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, did pen the state of that case, and proffers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63413:5"/>
to render acceptable service on that particular to the English Nation.</p>
            <p>And proffered also to leave with this State certain<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strants proffers touching secret concernments.</note> secrets which had been by your humble Remonstrant concealed, in the same manner, as they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, by the above mentioned, <hi>Don Hennin</hi> unto the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the which secrets, this Common-wealth might (at its own opportunity) extend the power, and encrease the wealth of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Nation beyond that of any People; and even make good a prediction which is currant in remote parts (among such men, who alas! have not yet the knowledge of the true living God) Of the comming amongst them of a People with white complexions, and flaxen hair, who shall possesse their country; at which time, its also related, that the very Leaves of the Trees shall be as pure Gold. All which in case the said <hi>Don Hennin,</hi> might happily have conceived to be likely to have been made good by the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Its no wonder that he pitcht upon the said Duke, to make the said discovery unto him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, sure it was, that the said <hi>Don Hennin</hi> was poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a black Spanyard, for his having communed with the said Duke thereon; and for his having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested unto him such particulars, whereby any Gentleman as shall set forth with an easie equipage, shall not need to look after one Kingdome, nor any experimented Merchant with the buying of Negros, nor Myne-masters with the heeding or preserving the lives of such as work therein, but to aim at that which <hi>Kelly</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, kept so close in his breast, as that the Qucen could not get ought out of him thereon, save an imperfect relation: Nor

               <hi>Don Hennins</hi> discoveries are in the first place so far beyond the known plat-form of descriptions and discoveries gathered out of Books, and taken upon common fame; as also of that which the famous Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and unfortunate Captain <hi>Cavendish</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as (though both of them have been very much traduced for that they were not upon <hi>Chim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> as the factious, which thirsted at that worthy persons life,) well knew; and who have ever since fortified severall of their landing Ports, in their gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den world.</p>
            <p>The said secrets so discovered by <hi>Don Hennin,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ever since with your Remonstrant, who pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them even as <hi>Don Hennin</hi> declared them to the said Duke, who would have proceeded to the said undertaking, had he not been slain at <hi>Portsmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the aforesaid undertaking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not a fleet, nor such vast charges as may be conceived; so a private Gentleman with an ordinary association (that could make up a stock of some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63413:6"/>
of pounds) may go through therewith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any venter of considerable losse; For as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are not to seek, in the providing against casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, even by their custom to ensure their Voyages, so likewise may such undertaking be secured.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let it be granted, that men cannot be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious nor wary enough in making of objections, and <hi>Ifs?</hi> as the sickning of men and other casualties, whereby Ships are enforced to return: Why as then Merchants full well know, that the bare lading of some commodities, to serve as Ballast, might supply to satisfie those <hi>Ifs,</hi> and to make up a Voyage.</p>
            <p>And as your humble Remonstrant had just cause to conceal the said <hi>Don Hennins</hi> overtures, ever since he was entrusted with them; yet was it not for want of an Association within the circuit of <hi>Europe,</hi> who would gladly imbrace such an opportunity, to make to the attaining of that which most men desire; but that in the first place, most men are as Saw-dust and Sand, which makes no good morter; that few can be trusted, and few doe aim at Gods glory: And that in the second, Your humble Remonstrant was moved meerly by a true zeal to the English Nation, amidst which, he hath spent above thirty three years of his life: with which your humble Remonstrant proffers to leave the secret of that undertaking, on such easie and reasonable tearms (for as much as concerns only himself and his family) as may seem just to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: So likewise doth he humbly conceive, that on this States silence (which he shall take as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal thereon) he hath done his part; and that he still remains, as he ever was, a free man born, and in their regard a second <hi>Colomba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63413:6"/>Fourthly, Your humble Remonstrant saith, that<note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants tenders as have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals and Instructions concerning a party abroad.</note> having been required (from a great party abroad) to manifest unto this Common-wealth, most certain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret concernments, the which are made apparent by the contents of Credentials, and other Papers, which have a reference thereunto; and the which have been intrusted unto your humble Remonstrant, condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he should give a speedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and true return thereon, unto the Party, from whom they originally proceed: He therefore hath the more incessantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to quit himself on that particular; for that (as in the first place) he could in no wise omit the same, in regard of the said parties reflecting on this Common-wealth, and the consequence of that refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; so likewise in respect of the satisfaction which this Common-wealth might receive therein, when as the truth and secret grounds of that parties ends should be made so apparent, as that it must prove an impossibility for any man (on what colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence soever) to hinder this Common-wealth from taking assured Levels, on that said parties designes; either for the present, or future, on such occasions as Providence should happen to lay before this State: So likewise, in the third place, did your humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant so urgently insist thereon, to the end that whereas the said particulars may be manifested, in one quarter of an houres time, it might not seem to be the more preposterous to such a considerable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that no account could be given in two years time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on a businesse which was entrusted unto your humble Remonstrant, with the greatest precaution that could be, as also on the greatest ties of secresie, and on the greatest score of confidence and credit: when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63413:7"/>
as spies, counterfeits (and men of smal trust) have had acccesse. All which (as he humbly conceives) will plead in his behalf, a sufficient harmlesse excuse, for his said incessant instances; and his present reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: when as he is also very well assured that this Common-wealth hath not had an account of the contents of those Credentals by any other way; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could certain advertisements, whereon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the lives of eminent persons (which stand at the Helm of this Common-wealth were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) come from a more considerable hand then that which had signed the aforesaid credentials.</p>
            <p>True it is, that there was a time taken to order one of your humble Remonstrants Sons (who is now with the Lord) to uncyfer the said advertisement, and thereon a Messenger was sent unto those whom it did concern; but there was not so much time taken as to expresse such a well liking of the parties affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as might have served to prevent his reflecting on the Italian saying, viz. <hi>Passato il periculo gabato il san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto;</hi> nor could one quarter of an houres time (which was requisite to have perused the contents of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid credentials) be set apart for the same; when as the said party hath not ceased to call for an account even untill this present day? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Your humble Remonstrant hath also attended to tender, and to leave with the Common-wealth seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other publike concernments, whereby other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">Severall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to a State.</note> have strengthened and enriched themselves, as some of those whereby the General States of the United Provinces did attract unto themselves, the concourse of severall Nations, as well as the stocks of very wealthy persons of them, after they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63413:7"/>
their mildnesse on the point of the Liberty of Conscience; that they had manifested their readines to grant Immunities, and Priviledges to Forreigners; the settling of a Free-trade, and the Imposing of easie customs, which doth ever attract Negotiants, and rectifieth divers of such as are somewhat more then ordinary inclined to defraud the Customers, and their fellow Negotiants, by the falsification of Wares: And that as then those States proceeded to settle those establishments, and to promote those means whereby to make moneys to flow into the publick Coffers, and in the Casshes of all Negotiants. The which was so carefully minded by the said States, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of <hi>William</hi> the old Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> of <hi>Maurice,</hi> and of <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> his brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that it was no wonder, if that Nation (notwithstanding their long and bloody wars against the potent King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in whose coffers gold and silver doth daily and yearly spring and flow) became so mighty rich during the time of their wars:</p>
            <p>For that they at the first dash pitch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Manning of their Ships, with a lesse number of men (then any other Nation) they have attained unto the best profit of the Commerce.</p>
            <p>One of the maine expedients whereby they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the reducing of monyes (as all experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men know) was first, by the exterpating of all Lombards, and forbidding of the excessive Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Brokers, such as those at present here are, who make no conscience to take 30, 40, nay, more <hi>per Cent.</hi> Use; besides, the horride customes of forfeitures: For as the Lombards (and such Brokers as take 30, 40, and more <hi>per Cent.</hi> Use,) must needs also give excessive rates for the Use of such stoks of monyes, whereby they furnish the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of men on their pawns of Plate and Jewels; It was a very hard task for any negotiant to raise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes but at unreasonable rates.</p>
            <p>A second expedient, whereby the reducing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes<note place="margin">A second ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by monies were reduced.</note> was furthered, was the practical establishment of a banck of payment; whereby the credit of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiant (who had monyes in Banco) became so great, as that all persons (as well Widdows as Orphants) would trust him with their monies; whereby they were enabled to drive the greater trade, and to leave the more considerable stock in the banck: And what a particular secret Revenue the Magistrates procured unto the State from such a Banck, is not so easie an <hi>Arcana Republicae,</hi> as to be discovered.</p>
            <p>The third expedient for the reducing of monyes,<note place="margin">A third expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to reduce monies.</note> was effected by the practical establishment of Bancks of Loan, and of Sale-offices in the cheif Cities and Towns; whereby the traffique was strengthened and encreased; all needy persons were supplyed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and it drew unto such Towns (especially to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63413:9"/>
the Markets ones) the confluence of all Negotiants, for whose secret relief the said Bancks of Loan do also serve, and prevent many Merchants from breaking; Besides that by them ready monyes are provided for all those who make speedy returns of their Wares, and so redouble their gains. In a word, by the means of such like Bancks, men may become rich on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable principles.</p>
            <p>As for that blessed thing called the Publique Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note place="margin">Concerning publique secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> or Faith (that which secures all men in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good their propriety) It was by the aforesaid States endeavoured by the practicall settlement of a general Record-office, by the which any proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant whatsoever was secured in his Inheritance, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasses, and Bargains; all cheats of severall sails, double transactions, and severall morgages were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and the which gave such a firm assurance unto all men, as that each one strove to be owners in chief and not tenants: And this expedient did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reduce monyes to a reasonable rate; for that beside the general benefit which those States and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates obtained thereby, they also procured to themselves the applause and general love of the People. And its observable, how that it is a custome amongst those People to call the best of them by the name of Father: Nay, so will the meanest man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them call their General, were he a Prince of an Imperial descent.</p>
            <p>Moreover by the practical establishment of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Record-office, those States did in the space of<note place="margin">How a vast stock of money and a constant yearly revenue may be raised.</note> one six weeks get a vast stock of ready money into their Coffers, and a yearly revenue of 40000. pounds, with such an applause of the people and its love, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63413:10"/>
may be justly argued: For whereas they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes have been constrained to pay as great rates perchance as the English Lawyers, Scriveners, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossers doe exact of men for their Grecian-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great brest-plate writing; they were as then onely to pay a very inconsiderate duty unto the said Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>office.</p>
            <p>And this the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> can doe with the same applause of the people, with the same advantages to themselves, and thereby attain unto Millions of ready monyes, as well as unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant yearly Revenue of one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, in lue of other duties.</p>
            <p>Hereon your humble Remonstrant hath written at large, and took a speciall inspection into the same, that so he might be able to give a full and clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof; the which he was long since comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe, both by King <hi>Iames</hi> and by the late King, <hi>viz.</hi> To study the truest and most advantageoust way to further the same; so likewise, all the other afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned establishments, whereby the Cities (where they may be so settled) would infallibly produce a very considerable Revenue to the State.</p>
            <p>Besides all which, your humble Remonstrant hath also set down in writing, the means whereby all Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">The advnata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges concerning Silken manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</note> Manufactures may be established here in <hi>England,</hi> which would prove to be a gain of fifteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the hundred: So likewise the monyes which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Bils of exchange into other parts would be kept in the Land; as also many laborious people would thereby be put in a way of subsistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63413:10"/>Moreover, as the refining of Salt can be performed<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fuel.</note> without the expence of Fuell, as one <hi>Swanenbuorgh</hi> doth practice the same on the coast of <hi>Grooninghen;</hi> the said expedient may be very beneficiall unto this State; especially, in a time of breach with the <hi>French,</hi> when as their Bay-salts from the Isles of <hi>Olon,</hi> and <hi>Brouage</hi> should not be had, but at a second hand, and not at eight shillings the Bushel, as it is had now; and that the <hi>French</hi> pollicy of State, suffers the exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof at such a rate, purposely to attract For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to their Ports; when as they cause their own Inhabitants to pay foure pounds sterling in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell.</p>
            <p>Now the said expedient of refining Salt might be set on foot in case the State may deem it fitting to grant the like priviledges unto the undertakers of it, as the above mentioned <hi>Swanenbourgh</hi> hath granted him by the States General.</p>
            <p>Finally, although your humble Remonstrant hath hereby no other particular ends, save such as may be consistant with this Common-wealths Interest; and that he also doth not presume to trouble any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member of Parliament, or of the Councel of State, with the addressing or promoting of this his last Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and summary account.</p>
            <p>Yet he humbly conceives, that as they all (and evry one in particular) minde the publique good, that after his zeal shall be hereby manifested unto so many of the Parliament, and of the Councel of State, as this Remonstrance may be humbly presented unto, it may rather by some of them in particular (or by all of them in general) seem fitting to be reflected on by the whole body of the Parliament; and that their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63413:11"/>
sense and pleasure may be evidenced concerning the same.</p>
            <p>At least, your humble Remonstrant may justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himself, that this his last dilligence and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, will argue a discharge in him, to have done as much as possibly can be expected from him. And this is the Summary of your humble Remonstrants Tenders, and his personall proffers, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, To endeavour by a present claim, to preserve the force and vallidity of the <hi>Flanders</hi> Debt in its former Esse; as also to put any person, whom the Parliament may confide in, into such a course as may recover the same, on such a reasonable consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to your humble Remonstrant, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may in Justice and Honour deem fit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To render any Sea-port or Haven what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever incapable of prejudicing this Nation, in case the same be thought fitting.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To make use of his best endeavours, at any time, wherein this State shall finde it expedient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the advancing of that grand profit, which the English Nation may make by the Cloth commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To give a clear account of the contents, of such Credentials and instructions as concern a great party abroad.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, To prefer the Common-wealth of England before any Dominion whatsoever, for to declare and leave with the same those particular secrets, which were revealed by <hi>Don Hennin</hi> the Spanish Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary; if so be the Parliament be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of them, and of your humble Remonstrant, in a just and reasonable way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63413:11"/>Finally, to make good his willingnesse to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his best experience and endeavours towards the promoting of any of those profitable and beneficiall establishments, which are mentioned in this his said Summary Remonstrance.</p>
