         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMongſt a great many other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation
enjoys under the Auſpicious Reign
of His preſent Majeſty, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
this Crown has in Foreign Affairs, may
be look't upon as one of the moſt conſiderable,
whether in reſpect of the Honour, or Benefit,
which is from thence derived to the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the People of <hi>England.</hi> For, whereas
our Inteſtine Broils, and the Careleſneſs of the
two preceding Reigns, had render'd the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of this Iſland almoſt as much divided from
that of other States of <hi>Europe,</hi> as it is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Neighbouring Countries by the
Ocean, it muſt be acknowledged, that it is
chiefly owing to the incomparable Valour of
His preſent <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> have re-gain'd their Ancient Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
abroad; and that in ſo eminent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that even the moſt potent Princes, in
far diſtant Countries, looking upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:54715:5"/>
as one of the moſt conſiderable in <hi>Europe,</hi>
ſhew a more than ordinary Deference to His
Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It is, withont
Queſtion, upon that Score, we have ſeen ſo
lately one of the greateſt Princes in the World
leave, for ſome Time, his own Country, and,
maugre the Tediouſneſs of ſo great a Journey,
came to viſit this Iſland. As I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that this Journey of His preſent <hi>Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
Majeſty is without a Parallel in the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Empire, ſo it was that which gave the
firſt Opportunity of engaging my Thoughts in
the following Treatiſe. I was not inſenſible
there were many Obſtacles to be ſurmounted,
in an Undertaking of this Nature: And I was
not ignorant, that the Want of Learning,
and the Natural Propenſity of the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
in general to Jealouſie and Secreſie,
would render it, at leaſt, very difficult, if
not quite impractieable, to give an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſo vaſt an Empire, compoſed out of
ſeveral Nations, diſtinguiſhed in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
Religion and Manner of Living.
Theſe Conſiderations were ſo prevailing with
me, as to check my firſt Inclinations, in hopes
that ſome Body or another would lay hold on ſo
favourable an Opportunity of giving a true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of a Country which has been but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
known hitherto in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perceiving that no Body would venture
to engage himſelf in the Deſign, I took a
<pb facs="tcp:54715:5"/>
Reſolution to undertake the Task, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo difficult, rather than to let ſlip ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
an Opportunity, as offered it ſelf, by
the Arrival of His preſent <hi>Czarriſh</hi> Majeſty
in <hi>England,</hi> of giving the Publick the beſt
Account I could of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire. The
Vaſtneſs of its Territories (a great many
whereof are quite unfrequented by Strangers)
did put me under an abſolute Neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Recourſe to thoſe of ſeveral Nations in
<hi>Europe,</hi> that have had the Opportunity of
Travelling in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> For, as I was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolved to inſert nothing in this Treatiſe,
but what I had received upon the Credlt of
thoſe that had been Eye-Witneſſes of their
own Relations; ſo I was obliged to conſult the
Travels, and moſt eſpecially the Embaſſies, of
the <hi>Engliſh, Germans, French, Dutch,</hi> and
other Nations, into thoſe Parts. And, for
as much as it is obvious, that ſcarce ever any
one Foreigner did viſit one half of this ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Empire, I was put under an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
Neceſſity of ſupplying the Defects of one,
with the Relations of others, who had (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their ſeveral Occaſions) taken different
Roads in their Travels through <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
But here it was, I found my ſelf engaged in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heſe Difficulties, which were not eaſie to be

Relations of different Perſons, and Nations,

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> found it a very difficult Task to reconcile,
<pb facs="tcp:54715:6"/>
in ſome meaſure, the various Deſcriptions of
Places, eſpecially in what relates to their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations
and Diſtances; occaſioned, doubtleſs,
by the moſt ſtupid Ignorance and Jealouſie of
thoſe <hi>Muſcovites</hi> from whom they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Intelligence. The Hiſtory of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
it ſelf, even that of the laſt Age, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in ſuch Perplexities, in point of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
that ſome of the beſt Hiſtorians of our
Age (whom I will forbear to name) have
been ſurpriſed into ſome Miſtakes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For the reſt; As the Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as well as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Policy, are very different from
moſt other Nations in <hi>Europe;</hi> and either
not at all, or, at leaſt, but ſuperficially known
in theſe Parts; ſo the enſuing Relation may,
in all probability, ſerve, not only to inſtruct,
but alſo to divert the curious Reader. I muſt
confeſs, the preſent <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Empire might
well have deſerved a Treatiſe ſuitable, in
Bulk, to its vaſt Extent: But the Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which moſt of my Friends ſhewed in the
Publiſhing of it at this Seaſon, obliged me t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
contract it into as narrow a Compaſs as the

thought it moſt expedient to divide the whole
into two diſtinct Volumes; the firſt of which
contains a Deſcription of thoſe ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and vaſt Territories, under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the preſent Grand <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;</hi>

Manner of Living, Religion, and Policy:

Empire, and its Increaſe, till the Death
of that famous Tyrant <hi>John Baſilovits,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Latter End of the laſt Age. But
the various and moſt ſurprizing Revolutions,
which, after the Death of this Grand Tyrant,
happen'd in the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Empire, either
in Conſideration of their various Viciſſitudes,
or the Strangeneſs of their Events, ſurpaſſing
not only what former Ages have delivered of
this kind, but hardly to be parallell'd by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
I reſerved the full and exact Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them to the Second Volume; with a
Continuation of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Hiſtory, and
the whole State of Affairs, from the Year
1613, (when the Family of the preſent <hi>Czar</hi>

Cities of <hi>Europe.</hi> The City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> like

of Wood, except the Palaces of Perſons of the
firſt Rank, ſome Churches and Chappels, and the
Houſes of ſome very Rich Merchants, which are
of Brick or Stone, it being the general Cuſtom
throughout all <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to build their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

laid and joyned one upon another, the vacuities
being fill'd up with Moſs; they are covered with
Barks of Trees, upon which they ſometimes lay
another covering of Turffs, the better to defend
themſelves againſt the Injuries of the Winter-Seaſon.
The Streets of the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> are very ſpacious,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54715:12"/>
and handſom enough in dry Weather, but after the
leaſt Rain very dirty, and would for ſome time of
the Year be rendred quite unpaſſable, were it not
for the great quantity of Firr Poſts, which being
laid croſs the Streets like a Bridge, ſerve inſtead of
a Pavement. The combuſtible Matter, of which
their Houſes are compoſed, together with the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs
and diſorderly Houſe-keeping of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
(they being much given to Drunkenneſs)
makes their Houſes very ſubject to the miſchances
of Fire. In the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> there are certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
left from place to place, and the ſooner to
quench the fury of the Flames, the Guards and
Watch in the Night-time carry Poll-axes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they inſtantly break down the next adjoyning
Houſes to thoſe that are on fire. Notwithſtanding
all theſe precautions, there is ſeldom a Week with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Muſcovites</hi> are the leſs diſturbed at, by how much
more common it is, and may be repaired without
any conſiderable Loſs to the Owners; their Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
conſiſting commonly of a few Benches only
(which alſo ſerve inſtead of Beds) and ſome
Earthen or Wooden Diſhes; And as for their Houſes,
they are almoſt as ſoon repaired as loſt, there being
a certain Market without the white Wall of this
City, where at a very eaſie rate (Wood being ſo
over-plenty in this Country) they buy a Houſe of
what bigneſs they pleaſe, ready built, which, in a

tranſported from thence into other places of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
but eſpecially to <hi>Niſe-Novogorod,</hi> which we
have ſpoke of before, in whoſe ſtead he planted
there a Colony of Muſcovites. The Booty which
he got there was incredible, having, beſides all ſorts
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54715:19"/>
of Rich Stuffs, and other ſumptuous Moveables,
carried away Three Hundred Waggons loaded with
Gold, Silver, and Jewels. About Fourſcore Years
after, <hi>Viz.</hi> in the Year 1569. the then Great Duke
of <hi>Muſcovy, John Baſilowitz,</hi> having conceived the

after he had cauſed an infinite number of People
to be trampled to Death by the Horſes Feet, and
ſome Thouſands killed by the Sword, ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of dead Bodies were thrown into the River
<hi>Wolgda,</hi> that its Current being ſtop'd, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Fields were overflown round about the
Town. The ſtench of the dead Carcaſſes cauſed

ſent the Letters to the Court of the Great Duke.
The people being over-joy'd at ſo lucky and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

the <hi>Czar</hi> taking Courage by the Example of his
Subjects, beſieg'd the City of <hi>Caſan;</hi> but, after

the Siege. After the Death of the Great Duke

that City. The place was for the ſpace of two
Months, batter'd furiouſly, when he offer'd them
very advantageous Conditions, which they having
refuſed in hopes of Succour from the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi>
the Great Duke, not to looſe Time, ordered his
Mines to be ſprung, which ſucceeded ſo well, that
a vaſt Number of <hi>Tartars</hi> were buried in their own
Ruins; During this Conſternation, the General
Aſſault was given, and the Place carried by Storm,
the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1552. not without a
great Slaughter, the <hi>Tartars</hi> defending themſelves

The <hi>Czar</hi> knowing the Importance of the Place,

name of the <hi>Mediteranean</hi> in a more ſtrict ſenſe,
than that which is commonly known by that
name. Beſides the great Rivers of <hi>Wolga, Araxis,
Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Jaika</hi> and <hi>Jems,</hi> the <hi>Nios,</hi> the <hi>Oxus,</hi> and
the <hi>Orxentes,</hi> near a hundred other Rivers of leſs
note, fall into this Sea; and notwithſtanding all
theſe prodigious Acceſſions of Waters, it is not
ſenſibly increaſed; which may ſeem to furniſh a
probable Argument to thoſe, who aſſert, that the
Waters of theſe Rivers muſt needs be conveyed
thence by ſome great and conſiderable Paſſages, or
open communication with other Seas. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
are of opinion, that under the Mountains near
<hi>Ferebath,</hi> betwixt the Provinces of <hi>Tauriſtan</hi> and
<hi>Meſendan,</hi> there is a Gulph where theſe Waters are
ſwallowed up, and conveyed away under the Earth.
But, why may not the ſame reaſon take place here,
which is alledged for the Oceans not overflowing
the Earth by the acceſſion of ſo many Rivers? <hi>viz.</hi>
That, beſides the Miſts, which conſume a great
part, the reſt is conveyed by infinite ſecret Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
through the Earth back again to the Source of
the Fountains and Rivers, ſo that by the help of
thoſe Veins of the Earth, theſe Waters being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
of their Filth, and ſeparated by this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Percolation from their Salt, are by an interrupted

or but ſuperficially known to the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> before the latter carried their Arms beyond
the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it is no wonder if the relations thoſe
Authors have left us about it, are for a great part
not conſonant to Truth, and ſome modern Writers,
miſguided by their Authority, and having taken
the reſt perhaps upon hear-ſay, have inferted a great
many things, which are contradicted by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
What <hi>Curtius</hi> relates concerning the <hi>Caſpian
Sea,</hi> being freſher than the Ocean, proves a miſtake,
it being full as Salt as the Waters of the Ocean;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54715:31"/>
tho' upon the Coaſt of <hi>Hyrcania</hi> (now called <hi>Kilan</hi>)
the Water is only brackiſh, becauſe of the mixture
of a great many Rivers which fall into this Sea on
that ſide; which may probably have led the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Author into that Error, tho' the ſame
may be obſerved in the Ocean; eſpecially upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> by reaſon of the
freſh Waters of divers Rivers, which exonerate
themſelves thereabouts. What the ſame Author
relates of a vaſt number of Serpents in this Sea, is
poſitively contradicted by the Inhabitants of the
Province of <hi>Kilan,</hi> and others bordering upon that
Sea: <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> in his Geography ſpeaks of a
vaſt number of Monſters, which he calls <hi>Belluae,</hi>
abiding in this Sea, which he alledges for one main
Reaſon, why it is ſcarce Navigable; whereas it is
ſufficiently known, that the true Reaſon why the
<hi>Perſians, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> ſeldom venture
far into this Sea, and that only in Summer, is, that
their Barks and Boats are ſo ſmall and wretchedly
built, that they dare not venture far from the Shoar;
Beſides, that this Sea has very few Havens, to wit,
that betwixt the Iſle of <hi>Tzenzeni</hi> and the Continent,
near <hi>Terki,</hi> beforementioned, the Havens of <hi>Baku,
Lenkeran</hi> and <hi>Ferebath,</hi> none of the ſafeſt; the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
near the City of <hi>Minkiſchack,</hi> on the ſide of
the <hi>Grand Tartary,</hi> being the beſt in this Sea; ſo that
the Inhabitants bordering upon it, being generally
very bad Seamen, and not well skill'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
it is their own Ignorance, and the Danger of
this Sea, that keeps them near the Shoar, not the
Terror of theſe Monſters; thoſe other <hi>Europaeans</hi>
that have of late years ſail'd deeper into the <hi>Caſpian
Sea,</hi> having neither ſeen nor heard any thing like
it, except they would take the Sea-dogs, which
are in great numbers near the mouth of the <hi>Wolga,</hi>
for ſuch prodigious Monſters.<note place="margin">Errors of Modern Authors concerning the <hi>Caſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sea.</hi>
                  </note> By the Experience
of thoſe alſo, it is ſufficiently contradlcted what
<hi>Petrejus,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> relates with ſo
much confidence, that the Water of the <hi>Caſpian
Sea</hi> is as black as Ink; that it is full of Iſlands well
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54715:32"/>
ſtock'd with Inhabitants, and a great number of
Cities and Villages; The Water being of the ſame
colour with that of all other Seas, and there being
not one Iſland in it, that has either City or, Village;
and, if the <hi>Perſians, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> living
thereabouts, may be believ'd, there is only the Iſle
of <hi>Enſil</hi> near <hi>Ferebath,</hi> which having very good
Paſtures, the Neighbouring Inhabitants, who keep
their Cattle there, have a few Huts to defend them
againſt the Injuries of the Weather, during the
time their Cattle Graſes there. Of the ſame ſtamp
is what <hi>Contarinus,</hi> in his Travels, and Father <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarous</hi>
in his Hiſtory of <hi>Perſia,</hi> relate concerning a
certain round Fiſh without a Head, to be found in
this Sea, of an Ell and a half Diameter, of which,
they ſay, there is drawn a certain Oil, which the
<hi>Perſians</hi> uſe in their Lamps, and to greeſe their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels;
whereas there are at the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

this Kind for that Uſe, at a much cheaper Rate, it
being from thence tranſported into the other Parts
of the Kingdom. I am apt to believe that they
are fallen into this Error by the ſuperficial Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of a certain Fiſh in the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> called
<hi>Naka,</hi>

ſeveral Kinds of Fiſh, as are catch'd in Rivers,
and kept in Ponds, as Barbels, Breams and Trouts.
Before we leave the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> it will perhaps
not be amiſs to take notice of a certain Species of
wild Geeſe, or (rather Cormorants) which are
found in great numbers on that Shoar, eſpecially
towards the mouth of the River <hi>Wolga.</hi> They are
like other Geeſe as to their Colour, Legs, Neck and
Feet, but the bulk of their Bodies exceeding the
Swans. Their Bills are fork'd at the end, being a
Foot and half long, and near two Inches broad,
the whole Body of ſome of them being above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Foot in length from the Head to the Feet. But
what is moſt remarkable in them, is, that under
their Bills, they have a ſhrivell'd Skin hanging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
a Bagg, which, when dilated, contains
more or leſs three Gallons of Liquor, this they
make uſe of for a Reſcrontory for ſuch Fiſh they
take, which they afterwards ſwallow down at

that kind of Fowl,<note place="margin">Onocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus,</note> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Onocratalus,</hi>
their Beaks are long and round, but at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

When it puts its Beak into the Water, it makes a

without doubt it had its Name. I had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got

that one may ſee down below their Navels, and
their Faces being always uncovered (contrary to
the Cuſtom of thoſe Parts) this, with their good
Humour, and Familiarity they uſe in Converſation,

meet in the Field, to be preſent at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Sacrifice, which is a He-Goat. The
firſt thing they do, is, to cut off its Privy Members,

they are obliged to kill another, till ſuch time they

of <hi>Tarku,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tarku.</note> ſituated within the Mountain among
ſteepy Rocks, which are as hard as Flint, and afford
ſeveral moſt pleaſant Springs to the City, which
contains about 1200 Houſes, built of Brick-ſtone
bak'd in the Sun, after the <hi>Perſian</hi> manner, but not
ſo high; It is the Reſidence of one of their Petty
Princes, but is not ſurrounded with any Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not ſo much as a Wall. Next to this, the
moſt frequented places of this Country are <hi>Ruſtain,
Boinack,</hi> and <hi>Andre,</hi> being three ſeveral Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
lying in the Road betwixt <hi>Perſia</hi> and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Wolga.</hi> The Town of <hi>Boinack</hi> is ſituate upon
the aſcent of a ſteepy Hill near the Sea-ſide. That
of <hi>Andre</hi> is built upon a riſing Ground near the
River <hi>Koiſu</hi> (by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> call'd <hi>Albanus)</hi> which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
out of Mount <hi>Caucaſus;</hi> Its Waters are very
muddy, and its Current very ſwift. The moſt
Remarkable thing here is a certaing Spring of ſeeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Water, which ariſing near the Town, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at ſome diſtance into a Pool, makes the Water
fit for Bathing. About ſome Miles lower, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Koiſu</hi> lets out a Branch, by the Inhabitants cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Askai</hi> (probably the River <hi>Caeſius</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy)</hi>
which running with a very ſlow Current, at laſt is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54715:36"/>
reunited with the ſaid River near the Sea. The
River <hi>Buſtro,</hi> mentioned in the beginning of this
Chapter, (known by the name of <hi>Gerrus</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy)</hi>
is the Boundary betwixt the <hi>Circaſſian</hi> and <hi>Dageſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han
Tartars;</hi> And, about 25 Miles before its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> is divided into two
Branches, the firſt of which, being called <hi>Terck,</hi> or
<hi>Timenski,</hi> has given the Name to the City of <hi>Terki,</hi>
the Metropolis of <hi>Circaſſia.</hi> The ſecond Branch is
called <hi>Kiſelar,</hi> very near as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oad as the other, but
not ſo deep, being fordable for the moſt part of the
Summer. But before we leave the Frontiers of the
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire on this ſide, it may perhaps not be
beyond our ſcope, to inſert here ſhort Deſcription
of the City of <hi>Derbent,</hi> both for its Antiquity's-ſake,
and its being the Frontier-Town of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
upon the Confines of the <hi>Dageſthan Tartars,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince we intend to treat of ſome other Parts,
bordering upon <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in the next following
Chapters.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Derbent</hi> is ſituate in the Province,<note place="margin">Derbent.</note>
called by the <hi>Perſians Lengerkunan,</hi> upon the very
Shoar of the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> which ſometimes waſhes
its Walls, under the 41 degr. 51 min. of Latitude.
Its length reaches from Eaſt to Weſt, near five
Miles, but its breadth is not proportionable to its
length. It is not only the Frontier-place of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
lying upon its utmoſt Confines on this ſide, but
may well be called the Gate of it, reaching from
the Mountain quite down to the Sea-ſhoar. The
whole City is divided into three diſtinct Quarters;
The firſt, is the Mid-City, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to be built by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> as alſo that
Wall which ſurrounds the City on the South-ſide.
Theſe Walls are of a great height, and about ſix
Foot broad, and at a diſtance appear as if they were
built of the beſt Free-ſtone in the World; but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Relation of the Inhabitants, the
Stones of it are made of Muſſle-ſhells and ſmall
pieces of Free-ſtone, beaten and molded together
into Bricks, which, by the long tract of Time, are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54715:36"/>
reduced to that degree of hardneſs, as to exceed
Marble it ſelf. There is, even to this day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of the Gates, remaining an Inſcription, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the <hi>Syriack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Character, as there appears in
another Place ſome <hi>Arabick</hi> words, but ſo defaced
by length of Time, as not to be legible. The Caſtle,
which lies upon the top of the Mountain, is alſo
related to owe its Foundation to that Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and is now always kept by a very good
Garriſon of <hi>Perſians.</hi> The ſecond Quarter reaches
up to the foot of the Mountain, being the moſt
Populous, as the lower Town, which reaches to the
Sea-ſide, is not much frequented now, being formerly
inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> but, ever ſince the <hi>Perſians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
it from <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into Gardens. The whole Body of the City
is encompaſs'd with a very ſtrong Wall, ſo broad,
that a Waggon may drive on them without Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
The Inhabitants are all <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
except ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe chief Buſineſs is to buy
ſuch ſtoln Children as the Neighbouring <hi>Dageſthan
Tartars</hi> bring thither, or elſe ſome <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
which they having pick'd up in ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
they ſend thither to Market, to be from
thence further carried into <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Mountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the City, being for the moſt part covered with
Wood, affords another piece of Antiquity, to wit,
the Ruins of a Wall, which, if the Inhabitants
may be believed, formerly ſerved for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
betwixt the <hi>Caſpian</hi> and <hi>Euxin</hi> Seas,
and extended it ſelf near 300 Miles in length.
Thus much is ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to this day, and are Gariſon'd by the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
There is a remarkable Monument of another kind
near this City, to wit, the Sepulchre of <hi>Tzumtzume,</hi>
of whom the <hi>Perſians</hi> relate the following Fable
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54715:37"/>
out of their Poet, <hi>Fieſull:</hi> They relate, that <hi>Eſſi</hi>
(this being the Name they give to our Saviour)
coming into thoſe Parts, found thereabouts a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Dead Man's Skul, which having taken par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Notice of, he deſired of God, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
he was, to bring the deceaſed Perſon to
Life again; which being done accordingly, <hi>Eſſi</hi>
then asked him, who he was; he anſwered, that
his Name was <hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> that he had been the
moſt Powerful King of that Country, where he
had kept a vaſt Court, compoſed of a great many
Thouſands Muſicians, Pages, and other Servants.
At laſt <hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> having asked <hi>Eſſi,</hi> who he was,
and what Religion he profeſſed, Chriſt made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
I am <hi>Eſſi,</hi> and by the Religion I profeſs, all
the World is to be ſaved. If this be true, reply'd
<hi>Tzumtzume,</hi> I declare my ſelf for that Religion,
but deſire that I may die immediately, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to live now without Subjects in a place
where I was ſo powerful before. <hi>Eſſi</hi> having
granted his Requeſt, he died inſtantly, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
remains here to be ſeen to this day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Tree of an extraordinary bigneſs, next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to which is a Scaffold erected of ten Foot
high, and ſixteen Square. On the other ſide of the
City are to be ſeen ſome Thouſands of Tombs,
cover'd with Stones, half round, Cylinder-wiſe,
but exceeding the ordinary Stature of Men, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of them <hi>Arabick</hi> Inſcriptions. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that in former Ages, yet ſince the Time of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> there was a certain King in <hi>Media,</hi>
named <hi>Kaſſan,</hi> who being engag'd in War againſt
the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Dageſthan,</hi> received there a ſignal
Overthrow, and cauſed the Bodies of the Officers
killed in this Battle to be buried in theſe Tombs.
The Relation ſeems to be not altogether fictitious,
there being near the Sea-ſide, at ſome diſtance from
the reſt, forty others, exceeding the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Tombs in bigneſs, and encompaſs'd with a
Wall, which having each its Banner, are ſaid to be
the Sepulchres of ſo many Lords of the firſt Rank,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54715:37"/>
and other Holy Men, that came along with them,
where the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> of both Sexes come
to pay their Devotions by kiſſing theſe Sepulchres,
and laying their Hands upon them, while they are
at Prayers. But it is time to return to the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
under the Grand Czar's Obedience, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

<hi>Siberia.</hi>

               <p>This Province which lies quite Northward from

is of a great extent, but not very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
being inhabited by <hi>Tartars.</hi> Its Capital City,
being alſo the Seat of an Archbiſhop, is <hi>Tobol,</hi>
built upon a riſing Ground, near a ſmall River;
and, except ſome <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Tartars.</hi>
On the Frontiers of the <hi>Calmuck Tartars,</hi> is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Daour;</hi> And far beyond <hi>Tobol</hi> is <hi>Chneſortski,</hi>
the chief place of Commerce in the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
for Sables, and other ſorts of Firrs, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of this Country. The Natives are a poor
and wretched ſort of People, notwithſtanding that
they have in ſome Parts good Corn Fields, and
great Store of Fiſh. But the chief and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Commodity of this Country, beſides other
Furrs, are the Skins of Sables. Theſe Animals they
catch either with Traps, not unlike to thoſe we
catch our Rats with; or by ſpreading of Nets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Trees, where they feed, which being cut
down, they are entangled in the Nets; In the
Winter they have alſo a Way of hunting them
with Dogs. They were formerly Pagans, being
Govern'd by their own Czar or King, till near 150
Years ago, they were ſubdu'd by Czar <hi>Jobn Baſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits</hi>
in the following manner: A certain Famous
Pirate among the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> living near the River
<hi>Wolga,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Jormack Timorhof,</hi> having
taken a Ship loaden with Amunition, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Czar,</hi> was for fear of being purſued and
diſcovered, fled for Shelter into a certain Iſland,
near the River <hi>Kama,</hi> which coming from <hi>Permia</hi>

(one of the Northern Provinces of <hi>Muſcovy)</hi> falls
below <hi>Caſan</hi> into the River <hi>Wolga.</hi> This Iſland
belonging then to a certain <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Merchant,
he propoſed to him no leſs than the Conqueſt of
ſome of thoſe <hi>Tartarian</hi> Countreys, lying more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North; and being furniſhed by him with
Arms, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries, he, with
about five or ſix hundred of his Followers went up
the River <hi>Tagit,</hi> and from thence to the River <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
where having poſſeſs'd himſelf of a ſmall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,
called <hi>Japouchin,</hi> he march'd from thence to
the City of <hi>Tumen,</hi> which he alſo took without
much oppoſition. Being fluſh'd with this Succeſs,
he directed his March ſtreight ways to <hi>Tobol,</hi> the

with very little Reſiſtance, he ſoon became Maſter
of the Place: But being not contented with thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
extraordinary Succeſs, and propoſing to himſelf no
leſs than the Conqueſt of the whole Province, he
loſt ſoon after both his Life and Conqueſts. For,
having purſued the flying Enemy a great way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the City of <hi>Tobol,</hi> all along the River <hi>Irtiſh,
300</hi> of his Men, whom he had ſent out on purpoſe,
to Atrack the Enemy at a certain paſs, being drawn
into an Ambuſh, were all kill'd upon the Spot, ſo,
that <hi>Jormack</hi> with the reſt, being about 200, was
forced to retire into a ſmall Iſland there abouts,
where he Entrench'd himſelf as well as he could.
But the <hi>Tartars</hi> having by their late Victory, got
new Courage, and being informed of what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men he had with him, Attack'd him
by Night, where he with all his Followers, except
40, who found means to get into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> were
either drowned or cut to pieces. The remnants of
<hi>Jormack</hi>'s Party, being at laſt come to the City of
<hi>Muſco,</hi> and having given to the Czar a relation of
what had paſt in <hi>Siberia,</hi> it was thought adviſable
to give them ſome Forces, thereby to enable them
to try their Fortune a ſecond time. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obtained 600 Men, with Amunition, and other
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54715:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Neceſſaries ſuitable to ſuch an Expedition, they
marched directly towards the City of <hi>Tobol,</hi> the
Metropolis and Reſidence of the Prince of <hi>Siberia;</hi>
and having a ſecond time poſſeſs'd themſelves of it
without much oppoſition, they took quite other
meaſures to ſecure their Conqueſts, from what <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi>
had done before; for they ſo ſtrongly fortified
themſelves there, that they ſoon were beyond all
apprehenſion of being Attack'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and
being afterwards reinforced with new Supplies of
Men, and other Neceſſaries, by their frequent
Incurſions ſo fatigu'd the Neighbouring <hi>Tartars,</hi>

their Chief Motive of ſurrendring themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Since the Conqueſt of <hi>Siberia,</hi> it is chiefly to the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> we are beholding for the particular
Diſcovery they have made of that vaſt Extent of
the Northern Countreys, that lie betwixt the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Oby</hi> (which traverſes this Province, and has
been mentioned before) and the Famous <hi>Chineſe</hi>
Wall, which divides that Famous Empire from the
<hi>Grand Tartary.</hi> For the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> having once
been made ſenſible of the prodigious Quantities of
all Sorts of precious Furrs, as the Sables, Martins and
black Foxes thoſe Countreys afforded, and the vaſt
Profit that muſt needs ariſe to their own Country,
by engroſſing the Traffick of thoſe Commodities,
have left no ſtone unturn'd, not only to make the
beſt Diſcovery they could of thoſe <hi>Tartarian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but alſo by ſettling a fair Correſpondence
with them, to open to themſelves a free paſſage
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54715:39"/>
into <hi>China.</hi> Among the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Nations which
inhabit that vaſt Tract of Ground betwixt <hi>Siberia</hi>
and <hi>China,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Calmuck,</hi> of <hi>Mongul</hi> and
<hi>Bogdoi,</hi> are the moſt conſiderable, whether for the
extent of the Countreys they inhabit, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
number of their Inhabitants. The firſt
diſcovery of theſe Parts has chiefly been owing to
the Induſtry of thoſe employed by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
in Sable Hunting, whom they in their Language
call <hi>Yachutehiki,</hi> or <hi>Hunters of Sable Martins;</hi> Theſe
are for the moſt part, compoſed not only out of
Malefactors or Criminals, but alſo out of ſome
Officers or Boyars, who for ſome reaſon or another,
having fall'n under the <hi>Grand Czar</hi>'s Diſpleaſure, and
being baniſhed into thoſe places where theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are caught, the hopes of Gains has by degrees
drawn them further and further after the Search of
theſe Creatures, even as far as the River <hi>Yamour,</hi>
where, for their better Conveniency, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
not many years ago, have built a Fort in a certain
Iſland of that River, which has occaſioned no ſmall
Conteſts betwixt them and the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> Beſides
the two ways of catching theſe Creatures by the
Trap and Net, mentioned before, they obſerve this
Method in theſe remote Parts: There is a certain
number of Men Arm'd with Croſs-bows, engag'd
for this Service, during the ſpace of ſeven Years,
and divided under certain Officers; One of theſe
Officers goes abroad, at leaſt once a Week with his
Hunters and Dogs in Search after theſe precious
Creatures, which commonly are lurking among the
little Iſlands, which they kill with their Croſs-Bows,
not making uſe of any Fire-arms, for fear
of endamaging the Furrs; What is thus caught is all
for the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Uſe, except a certain Allowance,
the Officers have for their Pains, which however,
they are obliged to divide in proportion with their
Huntſmen, to encourage them in proſecuting the
Game with the utmoſt diligence; The eagerneſs
after which has at laſt opened to them the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               </p>
               <p>The conſtant Reſidence of this Impoſtor is in a
very ſtrong Caſtle,<note place="margin">The Pagan Pope.</note> near the City of <hi>Barantola</hi> in
the <hi>Tarturian</hi> Province of <hi>Tanchut,</hi> which reaches
from the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Calmuck</hi> and <hi>Mongul,</hi> between
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and is Govern'd by
a great Prince, whom they call <hi>Deva.</hi> This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Pope, the ſpiritual Father of the whole <hi>Great
Tartary,</hi> is worſhipped by theſe Idolatrous Nations,
by proſtrating themſelves before him, and adoring
him, like a God; neither are any Strangers permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to approach him, unleſs they are ready to pay
him the ſame Devotion. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> themſelves
ſhew a great deal of Veneration to him, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he vouchafes to come into <hi>China,</hi> he is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the greateſt Reſpect and Honour imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and never returns without vaſt Preſents. He
has his Vicars or Vicegerents reſiding in ſeveral of
the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Provinces, unto whom they pay the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54715:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſame Adoration, as to the <hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi> or <hi>Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malamalow</hi>
himſelf; Theſe Patriarchs, or what elſe
you will call them, are by the <hi>Tartarians</hi> called
<hi>Coutuſta Lamas,</hi> and aſſume among other Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
an Authority to themſelves of compoſing
ſuch Differences, as may ariſe among the Under
Chans, either by themſelves, or by ſuch Judges as
they are pleaſed to appoint. The chief thing
which contributes towards the maintaining the great
Veneration theſe Pagans have for the <hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi>
is, that they have been perſuaded into a Belief,
that he is immortal, and only renews, like the
Moon. This Impoſtor is carried on in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner: As ſoon as they perceive this <hi>Dalaè</hi> or
Chief Prieſt, to be in danger of his Life, thoſe that
have the management of this Buſineſs, make it
their whole care to find out among the other <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s
or Vicars, one who moſt reſembles him in
Perſon; who, immediately after the Death of the
firſt (whoſe dead Body is carefully concealed) is
ſet up in his Room, and declared to be the ſame
<hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi> but only renewed in his Perſon; and
this Impoſtor is the more difficult to be diſcovered,
by the common People, they being but rarely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to ſee this High Prieſt, unleſs it be at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
when he gives them his Benediction.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice here of the Opinion,<note place="margin">Preſte Jean.</note>
which ſome, that have of late years travell'd into
thoſe Parts, have conceived of this <hi>Dalaè-Lama,</hi>
to wit, That he is that ſame <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> who has
made ſo much noiſe in the World, and has been
ſo variouſly repreſented by Hiſtorians. Thus much
is certain, that if every thing be duely weighed as
it ought to be, concerning the Title and other
Things, which by many Authors are attributed to
their <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> the ſame may in moſt points be
ſaid of this <hi>Dalaè-Lama;</hi> ſo, that I ſee no reaſon
why we may not with more Juſtice place him in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> than theſe Authors have look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for him in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſina,</hi>
where, with all their Endeavours and Shifts,
they have never been able to find him out hitherto.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54715:41"/>
The <hi>Portugeſes</hi> were the firſt that received, and
afterwards communicated this erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to the reſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> it being certain,
that the more an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ient Authors, who have made
any mention of this <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> have placed him
always in <hi>Aſia,</hi> though they have differed both
as to his Name, and place of Reſidence.
And thus far <hi>Baltazar Tellez, Nicolas Godigno,</hi> and
ſome others, who have been for a conſiderable time
reſident in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and conſequently had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Opportunity to be inform'd concerning this
Matter, agree with the Antients, that this <hi>Preſte
Jeen</hi> is not to be heard of in thoſe Parts. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugeſes</hi>
were firſt led into this Error by one <hi>Pieter
de Coulan,</hi> who being ſent by their King <hi>John</hi> II. to
diſcover the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> by Land, after having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
a great part of <hi>Aſia</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> could
not hear the leaſt Tidings there of this ſo Famous
<hi>Preſte Jean;</hi> But, in his return homeward, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Cairo,</hi> was inform'd, that in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> there
was a very Potent Prince, who was a declared Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of the Chriſtians, having always a Croſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before him. This Relation agreeing in a great
meaſure with what had been publiſhed before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> was the ſooner received as
Authentick, firſt, in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and afterwards all
over <hi>Europe.</hi> The Jeſuit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That there is not the leaſt mention made there
of this <hi>Preſte Jean;</hi> and if we ſearch narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Antient Authors, that have had occaſion to
ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> him, we ſhall find that the greateſt part
of them have placed him betwixt the Country of
the <hi>Monguls</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> tho' perhaps in ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
which difference might perhaps ariſe from
thence, that in former Ages this <hi>Preſte Jean</hi> had
his ſeveral Vicars, as the <hi>Dalaè-Lama</hi> has now,
which might be taken by ſome for the Head it ſelf.
St. <hi>Antonius,</hi> in the third Tome of his Hiſtory, places
this <hi>Preſte Jean</hi> in the <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper India,</hi> from
whence, he ſays, he drove back the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54715:41"/>
invaded the Chriſtians in thoſe Parts. Thoſe who
have aſſign'd him his Reign in <hi>Kitay,</hi> have queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
comprehended that vaſt Country, ſituate betwixt
the Rivers of <hi>Volga</hi> and the <hi>Oby,</hi> as far as <hi>China,</hi>
under that Name, as the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> do to this day;
eſpecially ſince <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</hi> who reſided
ſeveral Years with the <hi>Great Chan</hi> of the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
places <hi>Preſte Jean</hi> in the ſame Kingdom of <hi>Tanchut,</hi>
where the <hi>Dalaè-Lama</hi> has his Reſidence to this
day. Both the Antient and Modern Authors have
been ſtrangely puzzled in finding out the true Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
of the Word <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> but in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that of <hi>Scaliger</hi> is the moſt probable, who
derives it from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Word <hi>Preſtegiani,</hi> which
ſignifies as much as <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> and might eaſily by
Corruption be transformed into <hi>Preſte Jean</hi> by ſuch
of the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> as did not underſtand its true ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.
There is but two Objections of any
moment to be made againſt this Aſſertion: The
firſt is, that the ſame <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> who is ſo much
celebrated throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> and his Subjects,
were Chriſtians; whereas the People Inhabiting now
adays the <hi>Great Tartary,</hi> are Idolaters; The ſecond
is, that <hi>Preſte Jean</hi> was a Temporal Prince. As to
the firſt, it is to be obſerved, that, tho' at preſent
that vaſt Country is altogether poſſeſs'd by Infidels
or Pagans, nevertheleſs it is very probable, that
in more Antient Times, the Chriſtian Religion
was introduced into thoſe Parts as well as others,
and continued there for a conſiderable time, there
being certain Remnants of Chriſtianity to be met
with to this day, among ſome of its Inhabitants.
There is a Country in thoſe Parts, called by the
<hi>Moors</hi> in deriſion, <hi>Kiaferſtan,</hi> that is, <hi>The Country
of the Infidels,</hi> the Inhabitants of which are called
to this day, <hi>Chriſtians of</hi> St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> and, tho' no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
now, yet have retain'd Baptiſm for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
have painted Croſſes in their Churches, and
bear three Red Croſſes, made with the Tincture of
Sanders-Wood, in their Foreheads. I think it is
almoſt beyond queſtion, that in the thirteenth Age,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54715:42"/>
there was a vaſt number of Chriſtians in <hi>Tartary,</hi>
their Emperor <hi>Cublai,</hi> having embraced the Chriſtian
Religion, and his Brother waged War with great
Succeſs againſt the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.
In the fourteenth Age ſeveral of <hi>Franciſcan</hi>
Monks, who were ſent to the Great <hi>Chan,</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Kingdom of <hi>Thibet</hi> (which is next to
that of <hi>Tanchut)</hi> a great number of Pagans; and
it is Remarkable, what F. <hi>Andrada,</hi> a <hi>Portugeſe</hi>
Jeſuit relates, That in the Year 1624. when he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
in thoſe Parts, he found among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
ſome corrupted Idea's of Chriſtianity; as a
certain ſort of Confeſſion of that Chriſtian Faith,
their Anceſtors had profeſs'd in former Ages. And
I think it no leſs worth Obſervation, that this <hi>Dalaè</hi>
or High-Prieſt of the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> bears the Name
of <hi>Lama,</hi> which in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Language ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Croſs, and that the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> who
acknowledge among the reſt the Authority of this
<hi>Dalaè,</hi> wear always Croſſes about them, which they
call <hi>Lama's,</hi> and keep them with a great deal of
Reverence. As to the ſecond Objection, of this
<hi>Dalaè</hi> not being a Temporal Prince now, this may
be aſcribed to the Wars and Revolutions of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
inhabited by ſeveral diſtinct Nations, ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt corrupted, and at laſt quite degenerated
from their Antient Religion into a Barbarous Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and thereby the whole face of Affairs changed;
this Succeſſor of <hi>Preſte Jean,</hi> from being a Monarch,
might become the Head of a New Religion, or
rather Idolatry.</p>
               <p>But,<note place="margin">Tartars of Mongul.</note> it is time, after this Digreſſion, to proceed
in the Deſcription of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and among them to the
<hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Mongul.</hi> Theſe <hi>Tartars</hi> inhabit a very
large Tract of Ground from the Weſtern ſources
of the River <hi>Yamour</hi> to the <hi>Calmuck Tartars,</hi> from
whom they are however ſeparated by great Deſarts,
and border to the South-Eaſt and Eaſt upon <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtan</hi>
and <hi>China.</hi> They are ſubdivided into three
great Provinces, each of them being under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54715:42"/>
of its particular <hi>Chan</hi> or <hi>Taiſo,</hi> who are
all three of the ſame Family, and cultivate a very
good Underſtanding betwixt one another, having
ſeveral Under-<hi>Chans</hi> under their Juriſdiction. The
firſt and chiefeſt of theſe <hi>Chans</hi> is call'd <hi>Tchetchinga,</hi>
his Territories lie betwixt <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> of
<hi>Bogdoi.</hi> They inhabit neither Towns nor Villages,
their Houſes, which are but few in number, lying
ſcattered here and there, without any regularity.
They are very troubleſom to their Neighbours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
about the Lake <hi>Dalai,</hi> and all along the
River <hi>Szelinga;</hi> one of their Under-<hi>Chans,</hi> call'd
<hi>Becroeſain,</hi> Territories bordering upon that River.
It is in the Territories of this <hi>Chan Tchetchinga,</hi> that
the <hi>Coutouſta Lama,</hi> or the Vicar of the <hi>Dalaè Lama,</hi>
has his Reſidence, being reſpected here as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of all the <hi>Monguls,</hi> and adored almoſt like
a Deity. He follows them where-ever they ramble,
and it is to him they refer the deciſion of all their
Differences; theſe <hi>Tartars</hi> being naturally of a
very mild and pliable Temper. The ſecond of the
Principal <hi>Chans,</hi> is called <hi>Octiervikan,</hi> and the third,
<hi>D' Jan Gari,</hi> but their Territories lying out of the
way of Commerce, and conſequently being unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
by Strangers, are nothing near ſo well
known as the firſt. They are very jealous of the
<hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> ſince they have made themſelves
Maſters of <hi>China,</hi> but theſe ſtand in little fear of
them, as having the Advantage of their Fire-Arms
againſt them, with the uſe of which the <hi>Monguls</hi>
are altogether unacquainted; and the Deſarts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the <hi>Calmucks</hi> or <hi>Calmuches,</hi> ſerve
for a Barrier to both Nations. They keep a very
good Correſpondence with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Siberia,</hi> where they
drive a great Trade with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> eſpecially
in Cattle, wherein their chiefeſt Wealth conſiſts,
their Country being all over watered with a great
number of ſmall Rivers, which all empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

be Tributaries to the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> till they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
both known and fear'd, by ſubduing ſix of
the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Provinces; and would in all likelihood,
have ſoon made themſelves Maſters of the whole

their Aid the <hi>Yousbecks,</hi> who having expell'd the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
of <hi>Bogdoi,</hi> did not only ſettle themſelves there,
but alſo put upon the Throne the Family of <hi>Ive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
which having ſway'd the Scepter of this ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Empire, till the Year 1368, was expell'd by

Year 1644, re-entred <hi>China</hi> with a vaſt Army, and

The firſt Emperour of the <hi>Tartarian</hi>

of the Province <hi>Dauri</hi> are not near ſo rich in
Cattle as the <hi>Monguls,</hi> their Horſes being but very
ſmall, and never Shoo'd by their Owners, but
they drive a conſiderable Trade in Sables and black
Foxes Skins, as alſo in Rubies and Pearls, which
the Rivers, <hi>Argus, Yamour</hi> and <hi>Chingala,</hi> afford
them. Their Houſes are built of nothing but
Earth, and they reſemble both in their Stature and
Faces moſt of the <hi>Europaean Tartars,</hi> but eſpecially
thoſe of <hi>Crim,</hi> except that they are much more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſed,
by reaſon of their continual Commerce
with the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> Their Speech and the Characters
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54715:43"/>
they make uſe of, have a very near reſemblance to
the Vulgar Dialect of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but they have
above ſixty Letters in their Alphabet, and write
and read from the top downward, like the <hi>Chineſes.</hi>
They ſcarce profeſs any certain Religion, but wear
moſt of them Croſſes, which they keep in great
Veneration, and are great Enemies of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans.</hi>
Both Guns, and Gun-powder is in uſe
among them; but not ſo frequently, neither with
the ſame Dexterity, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> they having not
attain'd to the ſame perfection in the Compoſition
of the latter, ſo, that it being but of little Strength,
and their Great Artillery, which is very indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caſt, not very ſuitable to their rambling way of

Arms as the reſt of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe three different Sorts of <hi>Tartars,</hi> we
have ſpoken of, there are ſeveral others, as the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiouski,
Watski,</hi> or <hi>Vigulci, Barbanski</hi> or <hi>Scibanski,
Tyrgyski, Tingoeſi,</hi> and others, who inhabit about

many ſeparate <hi>Hordes,</hi> formerly belonging to that
Nation, but by converſation and trading with the

               <p>The <hi>Tingoeſes</hi> were firſt diſcovered to the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tingoeſes</note>
in the Year 1605, when ſome of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>
Hunters, guided by ſome <hi>Siberian Tartars,</hi> and a
few <hi>Samoyedes</hi> (of whom we ſhall ſpeak at large in
the following Chapter) after having paſs'd many
Rivers and ſeveral Deſarts, came at laſt to a River,
called <hi>Jeniſſay</hi> (where the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have ſince
built a City of the ſame name) exceeding in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the River <hi>Oby</hi> it ſelf, which having on the Eaſt
high Mountains (ſome of which caſt out Fire) and
on the Weſt very fertile Plains, theſe were the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
of the <hi>Tingoeſi,</hi> living in wretched Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
diſpoſed into ſeveral ſmall <hi>Hordes</hi> or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54715:44"/>
The River overflows the adjacent Plains in
the Spring, during which time, the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
into the Mountains, and return to the Plains
with their Cattle, as ſoon as the Waters are fall'n:
They found them of a very gentle and mild Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
having at the perſuaſion of the <hi>Samoyedes,</hi>
ſoon ſubmitted themſelves to the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but, what is very obſervable, is, that
theſe <hi>Tartarians</hi> have great ſwoln Throats, like in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the Inhabitants under the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Tartars</hi> in thoſe Parts are of a ſwarthy
Complexion, inclining to an Olive colour: They
have broad Faces, flat below, but riſing on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-part,
their Eyes very ſmall, but brisk and
ſparkling; they have very ſhort and flat Noſes,
wearing a little Hair upon their upper Lips or Chins.
The Stature and Proportion of their Bodies is very
large, ſomething above the common Size,
they are clean and well proportion'd in their
Limbs; their Air, tho' ſomewhat ſtern and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
yet carries not any marks of Cruelty or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs
along with it. Their Habits reſemble that
of moſt all the other <hi>Tartars,</hi> both <hi>Europaeans</hi> and
<hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> being made in the nature of a Caſſock
or large Veſt, fitted to their Bodies, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
are for the moſt part only Sheep-Skins. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Waſte they wear a Cord or ſmall Girdle,
wherein hangs their Bow and Quiver, which are
their conſtant Companions, wherever they go.
Their Heads are ſhav'd to the Crown, where they
preſerve a good Tuft of Hair, thick enough to make
two good Locks, one of which hangs down before,
the other behind. Upon their Heads they were no
other Covering, than a round Cap, or rather Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
made of the ſame Stuff with their Habits;
only that on the top of it, there is a pretty large
Tuft of red, white or green Silk, or perhaps of
ſome other colour, according to the Cuſtom of
ſuch <hi>Hordes,</hi> as they belong to; theſe <hi>Hordes</hi> wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe different colour'd Tufts, as a certain
mark, whereby to diſtinguiſh themſelves from one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54715:44"/>
another. Their Chief Men among them, eſpecially
ſuch as live in thoſe places where the Sables and
Martins are caught, make their Garments either of
thoſe Furrs, or elſe of Dog-Skins, and ſometimes,
eſpecially during the Winter, they join both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They generally wear the Hair of the Dogs (of
which they keep a great number) outermoſt mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Furrs of the Sables or Martins the Lining to
the other; not, but that they are ſufficiently ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
how much the firſt exceed the latter, both in
Beauty and Value; but, ſay they, <hi>We do not think

the Snow being well beaten, they Travel in Sleds
from the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> to <hi>Tobol,</hi> the Capital City
of <hi>Siberia,</hi> to wit, above 800 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles in leſs
than three Weeks. From hence they continue their
Journey by Land to the utmoſt Frontie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

and from thence to the <hi>Toſtiouski,</hi> a <hi>Horde</hi> of <hi>Tartars,</hi>
under the Subjection of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Here they
change their Carriage (which they ſend back into
<hi>Siberia)</hi> for one much more ſwift and commodious.
For whereas the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Sleds are uſually drawn
but by one Horſe, they make uſe in thoſe Parts of
a certain Beaſt, called the <hi>Reen,</hi> or <hi>Rain-Deer,</hi> which
they put in their Sleds, and to make it go the more
ſwift, they tye a great Dog behind, that by his bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">The Reen, or Rain-Deer.</note>
ſcaring the poor Beaſt, makes it run with that
ſwiftneſs, that it carries the Sleds Six or Sevenſcore
Miles a day.</p>
               <p>This Creature (probably the <hi>Tarandius</hi> of the
Antients) is by the Modern <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Rangifer,</hi>
from the Word <hi>Reen,</hi> which is the Name given it
by the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> who, as likewiſe the <hi>Samoyedes,</hi>
and ſome other Northern Nations, make a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Advantage of theſe Beaſts, not only in their
Sleds, but alſo by making Cloaths of their Skins. It
is as big as a large Stagg, but much ſtronger, with
a very high Breaſt, where the Hairs, which are of a
grayiſh colour, inclining to white, are very long
and rough. They have cloven Hoofs, the Horn of
which is as hard as Iron, ſo that making at every
ſtep an Impreſſion in the Ice, they go as ſecurely,
as if they were ſhoo'd with Froſt-Nails, or walk'd
upon the Ground, and that with ſuch ſwiftneſs,
that they often Travel 150 Miles a day, their Horns
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54715:45"/>
are higher than thoſe of the Elk, and larger than a
Stagg. They have on the Forehead two Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anklers,
wherewith in the Winter they dig up the
white Moſs from under the Snow for their Food,
and break the Ice, to get Water to quench their
Thirſt. For the reſt, they are very Sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
feeding in Herds, and eaſily tamed, and
made ſerviceable for the draught of Sleds, which
they perform with an incredible ſwiftneſs.</p>
               <p>By the help of theſe Creatures the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
Merchants Travel with great Expedition, as long
as the Ice continues to bear, to the City of <hi>Geneſſay</hi>
or <hi>Jeneſſay,</hi> built by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> upon a River of
the ſame Name, for the conveniency of Travellers.
From thence they take Boat to go up the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">Lake of <hi>Biakala.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Tonguſi</hi> and <hi>Augara,</hi> to the Lake of <hi>Baikala,</hi>
where both theſe Rivers have their riſe.</p>
               <p>The Waters of this Lake are extraordinary clear,
but what makes the Paſſage over it very difficult
and tedious, is, that it being ſurrounded on all ſides
with very high Rocks, and the Winds being thereby
check'd, they blow ſo variouſly, and from ſeveral
Points at a time, that they put the Maſters of the
Veſſels to a great deal of danger and trouble; ſo,
that tho' its breadth be not 30 Miles over, yet are
they obliged to ſpend ſometimes a whole Week in
paſſing it.</p>
               <p>After they have got over this Lake, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
enter towards the South, the Country of
the <hi>Mongul Tartars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sleds with Sails.</note> where being furniſhed with
Mules and Dromedaries, they continue their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards the Confines of <hi>China,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
done in fifteen or ſixteen days.</p>
               <p>But, before we part with our Travelling Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
I cannot forbear to mention here a certain
way they uſe in thoſe Parts of eaſing theſe Reens
or Sled-Stags in their Travels, it being the more
ſurpriſing, the leſs any thing of that Nature is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
among the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> tho' I remember to
have ſome Years ſince, ſeen ſomething, not unlike to
it in <hi>Holland, viz.</hi> a certain Machine, driven forward
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54715:46"/>
by the help of Sails upon a Level. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the help of Sails, which when the Wind
favours, they put up in their Sleds, ſo that by this
means they are driven along, ſometimes over the
Land covered with Snow, ſometimes over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
frozen with Ice; the Dog and Deer ſupplying
the defect of the Wind in a Country all Level,<note place="margin">Why the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel by Land into <hi>China</hi>
                  </note> (ſuch
as is that vaſt Tract of Ground betwixt <hi>Siberia</hi> and
Mount <hi>Caucaſus)</hi> as the Oars in a Veſſel, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed,
or labouring againſt the Wind.</p>
               <p>It will perhaps ſeem ſtrange to thoſe, who have
ſome knowledge of theſe North-Eaſtern Parts, that
whereas theſe Travelling Merchants might with more
Eaſe, and leſs Charge, take the Advantage of thoſe
great numbers of Rivers, which are betwixt <hi>China</hi>
and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> they ſhould chooſe the way by Land,
as being both more chargeable and troubleſome.
But, beſides, that it is ſufficiently evident out of
what has been ſaid, that the <hi>Grand Tartary</hi> betwixt
<hi>China</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> is not ſo Deſart, as has been
imagined, there are inſurmountable Obſtacles in
theſe Rivers, which are ſufficient to deter even the
beſt Seamen in the World, much more the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi>
who are hitherto not the moſt expert in Sea-Affairs.
Not to mention here an almoſt infinite number of
Rivers, whoſe Names are not ſo much as known in
<hi>Europe,</hi> the moſt conſiderable, both for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Water, and extent of their Courſe, are
the Rivers <hi>Oby, Geneſſay,</hi> or <hi>Jeneſſay, Lena,</hi> and <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
The two firſt have this Inconveniency, that,
where they diſembogue into the Sea, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the Year long, ſo choak'd up with whole
Mountains of Ice, that they are extreamly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
beſides which, the latter of the two is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Mouth of it ſo full of Cataracts, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-falls,
at ſome Leagues diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
occaſioned by the Rocks, whoſe tops being
all over covered with moſt delicious Flowers, by
their odoriferous ſcent, perfume the circumjacent
Air, that they cannot be paſs'd without unlading
the Veſſel, which cannot be done without great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54715:46"/>
Charge; The Mouth of the River <hi>Lena</hi> lying more
Eaſterly, is not ſo much peſter'd with Ice as the
former, and its Courſe much more eaſie, yet the
vaſt number of Rocks and Shelves, which lie
very cloſe to one another at the very Entrance of
it out of the Sea, renders it very dangerous, if
not quite unpaſſable to Ships of never ſo little
Burthen, except it be to very ſmall Fiſher-Boats.
'Tis true, the River <hi>Yamour,</hi> the moſt Eaſterly of
all, would be very convenient for Traffick, its
courſe being uniform, were it not for a prodigious
number of Sea-Bull-ruſhes, which at its Entrance
into the Sea, grow like a Foreſt, of that thickneſs,
that a Man can hardly graſp one of them with both
his Arms, whereby all Paſſage for Ships to go into
the Sea, is quite obſtructed: All theſe Difficulties
and Obſtacles conſidered, who can blame the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
if they prefer the moſt commodious and
ſhorteſt Way before the dangers of theſe Rivers,
which however, are not uſeleſs, but rather very
commodious to them in their Land-Travels from
<hi>Siberia,</hi> croſs the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Provinces, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>China;</hi> foraſmuch as they travel with more
Eaſe over them when they are frozen, and are
more Navigable towards their Sources, than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the End of their Courſes? During the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
betwixt the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Chineſes,</hi> ariſen
about the Building of the Fort of <hi>Albazin</hi> by the

to go by Water upon the Rivers, <hi>Oby</hi> and <hi>Szelinga,</hi>
as far as the City which bears the ſame name with
the laſt of theſe Rivers, being built there by the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> for the Conveniency of their Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Mercants. From this City they travel by Land
through the Country of the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Mongul,</hi> to

one of their Principal Chans, where alſo reſides the

being under the frigid Zone it ſelf. This
Country was firſt diſcovered to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by
a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Merchant, whoſe name was <hi>Oneke,</hi> who
having for a conſiderable time traded with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in rich Furrs, and gathered great Wealth,
at laſt made a Diſcovery of it to the Czar of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
who having ſent thither a ſplendid Embaſſy,
they ſoon perſuaded them to ſubmit to His Czariſh
Majeſty, paying a certain number of Sable Skins
for their yearly Tribute. They were formerly
comprehended under the name of thoſe the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
called <hi>Shytes</hi> or <hi>Sarmates,</hi> it being certain,
that the word <hi>Samoyedes,</hi> is a Muſcovian Word, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
as much as ſelf-eaters, compoſed out of
<hi>Sam,</hi> which ſignifies ones ſelf, and <hi>Geda</hi> to eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they uſed to eat the Bodies of their dead
Friends, mixed with their Veniſon, in the laſt of
which, this Country abounds, and always was, and
is to this day, their ordinary Food. Some would
have them to be the ſame <hi>Abii,</hi> of which <hi>Curtius</hi>
ſpeaks, that they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Alexander
the Great,</hi> and that they were called <hi>Obii</hi> from the
River <hi>Oby.</hi> Tho' they have no Cities, yet do they
not live a Vagabond-life, like moſt of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
but have their ſettled Habitations, which are
certain Cabans or Huts, ſome Foot deep under the
Ground, of a circular Figure, built Vault-wiſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54715:47"/>
a top, having in the middle of it a Hole, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
which is the Fire-place, round about
which they lie during the Winter; it ſerves both
for a Chimney, and ſometimes for a Door, thro'
which they let in the Air, when the others are
ſtopt up by the Snow, which falls here often ſix or
ſeven Foot high. During this Seaſon, which laſts
ſix Months, and keeps them in continual Darkneſs;
their Correſpondence is maintain'd betwixt them
by the Trenches or Walks under Ground from one
Hut to another, by which means they viſit one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the abſence of the Sun being ſupplied by
the melancholy light of Lamps, fed with Oil,
drawn of a certain Fiſh, of which as well as of
all other Neceſſaries, they make proviſion in the
Summer; which Seaſon begins here, as ſoon as the
Sun comes to the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> Line, and enters into
the <hi>Septentrional</hi> Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and rejoyces
them with a Day as long, but not ſo tedious, as the
Night had been before. It is then they leave their
doleful Huts, and apply themſelves to their uſual
Employments, which is chiefly Hunting. I am apt
to believe that it is upon the Account of theſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyedes,</hi>
that ſome have founded their fabulous
Narrations of a certain People that ſleep ſix Months
in the year, or that die in the beginning of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and riſe up again in the Spring, like the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
or Frogs; as that, what has been related
of ſome of the Northern Countreys, to wit, that
there are People there without Heads, having their
Eyes in their Breaſts; That they have Feet ſo big,
as that one of them ſhades the whole Body, and
being thus covered with their Feet, neither Sun nor
Rain can come at them, queſtionleſs owes its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to their Garments and Pattins they make uſe of
in the Winter. For, their upper Garments are
made like Veſts, or rather Coſaques, falling down
to the mid-leg, border'd below with Furr, open
only at the bottom (by which they get into them)
and in the upper part, where they put out their
Faces; when the Cold is exceſſive, they cover
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54715:48"/>
their Heads with a certain Cap, like to the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,</hi>
made in the ſame Faſhion with the Head of
a Man. So in the Winter-time, theſe <hi>Samoyedes,</hi>
as well as the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> wear a
kind of Shooes or Pattins, made of Bark of Trees,
or ſome very thin Wood; Thoſe that are worn by
the <hi>Samoyedes,</hi> are an Ell and a half long towards
the Toe, but thoſe of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi>
are as long to the Heels as to the Toes; they uſe
them with ſo much Agility upon the Snow, that
down a Hill, they will out-do in ſwiftneſs ſome
Horſes. For the reſt, their Garments are made of
the Skins of the <hi>Reens,</hi> the Nerves and Veins of
theſe Beaſts ſerving them for Thread to ſow their
Cloaths; At the end of the Sleeves of their Coſaques
they have their Muffs ſowed on, which they either
let hang looſe, or make uſe of to cover their Hands,
as occaſion requires. Under theſe Coſaques they
wear Shirts made of the Skins of young <hi>Reens</hi> or
<hi>Rain-Deer,</hi> which, having very ſhort Hair, are ſofter
than Linnen, and under theſe Shirts they wear their
Drawers. Upon their Heads they wear very large
Caps or Bonnets, which hang down round about
their Necks; they are commonly made by the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi>
of Cloath of ſeveral Colours, lin'd with
Furr, and ſold to the <hi>Samoyedes.</hi> They wear alſo
Boots with the Furr on the out-ſide, which makes
them appear at firſt ſght, more like Savage Beaſts
than Men. They have a way of ſcraping the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Bark of Beech as fine as the Shavings of
Ivory, which ſerves them for Handkerchiefs, for
they take a Handful of it at a time, to wipe their
Faces, Noſes or Hands. The length of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Seaſon making their Ground not fit for Tillage,
they have no Corn nor Cattle, ſo that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
to live upon what Nature affords them:
their Food being Fiſh dry'd in the Wind and Sun,
inſtead of Bread, Honey and Veniſon; and the
Fleſh of young Whelps or Puppies, is eſteem'd a
dainty Fare among them. Their Stature is very
low and mean, having very ſhort Legs, almoſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54715:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like the <hi>Groenlanders,</hi> of whom we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſpeak anon; their faces large and flat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Beards, and their Eyes very little, like the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> but not ſo ſparkling. The Women here
are very ugly, ſo that by their Faces and Cloaths,
which are exactly like to the Men's, their Sex is
not to be diſtinguiſhed at firſt ſight. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, they are very jealous of them, being
extreamly nice in preſerving their Wives for their
own Uſe. For this reaſon they buy them at the
Age of ſix or ſeven from their Parents, without
daring to look upon them before the Bargain is
made, the uſual payment is a certain number of
Deers, the only valuable Commodity their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
affords, thus thinking themſelves aſſured of
their Virginity, they keep them very cloſe, nay
more ſtrict than in <hi>Italy,</hi> both before and after
Marriage, and there is ſome who affirm, that when

to Strangers, they reſerve to themſelves the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails,

Arms are no other than a Bow and Arrows, which
they make uſe of when they go abroad a Hunting,
which being their continual Exerciſe, they are moſt
excellent at Shooting; they have alſo a certain way
of Dancing, but the moſt ridiculous in the World.
They were formerly all Pagans and Idolaters; for

a certain Animal, call'd <hi>Behemot,</hi> of which we

this Creature being very difficult to Hunt moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

Sexes is not eaſily diſtinguiſhed in their Garments,
but that the Breeches of the Women do not reach
quite down to the Knees, whereas they wear theirs

knowing any Superiority among one another, thoſe

and their Skin much ſofter. Their Hair is blacker
than Jet, which they roll together, and bind it up
on their Crowns. Some of them wear certain Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets

have their Breaſts flagging and falling down to their

ſuckle their Children over their ſhoulders, and it is
very remarkable, that thoſe Women that were ſome
Years ago brought into <hi>Denmark,</hi> were obſerved to
have no Hair in any other Part, but the Head, and
to be free from the Monthly Courſes of Women.

never pronounce the R (as do alſo the <hi>Tartars)</hi>

<hi>Wolmar</hi> II. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who laid the firſt

other Cities in that Country, to <hi>Goſwin d' Eck,</hi> the
then Maſter of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Order of Knights.
The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have for above theſe Hundred Years
paſt been very ambitious to unite, not only this
City, but alſo the whole <hi>Livonia,</hi> with the <hi>Ruſſian</hi>
Empire, which has occaſioned ſeveral Wars, not
only betwixt them and the Maſters of the <hi>Livonian</hi>
Knights, but alſo with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> after this City
had put it ſelf under the Protection of <hi>Eric,</hi> King
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> near a Hundred and Fifty Years ago.
This City is very Famous for two memorable Sieges
it held out againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the firſt, in the
Year 1570. the ſecond, in the Year 1577. both
which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were forced to raiſe with
great Loſs. The City is fortified according to the
Modern way, but its chief ſtrength lies in its Caſtle,
which being moſt advantageouſly ſituated upon a
Rock, ſteepy on all ſides, renders it almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible,
except towards the City, where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by very good Works. It has a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Haven, fitted rather by Nature than Art, for
the convenience of Trade, eſpecially with <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
It is one of the moſt Antient Towns belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Hanſeatick</hi> League, and had for ſome
Years, in Conjunction with the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the
Direction of the College belonging to the <hi>Hanſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Towns</hi> in the City of <hi>Novogorod Veliki.</hi> It was
very flouriſhing in its Commerce, from the Year
1477. till the Year 1550. when having broken

ſoon after took the City of <hi>Narva,</hi> and eſtabliſhed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54715:52"/>

Notwithſtanding which, it enjoys to this day the
Priviledge of being a Mart, which has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to them by ſeveral Treaties betwixt the

their Wings have been clip'd of late Years, as to
ſeveral Priviledges granted to them formerly by
the Maſters of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Order, and were ſince
look'd upon as dangerous to the Prerogatives of
their Sovereign. The Eccleſiaſtical Government is
here, like in moſt other Commonwealths that
profeſs the Proteſtant Religion, according to the
Tenure of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, adminiſtred by
a Conſiſtory and a Superintendent; And their Civil
Conſtitution comes very near to a <hi>Democratical</hi>
State, the Magiſtrates having no Power to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſact
any thing of moment, without the Advice of
the Principal Men of ſeveral Profeſſions, and in
Matters of Extraordinary Conſequence, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Summoning every Freeman of the City. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
half a League of it, towards the Sea-ſide, are
to be ſeen the Ruins of a ſtately Monaſtery, about
200 Years ago dedicated to St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> by a very
wealthy Merchant of this City. The only thing
Remarkable here, is, a Book compoſed of the
Foundation of this Monaſtery, intimating, That
the Religious Men and Women (for it conſiſted of
both) of this Monaſtery had been ſo ingenious,
even in thoſe days, as to have found out a way to

               <p>The next City of Note in the Province of <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Narva.</note>
is <hi>Narva,</hi> ſituate in the Circuit of <hi>Allentaken,</hi>
at 60 degrees Elevation. It hath its Name from
the River <hi>Narva</hi> or <hi>Nerva,</hi> which having its riſe in
the Lake <hi>Pripis,</hi> falls with a very ſwift Current in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gulph of <hi>Finland,</hi> about Ten Miles below
this City. Near three Miles above it, there is a
moſt dangerous Cataract or Water-fall, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54715:52"/>
obliges the Ships that come down the River from
<hi>Pleſcou</hi> and other Places to <hi>Narva,</hi> to unlade their
Merchandizes near that Place. This Town, which
is not very large, but exceeding ſtrong, by reaſon
of the adjacent Caſtle, is ſaid to be built, as well
as the City of <hi>Revel,</hi> by <hi>Wolmar</hi> II. King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
and was in the Year 1558. beſieged and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

General, under whoſe Juriſdiction it remains to this
day. It hath for many Years paſt enjoyed the ſame
Priviledges with the other <hi>Hanſeatick Towns,</hi> and
was in the laſt Age a Place of very good Traffick,
till the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Trade was from thence, by the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> transferred to <hi>Archangel,</hi> and
the Wars betwixt the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
its Commerce. During the War betwixt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s Time,
the Commerce to <hi>Archangel</hi> being interrupted, there
began to be a Proſpect of reviving the Trade into
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> abundance of Ships making uſe of this
Harbour for that purpoſe at that time, ſo, that the
Haven was repaired, and ſeveral new Additions
were made to the Town, for the Conveniency of
Strangers. It has two Caſtles belonging to it, one
on this ſide of the River, and the other on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Shoar, in a Peninſula, made by the River
<hi>Nerva.</hi> It is called <hi>Ivanovogorod,</hi> and was built
there by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> upon a Rock, ſo inacceſſible,
that it was judged Impregnable, and was not taken
by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> till in the Year 1617. when <hi>Guſtavus
Adolphus</hi> made himſelf Maſter of it. At the foot
of this Caſtle is another ſmall Town, or rather
Suburb, called <hi>Narva Muſcovite,</hi> being inhabited
by <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> but ſubject to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Governour of
the Caſtle. Betwixt <hi>Revel</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> there are
in the Woods, Bears and Wolves of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

abundance of Miſchief to the Peaſants. There is

out of twelve he met upon the Road before he was
killed himſelf. They faſten commonly a great Stick

in the Country of <hi>Shovenburgh,</hi> in the Dioceſs

Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Year 1561, during the

But <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> took it at laſt in the Year

one Blow, they ſurrendred to the Grand Duke.
But the Year 1571, prov'd moſt fatal to this City;
For one <hi>Reinold Roſe,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Livonia,</hi>
having laid a Deſign, to put the City into the
hands of <hi>Magnus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Helſtein,</hi> and being
diſcovered before it could be put in Execution, the
Citizens paid dearly for it, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all manner of Cruelties upon them, without
diſtinction of Age or Sex. Purſuant to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Peace, made in the year 1582, between
the Grand Duke, <hi>John Baſilovits</hi> and <hi>Stephen Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>

1635, which was ſince confirm'd by the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Year 1666, at the Monaſtery of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liva.
Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> founded an Univerſity

having received its name from the River <hi>Parnau</hi>

is much decay'd of late Years, the only thing they

taken it from the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> till in the year, 1562,
the <hi>Swedes</hi> made themſelves Maſters of it, but was
however, three years after, recoverd by the <hi>Poles</hi>

till by virtue of the beforementioned Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Poles;</hi> this, with the reſt

<hi>Swedes</hi> retook it from the <hi>Poles,</hi> in the Year 1617,
and have kept it ever ſince by the enſuing Treatiſes

               <p>The third Province of <hi>Livonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Courland.</note> is the Dutchy
of <hi>Courland,</hi> being divided from the former by the
River <hi>Dune.</hi> This Province was miſerably ruin'd
during the Wars betwixt the <hi>Muſcovites, Poles</hi> and
<hi>Swedes;</hi> and when the Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick
Order,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Riga</hi> were forced
to ſubmit themſelves to the Protection of <hi>Poland,</hi>
with all that was remaining under their Juriſdiction,
<hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> made <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
a Dukedom, which he beſtow'd upon <hi>Godard
Kettler</hi> of <hi>Neſſelroth,</hi> laſt Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick

after his Elder Brother <hi>Frederick</hi> died without Iſſue,
was diſpoſſeſs'd of it by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being forced to live in Exile till the year

City of <hi>Riga.</hi> During the firſt War betwixt the
<hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Swodes,</hi> the latter took the City of <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taw,</hi>
which they fortified and kept in their Poſſeſſion
till the year 1629, when, by Virtue of the Truce
then agreed on betwixt theſe two Crowns, they
were obliged to reſtore it to the Duke of <hi>Courland.</hi>
At the Entrance of the Gulph called by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
<hi>Couri-Chaf,</hi> or <hi>Lake of Courland,</hi> is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

<hi>Cleupeda</hi> by the <hi>Courlanders.</hi> It is encompaſſed by
the River <hi>Tange,</hi> which not far from thence falls
into the Gulph. Its Caſtle is extreamly pleaſantly
ſituated, and well fortified, and its Harbour very
commodious. It was built in the Year 1250, and
belonged to the Fryars of the Order of <hi>Livonia,</hi>
who, in the year 1328, ſold it to the Maſter of
the Order of <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> By Virtue of the Truce
concluded betwixt the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> in the

ſurrendred under the Juriſdiction of the
Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who remains ever ſince
in full Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>The Country of <hi>Livonia</hi> it ſelf was not known
in theſe Parts till in the Year 1158. when a certain
Ship of <hi>Bremen</hi> being forced by a Tempeſt into
the Gulph of <hi>Riga,</hi> the Merchants of that City
began to eſtabliſh a Commerce, and ſoon after, the
Chriſtian Religion in this Country, its Inhabitants
having been all Pagans before that time, of whoſe
Superſtitions and Sacrifices we ſhall have occaſion
to ſpeak anon. The firſt that preached the Goſpel
among them, was <hi>Menard,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Segeberg,</hi>
afterwards, in the Year 1170. made the firſt Biſhop
of <hi>Livonia,</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> III. Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> His
Succeſſor <hi>Bertold,</hi> a Monk of the Order of <hi>White
Fryars,</hi> not following the foot-ſteps of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
was for employing the Sword in converting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54715:55"/>
theſe Idolatrous People, who having taken up Arms,
kill'd him with above 10000 Chriſtians; ſo that
the Chriſtian Intereſt was in the utmoſt danger of
having been quite loſt in that Country, had not the
Prudence of <hi>Albert,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
to <hi>Bertold</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Livonia,</hi> in
part reſtored what the former had loſt.</p>
               <p>For he,<note place="margin">Livonian <hi>Knights.</hi>
                  </note> the better to eſtabliſh the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in theſe Parts, by the Authority received
from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. laid the firſt Foundation of
the Order of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Knights, or <hi>Fryars of
the ſhort Sword,</hi> ſo called, becauſe they wore on
their white Cloaks a red ſhort Sword, with a Star
of the ſame colour, which they have chang'd ſince
into <hi>two ſhort Swords,</hi> Salter-wiſe. They were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
almoſt to the ſame Rules with the <hi>Knights-Templars;</hi>
were to fight againſt the Infidels and
<hi>Barbarians,</hi> and to have the third part of all that
they gain'd from their Enemies. But in regard this
New Religious Order at firſt was ſcarce ſufficient
to ſubſiſt upon its own Bottom, it was joyn'd to
the Order of St. <hi>Mary of Jeruſalem,</hi> in the Year
1238. in the Perſon of <hi>Herman Balek,</hi> Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order in <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> ſince which
time, the Maſters of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Order had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
from the Grand Maſters of that Order,
till being hardly preſs'd upon by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
they were forced to ſubmit to the Protection of
the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> It is from hence, that the
Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> firſt claim'd the Title over
theſe Lords or Maſters of the Order of <hi>Livonia,</hi>
and in the Year 1513. they became entirely Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Empire, when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Riga,</hi>
with his Suffragans, and the Maſter of the Knightly
Order, who had in part freed himſelf of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Grand Maſter of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
among the Princes of the Empire. But the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by reaſon of its convenient Situation,
had for a conſiderable time look'd upon it with a
wiſhful Eye, and in the Year 1501. entred it with
a very Powerful Army, but were vanquiſh'd in a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54715:56"/>
pitch'd Battel, fought betwixt them and <hi>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Order, where
40000 <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were kill'd upon the ſpot, which
obliged them to make a Truce with the <hi>Livonians</hi>
for Fifty Years. This being expired, the Grand
Duke of <hi>Muſcovy, John Baſilovits,</hi> being fluſh'd
with his late Conqueſts of the Kingdoms of <hi>Caſan</hi>
and <hi>Aſtrachan,</hi> and taking Advantage of the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
that were then betwixt the Maſter of the
Knightly Order, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Riga,</hi>
entred <hi>Livonia</hi> with a numerous Army, and having
ruined all with Fire and Sword in the Biſhoprick of
<hi>Derpt</hi> or <hi>Torpat</hi> and <hi>Wirland,</hi> retreated into <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
This having put the whole Country into a
great Conſternation, they were for ſeeking Aid in
all Parts, and having made their firſt Application
to the Empire, but with little Succeſs, the City of
<hi>Revel,</hi> which was the moſt expoſed of all, offered
to put it ſelf under the Protection of the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> which having been refuſed, they had
recourſe to <hi>Eric,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who likewiſe
refuſed them the deſired Succours of Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
unleſs they would put themſelves under his
Protection (in which caſe he would maintain them
in their Priviledges) the City and adjacent Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſeparated from the Maſter of the Order, and
ſubmitted to the Protection of the Crown of
<hi>Sweden</hi> in the Year 1560. In the mean while,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Riga,</hi> and the Coadjutor
of the Order of <hi>Livonia</hi> had made a League
Defenſive with <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> unto whom they had promiſed 300000 <hi>l.
Sterling</hi> towards the defraying the Charges of the
War, and for his Security, had engaged ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bailywicks; But the King of <hi>Poland</hi> being
ſenſible of the extream danger they were in, and
how the City of <hi>Revel,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honie</hi>
or <hi>Eſthland,</hi> had been forced to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> refuſed to execute
the Treaties, unleſs they would follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the reſt of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and ſubmit themſelves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54715:56"/>
upon the ſame terms to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> as
they had done to <hi>Sweden.</hi> Being therefore reduced
to an abſolute neceſſity of chuſing the leaſt Evil,
the Archbiſhop and Maſter of the Order were
forced to Surrender all the Acts and Charters they
had obtained from the Emperour and Pope, into
the Hands of Prince <hi>Radzivil,</hi> who, in the King
of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Name, received alſo from them the
Oath of Fidelity. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> gave the
Title of Duke, with the Country of <hi>Gourland,</hi> to
the Maſter of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Order, as we have ſaid
before, in the Deſcription of <hi>Courland,</hi> in the Year
1562. And Twenty Years after, to wit, in the Year
1582. by vertue of a Peace concluded with the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> got into Poſſeſſion of the whole
<hi>Livonia,</hi> except that part of <hi>Eſthonie</hi> which had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> who by degrees got all the
reſt from the <hi>Poles,</hi> which was entirely reſign'd to
them in the Year 1666. by the Treaty of Peace
made betwixt theſe two Crowns, in the Monaſtery
of <hi>Oliva,</hi> near <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country of <hi>Livonia</hi> is very fertile, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Wheat, abounding in all ſorts of Cattle,
Fowl, and Veniſon; an Ox being commonly to be
bought here for Twenty Shillings, a Hog for a
Crown, and a good Hare for a Groat; but has
within theſe two Years laſt paſt been ſo oppreſs'd
with Famine, that a great many Thouſands of the
Peaſants have died for Hunger.</p>
               <p>Its Inhabitants muſt be conſidered under different
Qualifications;<note place="margin">Inhabitants of <hi>Livonia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </note> The firſt, are the <hi>Germans</hi> and their
Poſterity, out of which moſt of the Nobility, and
the Inhabitants of the Cities are compoſed; The
ſecond, are the Peaſants, the remainders of the
Antient Inhabitants, who living in the Champain
Country of <hi>Lettie</hi> and <hi>Eſthonie,</hi> have nothing they
can call their own, but are abſolute Slaves either to
the Nobility or Chief Citizens. They are called
by the <hi>Germans, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nteutſche,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>no Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
perhaps, becauſe they cannot be brought to
conform themſelves to the manner of Living and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54715:57"/>
Language of the <hi>Germans.</hi> They are the greateſt
Slaves in the World, but it is alledged againſt them,
that, if they were not kept under ſuch a ſevere
Subjection, they would be always endeavouring to
recover their Liberty at any rate, of which they
have given ſome Proofs, when ever any Occaſion
preſented.</p>
               <p>The Origin of the <hi>Livonian</hi> Nobility is founded
upon the Services they have in former Ages done
againſt the Infidels and <hi>Muſcovites;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> they are free
from all Taxes and Charges. <hi>Volmar</hi> II. King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> was the firſt that gave them Mannors to
hold in Fealty, which were confirmed by <hi>Eric</hi> VII.
by Letters Patents, and augmented by the Maſters
of the <hi>Short Sword,</hi> and the Grand Maſters of <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
Some of theſe Mannors, eſpecially in the Diſtricts
of <hi>Harrie</hi> and <hi>Wirland,</hi> are Inheritable by the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and their Iſſue, to the fifth degree. But they
are above all beholding to that Famous <hi>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</hi> who being in the Year 1513. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a Prince of the Empire, exempted the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
from all Subjection, excepting ſuch Services
as they were obliged to do in Perſon, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Mannors. When Neceſſity obliged
them to have recourſe to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they did not
ſubmit to that Crown, but with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their Antient Priviledges, which, for the
moſt part, they keep to this day. There is once a
Year a Review made of this Nobility, which does
not only, upon occaſion, furniſh the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
with a conſiderable Body of Horſe, but alſo is
look'd upon by the <hi>Sweden</hi> as their chief Nurſery of
Officers, even to the Generals of Armies. The
Adminiſtration of the Government, both as to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and Juſtice, is committed to Twelve of the
Body of the Nobility, who are the Council of the
Country, of which, the Governour of the Province
from the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> is Preſident. Their
Judicial Proceſſes are very ſhort, and decided once
a Year, to wit, in <hi>January,</hi> by this Council, who,
after a Declaration and an Anſwer, proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54715:57"/>
to Judgment. To perform this with the
more conveniency, each Province has its own Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as they call him, whoſe Buſineſs is, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the Governour and Council the Grievances
of the People, and this Employment is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
above three Years in the ſame Perſon. There
are alſo certain Triennial Judges appointed for the
determining of Differences in the flat Country;
concerning the Limits betwixt Private Men, which
have been rendred dubious by the Wars; and ſome
other Judges or Overſeers of the High-ways, Bridges,
and Cauſways; But from all theſe there lies an
Appeal to the Council of the Country.</p>
               <p>As to their Religion,<note place="margin">Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> they are <hi>Lutherans</hi> here,
which muſt be chiefly underſtood from the Nobility
and Inhabitants of Cities, but, as for the Peaſants;
they can ſcarce be called half Chriſtians, much leſs,
to be ſaid of any particular Religion, being, even
to this day, ſo deeply entangled in their Heatheniſh
Superſtitions, that they ſcarce ever go to Church,
or at leaſt, never Communicate, unleſs it be by
force, they being, notwithſtanding that wretched
and ſlaviſh Condition they live in, quite regardleſs
of any thing elſe but this Life. 'Tis upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that, when they take an Oath, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with theſe words: <hi>If I do not ſwear true, I
am content, that the Curſe of God may light upon my
Body and Soul, upon my Children, upon all what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to me, to the Ninth Generation.</hi> Some of
them, eſpecially the Peaſants about <hi>Riga,</hi> if they
are to take an Oath at Law, put a Turff upon their
Heads, with a white Stick in their Hands, thereby
ſignifying, that they conſent, That, <hi>they, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Cattle, may become as dry as the Turff and
Stick,</hi> if they ſwear falſely. They frequently put
a Needle and Thread into the Grave with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed,
becauſe, forſooth, <hi>he may perhaps have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to mend his Cloaths in the other World.</hi> Sorcery
is much more frequent among them than Prayers,
the firſt is propagated by Tradition from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to their Children. They never kill a Beaſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54715:58"/>
but ſome part of it is thrown away, nor never brew,
but ſomething muſt be ſpilt, which they look upon
as a Preſervative againſt Witchcraft; Nay, they
have a way of rebaptizing their Children themſelves
(tho' privately) if in ſome Weeks after the firſt
Baptiſm they happen to fall ſick, which; they ſay,
is occaſioned by the Child's having received a Name
not ſuitable to its Conſtitution, and therefore are
obliged to give it another. They love to do their
private Devotions upon Hills, or near a Tree, in
which having made ſeveral Inciſions, and ty'd it
up with ſome red Stuff, they there offer their Prayers,
which always tend to ſome benefit of this Life.
The Peaſants about <hi>Revel</hi> and <hi>Narva</hi> go once a
Year, <hi>viz.</hi> on the day of our Lady's Viſitation, on
Pilgrimage to an old ruin'd Chappel betwixt theſe
two Cities, where kneeling before a great Stone
that is in the midſt of it, they offer Fruits and
Fleſh as a Sacrifice for the Preſervation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Cattle, the whole ending with
Dancing, Drinking, and ſometimes Fighting. All
this is not ſo much to be attributed to their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as Stubbornneſs; for there is ſcarce a Village
but what has a Church and Miniſter, and the Biſhop
of the Province reſiding at <hi>Revel,</hi> keeps as watchful
an Eye as poſſibly he can over the Clergy, beſides
which, the Catechiſm, the Goſpel and Epiſtles, with
certain Explications added to it, have been long
ago tranſlated into their Native Tongue, for their
general Benefit; but all this has proved inſufficient
to root out of theſe ſtubborn Peaſants the remnants
of their Idolatrous Superſtitions.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings are in a great meaſure as odd as
ſome other of their Cuſtoms;<note place="margin">Their Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> For, if a Peaſant
Marries a Country Laſs out of another Village, he
gets on Horſeback, with a Stick cleft at the top;
wherein is put a Braſs Piece of Money, thus equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and accompanied by two of his Friends with
naked Swords in their Hands, and a Bag-piper ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before him, he comes to fetch the Bride, whom
he ſets behind him, and having made her embrace
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54715:58"/>
him with the Right-hand, away he rides to the
Houſe where the Marriage is to be conſummated;
when they come to the Door, his two Friends give
each of them a ſtroak with their Swords croſs the
Door of the Houſe, which being opened, he gives
the Braſs Piece of Money to the firſt he meets with
there. Being entred, his two Friends ſtick their
Swords into a Beam directly over his Head, which
they pretend to be done to prevent Charms; for
which purpoſe alſo, the Bride, as ſhe comes along
the Road, ſcatters little pieces of ſome red Stuff
or another by the way, but eſpecially, where any
Croſs-ways meet, or near any Croſſes which are put
upon the Graves of little Children, which die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Baptiſm, whom they bury in the High-way.
They have however one Cuſtom, which, among
People ſo barbarous, ſeems to have ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
in it. For, after the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
are ſet down at the Table with the Gueſts,
they don't tarry long there, but within half an
hour, leaving the Gueſts to themſelves, they get to
Bed, after having for the ſpace of two hours try'd
one anothers Vigour, return to the Table, where,
with Drinking and Dancing they ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Day and following Night, till, what
with Wearineſs, and what with Drunkenneſs, their
Legs begin to fail them, when they all Pig toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Neſt. As for their Garments, they are
ſuitable to their wretched Condition, to wit, of a
coarſe Cloath; the Womens Petticoats being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Plaits like a Sack. Thoſe, who have been
able to ſave a little by their Drudgery beyond the
reſt, wear about their Necks a Necklace of Plates
of Silver, of the bigneſs of a Crown Piece, and
upon the Breaſt one hanging down by a Chain as
big as a Trencher, but not very thick; Their Shooes
are either made out of the Barks of Trees, or raw
Leather of a Cows Hide.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe we have had occaſion to ſpeak here
of the Superſtition of theſe <hi>Demi-Chriſtian Peaſants</hi>
in <hi>Livonia,</hi> it will not be altogether beyond our

Inhabitants of <hi>Livonia, Pruſſia, Lithuania,

Nations, and among them more-eſpecially by the
<hi>Ruſſians,</hi> as to what relates to their Carnavals, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
Funerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be obſerved to owe their
firſt Off-ſpring to their <hi>Pagan</hi> Anceſtors. Theſe
Nations, before they were converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, had many Gods, unto whom they
uſed to Offer their Sacrifices. <hi>Occopirnus,</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them the God of Heaven and Earth, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimpus</hi>
was the God of the Sea, <hi>Gardvates,</hi> the
God and Patron of the Sea-faring Men, theſe three
being reckoned equivalent among them to <hi>Jupiter,
Neptune</hi> and <hi>Portuninus</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Beſides
theſe, <hi>Potrympus</hi> was their God of all Rivers and
Fountains, <hi>Pilvitus</hi> the God of Riches, <hi>Perguboius</hi>
the God of the Spring. <hi>Pargnus</hi> the God of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>On St. <hi>George</hi>'s Day, they uſed to offer their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

taking hold of the Cup of Beer with his Teeth,
drinks it off quite, without the help of his Hands;
when he throws it backwards over his Head. The
Cup being taken up from the Ground, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with the ſame Liquor, all that are preſent
drink one after another, ſinging the abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hymn in praiſe of the Idol; and ſpending the

Country People uſed to perform the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
which in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language, they call'd
<hi>Zazinck,</hi> that is to ſay, the beginning of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.
The Sacrifice being over, they uſed to chuſe
one of thoſe that were preſent, to begin the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
who cutting down immediately a Handful
of Corn, carried it to his Houſe till next day;
when firſt he and his Servants, and then the reſt
began the Harveſt; which being ended, they uſed
again to meet and perform the ſame Sacrifice as
before, which they called in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language
<hi>Ozinck,</hi> which ſignifies the End of the Harveſt.</p>
               <p>When they were to Sacrifice to their Idol, called
<hi>Putſcaetus,</hi> or the God of Groves and ſacred Trees,
they uſed to perform it under an Elder Tree, where
they brought Bread, Beer and other Eatables; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
their Prayers to the Idol, and begging his
Interceſſion with <hi>Marcoppol,</hi> the God of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to preſerve them from being oppreſſed by
their Lords; and deſiring him to ſend them ſome
of the <hi>Barſtucks,</hi> or Subterraneous Spirits; They
were verily perſuaded, that if theſe <hi>Demons</hi> take
to a Houſe, they bring good Luck to the Owners
of it, for which reaſon they did ſet upon a Table
in their Barns towards Night, Bread, Cheeſe,
Butter and Beer, if they found this eaten up againſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54715:60"/>
next Morning, they promiſed themſelves all the
good Fortune in the World; but if they found
it untouch'd as they left it the Night before,
they did preſage to themſelves nothing but Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
In the ſame manner they were perſuaded
concerning the <hi>Cobolds,</hi> as the <hi>Germans,</hi> or <hi>Colky</hi>'s,
as the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> call them, that they dwell'd in the
moſt obſtruſe Corners of old Buildings, or among
great Heaps of Wood; and that they would carry
their Neighbours Corn into their Barns, for which
reaſon they would be ſure every night to leave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table the beſt of Victuals the Houſe afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They believed, that when any of theſe <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
did intend to fix their Habitation in a certain
Houſe, they uſed to make the Maſter of the Houſe
ſenſible of their Intention, in the manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
They would carry what ſmall Wood there
was ready cut in the Houſe together in one Heap,
and put into their Milk-Pans, fill'd with Milk the
Dung of ſeveral Sorts of Creatures. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Houſe be willing they ſhould appear
and ſettle in his Houſe, he muſt with his whole
Family drink of the Milk thus ſeaſoned with
Dung.</p>
               <p>They uſed to keep a perpetual Fire on the top of
a very high Mountain in <hi>Samogitia,</hi> betwixt <hi>Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania</hi>
and <hi>Livonia,</hi> committed to the Care of certain
Prieſts, in Honour of the Idol <hi>Pargnus,</hi> whom they
believed the God of Thunder and Tempeſts.</p>
               <p>To the other Gods we have named before, they
either jointly, or ſometimes to one in particular
uſed to ſacrifice a He-Goat, which was thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd:
The Prieſt, after thoſe that were to be
preſent at the Sacrifice, were Aſſembled, having
laid both his Hands upon the Goat, mutter'd out
certain Prayers to ſuch God or Gods, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Sacrifice to, and, having craved his or
their Aſſiſtance, all that were preſent lifted up the
Goat, and held it ſo long in the Air, till the Prieſt
had finiſh'd a certain Hymn, which being done,
the Goat was again ſet upon his Legs on the ground.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54715:60"/>
Then the Prieſt made a Harrangue to the People,
containing in Subſtance; That <hi>they ſhould be very
careful in performing this Sacrifice according to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of their pious Anceſtors, with all imaginable Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tranſmit it without blemiſh to Poſterity.</hi> Having
ended his Sermon, he kill'd the Goat, and having
ſprinkled the Standers-by with the Blood, the Fleſh
is given to the Women to boil; which done, they
feaſt upon it all the Night, till they are all drunk,
and if any of the Fleſh happen to be left, the next
Morning they bury it under Ground, for fear it
ſhould be defil'd by the Birds or other Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Pagan Nations uſed to keep Snakes
or Serpents in a certain Corner of the Houſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
near their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oves, which heat their Rooms;
at certain times their Prieſts were to come to the
Houſe, and to Conjure theſe Creatures to come
forth out of their Holes, and to taſte of ſuch Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as were ready prepared for them upon a Table
ſet for that Purpoſe; if the Snakes are obedient to
the Prieſt's Command, and take a Taſte of all what
is ſet before them, the whole Family, after the
Snakes have withdrawn themſelves into their Holes,
eat the reſt with a great deal of Joy and Content,
as preſaging to themſelves nothing but good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
for that Year. But if theſe Creatures hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to prove diſobedient, not hearkning to the
Conjuring Prieſt, they appear very ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
as believing that ſome great Misfortune is
likely to befall them that Year.</p>
               <p>They had alſo a certain Sort of Southſayers, whom
they call'd <hi>Burty</hi> in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language; theſe
acknowledge for their Patroon, the God <hi>Potrympus,</hi>
unto whom having made their Addreſſes, and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
out certain Words, they uſed a certain way of
powring melted Wax into Water, and according to
the ſeveral Figures and Shapes that appear'd whilſt
they were caſting, they pretended to reſolve ſuch
Queſtions as were preſented to them.</p>
               <p>Their Nuptial and Funeral Rites were performed
in the following manner:<note place="margin">Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> After the young Couple
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54715:61"/>
had made mutual Promiſe of Marriage to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
two of the neareſt Relations of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
uſed to take the Bride, as it was, by force
out of her Fathers Houſe, which being done, they
addreſs themſelves to the Parents, or ſuch as have
the Diſpoſal of them, who then publickly give their
Conſent to the Marriage. The Day appointed for
the Conſummation of the Marriage being come,
the Bride, with Bells hanging from the Girdle
down to her Knees, is led three times back and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
into the Kitchen, and being afterwards put
into a Chair, her Feet are waſh'd with Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith they ſprinkle the Nuptial Bed, their
Houſhold Stuff, and all the Gueſts invited to the
Feaſt. After that, they uſed to give to the Bride a
taſte of Honey, and putting a Veil over her Face,
conduct her to every Door that belong'd to the
Houſe, where ſhe was obliged to knock with her
right Foot againſt them; In the mean while, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who followed her with a Sack, fill'd with all
ſorts of Corn, to wit, Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats,
Peaſe, Beans, and the Seed of Poppies, uſed to
ſtrow the Ground round about her, wherever ſhe
went, frequently repeating to her theſe Words: <hi>If
thou remain'ſt devout and conſtant in thy Religion, and
be'ſt careful of thy Houſe, thou ſhalt never want any of
theſe Things;</hi> Then the Veil is taken away, and the
Bride placed at the Table with the Gueſts, invited
to the Feaſt. At night they begin to Dance, and
whilſt the Bride is a Dancing, they cut off her Hair,
and put upon her Head a Garland, which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Women wear till they have brought forth a
Son, being till then look'd upon as Maidens. At
laſt, ſhe is conducted into the Room, where the
Nuptial Bed is prepared, and being forced, not
without ſome Blows, to undreſs her ſelf, ſhe is
thrown by the reſt into the Bed, and let to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Bridegroom. But after an Hour, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
they refreſh themſelves in Bed with a Cup
of good Liquor, and a Diſh of Stones of Kids or
young Bears, which they believe to contain a great

They dreſs the Corps of their deceaſed Friends
in their beſt Cloaths, with Shooes and Stockins, and
having ſet it up-right in a Chair, the next Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
making a Ring about it, drink very heartily;
When the Liquor is out, they begin to lament their
Deceaſed Friend. <hi>Alas!</hi> ſay they, <hi>Why wouldſt
thou die? Didſt thou want either Victuals or Drink?
Why wouldſt thou die then? Alas! Hadſt thou not a
Handſom Wife? Why wouldſt thou die then?</hi> Thus
running through every Particular thing poſſeſſed by
the Deceaſed in his Life-time, they ask in the ſame
manner; and conclude, <hi>Why wouldſt thou die?</hi> They
are very careful to furniſh them with Needle and
Threed, when they are laid in their Coffins, and
with ſome Bread and a Bottle of Liquor. When
the Corps is carried out to the Burying-place, the
Relations on Horſeback, ſurround the Hearſe or
Waggon in which it is plac'd, and with their Swords
drawn, ſtrike in the Air croſs-ways, crying out
aloud, <hi>Away you Demons to the infernal Places of
Darkneſs.</hi> At laſt, whilſt the Corps is putting into
the Ground, they throw ſome Money after it into
the Grave. The Widdow Mourns for forty Days,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mornings and Evenings, Sun riſing and ſetting,
over her Husband's Grave; but the reſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
celebrate the Memory of the Deceaſed at
certain appointed Days, to wit, on the Third, the
Sixth, the Ninth, and Fortieth day; when, after a
certain Form of Prayers, which they mutter out
before they enter the Houſe, they invite the Soul of
the Deceaſed to come and take part with them.
Whilſt they are at Table, there is not a Word to be
ſpoken, neither do they make uſe of Knives. They
are attended by two Women, who divide the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
among the Gueſts, but alſo without Knives.
Each of the Gueſt throws ſomething of his Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,

as alſo ſome of the Liquor, under the Table,
which they believe is the Food of the Soul of the

Houſes. The <hi>Taurica Cherſoneſus</hi> is in ſome parts
full of Hills and Woods, but in others has very
fertile Plains, abounding in all ſorts of Grain, Fruit,

the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which are their Slaves.
And as for the <hi>Tartars</hi> that live without the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi>
they make not the leaſt account of it; applying

All their Riches conſiſt in their Cattle, but eſpecially

to all ſorts of Hardſhip from their Infancy; their

in cold Water, wherein a little Salt is diſſolved, to
make them hardy, and render their Bodies proof
againſt the Injuries of the Air. No ſooner are

by degrees, bring them to ſhoot with the
Bow, which they do with great Dexterity; and
at the Age of twelve or fifteen, make them go

eſpecially thoſe living abroad in Tents, uſe
no other Cloaths but a <hi>Coſaque,</hi> coming down to
their Heels, made of Sheep-Skin, with a picked

Drawers. The Men and Women are ſcarce to be
diſtinguiſh'd in their Dreſs, but that the laſt wear
often a Linnen Coif, or piece of coarſe Cloth
tyed round their Heads. The Wives of their <hi>Chans,</hi>
and other Women of Quality always wear a Veil
over their Faces when they appear in publick,
and are cloathed in Calicoes, Stuffs, and ſometimes
Silk of divers Colours; as their chief Men have
their Cloaths made of Cloth, and uſe <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
for their Horſes, which are often of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi>

Their Bow-ſtrings are made out of the Nerves of
Horſes; the Quiver covered with the Skin of the
ſame Beaſt: They make alſo the beſt Whips in the
World, our Whip-makers in <hi>Europe</hi> having hitherto
not been able to come near them in twiſting of
Whips. Beſides their Arms, they always carry
about them a Knife, which ſerves to mend their
Bridles and Saddles, if any thing happens to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs;
a Tinder-box to ſtrike Fire; and a Compaſs

ill-ſhaped, being very long and thin, with long
Manes and Tails; but what they want in Shape
they make up in Swiftneſs and Hardineſs, being in
both theſe Points together, to be preferred before
any other in the World: They commonly undergo
the Fatigue of a long days Journey without the
leaſt Food; they are continually kept abroad, both
Winter and Summer; and when they are upon an
Expedition, theſe Beaſts will live upon what they
can pick out from under the Snow, or upon the
Moſs, Bark, or ſmall Branches of Trees, or upon
any thing elſe that they light on in their Way.
Their Chief Men make uſe of <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Horſes, wear under their Coſaques Coats of Mail,
and uſe very good Equipages: Their <hi>Chan,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

               <p>When they live abroad in their Tents,<note place="margin">Their Food.</note> they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
eat Bread, inſtead of which they make uſe of
Millet. Their Ordinary Food is Horſe-fleſh, which
they boil, either alone, or with Millet, when they

Expedition they have it bak'd, and upon the

The worſt of all is, that they do not chuſe the
Youngeſt or the Fatteſt of their Horſes, but ſuch as
are either rendred unſerviceable in a March, or die
of themſelves. They don't drink Wine, as being
<hi>Mahometans;</hi> ſo that their ordinary Drink is
clear Water; and in the Winter, when the Rivers
and Springs are frozen up, they make uſe of Snow;
or ſometimes of the Broth of bak'd Horſe-fleſh,
or a certain Liquor made out of Millet. Their
Chief Officers only, drink Water, Milk, or perhaps
Hydromel and <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> and have now and then

whereas it muſt needs prove very inconvenient to

carries at leaſt two Horſes, ſome more, into this

or what Proviſion they take along with them, which
however, ſeldom amounts to any more, than a

thoſe that purſue them, as they find opportunity to
do it. This is however to be underſtood, when
they out number their Enemies, for elſe, if they
happen to be ſurpriſed, they run away full Speed,
and truſt to the Heels of their Horſes. But this is
very rarely done, they always keeping ſtrong Out-Guards
at ſome diſtance from their Camp, either

                     <hi>The</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks.</note>
we will conclude this Chapter with a ſhort
Account of their Origin, and what elſe may be found
remarkable among a barbarous multitude of People.
Thoſe that have deſcribed the <hi>Coſacks</hi> as a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Nation, have been grosſly miſtaken in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
For, before the Time of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the I.
they were no more than Volunteers or <hi>Freebuteers,</hi>
compoſed out of a wild and barbarous Rabble,
moſt of them Boors, that had left their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Neighbouring Provinces of the <hi>Poliſh Ruſſia,
Wolinia</hi> and <hi>Podolia,</hi> and had ſettled themſelves in
ſome Iſlands of the River <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> beneath <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovia,</hi>
where they lived upon Robbing and Plunder.
They were called <hi>Coſacks</hi> from their Agility (the
Word <hi>Coſa,</hi> intimating as much in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
which chiefly conſiſted in paſſing betwixt
the innumerable ſmall Iſlands, ſituate at the mouth
of the River <hi>Boriſthenes.</hi> They uſed to commit
their Piracies, for the moſt part, upon the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi>
and are ſince that time, not only become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, but alſo to <hi>Natolia</hi>
it ſelf, where they did not only plunder <hi>Trebiſond</hi>
and <hi>Sinope,</hi> but even the Suburbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
and brought back their Priſoners and Booty ſafe to
their Habitatations, in the Iſles of the <hi>Boriſthenes.</hi>
Their Cuſtom is to Cruiſe during the Summer in
the <hi>Black-Sea;</hi> but as ſoon as the Winter approaches,
theſe <hi>Freebuteers,</hi> return to the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> where
diſperſing themſelves, every one to his reſpective
Home, they before parting, appoint the Time of
their Rendezvouz againſt next Spring, in one of
theſe Iſles, near the mouth of the <hi>Boriſthenes.</hi> The
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54715:68"/>
great Exploits they had formerly done againſt the
<hi>Turks,</hi> had gain'd them no ſmall Reputation among
the <hi>Poles;</hi> therefore <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi>
and afterwards Elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
having conſidered with himſelf, that theſe <hi>Coſacks</hi>
might be of great uſe to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi>
not only againſt the Incurſions of the Neighbouring
<hi>Crim</hi> or <hi>Precopian Tartars,</hi> but alſo might ſerve as a
conſiderable Addition to the Strength of the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Army, which conſiſting for the moſt part out of
Horſe, would in effect, be rendred more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when augmented by ſo conſiderable a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Foot. It was upon this Conſideration, he
reſolved to put theſe Vagabond Soldiers into a good
Order and Diſcipline, which he effected, by
granting to them, beſides their Pay, very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Priledges, and putting them under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a General of their own, with a Power to
chuſe ſuch Officers under him, as he eſteem'd moſt
fit for Service. Having thus reduced them into one
Body, he gave them the City of <hi>Techtimoravia,</hi> with
all the Territories belonging to it, which being
ſeated upon the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> they made it their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine,
and the Reſidence of their Governour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
And, to render this Body the more Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> he joyned to this Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> (being compoſed altogether of
Foot) two thouſand Horſe, for the Maintaining of
which he allotted the fourth Part of certain Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
belonging to the Crown, from whence they
were called <hi>Quartans,</hi> and by corruption <hi>Quartians,</hi>
and were diſpoſed upon the Frontiers, moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the Incurſions of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> By this
Means that Tract of Land, which from <hi>Bar, Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavia</hi>
and <hi>Kiovia,</hi> extends it ſelf all along the <hi>Boriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi>
to the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> and is now called the <hi>Vk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi>
which was before a deſolate Country, was in
a little time fill'd with populous Cities and Towns.
As this Body has done conſiderable Services to the
Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> by maintaining its Frontiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Irruptions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ſo after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54715:69"/>
time it proved very dangerous, having ſeveral times
taken up Arms againſt the Republick. For, being
once made ſenſible of their own Strength, they refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be obedient to the Orders of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> General.</p>
               <p>Their firſt Rebellion was in the Year 1587,<note place="margin">The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their General, <hi>John Podkowa,</hi> but being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd,
he had his Head cut off. In the Year 1596,
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. King of <hi>Poland,</hi> upon Complaints
made by the <hi>Turks,</hi> forbid them to cruiſe in the
<hi>Black-Sea,</hi> which Orders they obeyed for that time,
but, ſoon after fell into the <hi>Poliſh Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania,</hi>
where they Ravaged the Country, under their
General, <hi>Nalevaiko.</hi> In vain did the King ſend his
Orders for them to retire to their Habitations, they
on the contrary, reſolved to maintain their Ground,
againſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, which was advancing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, under the Command of the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
General <hi>Zolkieuski.</hi> The Battle was fought near the
City of <hi>Bialacerkiovia,</hi> where the <hi>Coſacks</hi> had the
better of it; but <hi>Zolkieuski,</hi> as he was a Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
having weather'd the Point for that time,
ſoon after got them into the Trap, ſo that they
were forced to ſubmit, and deliver up their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>Nalevaiko,</hi> who underwent the ſame Fate as
his Predeceſſor. In the Year 1637, the <hi>Coſacks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
again, the Occaſion was thus: A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords, having Purchaſed Eſtates in the
<hi>Vkraine</hi> (the Quarter of the <hi>Coſacks)</hi> and obſerving,
that the Boors, their Vaſſals, run frequently over
to them, they were of Opinion, that their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
could never be well ſecured, as long as the
<hi>Coſacks</hi> enjoyed their Priviledges. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
repreſented them to the King, as dangerous to
the Republick, by reaſon of the great number of
Peaſants, that daily ran over to them; it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That the <hi>Poliſh</hi> General, <hi>Koniespolski,</hi> ſhould
order a Fort to be erected at a certain Point of
Land, called <hi>Kudak,</hi> where the River <hi>Zwamer</hi>
falls into the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> which for its Situation,
they had choſen as a convenient Place to bridle the
<hi>Coſacks,</hi> as being not far diſtant from the place of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54715:69"/>
their ordinary Rendezvouz. The <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who
were not ſo ſimple as not to penetrate into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the <hi>Poles,</hi> reſolved not to ſuffer the Bridle to
be put over their Heads, and having defeated Coll.
<hi>Marion,</hi> who was left there with 200 Men, to ſee the
Fort perfected, they aſſembled a conſiderable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to prevent the <hi>Poliſh</hi> General in his Deſign.
But at the very juncture of time, when they ſhould
have been moſt unanimous, great Diviſions ariſing
among the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> they revolted againſt their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<hi>Sawakonowiez,</hi> whom they Maſſacr'd, and in
his Place ſet up one <hi>Pauluck,</hi> of little Experience,
and leſs Conduct in Martial Affairs; The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
having in the mean while taken this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to put the Fort in a ſtate of Defence, they
marched out under their new General <hi>Pauluck;</hi>
but were ſurpriſed in the Plains near <hi>Korſun,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could Entrench themſelves betwixt their
Waggons, according to their Cuſtom, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſtitute of Horſe, they were eaſily Defeated

ſaved themſelves by flight, got into <hi>Borovits,</hi> but
being immediately beſieged by <hi>Potoski,</hi> and the
Place being not provided with Ammunition, they
were obliged to ſurrender their General, <hi>Pauluck,</hi>
with four more of their Principal Officers, who were
afterwards beheaded at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> notwithſtanding
their Lives were ſecured to them by the Capitulation.
It was alſo decreed at the Dyet, held at the ſame

alſo a new Body of Militia ſhould be erected in
their ſtead. But the <hi>Coſacks</hi> being not diſcouraged
at this Reſolution, reſolved alſo on their Side, to
try the utmoſt for the Recovery of their Liberty;
and after having proteſted to the <hi>Poles,</hi> that they
would remain ſteadfaſt to the Intereſt of that Crown,
provided they were maintain'd in their antient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
they fought a ſecond time with <hi>Potoski,</hi> in
the <hi>Vkraine,</hi> but with not much better Succeſs than
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54715:70"/>
before; ſo that finding their Circumſtances deſperate,
they Entrench'd themſelves on the other ſide
of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> upon the River <hi>Statcza,</hi> where,
during the ſpace of two Months, the <hi>Poles</hi> attack'd
them at ſeveral times with great Vigour, but were
as often repulſed with all the Bravery imaginable;
ſo that, finding there was no good to be done with
theſe deſperate <hi>Coſacks,</hi> they were forced to come
to a Capitulation with them, and to confirm all
their former Privileges, and to promiſe the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of their Militia upon the ſame Foot as
before, under the Command of their own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
choſen by the King. But this Capitulation was
almoſt as ſoon broken as made; For, no ſooner
had they cajoled the <hi>Coſacks</hi> out of their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Poſt, but moſt of them were either cut to
pieces or plunder'd by the <hi>Poles.</hi> Their Militia
was not re-eſtabliſh'd, but another ſet up in their
ſtead, where no <hi>Coſacks</hi> were permitted to enroll
themſelves. But ſcarce two Years were elapſed,
before the <hi>Poles</hi> had ſufficient Occaſion to repent
themſelves of this Change. For the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who
before the Reform of theſe <hi>Coſacks,</hi> never durſt ſo
much as approach theſe Frontiers, made a great Irru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
into the <hi>Vkraine,</hi> and after having ruin'd all with
Fire and Sword, in the Tertitories of <hi>Pereaſlaw, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fun,</hi>
and <hi>Wiſnowitz,</hi> return'd home with a vaſt Booty,
and a great Number of Priſoners, according to their
wonted Cuſtom. <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> therefore then King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> having duely weighed the Neceſſity there
was, to keep on foot this Body, upon which he
much relied, eſpecially at that time, when he was
likely to be engag'd in a heavy War againſt the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> effectually reſtored them to
their former Condition, having given them for
their General, one <hi>Bogdan</hi> (or <hi>Theodore) Chmielniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki.</hi>
But a great many of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conceiv'd a mortal Hatred againſt the <hi>Coſacks,</hi>
miſs'd no Opportunity of doing them what Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
they could; Among the reſt, a certain
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman, whoſe Name was <hi>Jarinski,</hi> did
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54715:70"/>
not only burn ſome Mills belonging to the General
of the <hi>Coſacks, Chmielniski;</hi> but alſo, after having
raviſh'd his Wife, killed both her and her Son.
<hi>Chmielniski,</hi> being provok'd to revenge ſo barbarous
an Affront, after having demanded Satisfaction,
which was denied him, ſtirred up his <hi>Coſacks,</hi> who
with burning, plundering, and raviſhing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
peſtered the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility; ſo that they
addreſs'd themſelves to King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> Brother
of the deceaſed King <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> deſiring him to
march againſt them in Perſon, which he having
refuſed to do, they brought together an Army of
50000 Men, but were miſerably beaten by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks;</hi>
and having a ſecond time encountred them
without the King's conſent, they received another
Overthow. To revenge this, they watch'd their
Opportunity, when <hi>Chmielniski</hi> was celebrating the
Nuptials of his Son with the Daughter of the
Prince of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> then ſurpriſed the
<hi>Coſacks,</hi> plunder'd the City, and took the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Patriarch Priſoner. The General having ſent to
the King to know whether it were done by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?
was anſwered no; but that the Nobility had
done it to revenge themſelves upon the <hi>Coſacks.
Chmielniski,</hi> being vehemently incens'd againſt the
Nobility, entred into a League with the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
and entring <hi>Poland</hi> with a vaſt Army, the King
march'd againſt him in Perſon at the Head of a
Hundred thouſand Men; The Battle was fought
near the City of <hi>Bereſtesko,</hi> on the River <hi>Ster,</hi> where
both the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were entirely routed,
though they were almoſt three to one ſtronger
than the <hi>Poles.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Chmielniski,</hi> who eſcaped after the Battle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
re-aſſembled the Remainders of his broken
Army, ſo continually haraſſed the neighbouring
Country, that the King thought it moſt convenient
to come to an Agreement with them in the Year
1651. But the moſt of the Nobility being diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the King's Proceedings, did let ſlip no
Opportunity that offered it ſelf, to affront the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54715:71"/>
                  <hi>Coſacks,</hi> but eſpecially their General <hi>Chmielniski,</hi>
which obliged them about two years after, to wit,
in the Year 1653. to join with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who
with their aſſiſtance, took in the Year nex follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City of <hi>Smolensko</hi> and <hi>Vilna;</hi> ſo, that it was
chiefly owing to their Valour, that the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
got into the Poſſeſſion of the Provinces of
<hi>Smolensko,</hi> and <hi>Severia,</hi> and the greateſt part of
the Palatinate of <hi>Kiovia,</hi> which were confirmed to
them by the Treaty of Peace, made at <hi>Oliva,</hi> in
the Year 1666. About which time the greateſt
part of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> put themſelves under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the reſt under the <hi>Turks,</hi>
whereby they opened the way to the latter into the

of the River <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> there are a great many
Rocks, lying ſo cloſe together, that they ſeem to be

               <p>When they deſcry a Ship or Gally, which they
can do at a great diſtance without being perceived
by them, their Veſſels not baring above two Foot
and an half above Water, they approach to it as
near as they think convenient, towards the Evening;
when keeping at about three or four Miles diſtance,
they take exactly notice whereabouts the Ship is,
and what Courſe it takes; About Midnight they get
to their Oars, and, with all the haſte they can,
make towards the Place where they think it moſt
likely to meet with the Ship; which being found
out, they ſurround, attack, and board it on all
ſides, ſo that it being impoſſible for one Ship to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54715:72"/>
it ſelf in the Night-time againſt ſo many, it is
ſoon taken. What Booty they meet with, either of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Cannon or Arms, or ſuch Merchandices as are
of no great Burthen, they tranſport into their Veſſels,
but the Ship they generally ſink. But as they have
the Advantage over the Ships or Gallies by Night,
ſo, if they happen to meet them by Day, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come off without bloody Noſes, they being
not in a Condition to withſtand their Cannon. It is
then their Swiftneſs ſtands them moſt in ſtead, and
they are ſecure enough from the Enemy's purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when once they approach their little Channels,
and get among the Bulruſhes. Whilſt they were

obſerv'd, that they are but very indifferent Horſemen,

to all ſorts of Fatigues and Hardſhip, very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to their Commanders, and extreamly active
and dexterous in intrenching themſelves, not only
in the ordinary Way, but alſo by making a Fence
of their Baggage-Waggons as they march along.
Theſe moving Entrenchments are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for them, when they march without Horſe in

Horſeback; their Horſes as they are exceeding ſwift,

as being peculiar to that Nation, which in
their Language, they call, <hi>Goſcheſt:</hi> Thoſe that are
attacqu'd by this Evil, loſe all upon a ſudden,
the Uſe of their Limbs, and are tortured with moſt
horrible Pains all over their Body, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
continues for a whole Year; after which, a
Sweat coming, which continues for a whole Night;
but eſpecially in the Head, their Hair is the next
Morning all twiſted together into one knotty Lock,
which has a very nauſeous Smell, (from whence
ſome attribute the firſt Uſe of Hair-Powder, to
the <hi>Poles)</hi> but in a few days after, they are cured
both of their Lameneſs and Pain, but the Knot and
the Smell remain for ever; for if they cut it off,
the Remnants of the Humour, which purges it ſelf
that way through the Pores of the Head, falls upon
the Eyes, and makes them blind. This Diſtemper
is as familiar in <hi>Poland,</hi> as the Itch in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and what is worſe, is very Infectious; It is
ſometimes, like the Venereal Diſeaſe, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Coition; there having been Inſtances, that
Children have brought this Diſtemper with them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54715:74"/>
into the World, but as they grow up, it decreaſes
by degrees, and never returns afterwards. It is
look'd upon among them as incurable, except it be
by changing the Air, which muſt be done by going
into another Country: The Cauſe of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſeems to proceed from the great quantity of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenical</hi>
Mines, which are in <hi>Poland,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their poyſonous quality to the Waters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to their Body; which ſeems the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
becauſe abundance of their Horſes are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the ſame Diſtemper, and have ſuch a
Knot either in their Manes or foretop, of which, if
there be the leaſt part cut off, the Horſe either dies,
runs mad, or becomes blind and lame; I have been
very credibly inform'd, that tho' the <hi>Poles</hi> look upon
this Evil as incurable, ſeveral Foreigners travelling
in thoſe Parts have cured it with good Succeſs, by
the ſame Method and Remedies, which are made
uſe of in the Venereal Diſtemper; which ſeems
ſufficiently probable for ſeveral Reaſons, not to be

In the Winter they let them hang down, ſo

their ill Deſigns; for when they intend to rob
or cudgel any body, they hide in them their Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Daggers. Perſons of Quality have theſe
Robes of Sattin, Damask, or Cloth of Gold; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
wear them of Violet, or dark green Colour,

People, of a coarſe dark-colour'd Cloth, ſuch as is

to their ſeveral Qualities; but the Poor
People are contented with Sheep-Skin, which tho'
very convenient for keeping off the Cold, yet caſts
out a Smell that is very offenſive to the Noſtrils.
Theſe Robes they wear only when they go abroad,
over all the reſt of their Cloaths, and are as to their
Faſhion the ſame with thoſe kept in the Grand
Duke's Wardrobe, for the Uſe of his <hi>Boyars,</hi> by
whom he is attended at publick Ceremonies. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this they wear a cloſe Coat, and under that a
Waſtcoat. The cloſe Coat is called <hi>Feres,</hi> which
comes down to the Calf of their Legs, open before,
with a very broad Collar falling down upon the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54715:76"/>
Shoulders, with Gold or Silver Loop-Buttons, nay,
ſometimes Embroidery from the top to the bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and on the ſide. The Sleeves like thoſe of their
Upper Garments, being as long as the Coat it ſelf,
but very Narrow. The Waſtcoats which they call
<hi>Kaftan,</hi> comes down to their Knees, the Sleeves are
likewiſe ſo long that they cannot thruſt out their
Hands without making Folds upon the Arm; The
Collars of theſe Waſtcoats are almoſt like thoſe of
the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> but much higher, covering the hinder
part of the Head, about half a quarter of a Yard
high. Theſe Waſtcoats, as well as the Juſtelau-Corps,
are made either of Callico, Taffata, Damask, or
Sattin, according to the ſeveral Qualities and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of thoſe that wear them. And becauſe the
Collar of the Waſtcoat, is, by reaſon of its Height,
very conſpicuous, they either line it with Velvet, or
Cloth of Gold, and ſometimes adorn it with Pearls
and precious Stones. Their Breeches are pretty
large, and gathered at the Waſte, ſo that they may be
made ſtreighter and wider as they pleaſe. Their Shirts
which they wear over their Drawers or Breeches,
girded under the Navel, are very wide, but ſhort,
ſcarce covering their Thighs; they are not gathered
at the Neck like ours, but ſtrengthned behind by a
triangular Piece, which comes down from the
ſhoulders to the Reins, and is ſow'd down with
Crimſon Silk; thoſe that are more curious than the
reſt, have little Fringes of Silk of the ſame Colour in
the Seams, and under their Arm-pits. The Vanity of
the richer Sort reaches yet further; for they have
their Neck and Wriſt-bands, and where it is open at
the Breaſt, embroider'd with Silk, Gold and Silver,
and ſometimes with Pearls and precious Stones; and
they leave open their Waſtcoats before, that the
Embroidery and the Buttons of Gold, or Pearls, which
faſten the Shirt before, may be ſeen. The <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
wear no Hats, but, inſtead of them, Caps or
Bonnets, with a little Snip open before and behind,
to the form almoſt of a Pyramid, but not ſo much
peaked, near half an Ell high. The <hi>Boyars</hi> when
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54715:76"/>
they are preſent at any Publick Ceremonies have
them of black Fox-Skins or Sables; but when they
are abſent from Court, or in their Houſes, they
wear them of Velvet lined with theſe Furrs, with
narrow Brims (moſt like the <hi>Polonian</hi> Bonnets,
which are worn by moſt Strangers in <hi>Muſcovy)</hi> and
laid over with Gold and Silver Loops, or embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
on the Sides with Pearl. The Poor People
wear in the Summer, White Felt or Cloth Caps,
patch'd together out of Shreds of Cloth, it being
very dear in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> of ſeveral Colours, which
in a manner reſemble a <hi>Jack Pudding</hi>'s Cap, which
they line with the vileſt ſort of Fur they can get,
in the Winter; They are not near ſo convenient as
our Hats; for having no Brims, they don't afford
the ſame protection againſt the Sun, Wind, or foul
Weather. Their Boots, which generally they wear
inſtead of Shooes, are ſhort like thoſe worn by the
<hi>Polanders,</hi> and piked towards the Toes. But the
poor Peaſant is his own Shoomaker; his Shooes he
makes of the Bark of a Tree wrought very thin,
and interwoven after the manner of Wicker-basket;
ſo that it is true beyond Contradiction, that no
Country in the World has ſuch a Number of Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
as <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> As for Stockings they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regarded, among theſe poor Wretches, a piece
of Sheep-Skin or Cloth wrapt about their Legs and
tied faſt with a Packthread, ſupplies the defect of
them; the reſt of their Garments, which are of
the coarſeſt Canvaſs, being ſuitable to their Shooes and
Stockings. Perſons of the firſt Rank ſhave their
Heads, except when they are under ſome Diſgrace
with the Grand Czar, when they let their Hair grow
and hang careleſly over their Shoulders, as a Token
of their Affliction, in imitation of the Antient
<hi>Greeks.</hi> Thoſe of a lower Condition keep their
Hair cut ſhort; but the Prieſts wear it very long,
hanging down to the middle of their Backs. There
is no great difference betwixt the Mens Habits and
the Women; There is no ſtrife here for the Breeches,
for the Wife wears them as well as the Husband,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54715:77"/>
as they do in all other reſpects wear the ſame with
the Men. Their Robes are the ſame but ſomething
wider, and the Sleeves are not ſo cloſely faſtned to
them, but that they either may keep in or put out
their Arms at pleaſure, and let the Sleeves hang by;
The richer Sort lay them all over with very thick
Gold and Silver Lace, or trim them Button and
Loop Faſhion. They don't uſe theſe High Collars,
which the Men eſteem as a ſingular Ornament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that their Smock Sleeves are prodigiouſly long,
generally four or five Ells, which they pleat in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Folds upon the Arm; and the Heels of their
Shooes are half a quarter of a Yard high. The
main difference is in their Head-dreſs. For they
wear very wide Caps or Coifs of Damask or Sattin,
made after a very fantaſtical Way; the Hair of the Caſters
wherewith they are lined covering all the Forehead,
the outſide being ſometimes very richly embroider'd.
Maids that are marriageable wear them of Cloth
lined with Fox-Skin, and let their Hair hang down
their Backs in two Treſſes, which they tye at the
End with a piece of Crimſon Silk Ribband; but
the married Women put up their Hair under their
Caps or Coifs. Children under the Age of Ten
Years are not to be diſtinguiſhed in their Habits;
both Boys and Girls have their Hair cut cloſe to
their Heads, except two ſhort Locks almoſt like
Muſtachio's, which are left to cover the Temples;
only the Girls wear Rings of Gold, Silver or Braſs
in their Ears. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> keep very conſtant
to the ſame Faſhion; it being rarely to be ſeen
that any of them make uſe of a Foreign Dreſs
unleſs it be ſometimes a Perſon of Quality, who
taking a particular Fancy to Strangers, perhaps
makes uſe of their Faſhion when he goes in the
Country, or a Hunting. Formerly all Foreigners
of what Degree ſoever, uſed to go in <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
Habits, till about fifty Years ago, the Patriarch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obſerved ſome of them to ridicule their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
when he gave the Benediction to the People,
prevail'd with the Grand Czar to forbid all Strangers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54715:77"/>
living in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to appear for the future in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi>
Habits; but of late Years, they Cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
again after the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Faſhion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are of a middle Seize as to their
Stature, ſtrong proportioned, of the ſame colour as
the other <hi>Europaeans</hi> in the Northern Parts. But they
much affect Corpulency, eſpecially among Perſons
of Quality. Long Beards, and great Muſtachio's
are in great requeſt among them, which they look
upon as tokens of Virility. So that a large Belly and
a great deal of Hair about the Mouth (for upon
their Heads they were little or none) are conſidered
here as peculiar Ornaments belonging to a
Man.</p>
               <p>The Women in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are of a midling Stature,<note place="margin">Muſcovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Women.</hi>
                  </note>
neither too tall nor too little, and generally well
proportion'd before they are married, but after
they have had ſeveral Children, inclining to Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by reaſon they do not keep their Bodies ſo
ſtreight as our Ladies in theſe Parts, it being look'd
upon rather as a Comelineſs than an Imperfection.
The Features of their Faces are not deſpiſable, and
a great many among them might paſs for very
Handſom in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> were it not for that
prepoſterous Cuſtom received among all the Women
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> of what Age or degree ſoever, of
Painting their Faces, Necks and Hands. The worſt
of all is, that having not attained to any kind of
Perfection in this Art, they paint ſo grosſly, that it
appears no otherwiſe than if it had been done by a
Plaiſterer; and notwithſtanding this; whereas in other
places, Women make uſe of it as an Addition to their
Beauty, or a Concealment of their Deformity, a
great many of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Ladies, may very well
be ſaid, to uſe it as a Veil to their Beauty; Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
being ſo univerſally approved in this Country
that the Bridegrooms, among other Preſents, ſend
it to their Brides, as we ſhall ſee anon, before we
conclude this Chapther. Beſides which, they have
another Cuſtom, which will perhaps appear as odd
as the former; which is, that they are as careful,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54715:78"/>
and take as much pains in making their Teeth black,
as our Ladies do in keeping of them white, they
eſteeming black Teeth an addition to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
with the ſame Intention, as our Ladies
make uſe of Patches. I am apt to believe, that
their Teeth being generally ſpoil'd by their Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Paints, has obliged them to make a Vertue of
neceſſity, and by an univerſal Agreement, to cry
that up for an Ornament, which appears to us the
greateſt Deformity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are a People of great Wit,<note place="margin">Their Manners.</note> Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Dexterity, not wanting Ingenuity in any
thing they undertake, as has been ſufficiently expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
by thoſe, who have had the Opportunity to
deal with them, either by way of Commerce or
otherwiſe; but they are withal, exceedingly proud,
jealous and inſolent; beſides that, they are addicted
to Drunkenneſs beyond any other Nation in the
World. They generally boaſt to be deſcended from
the antient <hi>Greeks,</hi> but to confeſs the Truth, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
was firſt beholding to <hi>Graecia</hi> for their Literature,
and Civilization; ſo it may rationally be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the want of Converſation with the more
civilized part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the general Antipathy
they have againſt thoſe Arts and Sciences, which
render'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſo famous in former Ages, has
made the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to appear ſo different
in their Manners and Cuſtoms, from moſt of the
other <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations. This will ſeem the more
probable, if it be taken into conſideration, that
within theſe 30 or 40 Years laſt paſt, ſince which
time, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have had more frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with Foreigners than formerly; and that
Encouragement has been given of late Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the laying the Foundation of ſeveral uſeful
Sciences; it muſt be acknowledged that they made
conſiderable Improvements as to ſeveral Matters
which formerly were odious, if not unſupportable
to civilized Strangers. They are accounted to be very
malicious in their Inclinations to one another. It
uſed to be a common Practice among them, for one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54715:78"/>
to convey into another's Boots (when they carry their
Mony and Letters) either ſome Mony or other valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Things, and afterwards accuſe the Party of Theft;
to obviate this Evil, it was thought moſt expedient,
that it ſhould be Enacted, for the Accuſer to endure
the Torture firſt; and if while he was thus tortured,
did perſiſt in his Accuſation, the accuſed Perſon was
alſo to endure the ſame. Notwithſtanding this,
there have not been wanting Examples, that even
Wives have accuſed their Husbands, and (that
falſely) of moſt enormous Crimes, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
the utmoſt violence of the Torture, to the
Deſtruction of them.</p>
               <p>It is to the want of Education that muſt be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,<note place="margin">Their Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs.</note>
their Quarrelſomneſs, and Inſolences, being

according to their unbridled Appetites, unleſs
it be ſome Perſons of the firſt Rank, who by their
Converſation, having been made ſenſible of theſe
Errors, manage themſelves with much more Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
For the reſt, who have not had the ſame
Advantage, they do not ſhew the leaſt Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
to one another, unleſs it be upon the ſcore of

               <p>This occaſions frequent Quarrels among them, ſo
that even in the open Streets, you may hear them
Rail at and Abuſe one another, like Fiſh-Women,
and that with ſuch Animoſity in outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that a Stranger would think it impoſſible they
could part without Fighting. They have one good
Quality, which is, that they ſeldom or never ſwear,
blaſpheme, or curſe in their Anger; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, they uſe the moſt horrible and reviling
Expreſſions, accuſing one another of <hi>Sodomy, Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,</hi>
and all other enormous Crimes they can think
of, and that very often, without any reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
nay, even betwixt Parents and Children. The
Government being ſenſible of the ill conſequences
of theſe Inſolences, uſed to ſend the Strelitzes and
Sergeants about to ſurpriſe ſome of theſe Offenders,
but the Evil was found ſo deeply and univerſally
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54715:79"/>
rooted, that in a ſhort time, they would have
wanted hands to execute the Puniſhments, which
was Whipping. So, that for the Security of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality, it was Ordered, That if any one
of them ſhould be thus affronted, the Offender to
be obliged to pay a Fine (which they call <hi>Biſceſtia,</hi>
and at the moſt amounts to 500 <hi>l.</hi> Sterl.) according
to the reſpective Quality of the Perſons injur'd.
And the better to keep in Awe thoſe that had
little or nothing to loſe, ſuch, as were incapable
to pay the Fine, were to be put into their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary's
hands, who either might make them their
Slaves, or elſe have them ſeverely whipt by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,
whoſe place is, (to mention it here by the
by) Herditary; ſo, that the Sons ſerve their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip
in their Father's Houſe. Notwithſtanding
all theſe Precautions, this Fine is frequently paid,
even among People of very good Faſhion, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who do not forbear, upon the leaſt Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to call one another Sons of Whores, Dogs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which however is generally made up over a
large Cup of Aqua Vitae, for they ſeldom come to
Fighting, or if they do, when their Spirits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
by the Strength of the Liquor, it is done with
their Fiſts, or Switches, or a Cudgel, or perhaps by
ſoundly kicking one another about the Belly, for
in the heighth of their Rage, they are ſure to aim
at the Codpiece; this being the utmoſt extent of
their Bravery in private Quarrels. For, a Man may
live a conſiderable time in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and not hear as
much as mentioned a Dewel with Sword or Piſtol,
fought by <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as it is practiſed in other

Bravery and Courage to depend from theſe
Weapons.'Tis true, Perſons of great Quality, to

fight on Horſe-back, but their Weapon is a good

They were formerly ſo fond of Ignorance, that
for any one to apply himſelf to the Study of any
Art, Science, or foreign Language, much more
to enquire into the State of Affairs of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
or Diſcourſe of it, was look'd upon as a

It muſt be confeſs'd, that it is no where more
univerſal, than among the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> when the Clergy
as well as the Laity, the Women as well as the Men,
young and old, of what Quality or Degree ſoever,
have their ſhare in it. <hi>Tzarkowino</hi> (for ſo they term
their <hi>Aqua Vitae)</hi> is the firſt welcom they give to
their Gueſts, even among People of the beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
whether Men or Women, which goes merrily
round, before, at, and after Meals; Wine being a
Liquor too weak for their Stomachs. The Ladies
of Quality themſelves, at their <hi>Poctivats,</hi> or great
Entertainments, make themſelves ſo heartily mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with it, that they are ſenſible of it the next day.
It is for this reaſon, the Lady of the Feaſt, ſends
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54715:80"/>
the next day, one of her Gentlemen to Compliment
her Gueſts, to enquire after their Healths, and
how their Ladiſhips got home, and how they reſted;

are not the only People in the World, which

very ſame is practiſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Maſter or
the Miſtreſs of the Feaſt, as well as the Gueſts do
not think the Entertainment compleat, if they go
home without Staggering. And as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Ladies, it is poſſible their merry
Meetings may meet with a favourable Conſtruction
from ſuch of our Ladies, as prefer the Charms of
Diſtill'd Waters, before Wine. Beſides, that the
fair Sex in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> have a ſtrong Plea to Alledge in
their own Defence: For as much as the great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Fiſh they eat on their Faſt-days, which make
up above half the Year, requires certain Digeſtives
to attenuate the Viſcoſity of this Dyet; and, that,
the merry Cup makes them, in ſome meaſure an
Amends for the ſolitary Life they lead at Home,
under the moſt rigid Diſcipline of their Hurbands,
of which, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more
hereafter. On the other hand, it is moſt certain,
that the meaner Sort of People commit intolerable
exceſſes in this kind; for they will drink not only
till they can neither ſtand nor go, but oftentimes
till they die upon the Spot. To ſpend every <hi>Cope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others in <hi>Europe;</hi> but nothing is more frequent in
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> among the vulgar Sort, than to come
away without their Cloaths, nay, it often happens,
that if they come away with their Waſtcoats on,
and meet one of their drunken Companions by the
way, they return, and ſend thus, Stockins, Waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat,
Shirts and Drawers, after the reſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

that there is no Miſchief ſo great, no Vice ſo
abominable, but what is committed by theſe Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
who, even when ſober, very ſeldom act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the dictates of Reaſon. Hence it is,
that ſo many Murthers are committed in the Streets
of the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> ſo that it is unſafe to go
alone, or unarm'd in the Night-time, there
being ſometimes fifteen dead Bodies to be ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Court of <hi>Semskay,</hi> a place where
they are expoſed, that their Friends and Kindred
may take care for their Burial. If no body owns
them, they are thrown ſome where or another in a

Diſorders and Exceſſes in Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
even to ſin againſt the Courſe of Nature, not
only with Men, but alſo with Beaſts. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the meaner Sort, tho' otherwiſe kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a very ſtrict Diſcipline, will often find out
their Husbands at the Tippling-Houſe, and drink
with them to that Exceſs, till they can neither
ſtand nor go, and are obliged to lay down among
them at the Tippling-Houſe. Several of the
Great Dukes have attempted to put a ſtop to this
Evil, by ordering ſuch Publick-houſes as were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
of by their Authority, to ſell their Liquor
only by certain Meaſures at a time; but this prov'd
ineffectual, the Neighbours meeting by turns at
their own Houſes, where they play'd the ſame

               <p>Formerly Tobacco was as extravagantly taken,<note place="margin">Tobacco forbidden.</note>

Year 1634, under very rigorous Puniſhments;
to wit: For the Tranſgreſſors to have their Noſtrils

is of late Years more frequently uſed, than ever it
was before ſince the time of the Edict, the Search
being not now ſo ſtrict againſt the Takers, nor the
Puniſhment ſo rigorouſly executed. Foreigners
having the Liberty to uſe it, makes the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
often venture upon it in their Company; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo eager of Tobacco, that the moſt ordinary
Sort, which formerly coſt not above 9 or 10 Pence
<hi>per</hi> Pound in <hi>England,</hi> they will buy at the rate of
fourteen or fifteen Shillings; and, if they want
Money, they will truck their Cloaths for it, to the
very Shirt. They take it after a moſt beaſtly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
inſtead of Pipes, they have an Engine made
of a Cows-horn, in the middle of which, there is
a Hole, where they place the Veſſel that holds the
Tobacco. The Veſſel is commonly made of Wood,
pretty wide, and indifferently deep; which, when
they have fill'd with Tobacco, they put Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Horn to temper the Smoak. They common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
light their Pipe with a Firebrand, ſucking the
Smoak through the Horn with ſo much Greedineſs,
that they empty the Pipe at two or three Sucks;
when they whiff it out of the Mouth, their riſes
ſuch a Cloud, that it hides both their Faces and the
Standers by. Being debarr'd from the conſtant uſe
of it, they fall down drunk, and inſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after, for half a quarter of an Hour,
when the Tobacco having had its Operation, they
lep up in an inſtant, more brisk and lively than

defending of Places; which they will maintain to
the utmoſt extremity; I will only alledge here for
an Inſtance, the Siege of <hi>Noteburgh,</hi> where the

example of their Reſolution may be given in
the Siege of the Abby of <hi>Paedis</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi> where
they were reduced to ſuch Extremity for want of
Proviſions, before they would Capitulate, that they
were no longer able to ſtand upon their Legs, or to

that they are very ſeldom allow'd to go abroad,
when they do, they are always covered with a

This is done in the open Streets, where certain
Boys keep theſe Swingers for that purpoſe, and
have two, three, or four Pence for ſuch a merry
Bout. The Young Men at their Feſtivals, for their
Paſs-time, play at Fiſty-cuffs or Cudgels; ſome

Fornication is look'd upon among them as a ſlender
Treſpaſs; and though they don't permit Publick
Stews, yet they are not very backward in doing
one another a Kindneſs, eſpecially when they are
Fluſh'd with good Liquor. They don't count it
Adultery, for married People to have ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
with one another in the ſame manner as
we do in theſe Parts; Adultery is not committed
here, unleſs a Man marry another Man's Wife; all
the reſt comes within the Compaſs of bare Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;

which is in moſt other Countries of <hi>Europe.</hi> As
for their Warlike Muſick they have Kettle-Drums

But their Hautboys which the Infantry make uſe

the Venereal Act with a great deal of Gravity

Croſs which is hang'd about her Neck when ſhe
is Chriſtned; and they are ſo conſiderate in their
Love-Paſſion, as firſt to cover the Images of their
Saints, if there be any in the Room. For the reſt,
their chief Penance for Treſpaſſes of this Nature is
Bathing, which they alſo make uſe of, not only
at other times, but eſpecially at their Marriages,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54715:83"/>
after their firſt Coition. All <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> of what
Degree or Condition ſoever, ſleep after Dinner,
ſo that about Noon the Shops are ſhut up, and there
is no more ſpeaking with any Body than if it were
about Midnight. Both Bathng and Sleeping after
Dinner is ſo general a Cuſtom in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> that
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> who perſonated the Son of the Czar

with Furnaces, which they heat exceedingly, and
for the better Excitation of Vapours, frequently
caſt cold Water upon this Stove. There are Bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
all round about at ſome Diſtance one above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
differing in degrees of Heat, which are
choſen by every one according to his own Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.
Upon one of theſe Benches they lay
themſelves at full length, ſtark naked, and after
they have ſweat as long as they think it convenient
by the Help of theſe hot Vapours, they are well
waſh'd with warm Water, and well rubb'd with
Handfuls of Herbs. After which they aften take a
Dram of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and ſo go their ways. But
what is moſt admirable, is, that when they find the
Heat too intenſe, both Men and Women will run
out of the Stoves ſtark naked, either ſtraitways
into cold Water, or cauſe it to be pour'd upon
them, nay, in the Winter, they will wallow in the
Snow. There is ſcarce a Town or conſiderable
Village in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> which has not ſome of them;
People of Quality have their private ones; and
thoſe of the <hi>Germans</hi> that live in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> out-do

which they look upon here as a Matter of no great
Conſequence, though either Sex has nothing elſe to
hide their privy Parts but a Handful of Herbs
moiſtned in Water, which a great many don't

are the univerſal Remedies of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> not
only for cleanſing their Bodies, but alſo for the
Preſervation of their Health, which being thus from
their Infancy inur'd to the greateſt Extremities of
Heat and Cold, makes them to be of a very ſtrong and
healthy Conſtitution, and for the generality long
liv'd, and very ſeldom troubled with any Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
which if they are, their <hi>Panacea</hi> is a hearty

high Fever, they not knowing of any other Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but what is wrought thro' the Pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Thus they live, for the moſt part, without
Phyſicians, and many of them without Diſeaſes;
yet, ſince the laſt Wars with the <hi>Poles,</hi> they have alſo
made a very intimate Acquaintance with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Diſeaſe, which, in ſo cold a Climate as theirs,
ſticks very cloſe to them; eſpecially, ſince it may
rationally be believ'd that Phyſick does not appear
here in its utmoſt Perfection; tho' it be undeniable,
that Phyſick and Phyſicians have, for many Years
paſt been highly eſteem'd by the Czar and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>Their Way of Saluting is by putting off their
Caps; and if they intend to pay a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Reverence, they decline their Head very low
towards the Ground, without moving their Feet.
The Women uſe the ſame Way of Saluting, only
that they bow very ſlowly, letting their Hands

he brings to him his Wife attir'd in her beſt
Apparel, to ſalute her with a Kiſs. Your ordinary
Citizens, or Peaſants, when they appear before
their Magiſtrates or the Nobility, bow to the very
Ground, proſtrating themſelves and beating their
Foreheads to the Ground; The ſame Reverence is
paid to the Czar, even by the greateſt Men in the
Kingdom. This extraordinary Reſpect paid by
the Commonalty to the Nobles makes them appear
ſo extreamly haughty and jealous of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that Strangers, tho' of the firſt Quality, rarely
meet with that Civility they might reaſonably claim
according to their reſpective Stations, unleſs it be
from ſome who are acquainted with the Cuſtoms of
Foreign Countries.</p>
               <p>They begin their Day at the riſing of the Sun,

as ſoon as the Sun is down, and ends when it
riſes. Their Year they begin on the firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
becauſe they uſe no other Epoche than from
the Creation of the World, which they ſuppoſe
was in Autumn. And whereas we account from
the Creation of the World to the Nativity of Chriſt
Three thouſand, Nine hundred, and Sixty nine
Years; they following the Footſteps of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
reckon Five thouſand, Five hundred, and Eight.
So that in the Year 1697, they reckon in <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
7209 Years from the Creation of the World,
whilſt we account but 5720. They ſolemnize
their New-year's Day with great Proceſſions in all
the conſiderable Towns of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>

               <p>Their manner of Travelling is extreamly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
eſpecially in the Winter, when their
Sleds glide away on the ſurface of the Ice or Snow
in a flat Country, with incredible Swiftneſs, and
very little Inconveniency to the Horſes, ſo that
they will travel 50 or 60 Miles a day. Theſe Sleds
are made of the Bark of the Linden-tree, fitted to
the length and breadth of a Man; they line them
with ſome thick Felt, and when a Man is laid in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54715:85"/>
them along, he is covered and wrapt up over Head
and Ears in good Furs: The Carter runs, for the
moſt part, by the Sled, to warm himſelf, and
ſometimes ſits at the Feet of the Perſon that rides
in the Sleds, where he is ſure to comfort himſelf
with a Drachm of the Bottle. Theſe Sleds being
very low built, if they happen to over-turn, are
not very dangerous. The Ladies Sleds, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
on all ſides, in the Faſhion of a Coach, are
much higher and heavier, and therefore more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.
Whilſt they travel thus, the Time is paſt
away, for the moſt part, with Sleeping, the eaſie
and inſenſible motion favouring the Repoſe of the
Traveller. When they happen to paſs through De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts
and great Foreſts, where they are obliged to
remain all Night in the open Air, they kindle a great
Fire, and round about it range their Sleds; ſo, that
being well clos'd up on all ſides, and covered
all over with Furs, they ſleep more commodiouſly,
than in a Country Cottage, where Men and Beaſts
being all together lodged in one Room, greatly
diſturb a Man's reſt. In the Summer they travel
either by Water upon the Rivers, wherewith this
Country is ſtor'd every where, or elſe by Land, on
Horſeback, by Coach or Waggon, the Roads in
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> being very broad, beautiful and eaſie for
Travelling. By Water they make uſe of certain little
Boats, made all of one Piece, of the Trunk of a
Tree made hollow, in which they ſtand upright,
and row over the Lakes and Rivers. Theſe Boats
being very light, a Man goes a great way in them in
a little time; but they have this Inonvenience, that
if not exactly counterpoiz'd, they ſoon turn over.
They have alſo certain Floating Bridges, made of
pieces of Firr joyn'd together, which bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up upon the Water. The greateſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in Travelling here is, that in the Country
there are no Inns or Houſes of Entertainment for
Travellers, ſo that they are obliged to carry along
with them what Proviſions and other Neceſſaries
they ſtand in need of. Beſides that, the violent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54715:85"/>
Heat in the Summer, and the prodigious quantities
of Flyes, are very troubleſome, and interrupt the
Pleaſure which a Stranger elſe might take in the
Beauty and Variety of their Foreſts, Brooks and
Lakes.</p>

fill the Prieſt a Glaſs with Red Wine, which he
takes off, and the Married Couple having pledg'd
him, by drinking it off, each of them, three times;
the Bridegroom throws down the Glaſs, and both
of them treading it to pieces under their Feet,
pronounce theſe Words: <hi>May they thus fall at our
Feet, and be trod to pieces, who ſhall go about to

there preſent, caſt ſome Flax-ſeed and Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed
at the young Couple, wiſhing them much Joy
and Proſperity, and pulling the Bride by her Robe
(as if they would pull her away from her Husband)
but ſhe keeps very cloſe to him, and renders their
Endeavours fruitleſs; Then, by the Light of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Torches or Wax-Candles, they all return to
the Bridegroom's Houſe, where the Wedding is

Bridegroom and the Gueſts, ſit down at a Table
ready furniſh'd with all ſorts of Meat; but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
carry the Bride up ſtrait-ways to her Chamber,
where having pull'd off her Cloaths, ſhe is put to
Bed immediately. This done, the Bridegroom is
call'd away from the Table, and conducted by ſix
or eight young Lads with Torches (which they
ſtick into the Barrels of Wheat or Barley) into
the Chamber. As ſoon as the Bride perceives the
Bridegroom to approach, ſhe goes out of Bed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with her Night-Gown on, meets and receives
him with a very ſubmiſſive Reverence, with a low
Inclination of the Head; in the mean while, that
the new Husband takes this Opportunity to gaze
at her, this being commonly the firſt time that he
ſees her Face. Thus they ſit down together, like
Man and Wife (for it is to be conſidered, they are
not much addicted to Compliment) and among
other Diſhes, a roaſted Fowl is ſerved up, which
the Bridegroom pulls aſunder, caſting over his
Shoulders that Part which firſt comes off, whether
Leg or Wing, the reſt they eat; and, all being
withdrawn (unleſs it be one old Female Servant,
that keeps Watch at the Chamber-door) to work
they go, without any further Preamble, while
their Kindred and Friends are buſie in certain
Charms, which they believe to be of very great
Conſequence, either for fortifying the Codpiece,
or at leaſt in defending it from Witchcraft, which
they are ſorely afraid of (eſpecially People of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)

both in tying and unravelling the Codpiece Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The old Female that ſtands Centry at the Door,
asks ſome time after, whether the Battle be won;
and as ſoon as the Bridegroom anſwers, that it is,
ſhe gives the Signal to the Trumpets, who make an

Water, Hydromel and Wine, and the Bride ſends
the Bridegroom a fine Shirt, embroidered at the
Neck and Wriſts, and a rich Habit. The two next
Days are ſpent in Entertainments, and all ſorts of
Divertiſements, but eſpecially in Drinking, where
the Ladies ſometimes improve the Opportunity of
their Husbands being drunk, to carry on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
this being the only Convenient time to
make their Advantage of, inſpite of all the Rigour
of their jealous Husbands.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of leſs Quality are Married with leſs Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.
The Night before the Wedding, the
young Man ſends to his intended Bride ſome
Cloaths, a Cabinet with ſome Jewels, a Comb,
and a Looking-Glaſs. The next Day the Prieſt is
ſent for, who comes with a Silver Croſs, and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given his Benediction to the whole Company,
the young Couple are ſet at the Table with a piece
of Taffeta between them; but whilſt the <hi>Suacha</hi>
dreſſes the Brides Head, a Looking-Glaſs is brought,
and the young Couple joining their Cheeks, look,
and ſmile upon one another in the Glaſs; in the mean
while, Hops are caſt upon them, and ſo they are
led to Church, where the Ceremonies are the ſame
as we have mentioned before. The Bridegroom is led
home by young Lads, and the Bride by ſome grave
Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons and the <hi>Suacha,</hi> the Prieſt leading the Van
with his Croſs; at home they are received by a
Quire of Boys and Girls, ſinging <hi>Epithalamiums</hi> or
Nuptial Songs, but of the coarſeſt ſort of Bawdry;
and being afterwards conducted to their Nuptial
Bed, the <hi>Suacha</hi> is very careful in exhorting the
Bride to be <hi>Debonair</hi> and <hi>Buxom,</hi> and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
not to deceive the Bride in her Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
In the Interim, ſhe ſtands at the Chamber-Door,
in expectation when the buſineſs is over;
which being done, ſhe carries the Tokens of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,
with a great deal of Joy to her Parents, and
the next day or two are ſpent in Feaſting and other
Jollities, which the Bridegroom endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54715:88"/>
his loſt Spirits out of the <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> Cup, and
the Bride appears very chearful among her new
Friends, this being commonly the laſt Day of
Mirth for the poor Woman, unleſs what happy
Minutes ſhe can get by Stealth, at her Husband's
drunken Hours. To ſpeak without Partiality,
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> may well be called the Purgatory of the
Women, they being kept under ſo rigorous a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
by their Husbands, that in ſome Places
Slaves be treated with much leſs Severity:
For, it is not ſufficient, that by their Eccleſiaſtical
Conſtitutions they are debarr'd from Venery two
Days in a Week, <hi>viz. Mondays</hi> and <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi>
beſides, in Lent, and ſome other Faſtings, which
make up near Eight Months in the Year; but Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinency
from their Wives and <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> is the
chief Penance laid upon the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Husbands by
their Prieſts; ſo that the Wife bearing the ſame Share
with her Husband for his Treſpaſſes, labours under
ſuch Hardſhips as would ſeem intolerable in other
Countries. If a married Woman happens to grant
a Friend in a Corner Kindneſs, ſhe is ſure, beſides the
Houſe-Diſcipline, to be ſent into a Monaſtery,
where ſhe is to ſtay all her Life-time. The worſt
of it is, that this Severity often furniſhes a Husband,
with a Pretence upon the leaſt Surmiſe, to rid
himſelf of his Wife, by ſuborning of Witneſſes,
a thing frequently practis'd in thoſe Parts. If a
married Woman happen to have no Children by
her Husband, he has the Liberty of Perſwading,
and if that be not prevailing enough, of Cudgel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her into a Monaſtery, where ſhe muſt tarry all
her Life-time, for what, perhaps, was none of her
Fault, but the Husbands, who has the Liberty of
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rrying again in ſix Weeks. But this is not all,
if the Husband is taken with a Fit of Devotion
(whether real or pretended, it matters not) of
leaving his Wife for God's ſake, as they term it,
which is as much in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when a Man is
tir'd of his Wife, and maintaining his Family, he
has the Liberty, of going into a Monaſtery,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54715:88"/>
without his Wifes Conſent, or making any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for his Children; where he has a proſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
perhaps, from a Mechanick, a Prieſt, if
his Wife marry again; this being the only Amends
the Wife has to make her ſelf, if that may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an Amends, when they are forced to
leap (according to the old Proverb) <hi>Out of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pan
into the Fire;</hi> for whenever they Marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
they are ſure to meet with the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
Houſe-Diſcipline, which is the Cudgel and the
Whip. It is ſo general a Cuſtom in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> for a
Husband to chaſtiſe his Wife with the Whip, that
the Outcry's of a Woman upon ſuch an Occaſion,
are no more regarded, than we do a Correction
given to Children. They often uſed to tye them
up, ſtark naked, by the Hair of the Head, and ſo
to whip them as long as they were able; Nay, there
have not been wanting Examples of Husband's
whipping their Wives to Death, upon Suſpicion of
Adultery, without as much as being call'd to an
Account for it, they pretending to be exempt from
Puniſhment on the account of killing a Wife or
Slave, if it happen upon Correction. This barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Cuſtom has of late Years, however, been
much alter'd, if not quite aboliſhed, among Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Faſhion, by the prudent Care of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who now a-days, to mitigate at leaſt the
Slavery of their Daughters, oblige their Husbands
in their Jointures, under conſiderable Forfeitures,
to find them with Cloaths, ſuitable to their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to feed them with good wholeſom Meat, and
Drink, to uſe them kindly without Whipping,
Striking or Kicking; but theſe Contracts, as all
others, are ſometimes kept, ſometimes broken, the
General Cuſtom being a ſtrong Plea on the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
ſide; the beſt Comfort the poor Women have,
is that their Neighbours and Friends receive the ſame
Treatment. I know it has been alledged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Houſe-Diſcipline, that the
Women here have very lewd Tongues, will drink
a merry Cup of ſtrong Liquor, and upon an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54715:89"/>
not refuſe a Kindneſs to a Friend; but grant
this to be true, if the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> according to the
laudable Examples of other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi>
would give their Children of both Sexes a more
generous Education, the Husbands would ſhew
better Example and more Complaiſance to their
Wives; theſe Means would prove, without all
queſtion, more effectual than all their Whips and
Cudgels.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns their Oeconomy and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of their Houſes in general,<note place="margin">Their Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy.</note> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that it bears not the leaſt compariſon with
what is uſual in theſe Parts; for the inferior Sort
live in wooden Houſes, very low, and meanly
built, their Houſhold Stuff conſiſting commonly
in two or three Pots, and a few wooden or earthen
Diſhes. Some of the richer Sort make uſe of
Pewter, but what they have of it is very ill kept,
as is moſt of their other Furniture, the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
not making the leaſt account of Cleanlineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as for Plate, there is ſcarce any thing like it to
be ſeen, unleſs it be ſome few drinking Cups and
Goblets. Their Rooms, at the beſt are hung with
Mats, and adorned with two or three Images, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Faſhion. As for their
Sleeping, they ſtrive not only to imitate, but alſo
to out-do the antient Inhabitants of <hi>Capua;</hi> for
thoſe would not allow their Children any Beds;

not to encourage young Men in their Effoeminacy.
The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſeem to be more ſevere, the moſt
of them not uſing Beds, neither before nor after
Marriage, nor in their Old Age. A great many
even of the better Sort are contented with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes,

Summer they ſpread upon a Table, Bench, or

and the Poor meanly in their Diet; they know
no Superfluity but Drink, which they will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,

               <p>Their ordinary Drink is a ſort of ſmall <hi>Hydromel,</hi>

have moſt a mind to, for two or three Nights, in
Water, or ſometimes in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> till it has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the Colour and Taſtes of the Fruit. Into
this they put the pureſt Honey, to every Pound
three or four Pounds of Water, according as they
would have it ſtrong; Into this they put a Toaſt
dipp'd in the Dregs of Beer, which, as ſoon as
the <hi>Hydromel</hi> begins to work, they take out again.
When it has done working, they either keep it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or without the Lees, according as they either
intend to keep it or to ſpend it immediately; And
to give it a pleaſant Flavour, they put into it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a little bag of Cinnamon and Grains of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
with a few Cloves. But their main Liquor is
<hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> made out of Corn, which tho' very

with Pepper. Of this they drink a Dram before
and after Dinner, and at any other time when they
intend to make themſelves merry.</p>
               <p>Perſons of Quality, and rich Merchants, have of
late Years built themſelves Houſes of Brick and
Stone; they lie upon Beds or Quilts, have Tapeſtry
and other Hangings, and the reſt of their Houſhold-ſtuff
is ſuitable to their Quality, yet not to that
Degree of Politeneſs as is uſual in theſe Parts. As
for their Diet, they don't only uſe all ſorts of Meats
and Fowls, but eſpecially by reaſon of their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Faſts, have great Variety of Diſhes of all
ſorts of Fiſh, Herbs, and Pulſe. Among the reſt
they have one Diſh, which they make uſe of after
a drunken Bout, and has a very ſavoury Taſte. They
take cold roaſted Veal, which they mince, but not
very ſmall, with ſome pickl'd Cucumers, to this
they put good ſtore of Vinegar, Pepper, and
the Liquor of pickl'd Cucumers, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it as a good Preſervative againſt the
Head-ach ariſing from hard Drinking; foraſmuch as
they believe it diſpells the Vapours riſing into the
Head out of the Stomach. The Cellars of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality are always well furniſh'd with <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel</hi>

other ſorts of ſtrong Wines; (for the <hi>Rhiniſh</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Wines are in no great eſteem among them,
as being not ſtrong enough.) They brew their
ſtrong Beer, as we do, in <hi>March,</hi> and to keep it
cool, (their Cellars not being vaulted) during the
Heat of the Summer they make a Bed of Ice and
Snow mix'd tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon them another Bed of Ice, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
a Row of Barrels, which they cover with
Straw and Planks, which ſerves for a Vault. They
are very Splendid in their Cloaths and Equipage,
being attended by a great Number of Slaves, all
which however they do without any great Expence,
for aſmuch as what Proviſions they want for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Horſes, is brought from their Farms
in the Country; and as for thoſe Slaves they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the City, they allow them Board-Wages,
but ſo ſcantily that they can ſcarce live upon it.
This is one of the chiefeſt Cauſes that ſo many
Riots and Murthers are committed in the Streets of
the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and, that in Hay-making time
the Roads leading to this City are ſo unſafe to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
there being about that time ſo great a Number
of Slaves abroad working in the Fields. Perſons
of Quality and the richeſt Merchants in <hi>Muſco</hi>
keep for this Reaſon a Guard in their Courts, who
watch all Night, and are to knock every hour with
a Stick upon a Board,<note place="margin">Their Interr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> as many Knocks at a time
as the Clock has ſtruck Hours.</p>
               <p>They are very Ceremonious in their Interrments.
No ſooner is the ſick Perſon departed, but all the
Kindred and Friends come and ſtand about the
Body, making moſt horrid Out-cries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
They ask him, <hi>Why he would dye? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he wanted Meat and Drink? Whether he had
not a Handſom Wife?</hi> and ſuch like Queſtions.
The next thing to be taken care of, is to ſend a
Preſent to the Prieſt to pray for the Soul of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Party, which he is to do Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
for ſix Weeks, upon his Grave. For
tho' the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> do not believe Purgatory
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54715:91"/>
yet they believe two different Places, where the
Soul retires till the Day of Judgment; ſome,
they ſay, abide in a pleaſant Place, where they
enjoy the Converſation of Angels; others in a dark
Valley, where they are peſter'd with the Company
of Devils. They are of Opinion, that by the
Prayers of Prieſts and Monks, the Souls may be
delivered out of this Place of Miſery, and God's
Wrath be appeaſed againſt the Day of Judgment.
For which reaſon alſo, thoſe that are able give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Alms, during theſe ſix Weeks. Before it be
put into the Coffin, which is made out of the
Trunk of a Tree, the Body is well waſh'd, the

carrying the Image of that Saint, which had been
aſſigned the Deceaſed at his Baptiſm for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.
Him follow four Virgins, the next of Kin
to the deceaſed, who repreſent the Mourners, and
make moſt horrid Out-cries and Lamentations, all
in a Tune, not unlike the wild <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Body, carried by ſix Men upon their
Shoulders, the Kindred and Friends following the
Body without any Order, with Wax-Candles in
their Hands, whilſt the Prieſt is ſinging certain
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> they ſurround the Body, and by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes,
keep off the evil Spirits.</p>
               <p>Being come to the Grave, the Coffin is uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the ſame Saint that was carried before the
Proceſſion, is held over him; the Prieſt in the
mean while ſaying certain Prayers, and repeating
frequently theſe Words: <hi>Lord, look upon this Soul
in Righteouſneſs;</hi> and the Widow continuing (but
how heartily, is eaſie to be gueſs'd, conſidering
their Uſage) her former Lamentations: <hi>Timming
Dooſhink. Alas! My Dear, Why wouldſt thou leave
me thus?</hi> And repeating the ſame queſtions we
have mentioned before. Then the Kindred and
Friends take their laſt Farewel of the Deceaſed,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54715:92"/>
ſome kiſſing him, ſome the Coffin; and as ſoon as
the Prieſt has put a Teſtimonial between his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which is to ſerve him as a Paſs for the other
World, the Coffin is ſhut up, and put into the
Grave, with the Face towards the Eaſt. The Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
after having paid their Devotions to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
return to the Houſe, where they drown their
Sorrow in ſtrong Liquor. The Mourning is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for forty Days after, during which, the
Kindred are entertained at three ſeveral times, <hi>viz.</hi>
the third, the ninth, and twentieth Day; and
during this time of Mourning, the Prieſt reads twice
a day (as we mentioned before) the <hi>Pſalms</hi> upon
the Grave, having a little Booth made up of Mats,
to ſhelter him from the Weather. The Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
or Paſs for his Admittance into the other World
is ſigned by the Patriarch or Metropolitan of the
Place, and the Confeſſor, who ſells it according to
the Ability of thoſe that are to buy it. This Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonial
runs thus: <hi>We, whoſe Names are hereunto

received Abſolution, and taken the Communion for the
Remiſſion of his Sins. That he hath honoured God and
his Saints; that he hath not neglected his Prayers, and
hath Faſted on the Hours and Days appointed by the
Church; and that he hath always behaved himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, who am his Confeſſor, in ſuch a

               <p>THE State of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> or its Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which we are to treat in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is not only Monarchical, but alſo Deſpotical or
Abſolute; foraſmuch as the Czar being ſole and
abſolute Maſter over all his Subjects, diſpoſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Controul of their Lives and Eſtates, in the ſame
manner as in moſt antient Times did the Kings of
<hi>Aſſyria, Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> who governed their
Subjects no otherwiſe, than a Lord does his Slaves;
and as it is to this day in <hi>Turky,</hi> where the
<hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> diſpoſes of the Lives and Fortunes
of his Subjects at pleaſure. The Czars of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
poſſeſſed with ſo uncontrouled a Power, as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Sovereigns of theſe vaſt Countreys we have
given a ſhort Deſcription of in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that there is not a <hi>Knez</hi> or Lord ſo great in all
theſe vaſt Dominions, but who without Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
confeſſes, that he is his Czariſh Majeſty's <hi>Galop</hi>
or Slave. It is therefore the Czar alone, that gives
Laws to the People; it is he that diſpoſeth of the
Government of Provinces; it is he that Levies
Taxes, makes Peace and War; and to be ſhort, does
what he pleaſes. For, tho' he conſults in Matters of
Importance with his <hi>Boyars</hi> or Councellors; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that this Counſel is of his own Chuſing; he
does not always follow it, but reſerves to himſelf
the Prerogative of doing what he judges moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
The Honours of <hi>Knez, Boyars, Dukes</hi> or
<hi>Princes</hi> owe all their Origin to the Czar's Favour,
which they beſtow upon ſuch as they would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their Services; and the greateſt of them
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54715:93"/>
depend upon the Czar's meer Pleaſure, and own pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
that all they have belongs to God and Them:
Nay, formerly (within our Age) they were whipt
like the vileſt Slaves, and that ſometimes for a ſmall
matter, but of late years ſmall miſcarriages have
been puniſhed with two or three days Impriſonment.
This Slaviſh Subjection ſeems to be natural to the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> foraſmuch as in all theſe ſeveral Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that have happened there in our Age, they
have frequently changed their Maſters, but never
ſhew'd the leaſt inclination of changing the Form of
their Government, which the Sovereign Power has
devolved into their hands. The wiſer ſort among
them were perhaps ſenſible, that thoſe who are
good Slaves, make the worſt Freemen in the World;
not only their natural Inclination, but alſo their
Education, having infuſed into them the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> in ſo tranſcendent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as not to have the true Senſe of that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we enjoy in theſe Parts. This is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
out of their whole Behaviour, both in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
and private; None among them, of what
Quality ſoever approaches the Czar with a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or otherwiſe, but he names himſelf in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive.
As for inſtance, if his Name be <hi>Peter,</hi>
he will ſay, <hi>I little Peter,</hi> do implore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
they are to be admitted into his Preſence, they
ſay; <hi>Shall I have the Honour to ſee the brightneſs of
the Eyes of His Czariſh Majeſty?</hi> If you ask them
a Queſtion that ſurpaſſes their Judgment, they will
anſwer; <hi>God and the Czar knows;</hi> and nothing is
more frequent in their common Diſcourſe, than to
own, that, <hi>all what they have is at God's and the
Czar's Diſpoſal.</hi> The Great Duke, <hi>John Baſilowits,</hi>
was the firſt that reduced them to this entire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
for, when moſt of theſe Territories, now
under the Subjection of the Grand Czar of <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
were divided into a great many Principalities,
Govern'd by their own Laws and Princes, there is
no queſtion, but that the Nobility had their Share
in the Government here, as well as they had in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54715:93"/>
former Ages in moſt Countreys of <hi>Europe;</hi> and
what confirms me the more in this Opinion, is,
that at the Solemnity of the Czar's Coronation,
among other Things the <hi>Eſtates, Eccleſiaſtical and
Temporal,</hi> are mentioned by the Patriarch, as we
ſhall ſee anon. This entire Reſignation and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to the Abſolute Diſpoſal
of their Sovereign, has ever ſince been maintain'd
by three general Maxims; The firſt is, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is allow'd, upon pain of Death, to travel out
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> without leave of his Czariſh Majeſty;
The ſecond is, that the Czar never Marries a foreign
Princeſs, but looks out for a Spouſe among his
own Subjects. The third is, the Diſcouragement
of Learning and Sciences, their Knowledge, even
of the Prieſts themſelves, not reaching beyond
Reading and Writing their own Language. The
reaſon of it is obvious; for aſmuch as Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
makes people ſupple, and conduces much to
the eaſie Conſervation of what by a long Cuſtom
and Education has been implanted in them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Knowledge is merely without Ambition. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>
was not ignorant of this Maxim, when he
eſtabliſh'd Ignorance as one of the fundamental
Laws of his Republick; And the Emperours, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>
and <hi>Licinius,</hi> uſed to term Learning the
Plague and Poyſon of Sovereignty. And, that
by Travelling abroad they might not be enamour'd
with the ſweet taſte of Liberty, other Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and perhaps, by their Converſation, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in ſuch Matters, as were not to be learn'd
at home; they were not only prohibited to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
into other Countreys, but alſo Perſons of a
high Rank debarr'd from Converſing with foreign
Miniſters in their own Country, without the Great
Duke's expreſs Permiſſion. And for fear, that by
introducing a foreign Princeſs, ſome new Cuſtoms
might be introduced among the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which
in time might cauſe an Alteration in the State, the
Czars of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> (quite contrary to what is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by other Princes in <hi>Europe)</hi> always chuſe their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54715:94"/>
Spouſes among their own Subjects. The Czar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus ſecure of his Subject's entire Obedience,
he alone creates and depoſes Magiſtrates, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them to be puniſhed at Pleaſure. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
the Governours and Lieutenants of Provinces,
for the Management of the antient Demeſnes, and
the Adminiſtration of Juſtice; they have a <hi>Diack</hi>
or Secretary, and ſometimes another Aſſeſſor join'd
with them, and take Cogniſance of all Matters,
giving a final and abſolute Judgment in all Cauſes,
and have full Power to ſee their Sentences put in
Execution, without any Appeal; unleſs the Cauſe
be removed before Judgment given, to one of the
<hi>Pricas</hi> or Courts of Juſtice in <hi>Muſco.</hi> They are
changed from three years to three years.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Courts, kept by the <hi>Waywode</hi> or
Governour in the Provinces, there are a great
many others, who are all kept in the City of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
and are call'd <hi>Pricas,</hi> where always one of the
<hi>Boyars,</hi> or the Czar's Miniſters is Preſident, having
join'd with him, ſometimes one, ſometimes more
Aſſeſſors, and a <hi>Diack</hi> or Secretary.</p>
               <p>The chiefeſt are <hi>Pomieſtnoi Pricas,</hi> where a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
is kept of all Manors held by homage, and
the Sutes concerning them are adjudged, and the
Duties belonging to the Great Duke received.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Caſanskoi,</hi> and <hi>Siberskoy Pricas;</hi> all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Provinces of <hi>Caſan</hi> and <hi>Siberia,</hi> are
determined, and Accompts kept of all the Furs
coming from thence to the Great Duke.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Rosboinoy Pricas,</hi> all Robberies upon the
High-way, Murthers, and other Criminal Cauſes
are Judged.</p>
               <p>The Provinces of <hi>Gallitz</hi> and <hi>Wolodimer,</hi> have
alſo their particular <hi>Pricas,</hi> which is called <hi>Galliaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko-Volodimirski
Pricas;</hi> as <hi>Novorodkoi Pricas</hi> belongs
to <hi>Novogorod,</hi> and <hi>Niſe-novogorod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Boyars</hi> have their own <hi>Pricas,</hi>
as have alſo the Gentlemen and Officers of the
Court. The <hi>Diacks,</hi> Secretaries, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have
their own Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:54715:94"/>
In the <hi>Monaſterski Pricas,</hi> all Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whether Secular Prieſts or Monks are judged,
except it be in priviledged Caſes. Beſides which,
the Patriarch has his particular <hi>Pricas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are a great many other <hi>Pricas,</hi> or Courts of
Juſtice, as thoſe for the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Factors, for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
for the <hi>Galops</hi> or Slaves, for the Retalers of
Wine, <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> and Hydromel or Mead, for his
Smiths, Armourers, Cannoneers; For the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Officers, for the Cavalry, and many more, too
many to be deſcribed here.</p>
               <p>Beſides which, there is one general <hi>Pricas</hi> or
Court of Juſtice, where all Matters that do not
appertain to any peculiar <hi>Pricas,</hi> are determined,
this is called <hi>Siskoi Pricas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Diacks</hi> or Secretaries, Clerks, and Copiers
of theſe Courts, are very well Skill'd in Writing
and Arithmetick, the latter of which they perform
by the help of Plumb-Stones inſtead of Compters.
They keep their Regiſters in Rolls of Paper paſted
together, which being 30 or 40 Yards long, are
kept in the Offices. The <hi>Boyar,</hi> who is Preſident
of each Court, and has his Secretary and Aſſeſſors,
determines finally, all ſuch Cauſes as come under
his Cogniſance, he being the Repreſentative of his
Imperial Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Formerly moſt of theſe Cauſes depended from
the Equity of the Judge,<note place="margin">Laws of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
                  </note> there being very few
Laws eſtabliſhed then, according to which, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to be given; They only were concerning
High Treaſon, Adulteries, Thefts, and Debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
private Perſons. But in the Year 1647, a
Book was compiled in <hi>Folio,</hi> under the Title of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borna
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>loſienia,</hi> that is to ſay, Univerſal and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right, containing all the ſeveral Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
according to which, the Judges were to
regulate themſelves in the Courts of Judicature.
In Civil Caſes, they proceed thus: If there be no
ſufficient Evidence on the Plaintiff's ſide as to the
Matter of Fact alledged againſt the Defendant, the
latter is ask'd, Whether he will by his Oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54715:95"/>
the Anſwer given to the Plaintiff's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or elſe refer it to the Plaintiff's Oath. He,
who conſents to take the Oath, is brought in the
preſence of one of their Saints, where being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,
and ask'd, Whether he will take this
Oath upon the Salvation of his Soul? If he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in his Reſolution, he is obliged to kiſs a little
Croſs, and the Saint's Image. Thoſe that have
taken an Oath, tho' never ſo true, are look'd upon
as Scandalous, and are not admitted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in three Years after. For which Reaſon,
and to obviate Perjuries (which are pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
here) the Great Duke made an Edict in the
Year 1634, That all Promiſes or Obligations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Money or Pawning, tho' between Father
and Son, ſhould be put in Writing, ſign'd by both
Parties, under Forfeiture of the Debt. Perjury
is puniſhed by a ſevere Whipping and Baniſhment.
Strangers take their Oaths according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of their ſeveral Countreys and Religions.</p>
               <p>In Criminal Caſes, the Accuſed cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
altho'never ſo many Witneſſes appear againſt
him, unleſs he confeſs the Fact. To force therefore
Criminals to a Confeſſion of the truth, they make uſe
of the Torture, which has its ſeveral Degrees:
The firſt is the <hi>Strapado;</hi> when they hang the
Malefactor with his Hands tyed behind, in the
Air, having faſtned to his Feet a great Beam, upon
which the Executioner ever and anon gets up, to
further the Diſlocation of the Members, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to augment the Pain. Under his Feet is
made a Fire, which with the Smoak and Heat ſtifles
and burns him: If they don't think this ſufficient,
they ſhave his Head, and, as he is thus hanging,
drop gradually cold Water upon the Crown of his
Head, which is the moſt exquiſite Torment that
can be invented. Whipping in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
thus; A luſty Fellow, one of the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner's
Men after having ſtript them to the middle,
takes up one by one upon his Back (much after
the ſame manner as the Boys in <hi>England</hi> are hors'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54715:95"/>
by their Fellow-Scholars at School) and having ty'd
their Feet together with a Cord which comes thro'
the Legs of him that holds them up, is held by
another Servant of the Executioners, ſo faſt that
they are not able to ſtir. The Executioner with
a Bulls Pizzle, having faſtned to the end of it three
Straps of an Elks Skin not tann'd, lays it on their
Back with ſo much Dexterity and Strength, that at
every Laſh the Blood guſhes out on all ſides:
Heretofore theſe Puniſhments were not accounted
Infamous, and were inflicted upon Perſons of the
firſt Rank; but time has in a great meaſure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
that Error. Beſides this, they have another
Way of Chaſtiſement, which is alſo uſed in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for the Correction of Children and Slaves. He
that is to be thus corrected, after having pull'd off
his Cloaths to the Shirt and Drawers, is laid down
upon the Ground flat upon his Belly, one ſits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
his Head and Neck, another upon his Feet,
each of them furniſh'd with a good Switch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ſoundly tickle his Back, in the ſame
Manner as we beat the Duſt out of Cloaths or
Hangings. Murther is a capital Crime, unleſs no
body proſecute it; or it be that a Man kills his
Wife or Slave under Correction. He that has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a Murther, after he has been kept with
Bread and Water in cloſe Priſon, has his Head cut
off; But if a Wife kills her Husband, ſhe is put
in the Ground, alive, up to the Neck, till ſhe dies.
The Puniſhment of Coiners is, to have ſome
Metal ready melted pour'd down their Throats.
Traitors, after they have been tormented to the
higheſt Degree, are often baniſh'd into <hi>Siberia,</hi>
ſome with their Noſes and Ears cropp'd, ſome
without Eyes, ſome are put under the Ice. Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
has not been long in uſe in <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> but
what is moſt remarkable is, that the Malefactor,
moſt commonly at the Command of the Hangm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,
puts his Neck thorow the Nooſe, and turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
off, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch particular Admirers are the <hi>Ruſſians</hi>
of Paſſive Obedience. Thefts are not capital in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54715:96"/>
                  <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> but they are not ſparing in applying to
them the Torture for the Diſcovery of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices.
The firſt time, after a ſound Whipping
acroſs the Market-place, they have one Ear cut off,
and are impriſon'd for two Years; The ſecond
time they receive the ſame Puniſhment; but as an
additional Chaſtiſement, are baniſh'd into <hi>Siberia.</hi>
The Concealers and Receivers undergo the ſame
Puniſhment. Thoſe that ſell Tobacco and <hi>Aqua
vitae</hi> without Licence, have their Noſtrils ſlit, or
elſe are whipt. How they puniſh Adultery is
mentioned before. Thoſe that are uncapable of
paying their Debts, are us'd with a moſt barbarous
Severity: For if any one happen to fail of paying
at the time prefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, he is put in a Sergeant's
Houſe for ſome time, to ſee whether in the mean
time he can make Satisfaction or agree with the
Creditor. If he cannot, he is carried to Priſon,
and from thence brought every Day to a certain
Place appointed for that purpoſe, where, for a
whole Hour, the Executioner beats him with a
pretty thick Wand acroſs the Shin-bone. If he
can put in Security for his forth-coming the next
day, in order to receive the ſame Chaſtiſement, he
is permited to go home; if not, he is remanded
to Priſon, and is to undergo the ſame every day
till he has made Satisfaction; which if he cannot
do at laſt, he is to be ſold as a Slave to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
with Wife and Children; but this laſt the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
are not much concern'd at, foraſmuch as
they frequently fell themſelves and their whole
Family upon a very ſlender Account. So much are
they accuſtom'd to Slavery, that they ſcarce look
upon it as a Puniſhment. Sometimes the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
for a Preſent, will ſuffer the Debtor to put
a ſmall Iron Plate under his Boots. The ſame
Rigour is uſed, without any difference, to all of
what Quality, Condition, Sex or Age ſoever.</p>

The Metropolitans, Archbiſhops, Knez, Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,

being entred the place at the day appointed for the
Coronation of the new Czar, a Scaffold is erected
three Steps high, and covered with <hi>Perſian</hi> Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,

this Scaffold are ſet three very rich Chairs, at an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

the Great Duke, another for the Patriarch, and
the third for the Ducal Cap, embroider'd with
Pearls and Diamonds, with a Taſſel on the Crown

thy faithful Servant here preſent, who, through thy
Grace, thou haſt exalted to be King over thy People, and
thy Son hath redeemed by his Blood. Anoint him with
the Oil of Chearfulneſs, protect him by thy Power, and
Crown him with a precious Diadem; grant him a long
and happy Reign; put the Royal Scepter into his Hands,
that he may ſway it upon the Throne of Juſtice. Let
all barbarous Languages acknowledge his Power, and
let both his Heart and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding be always dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

Life, let him never recede from thy Commandments.
Let Hereſie, and Schiſm not come near his Perſon or

Church;</hi> Judge thy People in Juſtice, and ſhew thy
Mercy to the Poor, that, when they leave this Valley of

their Attendance every day at Court, and to ſmite
their Forehead in the Great Duke's Preſence, which
he looks upon as an Argument of their Fidelity and
his Security, which by their Abſence might be put
in danger, conſidering the great Authority they
have in their reſpective Provinces. They are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to appear at Court in great Splendor, to live
very Magnificiently, both in their Houſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;

The <hi>Knez, Boyars</hi> and Gentlemen, enjoy
this Prerogative as well as the Monaſteries, that
they are exempted from Taxes, but are obliged to
maintain a certain number of Soldiers, both Horſe

their Veſts of Velvet, lin'd with Sables,
their Caps adorn'd with Pearls and precious Stones,
and their Partiſans cover'd with Gold and Silver.
At the upper End of the Hall of Audience, His
Czariſh Majeſty is placed in a Throne of Maſſie
Silver, with his Scepter in his Hand, and a Crown
on his Head. The Throne is moſt curiouſly wrought,
ſtanding ſeven or eight Steps higher than the

Hall of Audience, he makes a very low Reverence,
the Throne of the Czar being exactly oppoſite to the
Door; Then advancing, and ſtopping in the midſt
of the Hall, he makes a ſecond, and when he is
ready to ſpeak, the third. The Credentials being
delivered to the Czar, (who immediately gives
them to his Chancellour that ſtands near the Throne)

and the Preſents ſent to the Czar being offered, and
the Salutes and other Ceremonies us'd upon ſuch
Occaſions paſt, the Ambaſſador is reconducted to
his Palace, where he is ſplendidly entertain'd with
a great number of Diſhes out of the Czar's Kitchen,
which in great State are carried from the Caſtle to
the Ambaſſadors Houſe. There is one thing very
remarkable in this Court in the Publick Audience
of Chriſtian Ambaſſadors, that they and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
are obliged to kiſs the Grand Czar's Hand;
which, as it is otherwiſe look'd upon as a thing
much below the Dignity of an Ambaſſador; ſo it
is conſider'd in the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Court as a particular
Favour, which is only granted to the Ambaſſadors
of Chriſtian Princes, and never permitted to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
               <p>The Revenues of the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the vaſt Extent of his Dominions.
For beſides, that he is Heir to all who die inteſtate and
without Heirs; He lays what Impoſition he thinks
convenient upon the Eſtates and Perſons of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which indeed, in times of Peace are not great;
but in times of War very exceſſive; ſo that they
pay ſometimes the <hi>Pottina,</hi> as it is call'd in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
which is the Fifth Part of every Man's Eſtate; as in
the Reign of <hi>Michael Federowitz,</hi> when the famous
Siege of <hi>Smolensko</hi> was to be undertaken, in the
Year 1632. But moſt frequently at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               </p>
               <p>The Great Duke's proper Demeſne, is always farm'd

that it maintains near a Hundred Thouſand <hi>Strelitz</hi>

Guard of his Perſon and the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> partly

Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> of all Merchandices imported or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,

               <p>The Czar is as it were the General Merchant of

as the Taverns and other Houſes where ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors

               <p>It is to be imagined, that all theſe ſeveral Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
when united, muſt needs make up a vaſt

Conſumption of all manner of Proviſions of his
Table, and the reſt of his Court, where above a

every day. His Military Expences are almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.
The vaſtneſs of his Territories obliges him to

Pay, which in time of War are ſometimes aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

betwixt them and thoſe Inhabiting the
<hi>Poliſh Ruſſia,</hi> that profeſs the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion.
The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> glory, that they are the only
True <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now in the World; foraſmuch
as they are baptized, whereas others have
been only Sprinkled, which is the Reaſon they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54715:103"/>
alledge for Re-baptizing all ſuch, of what
Perſuaſion ſoever, that embrace their Religion.
They profeſs, as they ſay, the true <hi>Greek</hi> Religion,
which makes them ſhew abundance of Reſpect and
Kindneſs to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Greek</hi> Monks
or Prieſts, which frequently come from other
parts into <hi>Muſcovy</hi> with their Relicks, know how
to make an Advantage of their Simplicity and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
They found their Religion on the Books
of the Old and New Teſtament. They are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to bring the whole Bible to Church (tho they
are allowed to read it at home) by reaſon of ſeveral
paſſages in the Old Teſtament; ſo that they only
carry the New Teſtament, and ſome certain choſen
Pſalms and Verſes taken out of the Prophets. It
is about threeſcore years ago that they got the Bible
tranſlated into the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language, wherein they
followed, as they pretend, the foot-ſteps of the
<hi>Seventy Interperters.</hi> They have alſo a certain Book,
which they call the <hi>Hiſtory of the Goſpel,</hi> but the
whole ſo adulterated with Fabulous Narrations, and
Impertinent Circumſtances, that in another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Country it would be ſo far from being look'd
upon as a Book of Devotion, that it would appear
abominable. As to the Explication of the Bible,
they follow St. <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who
flouriſh'd towards the latter end of the Fourth Age,
under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and
ought not to be confounded with <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
The reſt of the Fathers, which are in greateſt
eſteem among the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> are <hi>John Damaſcene,
Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>John Chyſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
the <hi>Syrian;</hi> of whom they relate, that an
Angel having preſented to him a Book writ in Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Characters, which no body could diſcloſe, he
immediately received thoſe Inſtructions from
thence, which he has tranſmitted in his Books to
Poſterity. They relate out of their Annals, that
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion was firſt eſtabliſhed in theſe
parts by the Apoſtle St <hi>Andrew,</hi> who leaving
<hi>Greece,</hi> came to the <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> where he embark'd,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54715:104"/>
and by the Sea of <hi>Ladoga,</hi> came to <hi>Novogorod,</hi>
where he Preach'd the Goſpel. That the Chriſtian
Religion was afterwards extirpated by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Pagans, who made themſelves Maſters of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> till in the Year 989. Prince <hi>Wolodimer,</hi>
or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lodimer,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> having given
them a ſignal Overthrow, and re-united ſeveral of
theſe Provinces to his Crown, grew ſo famous for
his great Atchievements, that <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine
Porphyrogennetae,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſent
their Ambaſſadours to Congratulate his good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
and that by the Converſation and Inſtructions
of theſe Ambaſſadors, Prince <hi>Wolodimer</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to embrace the Chriſtian Faith, and to receive
Baptiſm. <hi>John Cropalates</hi> who writ part of the
<hi>Byzantine Hiſtory,</hi> and lived much about the ſame
time, as alſo <hi>Cedren</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> chiefly attribute
the Converſion of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to a Miracle perform'd by a Biſhop that was
ſent thither by the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
and baptize the people. For, theſe Infidels
having objected to him, That, ſince God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Daniel</hi>'s Companions in the Fiery Furnace,
why might not with the ſame, or more reaſon, the
Bible be prevented by God's power, from being
conſumed by Fire? The Biſhop, after having told
them that he was aſſured he could not ask any thing
from God, which he could not obtain by his prayers,
caſt the Bible into a great Fire, made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
where having lain till the Fire was all ſpent,
it was taken out as entire and untouch'd as it was
caſt in, whereat <hi>Wolodimer</hi> being moved, aboliſh'd
all Idolatry, and in lieu thereof, planted Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in all his Territories. From hence it is, that
they deduce the Origin of their Religion from the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church, which however, they have much
alter'd ſince.</p>

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:54715:104"/>
The Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is the general Rule of
their Faith, for they believe in <hi>God the Father</hi> as
Creator of the World, in <hi>God the Son,</hi> as Saviour
and Redeemer of Mankind, and in <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
as Sanctifier of all the Faithful; but for the reſt,
they are involved in a great many Superſtitions,
and fix the Center of their Devotion, more in the
outward and Ceremonial Part, than in the Internal
Part of Religion. They pay their Venerations
to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
and an infinite number of other Saints, not only
as Interceſſors, but Co-operators of their Salvation,
for they pay to their Saints and Images all
the Honours due to none but God Almighty.

tends to no more, than to ſtand with a great deal of
Reſpect, and to ſay their Prayers before thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages;
for the reſt, they place the utmoſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their good Works (which they believe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious)
in building of Monaſteries and Churches,
and giving Alms. Thoſe who intend to change

obliged to go for ſix Weeks into ſome Monaſtery or

how to ſay their Prayers, how to reverence

               <p>The whole Exerciſe of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Religion,
may be reduced under theſe ſeveral Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
Baptiſm, Reading of the Word of God in their

Baptiſm,<note place="margin">Their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> they look upon as the moſt neceſſary
Point of Religion; they acknowledge themſelves
conceived and born in Sin, and that by Baptiſm,
they are regenerated and cleanſed, according to
God's Inſtitution, from their original Impurity.
They baptize their Children as ſoon as they are
born; and, unleſs they be too weak (when
they Baptize them at home, but never in the
ſame Room where the Mother lies) they are
carried to Church by the Godfather and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where being met at the Door by the Prieſt,
he ſigns the Child with the Sign of the Croſs in
the Forehead, and gives him the Benediction,
ſaying. <hi>The Lord preſerve thy coming in, and
thy going out.</hi> Then they walk up together to
the Font, which ſtands in the middle of
the Church, croſs which, the Prieſt faſtens nine
lighted Wax-Candles, delivered to him by the
Godfathers, whom he Incenſes, and Conſecrates
the Water with a great many Ceremonies. Then
the Proceſſion begins about the Font; the Clerk
goes before with the Image of St. <hi>John,</hi> being
followed by the Godfathers, with Wax-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
in their Hands; thus they go about it
three times, whilſt the Prieſt Reads out of a
Book. The Proceſſion being over, the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
give the Name of the Child to the
Prieſt, in Writing, upon his Demand, who
puts it upon an Image, which he holds upon
the Child's Breaſt, and after ſome ſhort Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
asks the God-fathers, Whether <hi>the Child
believes in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Having anſwer'd, Yes, they all turn their
Backs to the Font, as a Sign of their Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the three next following Queſtions,
to be asked by the Prieſt, to' wit; Whether
<hi>the Child forſakes the Devil?</hi> Whether <hi>he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
his Angels?</hi> Whether <hi>he forſakes his
Works?</hi> The Godfathers anſwering, Yes,
diſtnctly to every Queſtion, and Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
three times upon the Ground.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54715:105"/>
Then they face about again to the Font<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being asked
by the Prieſt, whether they promiſe to bring up the
Child in the true <hi>Greek</hi> Religion, they advance with
the Child nearer towards the Door (for fear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
by whom they believe Children to be poſſeſs'd
before Baptiſm, ſhould take up his Reſidence in the
Church) where he begins the Exorciſm, putting
his Hands upon, and blowing three times croſs the
Child with theſe Words: <hi>Get out of this Child thou
unclean Spirit, and make way for the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Then
returning to the Font, he cuts off a little of the
Childs Hair, which he puts into a Book, and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
asked the God-fathers, whether the Child was
brought thither to be Baptized, he takes him ſtark
Naked into his Arms, and dips him three times into
the Water, pronouncing the Words of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the mean while, <hi>viz. I Baptize thee in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghoſt.</hi> Immediately after the Baptiſm, he ſigns it
with the ſign of the Croſs on the Forehead, upon
the Hands, Breaſt and Back, with a certain Oyl
conſecrated for that purpoſe, and having put a corn
of Salt in the Child's Mouth, and a clean Shirt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

them: But theſe being of an inferiour Degree,
are not much regarded by the Laity; the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
being only obliged to ſay the Offices appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for thoſe Days.</p>
               <p>Formerly the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> made but an indifferent
Account of their Feſtivals and <hi>Sundays;</hi> for, though
they would go to Maſs in the Morning, the Shops
were open, and the Handycraft's-Man did follow
his ordinary Employment in the Afternoons; till
about Fifty Years ago, by a ſpecial Order from the
Patriarch, the Shops were ordered to be ſhut, not
only upon theſe Feſtivals and <hi>Sundays,</hi> but alſo on
their Weekly Faſting-days; to wit, on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi>
and <hi>Fridays:</hi> And that during the Time of Divine
Service, no Wine or <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> ſhould be ſold; but
this is not executed with too much Rigour; at leaſt,
they ſeldom fail to conclude them with Strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe above-mentioned Feſtivals,<note place="margin">Their Church-Service.</note> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi>
they go to Church three times a Day; firſt, in
the Morning early, to Mattens; at Noon; and in
the Evening, to Veſpers. They do not make uſe,
in their Service, of any Sermons, or Inſtructions to
their Auditors; but only read certain Paſſages out of
the Bible, and ſome Homilies: Giving for a Reaſon,
That their Faith being founded upon the pure Word
of God, it is, without any farther Explication, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to lead them into the Way of Salvation; for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54715:107"/>
as much as the divers Interpretations of the Holy
Scripture occaſion Hereſies and Diviſions in the
Church. This they lay down as ſo unalterable a
Maxim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſome of their Prieſts, who were, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
not quite ſo ignorant as the reſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to preach, and exhort the People out of the
Holy Scripture, have been excommunicated, and
baniſhed into <hi>Siberia;</hi> as it happen'd about 60 Years
ago, to a certain Proto-Pope of <hi>Morum,</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
Their whole Service therefore conſiſts in
the Reading of certain Chapters out of the Bible,
ſome Pſalms, and St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed: Sometimes
they add an Homily out of St. <hi>Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtom,</hi> or certain
Prayers, or rather Anthems; ſung much after the
ſame manner as the <hi>Antiphona's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The general Morning-Anthems are,</hi> Deliver me, O
Lord, of thy abundant Mercy: For thy Mercy's ſake,
cleanſe me from my Sins; O Lord, my Saviour. <hi>This
is for the Mattens, or Morning-Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At Noon-Prayers, this Anthem is uſed, amongſt
others;</hi> We trust in Christ, our Saviour; and our Hope
is in him: Halleluja; Halleluja.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That for the Veſpers, is;</hi> Lord, hear my Prayer,
and hear me when I call; and let my Cry come unto
thee.</p>
               <p>At the Concluſion of theſe, or any other of their
Anthems, the People repeat three times (making
every time the Sign of the Croſs) their <hi>Goſpodi Pomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lui;</hi>
or, <hi>Lord, have Mercy upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, the Prieſt, attended by the Clerk,
goes up to the Altar, where he ſays the Office, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Liturgy of St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> He pours Red
Wine and Water (in Imitation of the Blood and
Water that came out of our Saviour's Side) into the
Chalice, with ſome little Bits of Leaven'd Bread;
and after having conſecrated them, and ſaid ſeveral
Prayers, he takes out the Bread with a Spoon, but
gives nothing of it to any body, unleſs it be to ſome
ſick Child, brought thither on purpoſe to receive the
Communion according to the Inſtitution of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite</hi>
Church. They are all bare in the Church,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54715:108"/>
even the Great Duke himſelf. The People ſtand all
the Service-time, and inceſſantly bow and pay their
Reverences to the Images, frequently pronouncing
<hi>Goſpodi Pomilui</hi> or <hi>Lord have Mercy upon me.</hi> The

when they fall proſtrate upon Sycamore-Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
wherewith their Churches are ſtrewed; being
perſwaded that the Holy Ghoſt deſcends upon theſe
Leaves. The Prieſts only have the Liberty of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their Caps, which are given them at their
Conſecration. But if a Prieſt have known his Wife,
if he have touched a dead Corps, or been at a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
he is not to offici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but is obliged to ſubſtitute another in his Place.
The moſt Devout keep at a diſtance, not entring the
Church, but perform their Devotion at the Door,
among the Women: The fair Sex (as if they were
not ſufficiently diſciplined at home) having this, as
an additional Mortification, enjoined them, that
they muſt keep at a diſtance at Church; eſpecially
if they have chanced to take the Husband in a good
Humour, and enjoyed lately the Pleaſures of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
In which Caſe alſo the Man is confined to
the Church-door, unleſs he have, after having had
Knowledge of his Wife, waſhed and bathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and put on a clean Shirt. If the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

Hundred, or more, Scavengers have cleared the Way
through which the Proceſſion is to paſs, there firſt
comes a very large Chariot, moſt like a Pageant,
drawn by ſix Horſes; in which is placed a Tree,
garniſhed with abundance of Apples, Figs and
Grapes, which are faſten'd to the Branches: Round
about it are placed four or five Lads, with Surpliſſes,

they come quite to the Church, there is a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
erected on the Right Hand as you go to it, railed
in all about; before which are planted two great
Pieces of Cannon, whereof the Bore is near half an
Ell Diameter. The Grand Duke and Patriarch,
without admitting any body elſe, being got within
the Rails, upon the Theatre, the Patriarch preſents
to the Great Duke a certain Image, painted upon a
piece of Paſt-board which folds together in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
not unlike a Book, and is enriched with Silver
at the four Corners; to which the <hi>Czar</hi> makes a very
low Reverence, touching it with his Forehead, whilſt
the Prieſts without the Rails are muttering over cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Prayers, appointed for that Solemnity. This
done, the Patriarch preſents to him a Golden Croſs,
beſet with Diamonds, of about a Foot in length;
which, after the Great Duke has kiſſed, the Patriarch
touches his Forehead and Temples with it; and ſo
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54715:110"/>
to Church they go, where the Service is performed,
and the Solemnity ended for that Day.</p>
               <p>With no leſs Solemnity they celebrate their <hi>New-Years-Day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their New-Years-Day.</note>
which is the firſt of <hi>September;</hi> they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other Epache but that of the Creation of the
World, as we have mentioned before. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
is performed in the Caſtle, where a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of the People are permitted to partake of
the Benediction given them by the Patriarch. He,
attended by three or four Hundred Prieſts, carrying
Banners, Images, Croſſes, and Books, comes out of
the Church, which is on the Right Hand of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Court of the Caſtle, while the Great Duke with
his <hi>Knez, Bojares,</hi> and other Officers of his Court,
comes out on the Left Hand of the ſame Court. The
Grand Duke with his Cap in his Hand, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
with his Mitre on his Head, and a Croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with Diamonds a Foot long in his Hand, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to one another, the Patriarch preſents the Croſs
to the Great Duke to kiſs; which he having done
with a moſt profound Reſpect, the Patriarch gives
his Benediction firſt to the Czar, and afterwards to
all the reſt there preſent, wiſhing them all Proſperity
in the New Year.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns their Images,<note place="margin">Their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> they ſuffer not
any that are Carved or Graven, either in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or Houſes; becauſe, ſay they, theſe are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the Decalogue; but their Images are painted
with Oil upon Wood. The beſt of all is, That they
will not admit of any painted by Foreigners, though
done by the greateſt Maſters of <hi>Europe;</hi> but they
muſt be painted by one of their own Religion: So
that for Colour, Painting, and Proportion they are
the moſt wretched in the whole World, being about
a Foot in Breadth, and not quite a Foot and a half
in length. There is in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> as we have
mentioned in the Second Chapter, a certain Street
appointed for the Sale of theſe Images; though a
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> will never own to have bought his Saint:
For which reaſon, when any one of them has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
an Image in the God-market, he depoſits Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54715:110"/>
for the Exchange of it; if the Saint-maker
thinks it not ſufficient, he ſhoves it back, and the
other Party is obliged to add more to it, till both
Parties are contented. They will own, that during
the firſt Centuries, even till the Time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the Great, Images were not uſed in the Church; or,
if they were, no Worſhip was paid them. They
alledge that they follow in this Point the Authority
and Opinion of <hi>John Damaſcene,</hi> though it is more
likely they have taken them from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church.
The Walls of their Churches are every where full
of them, as they are the chief Ornaments of their
Houſes, every Family having its Saint with a ſmall
Wax-Candle before it, which they light when they
pay their Devotion. Over the Porch of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
in the Market-places, and over the Gates of
their Cities you are ſure to meet with the Picture of
ſome Saint or another, but eſpecially with that of
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Patron of
<hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Images the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> reſpect,<note place="margin">Their Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Saints.</note> and look
upon as things ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that without
them they could not perform their Devotion. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as they addreſs their Prayers to them, they ſet
Wax Candles before that Saint to whom they intend
to make their Addreſſes; and after they have made
moſt profound Inclinations with their Heads, they
frequently make the Sign of the Croſs with three Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of their Right Hand, touching firſt the Forehead,
next the Breaſt, laſtly the Right Shoulder, and the
Left after that. They conceive in this way of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves a great deal of Myſtery; for, they
ſay, the Three Fingers ſignifie the Trinity; by
their putting them to their Forehead, they would
ſhew that Chriſt is aſcended into Heaven; by
croſſing the Breaſt, that God ought to be reverenced
and loved with all our Heart. But as to making
the Sign of the Croſs from the Right Shoulder to the
Left, they intend to ſignifie the Day of Judgment;
foraſmuch as it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſhall place the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
on his Right Hand, to be called to Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54715:111"/>
and the wicked on the Left, to be thrown into the
Abyſs of Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they paſs by any of their Images in the Street,
they make a ſtand for a while before them, till they
have made their Reverence four or five times one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, which is done by croſſing themſelves,
and pronouncing with a loud Voice their <hi>Goſpodi Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milui,</hi>
or <hi>God have mercy upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They addreſs themſelves with the ſame Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſuch Croſſes as they meet with in their way,<note place="margin">Their Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note>
where they are frequently obſerved to ſtop, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the ſame Ejaculations. The firſt, nay, the only
thing Parents teach their Children, is, to make their
Reverences and Inclinations to the Images, to make
the Sign of the Croſs, and to ſay the <hi>Goſpodi Pomilui,</hi>
or <hi>God have mercy upon me.</hi> The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> don't
undertake any thing, nor Eating nor Drinking, or
whatever elſe it may be, without making firſt the Sign
of the Croſs, which may well be called the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to all the Civil Actions of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tutelar Saints of private Houſes have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Stations aſſign'd them in a Corner behind the
Table. Whenever a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> comes into a Houſe,
the firſt thing he does is to go ſtraightways to the Saint
of the Houſe; if he cannot find him, he asks, <hi>Jeſt le
Boch,</hi> or <hi>Where is the God?</hi> After he has found him
out, he pays his Reverence to him, ſaying his <hi>Goſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
Pomilui,</hi> or <hi>Lord have mercy upon me;</hi> and then
turns about and ſalutes the Company. If they are to
take a merry turn with a Woman in the Room where
the Saint is, they are ſure to cover him firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
fear he ſhould tell tales. They will not allow Strangers
to touch them, or for any Body to ſleep in the ſame
Room, with their Feet towards them; nay, ſome are
ſo nice, as to purifie the Chamber with Incenſe, if any
Strangers of another Religion have lodged in it.</p>
               <p>They will hold their Images to the Fire, believing
they have a Power to extinguiſh it if they pleaſe.
The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Soldiers, who in the Year 1610. had
taken and burnt the City of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> when they
ſaw the Inhabitants preſenting their Images to ſtay
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54715:111"/>
the Progreſs of the Flames, being convinced of their
Fondneſs to them, and not finding any thing elſe in
their Houſes worth taking, carried away their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> afterwards redeemed at a
very good Rate. In time of Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſtrive, before all
other things, to ſave their Images; but if they, or
a Church happen to be burnt, they would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as a great Diſgrace to ſay the Saint or Church is
burnt; but they ſay, They are aſcended. When the
Image is become obliterate or rotten, they either bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it with a great deal of Ceremony, or elſe (which
is the general way) throw it into ſome River, and
commit it to the Chance of the Current; at parting
they croſs themſelves, and cry, <hi>Proſti, Farewel.</hi> Perſons
of great Fortunes or Quality adorn their Saints with
Pearls or precious Stones; but theſe Demy-Gods
are ſo tenacious of what they have once got into their
Clutches, that they will never part with any of it
again to the Owners, though never ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There are not wanting Examples, that, upon a pinch,
ſome have made bold to borrow of their Saints againſt
their Will, what formerly was their own, who have
paid for it with the loſs of both their Hands. If any
one is excommunicated, his Saint, as well as his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is excluded from the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Monks and Prieſts,<note place="margin">Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> as ignorant as
they are in other matters, have been cunning enough
not to deſpoil the Saints of the Art of doing Miracles.
At <hi>Archangel</hi> there was once a Gang of them, who, by
ſuch Impoſtures, had got a conſiderable Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
together; but falling out among themſelves
when they were dividing the Spoil, the Fraud was
diſcovered, and ſo had a good Whipping for their
pains. It muſt be owned, there are but few Inſtances
of this nature among the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> they being elſe
too zealous to call in queſtion the Omnipotency of
their Saints, whom they believe to have at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Divinity in them. In the Year 1643. an
old Image had began to change Colour, and to turn
a little reddiſh. This was immediately cry'd up
not only for a Miracle, but rather for an ill Omen,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:54715:112"/>
or ſome Bloody Preſage, to that Degree, that the
Great Duke and the Patriarch being frightned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
as well as the People, preparations were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for an extrordinary Faſt-day, and publick
Prayers to be made all over the Kingdom; but ſome
of the <hi>Bojares</hi> having thought it convenient to call
together all the Painters about the City, they
brought in their Verdict: That they believed there
was nothing ominous in the matter, foraſmuch as
they were aſſured, that time having conſumed the
Paint, had only diſcovered the colour of the Wood,
which was Red: Among others of their miraculous
Saints, they have two of a late Date; the Name of
the firſt was, <hi>Sudatworets Philip Metropolite,</hi> he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Reign of that famous Tyrant, <hi>John Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovits,</hi>
unto whom he uſed conſtantly to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
of his wicked Life and Cruelties, till
the Great Duke not able any longer to endure his
Reprehenſions, cauſed him to be ſlain by one of his
Servants; ſince which time he has been reckoned
among their Holy Martyrs, and been famous for
the Miracles they have attributed to him, which
were formerly performed at <hi>Archangle,</hi> near which
he was Buried in the Iſle of <hi>Solofka</hi> in the <hi>White Sea,</hi>
but has been ſince from thence tranſlated to the City
of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and placed in the great Church of the
Caſtle; where for ſome time he did moſt ſurpriſing
Miracles, by healing the Dumb, Deaf, Blind, Agues,
and Paraliticks: But of late Years, it ſeems, the
Saint is grown Weary of his Profeſſion of Phyſick,
though they affirm, that his Body remains entire
to this day, which is not eaſie to be diſproved, ſince
it is forbidden upon pain of Death, to lift up the
Cloath which covers the Body of the Saint.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, and the topping Saint of all <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
for Miracles, is one <hi>Sergius,</hi> whoſe Reſidence was
in the Monaſtery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> about threeſcore Miles
diſtant from the City of <hi>Muſco.</hi> This Saint as it
ſeems, was in his younger Days, a Military Perſon
of a very graceful Aſpect, but having taken a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte
at that Profeſſion, and abandoned his vicious
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54715:112"/>
courſe of Life, turn'd firſt <hi>Hermite,</hi> and afterwards
got into the Monaſtery of <hi>Troitza,</hi> which from his
Name, ever ſince his Burial there, has been called
<hi>Zergeofski Troitza,</hi> it being formerly Dedicated to the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> where being ſoon after choſen Abbot, he,
and one of his Diſciples, called <hi>Nikon,</hi> grew ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the many Miracles they performed, that
they were both Canonized after their Death, which
hapned in the Year 1563. Their Heads, as they
ſay, do not only remain entire to this day, but alſo
that of <hi>Sergius</hi> (if one may believe them) has not
loſt its Military Operation; for, when this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
was Beſieged by the <hi>Poles,</hi> the Head of <hi>Sergius</hi>
only forced them to raiſe the Siege, having cauſed
them to turn their Arms againſt themſelves, during
the Aſſault: 'Tis true, this Monaſtery was Beſieged
by the <hi>Poles,</hi> under their General <hi>John Sapicha,</hi> who
was forced to abandon the Enterpize, and thus far
the <hi>Monks</hi> are in the right of it, but they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
in the true circumſtances of the matter; for,
aſmuch as it was not the Head of their Saint, or
their own Bravery, put the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army that oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Poles,</hi> to raiſe the Siege: But they are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to examine Miracles with ſo much nicety here;
for notwithſtanding this, the Great Dukes goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
generally twice a Year to do their Devotion,
and when they come at two Miles diſtance from
the Monaſtery, alight from their Horſes, walking
the reſt of the way on foot. Having performed their
Devotion, they ſpend ſome days in Hunting, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, the Abbot entertains the Great
Duke, and his whole Retinue. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
perform here their Vows of going on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and beſtowing their Alms, made perhaps
in their Travels or Sickneſs, which with the Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Great Dukes, has encreaſed the Revenues
of this Monaſtery to that Degree, that it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of the Richeſt and the moſt Beautiful in all
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and maintains a great number of Monks.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a Church Dedicated to the Holy
Mother of <hi>Caſan,</hi> whither many Pilgrimages which are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54715:113"/>
made by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as alſo to <hi>Chutina,</hi> about
Eight Miles diſtant from <hi>Novogorod,</hi> to the Sepulchre
of one of their Saints, called <hi>Werlam,</hi> who being
Born at <hi>Novogorod,</hi> was Buried near the ſaid Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of <hi>Chutina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Eve of the Pentecoſt they perform certain a
naual Devotions in Memory of their departed
Friends, with a great deal of Formality, but in a
manner very Ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of their Churches which are of Stone,<note place="margin">Their Churches.</note> are
all round and Vaulted, becauſe, they ſay, they have
thus a nearer reſemblance to Heaven, which is the
Throne of God. Theſe have in the midſt of four
Turrets, a Tower form'd at the Top, not unlike the
Knobs we put on our Bedſteads, having upon it a
Triple Croſs: This is to repreſent our Saviour, as
the head of the Church, and the Croſs being the
Badge of Chriſtianity, they think fit, the Church of
Chriſt ſhould be diſtinguiſh'd by it from others.
Within are neither Seats nor Benches, becauſe none
ſit down, but all perform their Devotions, either
ſtanding, or proſtrating themſelves. They don't
make uſe of Organs, or any other Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in their Churches, being perſwaded, that things
inanimate, cannot glorifie God. They believe their
Churches profaned by the Entrance of any Stranger
that is not of the ſame Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore they
are not admitted, and as ſoon as Diſcovered, thruſt
out. But if a Dog chances to come into the Church,
they firſt ſweep, and afterwards purifie it with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
and Holy Water; they alſo ſhew a great deal
of reſpect for their Church-yards.</p>
               <p>Their Bells are not hung in Steeples like ours,<note place="margin">Their B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Bells, but to the Clapper, and they faſten
two of theſe Ropes to both Arms near the Elbows,
and two more to both hands of a Man, ſo that one
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54715:113"/>
ſingle Perſon may make a Chiming, in which the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> take extraordinary delight, tho' it ſounds
but very indifferently to thoſe that are uſed to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
they Toll them at the beginning of Services,
and at the Elevation of the Chalice; for, the Bread
being put in immediately after the Conſecration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wine, they make but one Elevation; they
reckon the Chiming of Bells ſo eſſential a part of
Divine Service, that they believe it to be imperfect
without it.</p>
               <p>If there be any Religion in the World that obliges
its Profeſſors to a moſt ſevere Mortification,<note place="margin">Their Feaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> it is
certainly the <hi>Muſcovian;</hi> for as if it were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to have enjoyned the keeping of two conſtant
Faſt-days in the Week, to wit, the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and
<hi>Friday,</hi> and the Eves before Holy Days, when they
are obliged to abſtain ſo ſtrictly from all kind of
Fleſh, that they muſt not make uſe of Eggs and
Milk, they have four Lents every Year: The long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them is like ours of ſeven Weeks; the ſecond
begins Eight Days after the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and laſts till
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day; the third holds from the firſt of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
to the Sixteenth of the ſame Month; and the
fourth from the twelfth of <hi>November</hi> till <hi>Chriſtmaſs
Day.</hi> During all theſe Lents, they eat neither But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor Eggs, nor Milk, much leſs Fleſh, unleſs it
be in the firſt Week of the long Lent, which being
their Carnaval, they have liberty for all manner of
exceſſes, except Fiſh. In this Week, their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances
are almoſt paſt belief, and as if this time
was alloted them as a preparative to their Faſtings,
they commit ſuch Debauches in double diſtilled
Brandies and melted Butter, which they pour down
their Throats, that they are all kindled in a Flame,
and if they are not immediately quenched with Milk,
they die upon the Spot. Woe, to any Stranger that
meets theſe Drunkards at Night, without being well
guarded, their Inſolencies being ſo great, that with
Fightings, Quarrels and Murthers, commonly Forty
or more Perſons are Murthered in a Night, during
this Week; not to reckon thoſe, who being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54715:114"/>
with Liquors, and wanting Attendance to
carry them Home, fell down upon the Snow, and
ſo are Frozen to Death. It is a moſt diſmal Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
to behold perhaps Ten or a Dozen of theſe in
the Morning, carried upright in a Sledge, Frozen
to Death, ſome having their Faces Gnawed, others
their Arms eaten off by Dogs, others to have nothing
left but the bare Bones; and yet theſe are the daily
Objects one meets with in the Streets of <hi>Muſco,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this time of Debauchery. All the attonement
they make for theſe Enormities, is, That the next
Week after they live upon Honey, Herbs and Pulſe,
and Drink only Quus, or ſmall Mead, and Water;
and to cleanſe themſelves from the Impurities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in theſe exceſſive Debauches, they dont for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to viſit the Bath-ſtoves. The reſt of the Lent,
they live pretty Temporately, and ſome of the moſt
Devout will not eat Fiſh all that time, unleſs it be on
<hi>Sundays:</hi> But as they are very exact in obſerving
theſe ſtrict Rules in <hi>Lent,</hi> ſo it is a very difficult task
to perſwade them to eat Fiſh on <hi>Sundays</hi> or <hi>Holy Days</hi>
out of <hi>Lent,</hi> being of Opinion, that the Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in the Tomes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
Printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> according to which, Laymen
that Faſt on <hi>Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays,</hi> ought to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
are moſt conſonant to the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Inſtitution. By the ſame Rule that forbids them
to eat Fleſh, they are alſo enjoyned not to meddle
with Women on their Faſt-days, and during their
<hi>Lent;</hi> if the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſhould ſend abroad any Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
I am apt to believe they would make but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few Proſelites in theſe parts. There are ſome who
alledge, that theſe frequent Feaſts have been Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> rather upon a Political than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
account, to wit, for the preſervation of their
Cattle; foraſmuch as the Peaſants, being all Slaves
here, dont take the ſame care for the propagating
and preſerving their Cattle, as they do in other parts,
where they enjoy the Fruits of their own labour;
and that the long Winters in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> renders the
keeping of the Cattle both very troubleſome and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54715:114"/>
chargeable, whereas they abound in the beſt Fiſh in
the World, which are ſold at a very cheap rate all
over <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>

               <p>All thoſe that are arrived to the Age of Diſcretion,<note place="margin">Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note>
are obliged to go to Confeſſſion, before they receive
the Communion. Their Confeſſion they make
ſtanding before one of their Images, on which having

all their Sins, expreſſing their Sorrow for every one
of them in particular, and promiſing Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

more than ordinary expiation, the Prieſt is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
of his own Intereſt; for, in this caſe, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
them to make uſe of the Holy Water, which
is Conſecrated on <hi>Twelfth-Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to cleanſe Sinners of
their Sins, and is diſpoſed of for that purpoſe by the
Prieſts, not without a good Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> receive the Communion
upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve,<note place="margin">Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> or at leaſt upon a Faſting Day;
foraſmuch as if they ſhould Communicate on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
they muſt not eat Fleſh that day. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themſelves for it, by an extraordinary Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
a Week before, when they eat nothing but
hard Bread, and drink nothing but <hi>Quus,</hi> worſe
than our ſmall Bear, or Water. They Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in both kinds, unleſs it be Children under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years old, at which Age, as ſoon as they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
they are admitted to Communicate both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at that Age (as they ſay) they begin to ſin
mortally. They mix warm Water with Wine,
which (according to the Counſel of <hi>Conſtantinople)</hi>
repreſents the Water that came forth with the Blood
from the ſide of our Saviour; the Bread, which muſt
be Leavened and Baked by a Prieſt's Widow, they
put in the Wine, taking out a Morſal, together with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54715:115"/>
ſome of the Wine in a Spoon. The Communion
Bread for ſick Perſons is about twice as big, and
ſomewhat thicker than a Crown Piece, and hath
in the middle the ſign of the Crucifix. This figure
(after it is Conſecrated) the Prieſt takes off with
an Inſtrument, not unlike a Launcet, and puts it up
in a wooden Box, hanging above the Altar, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it from Rats and Mice. If a ſick Perſon is to
receive the Communion, they take a little of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they put a few drops of Red Wine, and a
little Water in the Chalice, which they give to the
ſick Perſon with a Spoon; if the ſick Perſon be not
capable of ſwallowing the Bread, they give him only
a little Wine. In the ordinary Adminiſtration of
the Sacrament, they make uſe of the ſame ſort of
conſecrated Bread, but not bigger than half a Crown,
from which they alſo take the Crucifix, and break it
into as many pieces, as there are Communicants,
which they caſt into Red Wine, and mix it with a
little warm Water, and ſo Adminiſter with a Spoon:
What remains of the Bread, after Conſecration, is
called <hi>Kutja,</hi> or Holy Bread, of which the Prieſt
gives a Morſel to each of thoſe, who have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
the Week before. At the Adminiſtring
of the Sacrament, the Prieſt ſays theſe Words:
<hi>This is the true Body, and the true Blood of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, which hath been given for thee, and for
many more, for the remiſſion of thy ſins, which thou
ſhalt take in remembrance of him, God bleſs thee:</hi> There
have been ſome who from theſe Words have drawn
this inference, as if the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> believed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
againſt which ſeveral pregnant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
may be alledged to the contrary. For, if you
Diſcourſe the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> concerning the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that belief, they will not refuſe to own it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
nay, abſur'd and ridiculous, neither do
they call to their aid (as the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> do)
God's Omnipotency. Beſides that they dont pay
Adoration to this Myſtery, which doubtleſs they
would do in a Religion ſo Zealous and Superſtitious
as theirs, were they of the ſame Opinion, as to this
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54715:115"/>
point, with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> Sick Children,
though never ſo Young, receive the Communion,
but in one kind, till they are ſeven Years Old, when
they Communicate like the reſt, as we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before. They do not refuſe the Communion to
Madmen, but they only touch their Lips with the
Bread dip'd before in the Wine. A Woman in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
is not to Communicate in the ſame Room, where
ſhe was brought to Bed, but muſt be firſt waſhed and
carried into another place. Thoſe that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Murther, are not to be Communicated but
at the point of Death; if thoſe that lie in extremity
are to be Communicated, they gave them firſt ſome
Water, or <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> wherein ſome relicks have
been put, then they receive the Communion, and at
the ſame time the Extream Unction; which done,
they are to take nothing elſe, nor any Nouriſhment,
unleſs there be very apparent Signs of their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There are ſome among the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who
at the laſt extremity, cauſe themſelves to be Shaven,
and become real Monks: This once done, they are
not permitted to take any thing for a Week after;
being perſwaded that they are no more Men, but
become Angels: And if they happen, after theſe
Eight Days of Abſtinence, to recover their Health,
they muſt go into a Monaſtery, becauſe the Razor
has paſſed upon their Heads. Formerly they uſed
to ſend the Conſecrated Bread to thoſe Places in the
Country that were deſtitute of Prieſts: They uſed
alſo to give it to Travellers, to reſerve it for a Caſe
of Neceſſity: But this Cuſtom is now quite aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>Sabor.</hi> The reſt of the Eccleſiaſtical Order are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
into <hi>Proto-Popes</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> or Prieſts.
Thoſe that attend at Church, toll the Bells, and do
other inferiour Offices, are called <hi>Pangamari.</hi> The
Patriarch of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> has the ſame (if not a greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
Authority, as the Pope has in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; for
he, in a manner, divides the Sovereignty with the
Great Duke. He is the Supream Head and Judge of
all Eccleſiaſtical Affairs: And ſuch is his Power in all
Matters that have any Relation to their Religion,
that he reforms whatever he thinks prejudicial to this
Religion, or good Manners, without giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it to their Great Duke: Yet not ſo, but that
his Orders muſt be put in Execution by the <hi>Czar</hi>'s
Commands. The Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had
heretofore the Nomination of the Patriarch of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
till in proceſs of Time he had only the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and in this Age he hath loſt both: At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the Patriarch of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> is choſen by the Great
Duke and the other Prelates: The Latter meet in
the great Church within the Caſtle, called <hi>Sabor;</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54715:116"/>
where having nominated two or three Prelates, the
moſt eminent for Learning, and other good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
they preſent them to the Great Duke, who,
after a Conference with theſe Prelates, proceeds
jointly with them, to an Election. If it happen that
thoſe propoſed for the Election are equally eminent
for their Learning and Piety, it is, with the Grand
Duke's Approbation, ſometimes decided by Lot.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch,<note place="margin">Their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not.</note> Metropolitans, Archbiſhops, and
the Biſhop, in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> are not to marry, but make
a Vow of Chaſtity as long as they continue in that
Dignity: For, the Prelates, as well as the Prieſts,
are allowed here to quit their Orders whenever they
think it convenient, They muſt not wear Rings on
their Fingers. They wear neither Drawers nor Shirts
of Linen Cloth, but of Flannel: Neither do they
make uſe of Beds.</p>
               <p>The ordinary Habit of the Patriarch,<note place="margin">Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</note> Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
Archbiſhops, Biſhop, and even of their Monks,
is very near the ſame: They wear a black Caſſock;
and over that, an upper Garment of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
not much different from that worn by the other
<hi>Muſcovites:</hi> Their Hoods are at leaſt an Ell and an
half Diameter, having in the midſt a round Piece, as
big as a Trencher, which hangs on the hinder part
of the Head: They wear in their Hands a Staff,
forked at the End, when they go abroad, which they
call <hi>Poſock,</hi> and ſerves them for a Croſier.</p>
               <p>There being in the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> above 2000
Churches and Chapels, the firſt of which have at
leaſt three or four, and ſome more, Prieſts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, it is no difficult Matter to gueſs what a
vaſt Number of Prieſts and Eccleſiaſticks there muſt
be in that City. Thoſe that are deſirous to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Holy Orders, make their Addreſſes either to the
Patriarch, or any one of the Metropolitans; the
firſt, the beſt; where having been examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Qualifications, which conſiſt only in
Reading and Writing, and to be able to ſing in the
Church, they are admitted into Orders, with an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtation
of their being received into Prieſtood. At
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54715:117"/>
their Conſecration they are inveſted with the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Habit, as we have juſt now deſcribed it: They
have alſo the Hair cut off from the Crown of their
Heads, on which is put a little Cap, or <hi>Calotte,</hi>
which is the main Character of their Prieſthood; the
which they never move, or take off, neither at
Church, or any where elſe, unleſs it be when they
have their Hair cut. The chief Reſpect the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
pay to the Prieſt, he is beholden for to his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte;</hi>
and good Reaſon why; for if, upon any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
or Quarrel, this <hi>Calotte</hi> ſhould be pulled off his
Head, upon the Ground, the adverſe Party would
incurr the Penalty of the Mulct, called <hi>Biceſtie,</hi> which
we have mentioned before: To prevent which, the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> when they are going to fight with a
Prieſt, firſt reverendly take off his <hi>Calotte;</hi> which,
after they have ſoundly cudgell'd or beaten him,
they put on again with a great deal of Reſpect:
Which done, they are not liable to any farther Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
than if they had kick'd or cuffed a Lay-Man.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proto-Popes</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> or <hi>Temple-Prieſts,</hi> are
not only allowed, but obliged to marry once; but
cannot the ſecond or third time, unleſs they quit
their Prieſthood. This Point of the Marriages of
Prieſts is one of the main Points wherein they differ
as well from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as the <hi>Roman:</hi> For
which they alledge the Text of St. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 3.
that <hi>a Biſhop ſhould be the Husband of one Wife.</hi> And
for the Confirmation of it, they alledge the Fourth
Cannon of the Council which was held at <hi>Gangres,</hi> in
<hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> not long after that of <hi>Nice;</hi> where all
thoſe are Anathematized who refuſe to take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from the Hands of a Married Prieſt. The
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> are ſo ſtrict in the Obſervance of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that their Prieſts muſt be in a State of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
before they are admitted into Orders: Which
makes thoſe that intend to embrace that kind of Life
marry very young, that they may the ſooner have an
Opportunity of getting a Living. They are, beſides
this, to marry a Maid, and no Widow, nor a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54715:117"/>
the leaſt blemiſhed in her Reputation: And in
this Point they are to be ſo circumſpect, that if the
Prieſt, the firſt Night after Marriage, finds that the
Lock has been opened before, by any other Key than
his own, he muſt either be divorced from her, or lay
down his <hi>Calotte;</hi> out of which two, you may be
ſure he chuſes the firſt. But if the Parſon's Wife
ſtands her Trial fairly the firſt Night, ſhe has, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this Comfort before the reſt of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
Women, that ſhe is not likely to be kept under ſo
ſevere an Houſe-Diſcipline as the reſt, for as much as
the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Prieſts hang, in a great meaſure, by
the Apron-ſtring, they being, after they once become
Widowers, not ſuffered to adminiſter the Sacrament,
or to aſſiſt at Noon-Service, when the Communion
is received, or to give their Benedictions to Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
but only at the Morning and Evening-Services.
But to counter-ballance this Advantage the Parſon's
Wife has before others, the Prieſt is under a moſt
ſtrict Obligation, that when-ever he has given his
Wife due Benevolence, he muſt not approach the
Altar all the next Day; ſo that, what with this, and
the great Number of Faſts, ſhe is likely to live upon
very ſlender Diet, unleſs the Parſon be ſo good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as ſometimes to prefer the Duty to his Wife,
before that in the Church, and ſubſtitute one to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
in his Room at the Altar. The Prieſts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
have this Comfort left them after the Death of
their Wives, that if they do not approve of a ſingle
Life, they are free to lay down their Caſſock and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi>
and turn Merchants, Tradeſmen, or any thing
elſe they can, and ſo marry again. If they are too
old to undergo the Fatigues of the Sacerdotal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or of Marriage, the laſt Remedy is a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
where they end their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Severity of their Statutes; for they ſeldom refuſe any

with Strong Liquor to that Degree, that it is unſafe
for them to go home without good Company.
Here-tofore Superſtition had got ſo far the Aſcendant
over the Religious <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> that here, as well as
in ſome other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> they uſed to make
over all that they had, for the Benefit of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries:
So that, if a Stop had not been put to theſe
Extravagancies, they would, in Time, have got into

leave the reſt to their Heirs. They do not live ſo
retired in them, but that they appear in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
both in the Cities, and all over the Country,
where they frequently follow the ſame Employments
with the Peaſants; ſome of them alſo Trading in
Malt, Hops, all ſorts of Corn, and Cattel. Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Old Age, Infirmities and Domeſtick Conteſts
being the chief Inducements of thoſe that embrace
this Life, the feweſt chuſing it out of a Motive of
Devotion, it is no Wonder if they, moſt of them,
according to the general Education of the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
can ſcarce read or write: Not One in Ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54715:118"/>
Commandments,</hi> are looked upon as Men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Learning. I cannot forbear to relate, upon
this Occaſion, a certain merry Paſſage, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
ſome Years ago, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Roſtone,</hi>
for as much as it is not only very diverting, but alſo
may ſerve as a convincing Inſtance of the Simplicity
and Ignorance of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Monks: The above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Monaſtery ſtands upon a Lake, where,
for ſome time, a Fiſh had been ſeen of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Magnitude, to the great Aſtoniſhment of the
Monks. This Fiſh, in a Sun-ſhiny Day, would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
be playing, and appearing half above Water;
ſo that an Eagle, one time, ſwooping at it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-eager of his Prey, ſtruck his Talons into
the Fleſh of the Fiſh with ſuch Violence, that he
could not pull them out again. The Fiſh being
willing to be rid of his Enemy, plunged him in to
the Bottom; ſo that being tranſiated into a much
groſſer Element than he was uſed to live in before,
he ſoon loſt his Life, though his Talons ſtill ſtuck
faſt in the Fleſh. The Fiſh, very impatient of his
Burthen, made frequently towards the Shoar of the
Lake; where being perceived by the Friars, with
Feathers upon his Back, they were all put under
ſuch a Conſternation, that not one of them had the
Courage to approach it; ſome believing it to be an
Apparition; others, a Sea-Monſter; and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
it could be no leſs than a Water-Devil: The
laſt Opinion, it ſeems, was the moſt prevailing; ſo
that, to baniſh the Devil from that Shoar, they fell
to Ringing of Bells: And when they found this to
prove ineffectual, they went all in Proceſſion, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at all Points with ſuch Inſtruments and Weapons
as are commonly made uſe of upon ſuch Occaſions;
but all in vain, the Monſter, or Devil, as it ſeems,
not being afraid of their Weapons: So that all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
nothing was to be heard of, but the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> which had ſcared the poor Monks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
out of their Senſes. One Mr. <hi>Roger Eaton,</hi> an

him of the Monſter; ſo that being curious to ſee,
he went to the Shoar, where he found a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People ſtanding ſome diſtance off. He ſoon
perceiving what it was that had put them into ſuch
a Fright, told them, that he would ſoon deliver
them from this Monſter, provided they could get
ſome Body that would row the Boat. But it was no
eaſie matter to perſwade any one of them all to be
ſo bold, as to approach ſo near the Devil; till a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fellow, being made more couragious than the
reſt by good ſtore of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> at laſt undertook
the Task. As they were going off from the Shoar,
to encounter the Monſter, the Spectators, looking
upon the Attempt no leſs dangerous, than when
St. <hi>George</hi> fought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Dragon, gave them over for
loſt, expecting every Moment to ſee them devoured
by this Water-Dragon: But they were agreeably
ſurprized when they perceived the terrible <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
ſlain by his Conqueror. In ſhort, Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi>
ſhot and killed the Beaſt with a Screw'd Gun;
which, when taken up, proved to be nothing elſe
than a very large Pike, of about five Foot long, and
of the Thickneſs of a Man. It is eaſily to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that their Fear ſoon turned into Shame; yet,
to hide their Bluſhes, and to make ſome Amends to
their Champion, they drunk together ſo heartily,
till they became all mellow; and ſo put a merry
Epilogue to the Play.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>White,</hi> another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, living in
<hi>Ruſſia,</hi> did not meet with the ſame Entertainment
from the Fraternity; For, having been one time invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them to Dinner, they had caught another Pike,
not quite ſo big as the former; and as the Cook was
cutting it open, he found a new-born Infant in the
Belly of it; which put the Monks into ſo ill an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman was fain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home without his Dinner. This Infant was
ſuſpected to have been thrown into the Lake by one
of the Nuns of a Nunnery hard by this Monaſtery;
it being the Cuſtom in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to build always a
Convent and Nunnery near to one another.</p>

Inſtance of the Ignorance and Superſtition of
their Prieſts, no leſs pleaſant than the former, it will
not be amiſs to inſert it here. It ſeems the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Reſident in the City of <hi>Muſcow</hi> had a very fine Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,
famous amongſt the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> there, for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tricks and Pranks which he would be playing in
the Market. This Monkey, one Day, got into one
of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Churches, hard by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's
Houſe, and tumbled down ſome of their
Saints. The Prieſt coming ſoon after into the
Church, and ſeeing his Gods thus handled, ſtood
amazed; but having recovered himſelf a little, and
ſet their Saintſhips in their reſpective Places, he
daſhed all the Windows and Doors with Holy-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to keep the Devil out of the Church. But Pug
not underſtanding his Exorciſms, took his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
one Morning, when the Prieſt was going to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Morning-Service, to be in the Church as
ſoon as he; where he begun the old Game of ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and pulling about the Saints, not ſparing even
St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> himſelf; and that with ſo much Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if he had been bred a Quaker, grinning now
and then in the Prieſt's Face; who, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himſelf out of his firſt Fright, at laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
with his Croſs before him; and having
no other Way left, he betakes himſelf to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Remedy; I mean, the Horſe-Tail, dipped in
Holy-Water; wherewith he ſo beſprinkled poor
Pug, (who hated it as bad as the Devil himſelf,)
that he made the beſt of his Way home to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Reſident's Houſe. No ſooner was the Morning-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
over, but the <hi>Pope</hi> (or Prieſt) made moſt bitter
Complaints againſt a certain Stranger, living in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe, for having thrown down his Saints,
and prophaned the Holy Place. Whereupon, he
obtained an Order to ſearch the Reſident's Lodgings:
And all his Retinue were brought forth, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Prieſt; but none of them being the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

he looked for, <hi>It was,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a little Nincheen,</hi>
(or Stranger.) Whereupon, the young Children
being brought out, the Monkey, by chance, came
jumping out with them: <hi>Hold, hold,</hi> ſaid the Prieſt,
with a great deal of Joy, <hi>this is the little Stranger:
Seize him, ſeize him.</hi> Which being done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
poor Pug was had before his Betters; where not
being able to anſwer for himſelf, he was condemned
to the Strappado, and paid for his unſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
with his Life.</p>
               <p>But, after all this merry Digreſſion, it is time to
return to more ſerious Matters: It is to be obſerved,
that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> retain to this Day ſome Remnants
of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law; For, though they do not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
Swine's Fleſh, yet they will not touch a Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
Coney, or Hare. But, which is the oddeſt of
all, They hold it <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Vnclean,</hi> to eat Veal;
but not Lamb: For what Reaſon, neither they, nor
any body elſe, know. They account it next to a
Sin, to omit <hi>Lotionem post inatum.</hi> They look upon
it as a great Sin, for a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> to lie with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that is not of the ſame Communion: But a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Treſpaſs, for a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Woman to accept of a
Kindneſs from a Stranger: They give for a Reaſon,
Becauſe her Iſſue will be educated in the True <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>

and immediately they throw Straw upon him, and

how confuſed the Atchievements and Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of theſe Ancient Princes are among an ignorant
People, it is no difficult matter to imagine, that
their Ancient Hiſtory muſt be full of uncertainty.
Thus much is certain, that this vaſt Empire was in
former Ages divided into a great many Principalities,
under their own Laws and Princes, which in after
Ages, and by ſeveral Degrees, have been united
under one Head, and compoſe that vaſt Body,
which now adays is known under the name of the
<hi>Ruſſians</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p>But to return to their Chronicles, they relate that
<hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> among others of his Kindred, whom
he ſent to be Governour over very remote Provinces.
One <hi>Pruſſus</hi> had aſſigned him <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> had his Seat
on the <hi>Eaſtern Baltick</hi> Shoar by the River <hi>Weixel.</hi>
Of him were deſcended by the fourth Generation,
<hi>Rureck, Sinaus</hi> and <hi>Truvor,</hi> who, at the perſwaſion
of one <hi>Goſtomiſtius,</hi> a rich Citizen of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> were
ſent for by the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> who at that time lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Civil Government, to rule over them in the
Year 1573. As they went into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> they took a
long with them <hi>Olechus,</hi> their near Kinſman, and
ſo having divided the whole Country among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
each in his Province laid the firſt foundation
of a regular Civil Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iverſon</hi> the Son of <hi>Rureck</hi> (the reſt dying without

Wife one <hi>Otha,</hi> the Daughter of a Citizen of <hi>Pleſſcon,</hi>

where ſhe was Baptized and Named <hi>Helen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Son <hi>Stoſlaus</hi> was a Warlike Prince, and very
Victorious in ſeveral Battles, till at laſt being Slain
by his Enemies, they made a Cup of his Skull, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven'd
with this Sentence; <hi>Seeking after other Men's

<hi>Anne,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Baſitius Porphyrogenites,</hi> and in the

the <hi>Tartars</hi> having ſoon after killed their Governour,
ſurpriſed him with a conſiderable Army, and having
forced him to retreat with ſuch Forces, as he could
get together in haſt, under <hi>Novogorod</hi> on the River
<hi>Occas,</hi> they took and plundred the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi>
and forc'd the Caſtle to a ſhameful Capitulation, by
vertue of which the Great Dukes were to be tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
to the <hi>Tartars.</hi> But the <hi>Tartars</hi> having ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
broken the Capitulation by Beſieging the City
of <hi>Rheſan,</hi> and the <hi>Weywode</hi> or <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Governor,
having by a ſtraitagem, got into his poſſeſſion the
Great Duke's Original Letters Patents, whereby the

(as has been related before in the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the City of <hi>Caſan,)</hi> and having at the ſame time,
forced the <hi>Tartars</hi> to raiſe the Siege of the City and
Caſtle of <hi>Rheſan,</hi> both the People and Great Duke,
were ſo encouraged by the ſudenneſs of ſo lucky an
accident, that the latter marched againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
and Beſieged the City of <hi>Caſan,</hi> which he cauſed to

Father, under the Tuition of <hi>George</hi> his Uncle, in the
Year 1540. But no ſooner was he arrived to the
Age of Maturity, but he gave moſt evident proofs
of his future Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>Being willing to make himſelf formidable to his
Neighbours, by ſome memorable exploit, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Reign, he reſolved to revenge the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
his Father had received before <hi>Caſan,</hi> which
City he Beſieged in the Year 1552,<note place="margin">His Wars.</note> And after he
had batter'd it very furiouſly for the ſpace of two
Months, offered them very honourable conditions,
which they having refuſed to accept, he ordered the
general Aſſault to be given on the Second Day of
<hi>July</hi> in the ſame Year; and notwithſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Defence made by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> carried it by
Storm, and thereby became Maſter of the whole
Kingdom of <hi>Caſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About two Years after, he marched againſt the
<hi>Nagajan Tartars,</hi> bordering to the <hi>South</hi> upon thoſe
of <hi>Caſan;</hi> and having in the Year 1554, on the firſt
day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> taken by Aſſault <hi>Aſtra Chan,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
of the Province, he alſo reduced that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
under his Subjection.</p>
               <p>By what accident he got into the Poſſeſſion of the
vaſt Country of <hi>Siberia,</hi> which has ſince proved one of
the moſt profitable to the Czars of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> by
which they have opened themſelves a way into <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
as has been related before in the Deſcription of
that Province.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1558. he turned his victorious Arms
again <hi>Livonia;</hi> where having ravaged the Biſhoprick
of <hi>Derpt</hi> and <hi>Virland,</hi> he made himſelf Maſter of the
Cities of <hi>Narva,</hi> and of <hi>Toopator-Derpt:</hi> So that the
<hi>Livonians</hi> not being able alone to reſiſt his Power,
and being put into Deſpair by the moſt horrid Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54715:124"/>
exerciſed upon them by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
againſt <hi>Furſtenbergh,</hi> the Maſter of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they were forced to ſubmit themſelves, ſome
under the Protection of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the reſt under the

Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> to beſiege the City of <hi>Revel,</hi> in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia;</hi>
but the City being aſſiſted by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe Protection they were, forced him to raiſe
the Siege: And when he attacked it a ſecond time,
in the Year 1577, he met with no better Succeſs:
And in the Year 1581, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General, <hi>Pontus
de la Guarde,</hi> recovered the City of <hi>Narva</hi> from the
<hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was at firſt alſo very ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi>
till <hi>Stephen Battori,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> not only recovered all the Places
he had taken from that Crown before, but alſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to make a Peace in the Year 1582; by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of which, he relinquiſhed all his Pretenſions to
that part of <hi>Livonia</hi> which had put it ſelf under the
Protection of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> In the Year 1571,
the <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi> alſo made a great Irruption into
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> deſtroying all with Fire and Sword; and
at laſt burnt the City of <hi>Muſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the firſt Years of his Reign were attended with
Victories abroad, ſo at home he ruled for ſome time
with a great deal of Mildneſs; and by the outward
Shew of his Piety, made his Subjects conceive all
the Hopes that could be of a proſperous Reign: For
he would go frequently to Church, ſay the Service
himſelf, ſing, and never fail to be preſent at any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Ceremonies; nay, ſometimes execute the
Functions of Monks and Prieſts himſelf: Which,
without Queſtion, was it that miſ-led <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi>
into that Miſtake, when he calls him <hi>a good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Chriſtian;</hi> For it will ſufficiently appear, in
the Sequel of this Hiſtory, that he abuſed both
God and Men; and that his pretended Piety was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended to gain the Popular Applauſe, (which he
both effected, and ſtood in need of,) and to cover
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54715:124"/>
his moſt horrid Deſigns againſt ſuch of the Nobility
as he was afraid would not ſubmit, without Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy,
to the Yoak he intended to put upon their
Necks. He began to give the firſt Proofs of his
cruel Diſpoſition in the Year 1560; when having
acquired a vaſt Reputation, both at home and abroad,
by the great Succeſs of his Arms againſt the <hi>Tartars,
Livonians</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> he thought this the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Time to put in Execution his Deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf the ſole and abſolute Maſter of this vaſt
Empire. His Grandfather had laid the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Maxim, (which was followed by his
Son <hi>Baſili,</hi> the Father of <hi>John Baſilovitz,)</hi> to wit,
To ſuppreſs the antient Nobility, by deſpoiling them
not only of their Caſtles, and Strong Holds, but alſo
of their Eſtates. But this Tyrant looking upon theſe
Means as inſufficient, reſolved, by putting to death
all the Great Men in the Kingdom whom he found,
in the leaſt, contrary to his Deſign, to ſecure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Arbitrary Diſpoſal of this great Empire.</p>
               <p>He made the firſt Beginning with one <hi>Demetrius
Owezinovitz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> a Man of great Parts among the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians:</hi>
Being therefore willing to be rid of him, he
invited him one Evening to Supper, with a great
deal of ſeeming Friendſhip; where they drunk very
merrily, ſo that <hi>Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trius</hi> began to be overcome by
the Strength of the Liquor; which the Tyrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
and believing this to be a fit Opportunity to
put his Deſign in Execution, he drank to him a great
Bowl-full of Strong <hi>Hydromel,</hi> which he obliged <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
to pledge, to his (the Great Duke's) Health;
but it being impoſſible for him to drink above half of
it, the Great Duke angrily told him, That ſince he
was ſo unmannerly as to refuſe to drink his Health in
his Preſence, he might get down into his Wine-Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
where he ſhould drink it at his own Leiſure.
<hi>Demetrius</hi> being very willing to obey, went, without
Reluctancy, down into the Cellar; where, by the
ſecret Orders of the Tyrant, he was ſuffocated.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner he cauſed to be either ſecretly
ſlain, or ſuffocated, ſeveral Perſons of Eminent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54715:125"/>
without any Body's daring to enquire into their
Death; till at laſt, the Patriarch, and the other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
in Conjunction with ſome of the boldeſt among
the Nobility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having repreſented to him the Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Actions, he ſeemed, for ſome ſmall Time,
to have changed his cruel Sentiments into a more
mild Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The better to confirm them in this Opinion, he
got it ſpread abroad, that he intended to abdicate the
Empire, and to retire into a Monaſtery: And ſoon
after, having called together the Nobility, he told
them, That ſince he had two Sons, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to make his Succeſſors, he would recommend
them to their Care: That he did not queſtion but
they would not only pay them due Allegiance, but
alſo aſſiſt them with their Counſel, and good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
That, for his part, he intended to build him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Monaſtery, near the City of <hi>Muſco;</hi> where he
would be ready at hand to give his Directions in
Matters of any Moment. Having thus cajoll'd them
into a good Opinion, he cauſed a very large Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be erected, ſurrounded with a ſtrong Wall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he endowed with conſiderable Revenues, for
the Maintenance of ſuch as were to abide with him
there, and to lead, as he pretended, a Monaſtick
Life; but, in effect, to ſerve as an Encouragement
to ſuch as he intended to employ in the Execution of
his cruel Deſigns: For, after he had ſettled himſelf,
with his Gang, in this Caſtle, he uſed, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Preferment, to ſend ſuch of his Nobles as
he intended to ſacrifice to his Ambition, into ſome
diſtant Province or another, as Governors; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
after ſome Time, he would command ſome of
his Soldiers, under ſuch Officers as were before-hand
engaged to execute his Orders, to the Place, where
the Fact was to be perpetrated under pretence of
changing the Garriſon; where they remained till
they found a convenient Opportunity to ſend, by
one Means or another, the Governor into the other
World: Which done, his Kindred were ſure to
meet with the ſame Fate at <hi>Muſco;</hi> the Tyrant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54715:125"/>
wanting Means to root out the Shrubs, after he
had fell'd the Tree; foraſmuch as the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
who are above all other Nations given to caluminate
and draw one another into the Snare, were always
ready to furniſh him with ſufficient opportunity to
rid himſelf of thoſe under ſome ſpecious pretence or
another.</p>
               <p>Thus he treated <hi>Knez Roſtoroski,</hi> deſcended from
the antient Dukes of <hi>Roskovie,</hi> or <hi>Roſthovie;</hi> whom
he dreaded, for his Courage, and Skill in Martial
Affairs. This Principality, as well as thoſe of <hi>Twere</hi>
and <hi>Bielski,</hi> were in former Ages allotted to the
Younger Brothers of the Dukes of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> but were
by <hi>Baſili,</hi> the Father of <hi>John Baſilovits,</hi> appropriated
to his own Uſe, leaving only to the Heirs a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Share for their Maintenance. The laſt of the
Dukes of <hi>Koſthovie</hi> was <hi>Peter Roſtowski,</hi> whom the
Tyrant had made <hi>Waywode</hi> or Governor of <hi>Niſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogorod.</hi>
Having reſolved his Ruin, he ſent thither
40 Ruffians, whom he uſed to employ on ſuch like
Occaſions, with Orders to bring to him the Head of
the ſaid Governor. Theſe having found him at his
Devotion, they dragg'd him from thence; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtripp'd him ſtark naked, and tied him in a
Sledge, they carried him ſtreight-ways to the River
<hi>Colga;</hi> where he that commanded the Party, having
cut off his Head, threw the Body into the River.
His Kindred and Children (Fifty in Number) were
all murther'd by the Tyrant's Order; and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Slaves condemned to perpetual Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Pietrovits,</hi> a Man of a very high Rank in <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
was fain to undergo the ſame Fate, with his
whole Family: For, having been falſly accuſed in
the Year 1568, as if he aimed at the Crown, the
Tyrant, without admitting them to be heard, ſeized
upon his Eſtate, both Real and Perſonal, which was
very great; and condemned him to go as a private
Soldier, in the War againſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Having not
ſo much left him, out of all his Eſtate, as an Horſe
to ride upon; he was furniſhed with one by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54715:126"/>
Friar, who took pity of his Condition;ſo he
obeyed his Orders: And after having ſerved ſeveral
Years as a ſingle Volunteer, who uſed to have at his
Heels a great Number of Servants, he at laſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Muſco.</hi> The Tyrant not thinking it ſufficient
to have humbled him thus, he called together, at a
certain Time; his Council of Nobles; where having
ſummoned <hi>Pietrovits</hi> to appear, he, with his own
Hands, as ſoon as they were all met, put the Ducal
Cap and Crown on his Head, with a Sceptre in his
Hand, and thus, attired in a very rich Robe, ſet him
upon a Throne, in the Preſence of all the Court;
where having ſhewed him the ſame Revernce as is
uſually paid to the Czars of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> he ſpoke thus
to him; <hi>All Hail to our Great Duke and Monarch of</hi>
Ruſſia: <hi>Now thou hast obtained what thou ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst;
now it is, thou hast encompaſſed thy Wiſh. I
knew thy Aim was, to ſupply my Place, in the Throne of</hi>
Muſcovy: <hi>See how I have, my ſelf, created thee Great
Duke of</hi> Ruſſia, <hi>in a most ſolemn manner. But know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that as it was in my Power to ſet thee upon the Throne, ſo
I am able to dethrone and deſpoil thee of that Dignity, as
Pleaſure.</hi> He had no ſooner uttered theſe laſt Words,
but he ſtabbed him with a Dagger, ſeveral times,
through the Heart. But this was only the Prologue
to the following Tragedy; for he did not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all his Servants to be either ſtrangled or drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but he went in Perſon to the Caſtle of <hi>Columna,</hi>
180 Miles diſtant from the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
belonging to <hi>Pietrovits;</hi> where 300 of his
Vaſſals were maſſacred in the Tyrant's Preſence.
But not ſatisfied with this, after he had, for a whole
Year together, ruined his Eſtate with Fire and Sword,
he ſhut up all the Gentlemen (of whom there was a
conſiderable Number) that held any Lands under
<hi>Pietrovits,</hi> in one Houſe, and ſo blew them up into
the Air, with Gun-Powder: Their Wives and
Daughters, after they had been raviſhed by his
Guards, were cut to pieces. The Peaſants, with
their Wives and Children, were driven, ſtark naked,
into the Woods. The Wife of <hi>Pietrovits</hi> was ſhut
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54715:126"/>
up in a Monaſtery; and his Children, and whole
Family, deſtroyed, by the Tyrant's Order.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Year he cauſed his Chancellor, <hi>Koza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
Dubrowski,</hi> to be ſlain by his Guards, with two of
his Sons, as they were ſitting at Dinner; and a third
Son happening not to be at home, eſcaped preſent
Death for that time; but he was afterwards taken,
and Quartered alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boris Titow,</hi> one of his Chief Counſellors of State,
coming one Day to pay his Reverence, as is uſual,
to the Great Duke; as he was bowing his Head, he
cut off one of his Ears, with his own Hands; and
preſenting it to the Owner, <hi>Accept,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of this
ſmall Gift at preſent: Another time I will remember you
better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Cruelites exerciſed on Perſons of ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a Rank, ſtruck ſuch a Terrour into the reſt of
the Nobility, that they were reſolved to try their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
whether perhaps they might not be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from theſe cruel Deſigns. Being therefore
met at a certain Day, to the Number of 300, they
went all in a Body, to repreſent to the Czar the
Heinouſneſs of his Cruelties; telling him, <hi>That they
were ready to ſacrifice both their Lives and Eſtates for
his Service; and that they would always remain ſtedfaſt
in their Allegiance: But, on the other hand, they hoped
he would be pleaſed not to afflict, in ſo horrible a manner,
his faithful and innocent Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Duke being not well pleaſed at their
Errand, he ordered them, all together, to be thrown
into Priſon; and ſome Days after, ſome to have
their Tongues, others their Legs and Arms cut off;
and 50 of the moſt Eminent among them were whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
round the Market-place; the reſt were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
without any Puniſhment for that time, but they
paid afterwards the whole Score, with Intereſt: For,
in the Year 1570, one Morning, when the Citizens
were opening their Shops, they were not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to ſee 18 Gibbets erected in the Market-place,
ſurrounded by the Great Duke's Guards, who
had brought along with them all manner of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54715:127"/>
for the Torture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides which, there was a
great Fire, and over it was placed a great Caldron,
with boiling hot Water in it. The Citizens, I ſay,
being terrified at ſo horrible a Spectacle, and preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
nothing but the worſt to themſelves, as being
uncertain for what End all theſe dreadful Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were made, ſome inſtantly ſhut up their Shops
again; others, more fearful than the reſt, left all
what they had, as it was, and were for ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Flight, or, at leaſt, for hiding in ſome more
remote Part of the City; Which Place being thus
put into a general Conſternation, the Great Duke,
ſurrounded by a great Number of his Guards, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the Market-place, ſeating himſelf near the
Caldron of boiling Water. But perceiving that the
Generality of the Citizens had; out of Fear, either
abandon'd their Houſes, or, at leaſt, abſconded, and
diſperſed themſelves into the other Quarters of the
the City, he rid in Perſon through the Streets, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to them; <hi>Let nothing diſturb you: Come, and
ſee what I am going to do: I give you my Word, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall hurt you; you may come forth, without the
least Danger to your ſelves: Therefore come forth, and
ſee what a Spectacle I am preparing for you.</hi> The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
partly out of Fear, partly out of Curioſity,
flocked to the Market-place, where they ſaw 400
Noble-men, of the moſt antient Families in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
coupled together, Two and Two, like Hounds;
and ſo miſerably disfigured by the Violence of the
Torture, that they were almoſt not to be known by
their neareſt Kindred. To gratifie in ſome meaſure
the People, he ſelected 180 out of their Number:
<hi>Vnto theſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I give their Lives, for your ſakes;
I will pardon them all their Offences: Let them be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcharged.</hi> Which being done accordingly,</p>
               <p>The firſt that was brought forth to Execution, was
<hi>John Michaelovits Wiskowaty,</hi> his Chancellor; deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from one of the moſt antient Families in <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy:</hi>
Who being charged with Keeping great Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and inviting the
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> to invade <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> when he was
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54715:127"/>
juſt going to be put on one of the Gibbets, he ſpoke theſe
following Words: <hi>I call God Almighty, the Infallible
Searcher of Hearts, to witneſs of what I am going to ſay,
to be true: I confeſs my ſelf, before him, to be a miſerable
Sword<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and trust in his Mercy, through the Blood of his

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> beloved Son. But as to what concerns the Station
I was lately in, by the Great Duke's Favour, I protest to
God, that I have always diſcharged my Trust faithfully,
as I ought to do, towards him; and therefore I appeal at
this Inſtant to the Tribunal of God, where, when I ſhall
meet the Duke, I will make my Innocence appear to the
Great Judge of Heaven and Earth. I am ſenſible that,
O Duke, ſuch is thy Ambition, ſuch is thy Avarice and
Thirst after innocent Blood, that nothing but my Life can
ſatisfie thee at preſent: Glut thy ſelf therefore with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Blood; but remember that thou must one Day give
a most ſevere Account of all theſe most barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
Whilſt he was going on in his Diſcourſe, the
Executioner, by the Great Duke's Order, tied him
up to one of the Gibbets, with his Feet upwards,
and his Head hanging down. This done, one of
the Captains of his Guards asked him what he would
have farther done with this Malefactor? <hi>Every one
of you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that belong to my Court, here preſent,
ſhall lend an helping Hand to ſend this Traytor out of the
World, whom I will have cut Limb by Limb.</hi> He had
no ſooner ſpoke the Word, but the firſt Captain of
his Guards, called <hi>Molutlo,</hi> diſmounting his Horſe, he,
with a little Knife, cut off his Right Ear; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

of the Grand Duke being alſo to have his

Members; of which he immediately died: Which
the Duke perceiving, and believing that it had been
done on purpoſe to ſhorten the Chancellor's Miſery,
he ordered him to eat them inſtantly; which he was
forced to do.</p>

I never was guilty of any treſpaſs againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord and
Maſter, and that I have faithfully, and without any
fraud, diſcharged my Office; wherefore, I ſummon thee,
O Great Duke, to appear on the laſt day of Judgment,
before the Tribunal of God, where thou ſhalt be obliged to
make ample ſatisfaction to me.</hi> Having ended theſe
Words, he was tied up to the Gibbet, in the ſame
manner as the Chancellor with his Head downwards,
and very cloſe ſhaved: After he had hung thus for
ſome time, two of the Captains of his Guards, each
with a bucket of Water; whereof one was Cold,
the other fill'd out of the Chaldron with Boiling
Water, we mentioned before, approached to the
Gibbet, and he with the cold Water, having firſt
waſhed his Head, the other continually poured the
Boiling hot Water upon it, till the Skin was quite
ſhriveled together, and the poor Treaſurer at laſt
died in the midſt of the moſt exquiſite Torments.
The third in order was his Cook, who underwent
the ſame Fate as the Chancellor, being cut to pieces
Limb by Limb.</p>
               <p>After theſe, follow three of the Great Duke's
chief Secretaries, <hi>George Czapkinou, John Buthakow,</hi>
and <hi>Baſili Stepanow;</hi> theſe were all together with
their Wives and Children cut in pieces, in the Great
Duke's preſence, by his Guards: At laſt, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of theſe Noble Men we ſpoke of before, were
brought before the Great Duke upon the Scaffold;
who having Condem'd them to Die, without as much
as naming their Crime, they were in an inſtant cut
to pieces by his Guards before his Face. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Tragedy, the Great Duke ordered to be
brought before him out of Priſon (where he had
been detained a great while) a certain perſon vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for his Old Age and Nobility, as being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from a very ancient Family, whom he run
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54715:128"/>
through the Body with his own Lance, and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that, after the Old Man lay upon the
Ground, wallowing in his Blood, gave him at leaſt
Fifteen or Sixteen Wounds more, till he died upon
the Spot.</p>
               <p>This Spectacle having thus continued for four
Hours, the Tyrant before he returned to the Caſtle,
would needs give a Viſit to the Widow of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
whom he had cauſed to be executed juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
She was Siſter to the Duke <hi>Wiazinski,</hi> and one
of the handſomeſt Ladies in all <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whom he
found ſhut up in her Bed-chamber, all over whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Grief, and lamenting the miſerable Death of
her Husband in Terms ſo Paſſionate, that it would
have moved Compaſſion in a heart of Stone. But
the Tyrant being void of all ſenſe of Humanity, no
ſooner entred the Houſe, but ordered her to be
ſtript ſtark Naked, and to be ſet with her bare But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks
upon a Rope, faſtned titely for that purpoſe
betwixt two Poſts, and ſo to be drawn upon the
Rope, till the tender Fleſh of this Pretty Creature,
not being able to reſiſt long the violence of this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was torn every where to the very Bones, of which
ſhe died ſome days after. She had a little Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Son, who had been forced to be the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spectators of their dear Mothers Miſery; the
firſt was ſent into a Nunnery, the laſt Condemned
to a perpetual Puniſhment. The Chancellor's Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
was alſo forced to embrace the Monaſtick Life,
and his Son ſent Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Biel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which lies in one of the <hi>Northern</hi> and moſt unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Some days after this
Slaughter, about Fourſcore of the Wives and
Daughters of theſe two Hundred Nobles, he had
cauſed to be Butchered before his Face, where drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Hair, to the River ſide, where they were
all drowned. About the ſame time, one of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries
having been preſented with a Pike by a
certain Countryman, the Great Duke having got
Notice of it, cauſed him to be thrown into a Lake,
where, as he ſaid, he might have Fiſh enough, ſince
he was ſo great a lover of them.</p>

The <hi>Lithuanians</hi> having by a ſtratagem ſurpriſed
the Caſtle of <hi>Borsko,</hi> took the Governour and his
Lady Priſoners, who being afterwards exchanged
with ſome <hi>Poles,</hi> returned to the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi>
where they were no ſooner Arrived, but the Great
Duke ordered three Gibbots to be Erected, on which
the Governor, and two more of his chief Officers
being faſtned with a Rope about their Waſtes, the
Tyrant and his Son ſhot their Arrows at them till
they were killed, telling them, ever now and than,
<hi>Thus you ought to have defended your Cauſe.</hi>

               <p>His own Brother, though he had lived all along
with the greateſt Circumſpection in the World, for
fear of giving any occaſion of Jealouſie to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
yet could not eſcape his hands. For under
pretence that one of his <hi>Bojares,</hi> called <hi>Trzeriack Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konati,</hi>
had given information againſt him, he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, without being heard, to be tortured in the
moſt violent manner that could be invented; and
thus having forced him to make a Confeſſion where
his Treaſure was hid, his Head was cut off in the
preſence of his Lady, who all this while lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
at the Tyrant's Feet, and in vain was implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Ear to her juſt Petition, ſhe was ſtript ſtark Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

afterwards dragged to the River and drown'd.</p>
               <p>It uſed to be a common Cuſtom with him, to

to be hanged at their own Doors, where the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was to go out and in, perhaps for three or four
Weeks, till the Tyrant was pleaſed to order the
dead Body to be removed. He was ſomething more

Buſhels of Peaſe to be thrown down before them,
which he made them pick up: When he had done,
he treated them with ſome Wine, and bid them to
take heed for the future, how they made ſport with

take a view of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Ladies, he took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſee how far the Foreign Women differed

               <p>After he had, in a manner, thus either ruin'd, or

Some of theſe were ſlain by his own Hand;

we have ſpoken in the Deſcription of that City;
ſo that it will be ſuperfluous, to give a further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them here: We will only add thus much,
That, as he exceeded all the Tyrants that ever were
infamous for their Cruelties, ſo it was he that perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Work begun by his Grand-father: to wit, by
ſuppreſſing the Antient Nobility, to make himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Maſter of this great Empire: Which when he
had obtained, he grew alſo inſupportable to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes. How he treated the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Captives, we have related before; and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
being unmeaſurable, he gave a proof of it to a

was ſo far from being diſpleaſed with this bold An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that ever after he had a great eſteem for him;
telling his <hi>Bojares,</hi> That he queſtioned whether, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them all, there was one that dare do ſo much
for him. It was in his Reign that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettled
firſt their Trade in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> as we have mentioned
in the Deſcription of the City of <hi>Archangel.</hi> He
had three Sons; of which, the Eldeſt being ſtruck by
his Father one time, with a ſtick, died with Grief;
or, as ſome will have it, by his Father's Lance: The
two others were, <hi>Fedor,</hi> or <hi>Theodor,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius;</hi> the
Eldeſt of which ſucceeded him in the Empire. He
Reigned Nine and Thirty Years, and died in the
Year 1584. in the Fifty ſixth Year of his Age; belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by few, but dreaded both at home and abroad,
and might have been counted one of the greateſt
Princes that ever ſat upon the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Throne, if
by his moſt barbarous Cruelties he had not defaced
the Glory of his great Actions, and had drawn upon
his Family the Vengeance of God, which was very
conſpicuous in thoſe Revolutions which after his
Death happen'd in the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Empire; which,

the Management of Affairs of State, and in a very
few Years had attained to that degree of
Perfection in Flattery and Diſſimulation, that he
ſeem'd to be the Darling both of his Prince and
the People; both being equally well ſatisfied in his
Conduct. Thus by the Advantages of his Quality
and Dexterity, and the Weakneſs of the Czar <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
having got the whole Management of Affairs
into his own Hands, he began to bend all his
Thoughts, how to ſecure the Crown of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to
himſelf and his Family; the better to enable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to obtain his Ends, after he had gain'd the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

ſmooth his way to the Throne, by the Favour of
the Nobility, moſt of whom having a Dependance
from him, as the only Perſon, through whoſe hands
all Places of Honour, Truſt or Profit paſſed, were
ſoon brought over by the Hopes and Advantages of

grievouſly miſtaken in their Account; for <hi>Boris Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denou,</hi>
conſidering with himſelf how dangerous
they might prove one time or another to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
took a Reſolution to take the firſt Opportunity

to effect which, he hir'd others, who by the
Temptations of great Rewards were made the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners
of thoſe four Murderers of their
Prince.</p>
               <p>To prevent the Murmurs of the People, who
were all ſtartled at the ſuddenneſs of ſo bloody a
Tragedy, he made uſe of the ſame Method he had
done at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz;</hi> For, having cauſed the City of
<hi>Muſco</hi> to be ſet on fire in ſeveral Parts, he did not
queſtion but that this general Conſternation would
divert the Peoples Thoughts from enquiring into
the true Circumſtances of this Murther: And to
remove as far as poſſibly could be from himſelf, all
Suſpicion of having had the leaſt hand in ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Murder, he declared, that he would revenge
the Death of the Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>

Conſternation, occaſioned by the Fire in that City,
a little over, but a Rumor being ſpread, that the
Prince had been Murder'd, the Inhabitants forced
their Way into the Caſtle, and tranſported with a
furious Zeal of revenging his Death, ſlew all his
Servants, without any diſtinction. This, which
in all probability ſeem'd to clear them from the
Stain of the Fact, was by the Contrivance of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
interpreted to their Deſtruction; alledging,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54715:134"/>
that they having ſlain all thoſe from whom any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
might have been made concerning this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſination,
it would but be a ſufficient Argument
of their Guilt; and that the Murder being to be laid
at their door, they muſt be proceeded againſt like
Criminals. In effect, a great many of the Citizens
of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz,</hi> were baniſh'd, ſome were tortur'd,

                  <hi>Boris Goudenou,</hi> who was ſufficiently acquainted
with the mutinous Temper of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> when
freed from that Servile Yoak, which otherwiſe
keeps them under Subjection, and that moſt

to his Advantage, being ſenſible that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
would be emulous, who ſhould moſt ſhew his
Zeal in placing him upon the Throne. Finding
therefore the Nobility ready to make their Addreſſes
to him, he cunningly cauſed a Rumor to be ſpread
abroad by his Emiſſaries, that being tir'd with the
Toils of his Charge of Lord High Steward of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
he was reſolved to quit it, by retiring
into a Monaſtery, to end the remainder of his Days
in quiet. The People being thus more and more
tranſported with the Apprehenſions of their Ruin,
when they perceived, that among all the Nobility,
there was not one who durſt as much as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Management of the Government, they
join'd with the Nobility, and the Clergy, whoſe
chief Intereſt conſiſted in maintaining the Publick
Peace, were of opinion, that all the States of the
Empire ought to make their humble Submiſſions to
<hi>Boris,</hi> to try whether by their joint Importunities,
he might, perhaps, be prevail'd upon to take upon
him the Burthen of the Empire. The Nuns quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Cloiſters, and the Women ran with their
Children in their Arms, to back the Eſtates of the
Empire, and to offer their moſt humble Prayers to
<hi>Boris,</hi> like to the tutelar Saint of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> ſo, that
being at laſt overcome by their Prayers and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
he yielded to the abſolute Neceſſity of
his Country; and, after he had ſpoken much in

                  <hi>but meerly to their Importunities, and the Love of his
Country, that he was going to ſacrifice all the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he found in a retir'd Life, and that the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which made him offer Violence to his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was, that he could not ſee any longer ſo glorious
an Empire, expoſed to the imminent Danger of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Ruin; But knowing himſelf too weak for
ſo great a Burthen, he hoped that they would not deny
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54715:135"/>
to Aid him with their Counſels, when Occaſion ſhould
require; and that relying upon their Honour and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he would chearfully receive the Truſt, which he
would be ready to Maintain and Defend to the laſt Drop
of his Blood, aſſuring them, that if he could not equal his
Predeceſſors in Greatneſs and Glorious Actions abroad,
he would endeavour to exceed them in Temperance and
the Mildneſs of his Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that <hi>Boris</hi> did ſhew no leſs
Conduct and Wiſdom in preſerving the Crown,
than he had uſed dexterity in acquiring it. For he
entirely engag'd the Army to his Service by great
Rewards, he continued the Nobility in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Dignities, and heap'd upon them new Favours
and Preferments; The common People he ty'd to
his Intereſt, by eaſing them of their Taxes, and
the Mildneſs of his Government; and having thus
ſecur'd the Affections of his Subjects at home, he
was no leſs careful of Eſtabliſhing a good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
abroad with the Neighbouring Princes, for
which purpoſes, new Treaties were ſet on foot,
and concluded betwixt him and the <hi>Poles, Swedes,</hi>
and other Nations, bordering upon <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Thus
the whole Intereſt of his Government ſeem'd, in
all human Appearance, to be built upon ſo ſolid a
Foundation, that no power upon Earth was like to
overturn it, as being founded upon the general
Affections of the People at home under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of a Prince, who, for his Wiſdom, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and Courage, was look'd upon abroad, as
one of the moſt promiſing Princes, that ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
the Throne of this vaſt Empire.</p>
               <p>But mark the ſudden Change of all humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
how ſubject to continual Viciſſitudes. What
perhaps the moſt powerful Foreign Enemy durſt
ſcarce have attempted at that Juncture of Time,
was effected by a poor inconſiderable Monk, who by
his Devices put the whole <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire into ſuch
a Confuſion, that, in ſpite of all the Precautions of
<hi>Boris,</hi> he broke all his Meaſures, and brought the
Empire of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> to the very brink of Ruin and

Wit, but alſo of a very handſom Aſpect and Mien,
and his outward Behaviour and whole Perſon ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his great Genius; and this Confinement not
agreeing with his aſpiring Thoughts, put him into
a deep Melancholy. A certain old cunning Monk
of the ſame Monaſtery, who was a ſecret Enemy
of the then Great Duke <hi>Boris Goudenou,</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of it, and judging that the Cauſe of his
Sadneſs proceeded from his preſent Confinement,
the Narrowneſs of a Monaſtick Life not being any
wiſe ſuitable to his capacious Soul, contracted an
intimate Friendſhip with him, endeavouring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
his Penſivenſs by the Inſtructions he gave him,
firſt, concerning the Ancient State of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi>
Empire, and afterwards by giving him a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the preſent Poſture of Affairs under the
Uſurpation of <hi>Boris Goudenou.</hi> Being not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Treacheries by which <hi>Boris</hi> had
compaſſed his Aim, he did not forget to tell him,
how he had cauſed <hi>Demetrius</hi> the youngeſt Son of
<hi>John Baſilovits</hi> to be murthered at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz,</hi> how the
Grand Duke <hi>Fedor,</hi> the Elder Brother of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
was poiſon'd by his Contrivances; and that
by the Murther of theſe two Princes, as by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſteps he had aſcended the Throne. He told him,
that though his Intereſt was laid deep at preſent in
the Nobility, yet that there were not wanting ſuch
among them, as, being ſenſible of the Treachery
committed againſt the two Princes, and envying
his Greatneſs, would not Refuſe to embrace the
firſt Opportunity that offer'd to expoſe his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Deſigns to the View of the World, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once done, would ſoon turn the Affection of
the common People into a mortal Hatred againſt
him. He cunningly inſinuated to the young Monk,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54715:137"/>
That his Perſon and Aſpect, being not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and his Genius
ſitted for great Undertakings, it would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Task for him to perſonate the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
(whom they would give out to have been ſaved
from the Aſſaſſins by the Care of his Mother) and,
at once, to puniſh the Treachery of <hi>Boris,</hi> and to
ſupply the Place of Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the Throne
of <hi>Muſcovy. Grisko,</hi> who was naturally of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
Temper, having received the Propoſals of
the Old Monk with a great deal of Satisfaction, they
began to concert Meaſures, which way to put their
projected Deſign in Execution; and wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
with themſelves, that as ſoon as the thing
ſhould take the leaſt Vent, there would be no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for this New-model'd <hi>Demetrius</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
at the Head of a conſiderable Body, it was
thought moſt adviſable for him to retire into
<hi>Poland,</hi> where he might find an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

<hi>Demetrius,</hi> and with the Aſſiſtance of his Friends
who by the Proſpect of great Advantages might be
drawn into his Intereſt, publickly lay claim to the
Crown of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Purſuant to this Reſolution,
the Old Monk, with his Pupil, travelled towards
the Palatinate of <hi>Kiovia</hi> bordering upon <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
where having introduc'd him into the Service of a
Perſon of very eminent Quality and Intereſt in
thoſe Parts, whoſe Name was <hi>Adam Wiſnowiski,</hi>
and given him ſuch further Inſtructions, as he
thought moſt conducing towards the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

this <hi>Demetrius</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould be in a Capacity

it ſelf, when he leaſt expected it. For</hi> Wiſnowiski
<hi>being in a violent Paſſion one day, not only call'd

me thus, if you were as well acquainted with my
Quality as my Perſon; and what grieves me moſt, is,
that I ſhould receive this Affront from the Man in

Re-eſtabliſhment. <hi>Having ſpoken theſe Words, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly,

my place, who was accordingly aſſaſſinated and buried
in my ſtead. I have ever ſince lain conceal'd in a

Aid abroad againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper of my Throne, the
Murtherer of my Brother <hi>Fedor</hi> the late Great Duke,

Love; and, ſince I have freely truſted you with

I live in hopes that you will not refuſe me your
generous Aſſiſtance in the Recovery of my Father's
Throne, which I ſhall always be ready to acknowledge

of a great Preſence of Mind, and of an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
much above his Years; and being, beſides
this, of a very handſom Aſpect; this, with the
late Rumour induſtriouſly ſpread abroad by the
Old Monk, firſt put</hi> Wiſnowiski <hi>under a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment;
but having ſoon recollected himſelf,

committed againſt a Perſon of his eminent Rank,

               </p>
               <p>Scarce a few Days were paſt before <hi>Wiſnowiski</hi>
got a moſt magnificent Equipage prepared, in ſome

               <p>This ſudden Change in the Court of <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi>
being ſoon ſpread abroad, as well in <hi>Poland</hi> as in <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
as it ſerved for a ſtrong Confirmation of what
had been whiſpered about by the Contrivances of
the Old Monk, ſo it was not long before it reached
the Ears of <hi>Boris Goudenou.</hi> He ſoon took the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54715:138"/>
at ſo unexpected and ſurprizing a piece of
News, and thinking it moſt adviſable to ſtifle this
Monſter in the Birth, he immediately diſpatch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a Meſſenger to the Duke <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> with
Orders to inform him of the Impoſture put upon
him by this pretended <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and how unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Quality it would be, to eſpouſe the Cauſe of
an Impoſtor, againſt a Legal Prince; neither was
he ſparing in his Promiſes, offering not only vaſt
Sums of Money, but alſo conſiderable Poſſeſſions to
that Duke, if he would ſurrender him dead or
alive into his Hands. But this had a quite contrary
Effect upon <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> who, being in ſome doubt
before, concerning this <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was now, by the
great Offers made by <hi>Boris,</hi> entirely confirmed in
his Opinion, that he muſt needs be the true
<hi>Demetrius;</hi> and therefore renewed his former
Reſolution of Adhering to his Intereſt, maugre
all the Temptations of <hi>Boris Goudenou.</hi> But
having wiſely conſidered with themſelves, that
he would leave nothing unattempted on his
ſide, which might facilitate the Deſtruction of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
it was judged moſt adviſable not, to expoſe
his Perſon any longer ſo near the borders of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
as was the Duke's Houſe, but to retire to
<hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> a certain place well fortified, and more

<hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> who, in the mean while returned to
his own Houſe, to get the better Intelligence of
what paſt in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> Here he was met by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meſſenger from the Great Duke, <hi>Boris Goude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou,</hi>
who not only by his Maſter's Orders, renew'd
his former Offers, but alſo promiſed more ample
Rewards, if he would ſurrender the Counterfeit
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> either dead or alive. But this Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
meeting with no better Succeſs than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he received ſecret Inſtructions to endeavour
the Deſtruction of this Impoſtor, at what rate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
not to be ſparing of Dagger or Poyſon, great
Rewards or any thing elſe which might contribute
to his Ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54715:139"/>
This was not ſo ſecretly carried on, but that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowiski</hi>
had got ſome Scent of the Deſign laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Life of his Friend; wherefore thinking
him not ſufficiently ſecured againſt the Attempts of
the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> in that place; eſpecially, ſince they
had drawn together a conſiderable Force upon the
Frontiers, it was reſolved to ſend him to <hi>George
Mniſzeck,</hi> Waywode of <hi>Sendomiria,</hi> the Duke's
particular Friend, which would both put him out
of the reach of his Enemies, and probably, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
his Pretenſions with the Intereſt of one of the
moſt conſiderable Men in all <hi>Poland.</hi> Purſuant to
this Reſolution, <hi>Demetrius</hi> being provided with
Letters of Recommendation from <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> went
to the Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria</hi>'s Houſe, by whom
he was received with all the Honour imaginable,
due to his pretended Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> being now at leiſure to make ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reflections upon the preſent poſture of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
had no reaſon to be diſſatisfied with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as being not without hopes of encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his End, with the aſſiſtance of ſuch powerful
Friends; but wiſely conſidering with himſelf, that
their firſt Heat might, by degrees, grow weak, if
not quite become cool, if not ſuſtained by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fuel to nouriſh it, he employed all his Thoughts
to eſtabliſh, by ſome means or other, his Fortune,
upon a more ſolid Foundation, than that of bare
Friendſhip. He was ſenſible, that the Perſons,
among whom he now lived, and from whom he
chiefly rely'd in reference to his Grand Deſign, were
all Zealous <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> he very well foreſaw,
that if he expected to be back'd by them in his
Pretenſions, he ought at leaſt, to ſhew ſome Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the ſame Faith, without which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that their Friendſhip would be very unſtable.
To obtain therefore this End, he thought it moſt
convenient to make his Applications to the Jeſuites,
whom, by reaſon of their great Zeal for the <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> Cauſe, and the free Acceſs and Influence
they have over Perſons of the greateſt Quality, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54715:139"/>
knew to be the moſt proper Inſtruments for the
managing of his Deſign. <hi>Demetrius</hi> therefore,
having given them ſome aſſurances of his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
towards that Religion they profeſſed; theſe
Fathers being over-joy'd at the proſpect of ſo great
a Proſelyte; under whoſe Protection, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
themſelves one day to join one of the moſt
Potent Kingdoms in the World to the Papal Chair,
were not negligent in their Duty, but readily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both their Counſels and real Aſſiſtance to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius.</hi>
After they had frequently diſcours'd him
concerning the Chief Articles of Faith, in Diſpute
betwixt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Church,
and given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſuch further Inſtructions, as they
judged moſt convenient for their preſent Purpoſe,
they were alſo not wanting in their Advice towards
the promoting of his main Deſign.</p>
               <p>They propoſed to him a Marriage with <hi>Marina,</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>George Mniſzeck,</hi> Weywode of
<hi>Sendomiria,</hi> who entertain'd him at that time in his
Houſe; ſhe was a Lady young and ſprightly, and
the Jeſuits knowing her beſides this, to be of a very
haughty Temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did not queſtion, but that
the proſpect of a Crown would be temptation too
powerful for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>o reſiſt; which would at once
ſtrengthen his Intereſt in <hi>Poland,</hi> and remove all
further Doubts, among the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Coſacks,</hi>
of his being the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Son of the Great
Duke, <hi>John Baſilovits.</hi> They repreſented to him,
that <hi>Boris Goudenon,</hi> being a great Politician, had
ſo firmly eſtabliſhed himſelf in the Throne of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> that without the aſſiſtance of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as the Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria,</hi> it would be
impoſſible for him to ſhake his Intereſt; that they
knew the Weywode to be one of the moſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men in the World; and that therefore, if he
could condeſcend to enter with him into a more
ſtrict Alliance, by Marrying his Daughter, it would
be the moſt powerful Motive to engage him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
into his Intereſt. They adviſed him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to make his Addreſſes firſt to <hi>Marina,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54715:140"/>
after he had ſounded her Inclinations, to offer the
ſame Propoſition to her Father, when they would
be ſure to back his Pretenſions with all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
they had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had already been touch'd by the
ſparkling Eyes of <hi>Marina,</hi> receiv'd this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jeſuits, with the utmoſt Satisfaction;
and being ſpurr'd on by a double Motive, to wit,
that of his Love and Intereſt, he ſought only for a fit
Opportunity to declare his Paſſion to his admir'd
Miſtreſs, which he having ſoon met with one day,
as he was walking with her in the Garden, he by
the moſt paſſionate and tender Expreſſions in the
World, endeavour'd to make her ſenſible of his
Love; which ſhe having received with a ſeeming
Indifferency, he made his next Applications to the
Weywode her Father, unto whom he repreſented
his Deſire of allying himſelf with his Family by
Marrying his Daughter, <hi>Marina,</hi> the poſſeſſion of
whom he preferr'd before the Crown, even of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
it ſelf. The Weywode, who had been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
prepared by the Jeſuits, being not in the leaſt
ſurpriſed at this Propoſition; after he had thank'd
him for the Honour he intended to do his
Family, told him, that he thought he was a
little too haſty in applying his Thoughts to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
at a time when the Eyes of the whole World
were upon him, looking for the Succeſs of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
That a Miſtreſs, at this Juncture of Time,
might prove a great Obſtacle to his Affairs; that,
as he ſtood in need of the powerful Aſſiſtance of
ſome Princes, ſo it was poſſible one or other of
them might be for fortifying their Alliances with
him by a Marriage, which, if refuſed, might
prove very prejudicial to his Affairs. He conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that as his Honour and Welfare were more dear
to him than his own Intereſt; ſo he adviſed him
to gain his Miſtreſſes Heart by the Point of his
Sword, and by opening his Paſſage to the Throne
of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Right. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who by the Father's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54715:140"/>
and the Indifferency of the Daughter, was
fully perſuaded, that the Succeſs of his Love, did
abſolutely depend from his Eſtabliſhment in the
Throne, apply'd himſelf with more than ordinary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
to the accompliſhing of his Deſign. For which
Purpoſe, he was more converſant than ever with
the Jeſuits, and having at laſt declared to them his
Reſolution of becoming a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and
Eſtabliſhing the ſame Religion in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as ſoon
as he ſhould aſcend that Throne; theſe Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over-joy'd at this Declaration, promiſed him
their utmoſt Endeavours in procuring the Aſſiſtance
both of the Holy Father, <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. and <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Being fluſh'd with theſe
hopes, he reiterated his paſſionate Addreſſes to his
Miſtreſs and the Weywode, ſo, that, at laſt he having
obtained their Conſent, in caſe he ſhould recover
his Throne, theſe following Articles were agreed
on betwixt them: <hi>That in Conſideration of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
and Aids to be given to</hi> Demetrius, <hi>he ſhould be
obliged, after his, Acceſſion to the Crown, to re-pay the</hi>
Weywode <hi>his full Charges, Marry the Lady</hi> Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<hi>his Daughter, and introduce the</hi> Roman Faith <hi>in</hi>
Muſcovy. Theſe Articles being Sign'd and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
he was by the Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria</hi> and
<hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> introduced to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who,
at the Recital of his Circumſtances, being mov'd
with Compaſſion, did not only give him a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Reception, but alſo granted him Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to levy what then he ſtood in need of, for his
intended Expedition, in his Dominions. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
turn'd to the no ſmall Advantage of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius.</hi>
For, it having been very induſtriouſly ſpread
abroad, in what a favourable Manner he had been
received by King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> this did not only much
ſtrengthen his Party in <hi>Poland,</hi> where a great many
Perſons of Quality eſpouſed his Intereſt, but alſo
had ſuch a powerful Influence upon the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
that they began to exclaim at the Treacheries of
<hi>Boris;</hi> and moſt of them out of Fear, others out
of hope of Rewards, only ſtay'd for a favourable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54715:141"/>
Opportunity to declare for him, whom they now
began to look upon as their Natural Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> having ſoon got notice, how the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
ſtood affected, and brought over to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by great Preſents, ſome of the leading Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, thought it now high Time to put his
long projected Deſign in Execution. The Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode
of <hi>Sendomiria</hi> had all this while been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in raiſing conſiderable Forces in <hi>Poland,</hi> for
this Expedition, and the Duke <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> having
alſo publickly declared for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Number of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> being encouraged by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
eſpouſed this Intereſt. Being ſtrengthened by
theſe and other Forces, which were in ſeveral parts
of the Kingdom, raiſed for his Service, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Head of them into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in the heart
of the Winter, where, being joyned by a Body of
<hi>Coſacks</hi> of 10000 Men, under their General <hi>Corclos,</hi>
who had been engaged with great Promiſes into his
Service,<note place="margin">Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>enters</hi> Muſcovy.</note> by the Artifices of the old Monk, it ſtruck
ſuch a Terror into the Inhabitants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

paſſed the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> at <hi>Kiovia,</hi> they advanced
without any Oppoſition, to the very Walls of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringow,</hi>
which upon the firſt Summons ſurrendred

Note, trod the Footſteps of the others, and put

advancing deeper into the Country, his Army was
conſiderably augmented by ſuch as flock'd in to
him from all the adjacent Cities, of which none
attempted to make the leaſt Reſiſtance, except the
City of <hi>Novogorod Sevie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

attack'd with all the Vigour imaginable. The Czar,

againſt all ſuch as ſhould perſiſt in their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

a ſolemn Ambaſſy to <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> then King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> who having immediately demanded and
obtained Audience, made moſt heavy Complaints;
<hi>That the Truce, which was ſo lately made betwixt
the two Crowns for Twenty Years, was violated by
the</hi> Poles, <hi>who without the leaſt Reaſon given, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Czar's Territories, taken his Towns, and
ravaged the Country: That he hoped the King would
take better Meaſures, and not purſue a War that was
founded upon nothing but an unjuſt Pretence, but recall
his Troops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were at that time employed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Pretenſions of a vile Impoſtor, againſt one
of the moſt potent Princes in</hi> Europe, <hi>who, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
would not want means to give himſelf Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the Damages and Affronts received from
the Crown of</hi> Poland. Neither was he ſparing in
his Promiſes, by which, and the great Preſents he
made to moſt of the Chief Miniſters and other
great Men of the Court, he hoped to obtain what
all his Remonſtrances had not been able to effect,
but in vain; for whether it were, that they look'd
upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> as the true Heir of the Crown, and
upon the Affairs of <hi>Boris</hi> as in a declining Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or that the Authority of the Pope and Jeſuits
who had eſpouſed the Intereſt of the firſt, had
made them deaf to all theſe Applications, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
was ſent back with this general Anſwer:
<hi>That the King and Commonwealth of</hi> Poland <hi>were not
concerned in what was tranſacted in</hi> Muſcovy; <hi>and
that, if</hi> Demetrius, <hi>who was a</hi> Muſcovite <hi>born, had
obtained the Aſſiſtance of ſome</hi> Poliſh <hi>Volunteers to
maintain his Pretenſions againſt the Czar</hi> Boris Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denou,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54715:142"/>
                  <hi>this could not be interpreted a Violation of
the Truce betwixt the two Crowns, which on their ſide
they would obſerve inviolably. Boris</hi> having miſſed
his Aim in <hi>Poland,</hi> diſpatched a Meſſenger to the
Camp of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to try once more his Fortune,
and to endeavour to undeceive the Wayvode of
<hi>Sendomiria,</hi> and <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> concerning the Fallacy
put upon them by the Counterfeit <hi>Demetrius.</hi> For
this End having found out one of his Uncles in
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Smyrna Otropeja,</hi> and
judging, not without Reaſon, that if he could be
confronted with <hi>Grisko Otropeja,</hi> his Nephew, his
Confeſſion would be of the greateſt Conſequence
towards the Detecting of this Impoſture; he ſent
him along with the Meſſenger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But whether the
Wayvode look'd upon that as a Contrivance of <hi>Boris
Goudenou,</hi> invented on purpoſe to blaſt the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and to ward the Blow which
ſeemed to threaten his Ruin; or that he thought

Otropeja</hi> was forbid, under pain of Death, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Camp, and the Meſſenger ſent back with
Scorn and Indignation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boris Goudenou,</hi> finding all other Means to fail, had
Recourſe to Arms, and ordered his Army, which
conſiſted of above a Hundred thouſand Men, moſt
of them Vetera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Novogorod Sevierski,</hi> which defended it ſelf
bravely againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> under the Conduct of
their Governour <hi>Boſman. Demetrius,</hi> tho' much
inferiour in Number, (being not much above
Twenty thouſand, but all choſen Men) upon the
Approach of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army, leaving the
Siege of <hi>Novogorod,</hi> poſted himſelf as advantageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he could, in ſight of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Paſſage of ſuch Officers in the Army of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
Goudenou,</hi> as being corrupted before, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to come over with their Soldiers to his Party.
But theſe ſeeing the great Diſproportion there was
betwixt the Numbers of theſe two Armies, either
quite changed their Reſolutions, or at leaſt thought
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54715:142"/>
it moſt adviſable to delay the Execution of it till a
more favourable Juncture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> therefore finding himſelf in a Poſt
from whence he could not retreat without fighting,
was forced to put the beſt Countenance he could
upon the Matter, and having nothing to truſt to
but their own Courage, the <hi>Poles</hi> fought ſo bravely,
that they not only repulſed the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who
being over confident in their Number attack'd
them with more Fury than Skill, but alſo charged
them at ſeveral times with ſo much bravery, that
the Victory remain'd doubtful for ſeveral Hours;
till at laſt the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being continually ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by freſh Troops, and the <hi>Poles</hi> quite tired by
the long Fatigues of the Day, were forced to give
way, more to the Number than the Bravery of
their Enemies,<note place="margin">Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> who at laſt entirely routed them,
(though not without a great Slaughter on their
ſide) killing 9000 of them upon the Spot, with
the loſs of all their Cannon and Baggage.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had been as careful in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as they were fortunate in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

as were retreating in ſeveral Bodies towards <hi>Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcum,</hi>
they might without queſtion have put an
End to the War at this one Stroke, or at leaſt have
driven him quite out of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> But inſtead of
purſuing their Advantage, they beſieged <hi>Krom,</hi> which
defending it ſelf with an extraordinary Bravery;
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> whilſt theſe waſted themſelves in the

expect the Return of the <hi>Waywode</hi> and <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi>
who were gone to their reſpective Countries to raiſe

               <p>Being at laſt made ſenſible of their Miſtake, they

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54715:143"/>
Courage, but having rally'd his ſcatter'd Troops, and
ordered new Levies to be made, he ſent his Spies
and Emiſſaries into the Camp of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to try
whether, by the hopes of Pardon and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they could bring over the Revolted <hi>Ruſſians</hi>
to their Allegiance to him, and eſpecially to entice
the <hi>Coſacks</hi> from <hi>Demetrius</hi> to his Party, or whether
by ſome means or other, they could not diſpatch and
ſend him to the other World. But ſome of theſe
Emiſſaries being diſcovered, and put to the Torture,
made an Ingenuous Confeſſion of the Truth, and
were without any further Puniſhment, ſent back
to <hi>Boris,</hi> with this Errand, that it was little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

Poyſon and Daggers againſt his Enemy, and that
he did not queſtion, but that before long, he ſhould
be ready to call him to a ſevere Account for this,
as well as his other treacherous Deviſes; But that,
if he would give him real Demonſtrations of his
ſincere Repentance, by ſurrendring the Crown to
him whoſe unqueſtionable Right it was, he would
grant him, and all his Adherents a general Amne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
for all paſt Crimes and Miſdemeanours.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Boris</hi> having rejected theſe Offers with Scorn,
and yet ſeeing his Adverſary encreaſe in Strength
every day, he reſolved to try the utmoſt, and
whether by one dextrous Blow, he could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
him and his Deſigns. He was not ignorant
that the main ſtrength of his Army conſiſted in the
Auxiliaries and Supplies, he from time to time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
out of <hi>Poland,</hi> and that if he could by any
means, deprive him of his foreign Aids, the reſt
would ſoon diſperſe, or at leaſt eaſily be reduced
to obedience. He wiſely conſidered, that, if a
conſiderable Diverſion could be procured to the
<hi>Poles</hi> at home, they would be obliged to recall
their Subjects out of the Service of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who
deprived of their Aſſiſtance, like a Body of its

languiſhing Condition. But the circumſtances of his
Affairs, being ſuch as not to permit him to attempt

it upon the whole Family of the Great
Duke, as we ſhall ſee anon. In the mean while,
<hi>Demetrius</hi> had commanded the greateſt Part of his

towards <hi>Krom,</hi> and endeavour its Relief, who have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Camp, he received Intelligence by the means

that he intended to come over to his Party, as ſoon
as a favourable Opportunity ſhould preſent. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porius</hi>
being reſolved to improve ſo advantageous

Number, and ſtrongly Entrench'd, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not to be attack'd, without expoſing the whole
Army, he drew them out of their advantageous
Entrenchments by the following Stratagem: He
contrived a Letter, directed to the Governour and
Chief Officers of the Garriſon of <hi>Krom,</hi> wherein,
after having highly extolled their Valour and Zeal,
and made them ample Promiſes of Rewards, he
told them, that he was advanced with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Force near the Enemies Camp, to annoy them,
and to intercept their Foragers, till the arrival of

having ſuceeded accordingly, the poor Fellow was
carried before the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> General; where have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been examined, he was forced to produce the
Letter, which, as he believ'd, was to have been
carried into the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hodwen,</hi> the General of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army,
having peruſed the Letter, and over-joy'd at the
Diſcovery of the approach of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> call'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
a Council of War, wherein it having
been judged moſt convenient, to attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
before they could be join'd by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> it
was reſolved, to leave only a ſmall Body to keep
the Avenues leading to the Town, and with the

               <p>He ſoon perceiving by the Countenance of the

but being much inferior in number, and

and other uſeleſs Perſons belonging to the
Baggage, at ſome diſtance behind the Army, with
whom having join'd ſome Soldiers, enough to
make up a Front, he order'd them, after they had
ſeen him Engag'd for ſome time, to advance in
good Order, with their Colours flying, Drums
beating, and Trumpets ſounding. Thus having
prepared every thing according to his intended
Purpoſe, he marched directly towards the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
whom he attack'd with the utmoſt Vigour;
but theſe being without intermiſſion re-inforced by
freſh Troops, gave ſo much work to the <hi>Poles,</hi> that
the Fight was very obſtinate and bloody, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54715:145"/>
latter would have been in no ſmall danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Day, had not <hi>Boſman,</hi> who Commanded

ſoon as he ſaw the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Mock Army advance, in
the greateſt heat of the Battle, with ſome of his
Party, gone over to <hi>Zaporius,</hi> and declared for
Prince <hi>Demetrius,</hi> crying out aloud to the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
that they ſhould ceaſe to fight againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Prince. Boſman</hi> being the Darling of the
common Soldiers, his Words and Example had ſuch

they cry'd,<note place="margin">The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</note> they would live and die with him.</p>
               <p>The Nobility and Chief Officers of the Army,
finding themſelves deſerted by the Soldiers, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
immediately to ſend their Deputies to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
who at that time reſided at <hi>Puttiwoll,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their Fault in having ſo long ſtood out
againſt their Prince; to implore his Pardon for
what was paſt, and to give him all the imaginable
Aſſurances of their Fidelity, for the future. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
tranſported with Joy at ſo welcome a piece
of News, loſt no time, but having immediately
put himſelf at the Head of ſuch Troops as he had
with him at <hi>Puttiwoll,</hi> march'd directly firſt to
<hi>Krom,</hi> where he cauſed <hi>Hodwen,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
General to be clapt in Irons, and from thence to
<hi>Avol,</hi> where the revolted Army lay Encamped;
Being arrived there, and having received freſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of their entire Submiſſion to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
he offer'd his Thanks to the Chief Men,
but eſpecially to <hi>Boſman</hi> and his Friends, and by his
Careſſes, ſo gain'd upon the Affections of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soldiers, that they all with one Voice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to Lead them againſt the Son of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper
of his Crown.</p>
               <p>Being thus become abſolutely Maſter of the Field
and the Army, and believing that now, he had but
one ſtep left to aſcend the Throne, to wit, to make
himſelf Maſter of the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> the Capital
of the whole Empire, he ordered every thing to
be got ready for the March. Whilſt he was thus
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54715:146"/>
advancing by ſlow Marches towards <hi>Muſco,</hi> he ſent
his Letters to the Magiſtrates of that City, wherein
he told them, he was near at hand with a moſt
Potent Army, ready to attack them at his firſt
Command; but that taking commiſeration of their
Condition, he exhorted them to make choice of the
fruits of Peace before the inevitable Calamities of
War. That if they preferred the laſt before the
firſt, they muſt be anſwerable for all the Miſeries,
which are the neceſſary Conſequences of an inteſtine
War; but as he was perſuaded they would conſult
their own Safety, he adviſed them to root out the
whole Progeny of that accurſed Traytor, <hi>Boris Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denou,</hi>
who had murder'd his Brother, the late

               <p>This Letter having been read in the Preſence of

not without Reaſon, that ſcarce any thing would

and put his Birth beyond all queſtion, than if he
were acknowledged by the Mother of the true
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had been murthered at <hi>Vgletz,</hi> he
ſent to her a Meſſenger with ſecret Diſpatches to
the Monaſtery where ſhe had been ſhut up for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Years laſt paſt, inviting her to the City of
<hi>Muſco,</hi> and the Royal Palace. She, who ſaw her
ſelf thus at once freed from ſo long a Confinement,
and at the ſame time put in a Condition to revenge
her ſelf of the Barbarities committed againſt her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by the Treachery of <hi>Boris Goudenou,</hi> accepted
theſe Offers without the leaſt Reluctancy.</p>
               <p>As She was approaching the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> with
a moſt magnificent Train. <hi>Demetrius</hi> her pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Son, met her at five or ſix Miles diſtance from
the City, and as ſoon as he eſpied the Coach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe was, diſmounted, and came up to ſalute
her on foot and bare-headed. At their Meeting,
after the moſt tender Expreſſions, he ſhewed her
all the Marks of Reſpect due from a Son to his
Mother in a private Condition, and as he reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her with a more than filial Duty, ſo ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with all poſſible Demonſtrations of a
moſt tender and ſincere Affection, their mutual
Careſſes and Embraces being accompanied with
Tears. She urg'd him ſeveral times to come into
her Coach, which he as often refuſed, and would
walk by, on foot and bare-headed, till the Empreſs
telling him that ſhe would do the ſame if he did not
gratifie her in her Requeſt, with much ado, perſwaded
him to remount his Horſe. Thus having condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
her to the Palace, they renewed their former

Demonſtrations of mutual Satisfaction in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

tranſacted in the Face of the World, appear'd to
the People the moſt evident Proofs that could be
given of the reality of his Birth, as being founded
upon the publick Confeſſion of the ſame Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that bare him; ſo that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſeem'd ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſatisfied concerning the Reality of his
Extraction, that by the common Conſent of
the whole Nation, it was put beyond all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Demetrius</hi> had not many Months enjoyed
the Royal Dignity and the Affections of his Subjects,
before the Chief of the Nobility (who had always
entertained ſome Jealouſies concerning the Legality
of his Title and Extraction) began to perceive his
manner of Life to be far different from that of the
Great Dukes, his Predeceſſors; ſome of the moſt
refined among them, diſcerning in his whole Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
a certain Lightneſs, not bearing the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Grandeur of his High Station; and
tho' they knew him to be endowed with a ready
Wit, and a ſufficient Stock of Courage, yet had
they obſerved in all his Tranſactions, but a very
ſlender ſhare of Judgment, eſpecially in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Publick Affairs relating to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The Common People, whoſe Judgment
ſeldom reaches further than the out-ſide of things,
having obſerved his Habit, Manners and Geſtures, to
be wholly Foreign, concluded his Inclinations to be
the ſame. For he frequently uſed to appear in
<hi>Poliſh</hi> and other Foreign Habits, he ſeldom bathed,
and ſcarce ever ſlept after Dinner, according to
the general Cuſtom of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> he would
carry his Dogs along with him into the <hi>Muſcovite</hi>
Churches, he would eat Calves Fleſh, and not
bow to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> all which being abominable
to the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> a People ſuperſtitious to a degree
of Madneſs, contributed not a little to the Hatred
which the Populacy conceived againſt his Perſon.
But what moſt enflamed both the Nobility and
People was, that they ſaw their immenſe Treaſures
waſted in a few Months, among his Players, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,
and Mimicks, who made it their whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to flatter and encourage him in his Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to which he was naturally inclined; which
made him neglect the Management of Publick
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54715:148"/>
Affairs and commit the Adminiſtration of Juſtice
to Foreigners. They ſaw the Jeſuits erect moſt
magnificent Churches and Dwelling-places, and
the Great Duke himſelf, not only to follow the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion, but alſo publickly to deſpiſe
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and to endeavour to introduce
the <hi>Latin;</hi> by all which he drew upon himſelf
the Scorn of the Nobility and the Hatred of the
People.</p>
               <p>But nothing contributed ſo much to his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as his final Reſolution of Marrying a <hi>Roman</hi>

of his Affairs, who were unanimouſly of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that he ſhould not ſpare any of the Heads
of this Conſpiracy, but by bringing them all to
condign Puniſhment, would ſtrike ſuch a Terror
into the reſt, as not to dare for the future to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
in ſuch ill Deſigns. They repreſented to
him, how that <hi>Zuski</hi> being by his Mothers ſide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
to the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and a Man of
a very aſpiring Temper, did without queſtion aim
at the Crown, and therefore it behoved him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelf againſt ſo dangerous a Rival, now
Fortune had put it into his Hands, and he had the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54715:152"/>
faireſt in the World of putting an End to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
without the leaſt blame of Injuſtice. But
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> as if hurried on by ſome fatal Stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his own Deſtiny, was for chuſing the milder
Way; and, when <hi>Zuski</hi> was upon the Scaffold,
ready to receive the fatal Blow, not only ſent him
his Pardon, but ſoon after received him into his
particular Favour, vainly imagining to engage him
thereby to eſpouſe his Intereſt for the future.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Baſili-Zuski</hi> was ſo far from acknowledging
the Benefit received at his Hands, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
his Ambition being now back'd by Revenge, he
fully reſolved to encompaſs his Deſign, and to find
out means to diſpatch this Impoſtor, in ſpite of all
the Obſtacles that might fall in his way. For which
Reaſon he invited the moſt Eminent <hi>Knez</hi> and <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi>
whom he knew to be of his Party, to his
Houſe, and having again repreſented to them the
preſent dangerous Condition of the Empire under

as he was ready to ſacrifice once more his Life, and

chearful Concurrence and Aſſiſtance in a matter,
from whence depended the Welfare both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Poſterity. The whole Aſſembly,
after having given their hearty Thanks to <hi>Zuski</hi> for
his Zeal in the common Cauſe, ſolemnly promiſed
to aſſiſt him to the utmoſt of their Power in his
laudable Deſign, and to be ready at hand, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſhould meet with a favourable Opportunity
of putting it in Execution; There were not a few
among them, who were of Opinion, that the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ought to be diſpatch'd immediately, and that
Delays of this nature, did often prove dangerous;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54715:153"/>
but the Arguments of the wiſer Sort prevail'd, by
whoſe Advice the Execution of it was delay'd, till
the Celebrating of the Nuptials of <hi>Demetrius</hi> with
<hi>Marina.</hi> There were ſeveral pregnant Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for this Delay: Conſidering that they had
not all their Friends ready at hand, who in the
mean while, under pretence of aſſiſting at the
Nuptial Solemnity might meet all together in the
City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> without the leaſt Suſpicion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, whilſt they were at Court, taken up
with their Jollities, they might with the leſs Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
put their Deſign in execution. There was
alſo another Reaſon no leſs prevailing than the reſt,
which was, that after the arrival of the Bride, they
were in hopes to recover the Crown Jewels, which
were ſent to her as a Preſent into <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſoon after his Coronation had

a Day appointed for an Extraordinary Feaſt in

among them, that at the cloſing of the
Feaſt, when the whole Court ſhould be buried in
ſtrong Liquor, and Sleep, ſhould be the beginning
of the Tragedy they intended to act the next
Morning. The very ſame Night there happned a
certain Accident, which had been likely to have
once more ſpoil'd their whole Deſign.</p>
               <p>For a certain young Fellow who was privy to the
Conſpiracy, drinking with ſome of the Guards,
and being elevated by the Force of the ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
had unwarily let fall ſome Words in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning this intended Conſpiracy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
being ſeized and brought before <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
he order'd him immediately to be put to the Rack,
to extort from him the whole truth of the Deſign.
But ſome of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Lords, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Plot, and in the moſt imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that could be of being diſcovered, told the
Grand Duke, that it was eaſily to be ſeen, that the
young Fellow's Brains were intoxicated by the
Strength of the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and that therefore it
would be a Madneſs to make the leaſt Reflection
upon what he ſaid while he was drunk. <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
hurried on by his malignant Fate to his approaching
Deſtiny, being alſo hot-headed with the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Wine he had drank that Day, followed the
deceitful Advice of his mortal Enemies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
the young Fellow for time, with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have him further examined the next day,

               <p>The Beginning of their projected Deſign having
thus ſucceeded according to Wiſh, <hi>Knez Baſili-Zuski</hi>
at the Head of this Party and a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People, having by the Maſſacre of the <hi>Poles</hi>

directly with their Scymeters in their Hands towards

Silence and Security, every Soul there being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with Sleep, Wearineſs and ſtrong Liquor,
to that Degree, that the Conſpirators were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Gates of the Royal Palace before they
took the Alarm within. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> being one of
the firſt that awaken'd by the Noiſe and Out-cries
of thoſe that were Maſſacring all they met within
the Caſtle, got to one of the Windows, and having
ſoon underſtood the true Meaning of this Tumult, he
call'd to <hi>Boſman</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen of his

taken what Weapons they could meet with, on a

who preſs'd forward to enter the Great Duke's
Apartment, <hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf appearing among
them, arm'd with a Halbard, wherewith he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched
ſome of the moſt forward of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators;
but ſome of them being provided with
Piſtols and Muskets, they diſcharged ſo furiouſly
upon the Great Duke and his Company, that moſt
of them being ſlain, (among whom was <hi>Boſman,</hi>
who was ſtabb'd with a Dagger,) <hi>Demetrius</hi> was
forced to retire, and being purſued from Chamber
to Chamber, at laſt threw himſelf out of the
Window, down into one of the Courts,
from whence, tho' ſorely bruiſed, he at laſt got
into the Fortreſs of the Caſtle guarded by <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſpirators being enraged at their having
miſs'd their Prey, fell a ranſacking the Great
Dukes Apartment, and forcing their Way with
their Scymeters thro' the Bodies of a few Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
that were left, entred the Grand Duke's Bed-Chamber,
whither all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ladies of Quality
were retired, and at the Approach of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
appeared half dead and immovable, like Statues, for
fear, not being able to utter one Word, unleſs it
were a certain ancient Lady, who ſomewhat more
confident than the reſt, by reaſon of her great Age,
anſwered the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Lords that were enquiring
where the Great Dutcheſs was? <hi>That at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Tumult ſhe had found means, to get away
as ſhe believed, to her Father's Palace.</hi> Having
ſearch'd all over the Room, and not being able
to find her, they were reſolved to try whether they
could put Life into the Ladies, and reſtore to them
that Natural Motion they had loſt by this ſudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
and ſo to work they went, every one
catching hold of her he liked beſt; and thus having
ſatisfied their brutiſh Luſt, they were going to leave
the Room, in further Purſuit after <hi>Demetrius.</hi> It is to
be obſerved that among all the Ladies that were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54715:156"/>
there, but two eſcaped their Violences; the firſt
was the Lady Palatine of <hi>Lamoc,</hi> we mentiond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſecured more by her Wrinkles and Grey Hair
than out of any Reſpect to her Perſon; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lady that ſate very ſick in a large Elbow-Chair,
One of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Lords, as they were Juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, hapning to caſt his Eyes that way, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome Motion behind that Chair, and being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to know the Meaning of it, advanced that
Way, where having pulled up the Hangings he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the poor affrighted <hi>Marina,</hi> who as ſhe
was of an extraordinary Preſence of Mind, look'd
upon them with ſo Majeſtick an Air, that they
all withdrew without offering any further Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>By this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Conſpirators being advertiſed
that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had ſaved himſelf among the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
that guarded the Fortreſs of the Caſtle, they
march'd thither and attack'd the Fort with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Fury; but theſe within being encouraged by
the Preſence of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who notwithſtanding
the Violent Bruiſes occaſioned by his leaping out of
the Widow, fought in this Extremity like a Lion,
with a Reſolution rather to die with his Scymeter
in his Hand than to be expoſed to the Scorn of his
Enemies, they were repulſed with great Slaughter;
but their Strength increaſing with their Number,
they renew'd the Aſſault ſeveral times, but were as
often repulſed, till the Garriſon by their Threats
was at laſt prevailed upon to ſurrender the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Demetrius</hi> into their Hands.</p>
               <p>From thence they led him,<note place="margin">

ragged Coat about him, thro' the Streets of the
City in Triumph, under the Imprecations and
Scorns of the Rabble, who pointed Fingers
into his very Eyes, pluck'd him by the Noſe
and Chin, asking him whether he was now <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
or <hi>Grisko?</hi> All which he bore with a moſt
admirable Conſtancy, not ſo much as uttering one
Word, and ſcarce changing his Countenance. But
coming near the Market-place, and perceiving a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54715:157"/>
great number of the dead Bodies of the <hi>Poles</hi> ſlain
by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> wallowing in their own Blood,
he could not refrain from ſhedding of Tears, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
a greater Senſe of their Sufferings than his
own; telling them, that if they would but have
ſpared his Friends, he ſhould not have grumbled
at his own Fate, tho' perhaps the moſt ſevere, and
not to be parallel'd in Hiſtory, as being their lawful
Sovereign, and Youngeſt Son to their Grand Duke
<hi>John Baſilovits;</hi> for the Confirmation of which he
would appeal to his Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The People being not a little ſtartled at his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Behaviour, began to abate of their former
Fierceneſs, and having ſent Knez</hi> Baſili-Zuski <hi>to
the Empreſs Dowager, to learn from her own
Mouth the whole Truth of the Matter, he return'd
ſoon after with this Anſwer;</hi> That the Empreſs
Dowager, his pretended Mother, had declared to
him, upon the Croſs, that he was no Son of hers, and
what ſhe had done before, in acknowledging him as
ſuch, had been done, partly to obtain her Freedom,
and partly to revenge her ſelf upon the Family of
<hi>Boris Goudenou</hi> for the Murther of her Son <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer having been ſoon ſpread among the
People, a certain <hi>Muſcovite</hi> thronging thro' the
Croud that ſurrounded <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with his Piſtol
ready cock'd in his Hand, and coming up cloſe to
him, <hi>Thou infamous Traitor,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of thy Impoſture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius <hi>kill'd.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo ſhot him thro' the
Heart that he fell dead the ſame Inſtant at his Feet,
thoſe that ſtood neareſt, wounding the dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs
with their Scymeters and Pikes, and after they
had ſtript and mangled it ſo as ſcarce to be known,
dragg'd it thro' the Streets of the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all manner of Barbarities upon the dead
Body of the ſame Perſon, whom within a few
Months before they both dreaded and adored.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Splendor of the Nuptials darkned
by the fatal End of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who after he had
ſcarce taſted the Sweets of a Diadem, and the Joys
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54715:157"/>
of a fair Bride, was ſnatch'd away from both by
the ſame Fate, that, not many Months before, had
exalted him to this ſublime Station, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as it ſeems, to make his fall the more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</p>
               <p>It is a controverted Point to this day, not only
among a great many of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> but eſpecially
betwixt the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> whether he was an
Impoſtor or not. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were engag'd
on <hi>Boris Goudenou</hi>'s and <hi>Baſili-Zuski</hi>'s ſide, ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
maintain the firſt, and for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this their Opinion, alledge, that it was
put beyond all queſtion by the Evidence of the
Empreſs Dowager, and <hi>Baſili-Zuski</hi> himſelf, who
managed the Funeral Solemnities of the true <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
ſlain at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz,</hi> and aſſerted that he was certainly
murthered by the Aſſaſſins ſent for that purpoſe by
<hi>Boris Goudenou;</hi> and that the owning of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor
to be the true <hi>Demetrius</hi> by <hi>Zuski,</hi> proceeded
from his fear of being Maſſacred by the People, as
that of the Empreſs owes its Origin to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe had to him for her Liberty and the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſhe received of being revenged of the <hi>Bori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>

affirming, that what the <hi>Swedes</hi> relate of him, is

Enemies, on purpoſe to encompaſs their Deſigns
of ſnatching the Crown from the true Family of
the Great Duke <hi>Baſilovits;</hi> That the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who
were not concern'd ſo nearly in the Matter as the
<hi>Poles,</hi> and that not till ſeveral years after the Fray
was begun, ought not to be look'd upon as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges of this Controverſie; That it would
be ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that ſo many Perſons of
Quality in <hi>Poland,</hi> and the King himſelf could be
thus impoſed upon; that it was not very likely,
that the Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria,</hi> would have thus
engag'd in his Intereſt, and promiſed him his
Daughter in Marriage, if, beſides the great Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
he had with that <hi>Demetrius</hi> at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz,</hi> he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54715:158"/>
had not had very evident Proofs of the reality of
his Extraction. That the firſt Declaration of the
Empreſs <hi>Dowager,</hi> was without queſtion real, and
that the pretended denial made afterwards to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſili-Zuski,</hi>
concerning this <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was extorted
from her by Fear; beſides that, it was only found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Faith of <hi>Baſili-Zuski,</hi> who, as it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appear'd afterwards; was his Rival for the
Crown of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and ſucceeded him in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>But we muſt purſue our Tragedy, which did not
end with the Death of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> For, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a conſiderable number of <hi>Poles</hi> quartered in the
more remote Parts of the City, who being involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Drink and Sleep, had not as yet heard the
leaſt Tidings of what had paſt in and about the
Caſtle; and the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> fearing, not without
Reaſon, that if they ſhould take the Alarm upon ſo
ſurpriſing an Occaſion, they would ſell their Lives
at a very dear rate, they reſolved to draw them into
the Trap, before they could have any notice of
this Accident. For this purpoſe, certain Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were diſpatch'd with counterfeit Orders from
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> to appear forthwith in the Caſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Arms, the Grand Duke being reſolved,
that at the Day of a general Rejoycing, nothing
of Terror ſhould appear at his Nuptials. The <hi>Poles,</hi>
not ſuſpecting the concealed Fraud of this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Meſſage, came forth without their Arms, thus
tamely expoſing themſelves to the Slaughter,
which was executed upon them with a more
than barbarous Cruelty, very few eſcaping the hands
of the bloody <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> except ſome Gentlemen
of Quality, who having ſcatter'd ſome Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rabble, had thereby an Opportunity
given them to gather into a ſmall Body, and ſo
hew'd their Way thro' their Enemies, till they came
to the Palace of <hi>George Mniſzeck,</hi> Weywode of
<hi>Sendomiria,</hi> Father-in-Law to the Great Dutcheſs,
where was alſo the Duke <hi>Wiſnowiski,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords, who having opened their way
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54715:158"/>
by their Scymiters to this Palace, which was pretty
ſtrong, were reſolved to defend it to the utmoſt,
and at leaſt not to ſell their Lives at a cheap rate.
Neither was it long before they ſaw themſelves ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
on all ſides by an infinite number of their
Enemies, who with great Fury attack'd them on
all ſides, but with little Succeſs, for, the <hi>Poles</hi>
having no other Sanctuary left them, fought like
deſperate Men, and as often as they were attack'd
by the Enemies, drove them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> back with a great
Slaughter, ſo that at laſt their Fury being quell'd
by the difficulty of the Enterprize, and the Blood
of their Comerades, they thought fit to leave the
<hi>Poles,</hi> who thus ſaved themſelves by their own
Bravery, by giving ſuch Teſtimonies of their
Courage to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as made them ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſenſible that if the reſt of the <hi>Poles</hi> had been alive,
they would not have rid themſelves at ſo cheap a
rate of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and that they were more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the Conduct of <hi>Zuski,</hi> than their own
Courage for the Succeſs of this Conſpiracy. To
revenge themſelves of the Affront received at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
Palace, they fell upon the Jewellers,
and other foreign Merchants that were lodged up
and down the City, of whom they kill'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part, ſome few eſcaping into the Houſes of the
Ambaſſadors of the ſeveral Nations, to whom they
belonged, where, by the Interceſſion of the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men of the Conſpiracy, they found a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary

               <p>THE next following night, having put an end
to the Maſſacre and Tumult, the Boyars and
other Lords of the Empire met two days after, to
concert meaſures about the Election of a new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
The deference they all paid to <hi>Zuski,</hi> as
the Contriver and Chief Leader of the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,

               <p>
                  <hi>Baſili-Zuski,</hi> who beforehand had ſufficient

not queſtioning but that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reſt, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his late Service, would alſo, without much
difficulty, be brought over to his Party, took this
Opportunity to tell them; That he was over-joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee the ſame Satisfaction in their Faces, which
they had teſtified by their Words, in reference to
the late Enterprize, contrived and executed by his
directions; That, as the Greatneſs of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi>
Empire was chiefly owing to the extraordinary
Feats of that renowned Emperour, <hi>John Baſilovits,</hi>
ſo the preſent ill poſture of their Affairs muſt be
attributed to the Perfidiouſneſs, Murders, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation
of <hi>Boris Goudenou:</hi> That, to deliver
them from this Uſurper, and to revenge upon him
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54715:159"/>
the Death of the two Sons of <hi>John Baſilovits,</hi> he
had been prevail'd upon to acknowledge the laſt
Great Duke for the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and rightful
Heir of the Crown. But this Impoſtor, having
trampled both upon their Laws and Religion, he
had twice ventur'd his Life to reſcue them from
his unſupportable Tyranny; and ſince now God
Almighty had bleſs'd their projected Deſign with
Succeſs, by the aſſiſtance of their Zeal and Courage
for the common Cauſe, whereby the Royal Line
being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extinguiſhed, they were now in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of a Free People, unto whom was devolved
the whole Right of Election, it was their Duty
not to let ſlip ſo favourable an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing
their Affairs, according to the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Conſtitution of that Great Monarchy, which
they ought to look upon as the only ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereupon to build ſo vaſt a Structure. That,
as for his part, he was very ready to aſſiſt them
with his Counſel, and ſuch Obſervations as he had
opportunity to make during the ſpace of thirty or
forty Years, in the moſt conſiderable Employments
in the Kingdom; being ſenſible that their future Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
would depend from the Choice they were
now going to make of a Perſon fit to fill the Throne
of this vaſt Empire. That (if they would follow his
Advice) a Perſon of mean Extraction would by no
means be qualified to anſwer their Expectation,
and to command ſo many Perſons of an eminent
Rank, who would not without Reluctancy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his Commands, or at leaſt claim a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to controul his Orders, and to have a ſhare in
the Adminiſtration of the Government. That a
young Prince would be inſufficient to undergo
the Burthen, at the preſent juncture of Time, that
it was to be fear'd he would be more mindful of
his Pleaſures, than the Troubles and Fatigues of ſo
great a Charge, and by neglecting his Duty, and
laying the Weight thereof upon other Men's Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
make their preſent Condition worſer, inſtead of
mending it. That therefore they had no other way
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54715:160"/>
left them at this time, than to caſt their Eyes upon
a Perſon in the Commonwealth, fitly qualified for
the Management of ſo great an Empire, at the worſt
of Times. That, to anſwer this End, they ough to
chuſe One advanced in Years, of an Illuſtrious Birth,
and well vers'd, by many Years Experience in
the Management of publick Affairs; one of approved
Valour and Conduct, meaſuring his Intereſt by that
of the State, and conſtantly adhering to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and moſt ancient Cuſtoms; From ſuch a one
it is (concluded he) that we may with Reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Redreſs of thoſe Miſchiefs which have in the
late Reigns overwhelmed this Empire, and ſee it
reſtored to its former flouriſhing Condition.</p>
               <p>There were very few in the Aſſembly, who did
not perceive that <hi>Baſili-Zuski,</hi> in the Deſcription
he had given of his Prince to fill the Throne of
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> had pointed directly at himſelf; They
knew him to be deſcended of one of the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Families in the whole Empire, and by his
long and many Services, both in Peace and War,
trained up in the Management of the State, ſo that
meeting, in his Perſon, with all the neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
for ſo great a Truſt, after ſome days De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
by the Suffrages of the Nobility, he was elected
and proclaimed Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> in the Month
of <hi>June,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baſili Zus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi> made Emperour.</note> in the Year 1606, about a Month after
the Maſſacre of <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baſili-Zuski,</hi> being thus placed in the Throne,
was ſoon after Crowned with the uſual Solemnities:
The firſt thing he did, was to ſend <hi>Marina,</hi> with all
her Moveables ſhe brought along with her out of
<hi>Poland</hi> (except the Crown Jewels) to her Father's
Palace, where he placed a ſtrong Guard, under
pretence of preſerving them from the Outrages of
the Common People, but in effect to obſerve their
Motions, and to ſecure them as his Priſoners, till he
ſaw how the Treatment the <hi>Poles</hi> had met with
in <hi>Muſco</hi> would be reliſh'd at the Court of <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi>
And the better to palliate the late Maſſacre,
he publiſhed his Declaration, ſtiling <hi>Demetrius</hi> an
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54715:160"/>
Impoſtor, Heretick, and Tyrant, and that the moſt
imminent Danger, unto which both Church and
State were reduced, under his ſhort but unfortunate
Reign, had forced him againſt his Inclinations to
embark in a Deſign to deliver his Native Country
from Death and Confuſion, which, tho' ſomewhat
cruel in the Execution, yet by its abſolute Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Juſtice of the Cauſe, and happy Event, was
ſufficiently juſtifiable to all the World.</p>
               <p>This Sugar-plumb, tho' it was greedily ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the giddy-headed Multitude, who being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Extreams, and fond of Novelties, ſhewed
their Approbation by digging up the dead Carcaſs of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> which with moſt horrible Imprecations,
(in which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> excell moſt other Nations)
they burnt and threw the Aſhes into the Air, yet did
it not reliſh ſo well with the <hi>Poles,</hi> but that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding
all his ſpecious Pretences, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to call him to a ſevere Account for the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
committed upon their Country-men.</p>
               <p>Neither was it long before they met with an
Opportunity to revenge themſelves, and to give
very ſenſible Proofs of their utmoſt Reſentments
againſt <hi>Zuski,</hi> the Contriver and chief Actor of that
Tragedy. For, tho' the dead Body of the late <hi>Demetrius</hi>
was expoſed to publick View for ſeveral days, it
was ſo mangl'd and hack'd by the Fury of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
that it was impoſſible to be known even by
the neareſt of his Friends. Which <hi>Schacopski,</hi> the
Lord Chancellor of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and one of his moſt
truſty Friends having got notice of, he made his
Eſcape with two or three more whom he knew to
be abſolutely in his Intereſt, to the City of <hi>Putti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woll,</hi>
which had always ſtood vigorous for <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
from the firſt time he entred <hi>Muſcovy</hi> with
an Army. As they were travelling upon the Road
at ſome diſtance from the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> they
made it their Buſineſs to ſpread it about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not dead, that the People
during the Tumult had apprehended and maſſacred
another in his place, he having at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54715:161"/>
of the Diſorder ſaved himſelf by Flight.
They ſhewed to ſeveral Inn-keepers, the Great Seal
of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> telling them at their Departure, that
in a little time they ſhould know what a great
Gueſt they had entertain'd that Night. They were
alſo very profuſe of their Gold, all which ſerving for
a Confirmation of what they had heard them ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they took it as an undoubted Truth; and the
more they were enjoin'd Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, the more eager
were they in Whiſpering it about among their
Friends, ſo that in a little time it became currant
News in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> where it having been
encouraged and improved by ſome ſecret Friends of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> there was ſcarce a Meeting where this
ſurprizing News was not the chief Subject of their
Diſcourſe, every one judging of the Matter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Sentiment.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>George Schacopski</hi> was, with
his Friends, arriv'd at <hi>Puttiwoll,</hi> from whence ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
immediately diſpatch'd a Meſſenger into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with Letters to the Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria</hi>'s
Lady, wherein he gave her a full Relation of the
Conſpiracy form'd by <hi>Zuski</hi> and his Party againſt
her Son-in-Law, but that by a peculiar Providence he
had ſaved himſelf in time by Flight, and was retir'd
to a Place of Security, from whence he would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
return at the Head of a conſiderable Army
to revenge the Death of his Friends upon theſe
Traitors. That her Husband alſo had by his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
eſcaped the Fury of the enraged Multitude,
and remained in good Health in the City of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co;</hi>
and that in a little time he hoped to give her
a more ample Account of the further Succeſs of
their Affairs.</p>
               <p>Having ſent away the Meſſenger with theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches,
he immediately demanded Audience, in
the Great Duke, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> his Maſter's Name,
which being ſoon granted, he appear'd in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
the next day, where having highly extoll'd
the Zeal of the Citizens of <hi>Puttiwoll,</hi> in having
been the firſt that eſpouſed the Intereſt of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54715:161"/>
in the very Infancy of his Affairs, and their
Conſtancy in perſevering ever ſince ſtedfaſt in
their Loyalty to their Natural Prince; he told them
how <hi>Zuski,</hi> the preſent Uſurper, prompted by his
immenſurable Ambition of putting the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own Head, had with his party form'd a
Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the Grand Duke
<hi>Demetrius;</hi> that, to facilitate their Helliſh Deſign,
they had maſſacred a great number of innocent
Perſons in their Beds, againſt all the Laws of
Hoſpitality, and afterwards intended to have done
the ſame to the Great Duke himſelf, whom they
intended to have ſurprized in his Palace; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been ſtopt for a little while by the Reſiſtance
made by his truſty Servants, he had by a peculiar
Providence of God Almighty, got into his Stables,
where being furniſhed with ſome of his ſwifteſt
Horſes, he was with a few of his particular Friends
eſcap'd the Fury of the People, and had directed his
Courſe to <hi>Poland,</hi> from whence he ſoon hoped
to return with ſo conſiderable a Force as to be
able to reduce his rebellious Subjects to Obedience.
He told them that he had recommended to his Care
the Affairs of the whole Empire in his Abſence;
for the Confirmation of which, he produced the
Great Seal of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> and that he had given him
a moſt particular Charge to ſatisfie his faithful Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Puttiwoll,</hi> that he was alive and in a place
of Security. He further added, that having had
ſuch conſtant and evident Proofs of their Loyalty,
he had, in Obedience to his Maſter's Commands,
taken the direct Road to this City, to diſcharge
himſelf of his Commiſſion, and to give them freſh
Aſſurances of the Grand Duke's Favour which they
had at this time the beſt Opportunity in the World
to improve to their Advantage, if, as they had
done heretofore, they would by their Stedfaſtneſs

               <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> in the mean while had not been idle,
but having received Intelligence, that a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Party in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> had declared for <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
they were over-joy'd to have found ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th of their Countrymen, Maſſacred in their
Quarters, againſt the Laws of Nations; for which
purpoſe, they maintain'd a Correſpondency with
<hi>Schacopski,</hi> whom they inform'd that they had found
out a certain Gentleman in <hi>Poland,</hi> not unlike in
his Perſon to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who intended to appear
at the Head of a conſiderable Army in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
In the mean while they had got together a Body
of twelve thouſand <hi>Coſacks,</hi> under the Command
of one <hi>John Polutnich,</hi> who being ſent by this new
<hi>Demetrius</hi> to reinforce the Army, that lay Encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
near the Gates of the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> was by
his ſpecial Commiſſion conſtituted General over all
his Forces.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Polutnich</hi> was a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> by Birth, and now
a Soldier of Fortune; he had been bred among the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> and ſerv'd his Apprenticeſhip in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> where he had made himſelf famous
for his extraordinary Atchievments, till at laſt he
was taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and made a Gally Slave;
but by good Fortune reſcued by the <hi>Venetians;</hi>
from thence he took his way through <hi>Poland,</hi> where
having met with this new <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he obtained
of him the Command over his whole Army; <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutnich,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54715:163"/>
therefore having, purſuant to his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
join'd the Forces before <hi>Muſco,</hi> ſhew'd his
Orders to <hi>Iſthoma,</hi> who was forced to obey, but
being extreamly diſguſted at the Affront put upon
him, to ſee himſelf thus neglected, and another
to reap the fruits of his Victory; he, with ten
thouſand Men, whom he had debauch'd before, and
brought over to his Party, went over to <hi>Zuski,</hi>
who receiv'd him no leſs than his Tutelar Angel,
to whom he was indebted for his preſent Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
eſpecially when he aſſured both him and the
People, that there was no ſuch Man as <hi>Demetrius</hi>
at <hi>Puttiwoll;</hi> and that the whole was only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of <hi>Schacopski,</hi> who by theſe Intrigues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make himſelf the more Conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The whole City being not a little over-joy'd at
theſe comfortable Tydings, the People as well as
the Nobility, ſent their Deputies into the Camp to
<hi>Polutnich.</hi> The firſt deſired, that they might be
admitted into the Preſence of <hi>Demetrius</hi> their
Prince, and that they were ready to proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at his Feet, and to beg pardon for their paſt
Offences. Thoſe of the Nobility repreſented to
the General, how miſerably he was impoſed upon
by the Artifices of <hi>Schacopski;</hi> that the true <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
whoſe Intereſt he had eſpouſed was in the
preſence of a great many Thouſands ſlain in the
City of <hi>Muſco;</hi> and therefore, whoever ſince had
aſſumed his Name, and counterfeited his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
muſt needs be an Impoſtor, from whom
he could expect neither Honour nor Profit; That
therefore, he would be much better adviſed to
leave his Party, and to ſpare the Effuſion of
Chriſtian Blood, by acknowledging <hi>Zuski</hi> for the
lawful Sovereign of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who would not fail
to heap upon him ſuch Honours and Dignities, as
ſhould be ſuitable to his Merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polutnich</hi> anſwer'd like a Man of Honour, that he
was ſorry to underſtand that they took him to be
like <hi>Iſthoma,</hi> a Traytor both to his Maſter and
Country; That they did him wrong in entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54715:163"/>
ſo mean an Opinion of him; That, tho' he
was a Soldier of Fortune, he would never give
<hi>Demetrius</hi> the leaſt Occaſion of repenting himſelf
of the Truſt he had put in him. That the Prince
was certainly in <hi>Poland,</hi> where he had ſeen and
ſpoke with him, and had from his own hands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this Commiſſion of being General of this
Army. That if they were ſo nearly touch'd, as
they pretended, in their Conſciences, with the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of Humane Blood, the beſt way to prevent
it would be, to return to their true Allegiance, and
pay to their lawful Prince due Obedience, and as
a Pledge of their future Fidelity, and of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
for what was paſt, to deliver up into his
Hands the Uſurper of his Crown. That this was
the only means left them to prevent theſe Evils,
which they dreaded, and by which they might
hope to deſerve their Pardon, and to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
their Wives and Children, and the whole
City from deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Muſco,</hi> being in no wiſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with <hi>Polutnich</hi>'s Anſwer, which ſerved them
for a Confirmation of what they had received from
<hi>Iſthoma</hi> before, to wit; That there was no ſuch
Man as <hi>Demetrius,</hi> either in the Camp, or any
where elſe; and encourag'd by the late Defection of
<hi>Iſthoma;</hi> they reſolved unanimouſly to ſtand by
<hi>Zuski,</hi> and not to hearken to any further Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but to treat <hi>Polutnich</hi> as an Enemy of their
Country. Purſuant to this Reſolution, moſt of
the young Men inhabiting the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> were
put in Arms, and being join'd with ſuch regulated
Troops as were brought over by <hi>Iſthoma,</hi> they made
a furious ſally with a hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men;
and, attacking the <hi>Demetrian</hi> General
on all ſides in his Entrenchments, forced him to
retreat to <hi>Catuga, Zuski,</hi> after a few days ſpent in

               <p>Some time was beſtow'd in raiſing the neceſſary
Recruits, ſo that <hi>Polutnich,</hi> in the mean while,
having recovered Breath, ſaw himſelf once more
in a Condition to appear with a conſiderable Body
in the Field, which having afreſh Alarm'd the

with a very formidable Army.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Demetrians,</hi> tho' much inferior in Number,
being as forward as they to come to Blows, both
Armies were drawn up in order of Battle, in a
great Plain, not many Miles from the City of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and were juſt upon the point of Engaging one
another, when a Body of five thouſand <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
which were poſted in the Front of the left Wing of
the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Army, inſtead of attacking the
Enemy, ran over to them, all in a Body, which
having put <hi>Polutnich,</hi> and the whole Army into a

to avoid fighting, and to retreat to <hi>Thula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zuski</hi> falling in their Rear, cut off a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of them, cloſely purſuing the reſt
to the Walls of the City, which was immediately
after, ſurrounded by the whole Army, and attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all the Fury imaginable; The beſieged
having in their Retreat, been forced to leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them all their Artillery and Ammunition,
were very ill provided with ſuch Things as were
neceſſary to ſuſtain a Siege; nevertheleſs, truſting
in their Courage, they defended themſelves ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſeeing themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:54715:167"/>
in the mean while, was not a little amaz'd,
that he received not the leaſt News out of <hi>Poland,</hi>

of <hi>Thula,</hi> who ſaw themſelves reduced to
that Extremity, as to be forced to feed upon Cats,
Dogs, Horſes, and ſuch like Things, without hopes
of Relief, began to be mutinous, and to accuſe
both <hi>Schacopski</hi> and <hi>Polutnich,</hi> of having betrayed
them by their fictitious Inſinuations, as if their
Great Duke, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> were alive in <hi>Poland,</hi> which
if he had been, he would not have fail'd to give
them his Aſſiſtance in this Extremity. <hi>Schacopski</hi>

to the Strength of his Enemies; and, that, if
they would but have Patience, he did not queſtion,
but in a few days to hear of his approach, in

them upon his Honour, that he himſelf had ſeen

Years of Age, who was in <hi>Poland,</hi> acknowledg'd
to be the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and from whoſe Hands he
had received his Commiſſion; that they ſhould
not rely upon his Word alone, but that he would
adviſe them to ſend a truſty Meſſenger of their

Prince <hi>Demetrius</hi> before) into <hi>Poland,</hi> to repreſent
to him the true State of their Affairs, and to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite

Careleſneſs of the Beſiegers got ſafely thro' their
Camp without being diſcovered, they gave freſh
Aſſurance of their Stedfaſtneſs to <hi>Polutnich,</hi> till the
return of this Emiſſary. <hi>Schacopski,</hi> in the mean
while, was not a little ſurpriſed, that he could not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54715:168"/>
hear the leaſt Tidings out of <hi>Poland;</hi> but the true
Cauſe was, that the Gentleman, whom the <hi>Poles</hi>

underſtood, in what ill a poſture his Affairs
were in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> after the two laſt Defeats, began

The <hi>Coſacks</hi> that had hitherto ſtood firm to the

               <p>Not long after Duke <hi>Roſinski,</hi> being alſo arrived

of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baſili-Zuski</hi> had in the mean while applied all his
Care in getting ready his Recruits and making
new Levies throughout the whole Empire, with an
Intention to bring ſo formidable an Army into the
Field, as to be able to ſtop the further Progreſs of
his Enemy. For this end having formed an Army
of above a Hundred and fifty thouſand Men, and
declared his Brother <hi>Demetrius. Zuski</hi> General, he
ordered him to march directly towards the <hi>Poles,</hi>
and fight them wherever he met them. Purſuant
to theſe Orders, the <hi>Zuskian</hi> Army march'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City of <hi>Bolchow,</hi> where having fix'd
their Tents within ſight of the Enemy, ſome Days
were ſpent in Skirmiſhes, whilſt the Generals of
both Parties watch'd their Opportunity of Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Quarrel by a Battel to the beſt Advantage;
It was not long before they found it, being equally
eager of Engaging.</p>
               <p>For, as I ſaid before, ſcarce had they lain thus
encamp'd a few days, but they ſaw the <hi>Zuskians</hi>
early in the Morning drawing out to put themſelves
in Battle Array, having detach'd a Body of their beſt
Horſe to poſſeſs themſelves of ſome advantageous
Poſts near to the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Camp; which theſe
have ſoon been advertiſed of by their Parties that
were abroad to obſerve the Motion of the Enemy,
they with all ſpeed ſent alſo a Body of their beſt
Horſe to engage the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and to maintain
thoſe advanced Poſts, till they could be ſuſtained by
ſome of their Infantry. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe engaged
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> with ſo much Bravery, that after an
Engagement of an Hour they forced them to quit
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54715:171"/>
thoſe Poſts, whilſt the whole Army was putting in
Order of Battle, having taken the Advantage of
the ſame Ground which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> intended to

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Muſcovites <hi>being baſſled in their firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,

which might encourage his Soldiers to

had once more the Impudence to look them in
the Face, hurried on by their ill Deſtiny, to receive
the Reward of their Treacheries from their Hands;
That the reſt were <hi>Poles,</hi> the Hereditary Enemies
of their Country and Religion, unto whom muſt be
aſcribed all the Evils and Miſchiefs which had befaln
their Empire for theſe ſeveral Years laſt paſt; That
this inſolent Nation, not being contented to have once
before involved their Country in Blood and Confuſion
by ſetting up an Impoſtor inſtead of the true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
ſlain at <hi>Ugletz,</hi> were now upon the point
of Impoſing upon them a Second, in order to diſpoſe
of the Throne of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> at their Pleaſure, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
their Country, and to root out the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Greek</hi> Religion. <hi>He repreſented to them,
how inglorious, nay, ignominious it would be to
the whole</hi> Ruſſian <hi>Nation, who had extended their
Conqueſts over moſt of the neighbouring Countries,
to receive Laws from the</hi> Poles, <hi>who had conſpired
their Ruin and Deſtruction. That therefore they
being to expect nothing but Miſery from their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemies, they muſt look for their Deliverance
in their own Courage, with a Reſolution not to
out-live that Day, which, if loſt, would put an
End to all the Glory purchaſed by their Anceſtors,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54715:172"/>
to their own Felicity, and that of all their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Roſinski</hi> on the other hand, the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
was not wanting to enflame the Courage of
his Soldiers, by repreſenting to them: That the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> which they ſaw before them, were the
Remnants of thoſe whom they had ſo often beaten
with a much leſs number; witneſs their late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
with <hi>Miſinowski,</hi> whom, to their eternal
Glory, they had droven from his advantageous
Poſt, notwithſtanding the inequality of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
That therefore they ſhould not be ſtartled at
their Enemies, who, tho much more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
were, for the moſt part, an undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
Rabble, terrible only in outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
the reſt, who ſo lately had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their invincible Courage, ſcarce daring
to look their Conquerours in the face. He
deſired them to remember the Slaughter of that
Countrymen in cold Blood, againſt all the Laws of
Hoſpitality, by that very ſame Rabble, whom they
were now going to Engage; that their Blood cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for Vengeance, they had now the faireſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
in the World, to take the moſt ample
Satisfaction from thoſe barbarous Wretches, and to
puniſh them for their Cruelties. He concluded 
That they ought to conſider, that the Conqueſt of
whole <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> depended upon the points of their
Swords, and that one day's labour would put them
into Poſſeſſion of a vaſt Empire, and all the Riches
and Treaſure of their Enemies, be the Reward of
the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſinski</hi> finding a great eagerneſs in his Soldiers
to Engage, led them on ſtraight to the Enemy,
whom they attack'd with an unparallell'd Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,

obſerved, that the <hi>Coſacks</hi> (in the ſame manner as
<hi>Zaporius</hi> did ſome years before, when he fought

if Matters were truly repreſented to the King, he
might in time be induced to draw off his Supplies

was back'd by ſome of the Chiefeſt Men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

ſo it was not to be ſuppoſed, that they ſhould be

which perhaps, when preſent, they might do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Difficulty, by repreſenting to the Court
the true State of the Caſe, and the Impoſture of

it would be to their Affairs, in detecting
the whole Intrigue of this ſuppoſititious <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
if <hi>Marina</hi> in Perſon appear'd at Court, and by her

               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> did not very well reliſh theſe

over-ruled by the Speciouſneſs of their alledged

with the Deſires of theſe <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords, unto whom,
as well as to <hi>Marina,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

under Condition, that they ſhould undertake to

               <p>This Treaty had not been managed with ſo much
Secrecy, but that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was not without
his Spies within the City, had got Scent of it, by
whoſe Means alſo having got Notice of the Day of
their Departure, and judging, not without great
Reaſon, how diſadvantageous their Preſence at the

<hi>Marina</hi> to own him for her Husband; he
ſent out <hi>Zlarowski</hi> with fifteen hundred Horſe to

before hand informed which way they were to paſs,
had not marched above two Hours before he met

himſelf, as ſome others that were preſent at

them to another Quarter of the Camp, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not to take notice, that they had been ſeen by
him; hoping thus to huſh up the former
Paſſage, till they could concert new Meaſures to

               <p>But an Error of this Nature being not ſo ſoon

as that there ſhould be no room left for any

had wrought moſt ſurpriſing Miracles, as had been

and clear-ſighted; beſides a great many other
pretended Diſtempers, otherwiſe incurable, which
were removed in an inſtant by the miraculous Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this Body. They had alſo taken particular care
to bring a Body, which having not been long under
Ground, was as yet uncorrupted; ſo, that the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Superſtitious People being heightned,
when they found it entire after fifteen Years Burial, it
was look'd upon as a Crime deſerving no leſs than
Death, to queſtion the Truth of this Fable; for

to <hi>Zuski,</hi> deſiring that it might remain diſinterr'd,
till a Temple could be built, where it ſhould be

was granted them by the Great Duke for that time.</p>
               <p>But not long after wiſely conſidering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that ſuch groſs Abſurdities could not be long

of the common People, it was publiſh'd by

their Zeal for their Prince, whoſe Memory ought
ever to be ſacred among them; nevertheleſs that,
having obſerved his Subjects to pay the ſame Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration

to the immortal Creator, he had taken this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to depoſite his Body amongſt his Anceſtors,

as far as the Nature of ſo nice a Thing

by the Intereſt of their Friends in the Camp, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
their Return to the Court of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi>
King of <hi>Poland.</hi> They were not a little divided in
their Opinions. Some of them repreſented to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi>
how ignominious it would be for a Perſon
of her Extraction and Dignity, to throw herſelf
away upon an unknown Vagabond, whom ſhe
herſelf knew to be an Impoſtor, and ſet up by the
<hi>Poles,</hi> for no other End, than to ſerve their own
Turn of revenging themſelves upon <hi>Zuski</hi> and the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which when they had effected, and
found themſelves ſtrong enough to maintain their
Intereſt in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> without him, they would be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54715:178"/>
ſure to caſt off, and throw him upon the Dunghill,
with no leſs difficulty than they had taken him up.
That the <hi>Zuskians</hi> would not fail to improve the
whole to her diſadvantage, and to alledge againſt
her, that ſhe had married a mean Wretch, and a
ſuborued Property, in hopes to ſatisfie her own
Ambition, and to gratify the Ends of a third Party.
On the other hand, it was urged, that there being
no great likelihood that the <hi>Poles</hi> ſhould abandon
his Intereſt, more than they had done that of the
former, as being founded upon the ſame bottom,
and link'd together by a mutual Intereſt, the moſt
indiſſoluble Knot of all humane Affairs, no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reaſon could be alledg'd, why ſhe ſhould not
as well own this <hi>Demetrius</hi> as the former, being
both, equally doubtful, as to their Deſcent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Great Duke, <hi>John Baſilovits;</hi> and,
that, ſince ſhe had once had the Misfortune of
throwing herſelf into the Arms of an Impoſtor,
ſhe might, with the ſame Reaſon, not refuſe the
Embraces of a Second, when no leſs than the
Crown of ſo vaſt an Empire lay at ſtake. That,
ſuppoſing his Birth to be inferior to that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> he was juſt upon the point of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing

reduced to the utmoſt Extremities, as ſoon
as they were informed of her having owned him
for her Husband, would not be long before they
would receive him for their Emperour, and place
him in the Throne of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> That the Crown
would ſoon wipe off all the Stain of his ignoble
Birth, were it never ſo baſe and ſordid, and exalt
him to the ſame degree with the moſt illuſtrious
Monarchs of the World. Beſides that, if ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

the whole Buſineſs was a Deſign of a popular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo it was thought moſt adviſable to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in view of the whole Army; the better to

That the Great Dutcheſs <hi>Marina,</hi> had been indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

in the open Field, where being met, they both, at
ſome Yards diſtance did alight, he from his Horſe,
ſhe out of her Coach; Having received one another
with open Arms, they intermingled their Kiſſes
with Tears, and with Expreſſions ſo tender, ſo
paſſionate, and ſo natural, that it was impoſſible
even for the moſt quick-ſighted ſo much as to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

the higheſt Reverence and Marks of a moſt
profound Eſteem, as ſhe had before given him the
moſt paſſionate Teſtimonies of an unfeigned Love,
and the moſt ſincere Affection; whilſt <hi>Demetrius</hi>
could do nothing elſe than repay theſe Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with his repeated Embraces.</p>
               <p>After ſome time ſpent in thoſe mutual Careſſes,
<hi>Demetrius</hi> made his particular Application to the
Weywode of <hi>Sendomiria,</hi> the Father of <hi>Marina,</hi>
unto whom he told, That next to the Recovery
of his Dear Spouſe out of the Hands of thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Wretches, nothing could be more pleaſing
to him at this time, than to ſee himſelf in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to make him in Perſon the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
due to him for all the Honours he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at his Hands. He put him in mind, that, as
he had been the firſt who had given real Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his undertaking, by publickly eſpouſing
his Intereſt in <hi>Poland,</hi> ſo he had ever ſince been the
conſtant Companion of all his Labours and the
various Viciſſitudes of Fortune, till that unhappy
Separation on the ſixteenth day of <hi>May,</hi> occaſion'd
by the Contrivances of their moſt barbarous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
He concluded, that the ſame propitious
Fate, which had ſo miraculouſly preſerv'd him
from falling into their Hands, and now bad once
more bleſt him with the ſight of thoſe Perſons he
lov'd and reverenc'd moſt in the World, in ſpite of
all the malicious Endeavours of their implacable
Enemies, ſeem'd already by its auſpicious Influence
to have directed his Path, by which to re-aſcend
his Throne, to enable him to pay his real Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
to his Friends, and to put his Enemies to
Shame and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Weywode, after having returned his moſt
humble Thanks to <hi>Demetrius</hi> for putting ſo high a
Value upon his Services, for which he own'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſufficiently rewarded by having honour'd his
Family with his Alliance, in marrying his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the publick Acknowledgement given juſt

now in the Preſence of ſo many great and brave
Men, failed not to inſert ſome remarkable Paſſages
common to them both ſince their firſt Attempt of
entring <hi>Muſcovy</hi> with an Army; and concluded,
that he had all the Reaſon to believe, that the ſame
Power which had been ſo inſtrumental in preſerving
them from ſo many Dangers, and ſurmounting all
theſe Difficulties, would crown all their paſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in a little time with a happy End.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the Lady play'd ſo naturally the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
her Father ſo ingeniouſly the Politician, and
<hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf perſonated ſo artificially the real
Grand Duke, that all three acting their Parts to the
Life, drew Tears from the Eyes of the Spectators,
the moſt ſubtle and quick-ſighted being conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

not only a very magnificent Structure (after the

and Grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54715:180"/>
of Qualty, or Officer of Note, who had not a
Houſe prepared for his Dwelling-place, with all
the Conveniencies that could be had, in a well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
City, the whole Camp being divided into
ſeveral goodly Streets, with a Market, and other
publick Places; the common Soldiers being lodged
in Huts, well provided againſt the approaching
Winter-Seaſon. The whole was encompaſſed with
a very ſtrong Line, fortified at certain diſtances
with Redoubts, and good ſtore of Cannon, ſo that
it had the reſemblance of a very large and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fortified City.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Muſco,</hi> tho' not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
by the general Defection of the Country,
and the Neighbourhood of the Enemy, who by the
countenance of their Camp ſeem'd to be reſolved
not to quit the Enterprize at an eaſie rate, yet
did not loſe Courage, and finding themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of all Means to draw Supplies out of their
own Country, they had recourſe to the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
which <hi>Boris Goudenou</hi> intended to have made
uſe of againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> if he had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by his ſudden Death. They were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſenſible, that <hi>Charles,</hi> then King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
who had found Means to exclude his Nephew <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi>
then King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and lawful Heir to the
Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> from that Crown, would be glad
of any Opportunity to ſtop the Progreſs of the <hi>Poles,</hi>
to prevent their becoming Maſters of the Empire of
<hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which would infallibly open them the
way into the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Territories. They apply'd
themſelves therefore to the beforementioned King
<hi>Charles,</hi> who, upon their Requeſt, ſent them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Supplies, and firſt check'd the courſe of the
Victories of the <hi>Poles,</hi> which gave ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to many other Provinces of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> that being
tir'd with the Inſolencies and Exactions of the <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians,</hi>
they ſhook off the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Yoke, and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus entangled in new Difficulties, when they
thought themſelves upon the point of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Deſign, fell into Diſſentions, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54715:180"/>
of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which
at laſt proved fatal, both to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Affairs in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which was thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
delivered from its Enemies; when in all
Humane Appearance, they were ready to triumph
over them; as it will ſufficiently appear out of the
Sequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>For, when the <hi>Poles</hi> ſaw the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> reduced
to the greateſt ſtraights that could be, by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Diſſenſions, raiſed and fomented by their
Contrivance, they judged now to have met with a
favourable Opportunity to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of that vaſt Empire. For which reaſon, the
Senate of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> repreſented to
their King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> how eaſie it would be for
him, at this critical Juncture, to gives Laws to
both Parties in that divided Empire, if he would
ſhew himſelf at the Head of a conſiderable Army,
which was ready at hand in <hi>Poland,</hi> to march upon
his firſt Orders, into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where they might live
upon the Country, whereas they muſt now be
maintain'd at the Charge of the Republick. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the benefit he would reap from this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in giving Laws to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and purging
the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> of a great number of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds
and idle Perſons, the remnants of their
late civil Diſſenſions, it would be a glorious Work,
to revenge the barbarous Murder of ſo many of
his Subjects, and the detaining of his Ambaſſadors.
The Chief thing objected was; that the Truce made
ſome Years ago betwixt both Nations was not
expir'd; But this Objection was ſoon anſwered,
conſidering that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had been the firſt,
who violated it in Maſſacring the <hi>Poles</hi> againſt all
Laws of Hoſpitality, and detaining their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
againſt the Law of Nations; but, ſuppoſing
this to be inſufficient, the ſpecious Pretence <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
might make uſe of in appearing for <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
their lawful Great Duke in Poſſeſſion of the
greateſt Part of the Empire, againſt the Uſurper
of his Crown and Right, would take off the Blame
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54715:181"/>
of the Violation of the Truce in the eyes of the
World.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> being ſwayed by theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Conſiderations, alledged by his Council, at

and his Council, he had marched directly to
the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and in conjunction with the
<hi>Demetrian</hi> Army, attack'd that City, or at leaſt
block'd it up more cloſely than before; the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
who were already reduced to great Straits
for want of all manner of Neceſſaries, would ſoon
have been forced to abandon <hi>Zuski,</hi> and to embrace

his ſide the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> (the main, if not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Strength of his Army) by great Rewards; and
thus, either to render himſelf abſolute Maſter of
the whole Empire, or at leaſt, by coming to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to unite all the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
Provinces, bordering on <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> with
his Crown. But inſtead of following theſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Counſels, he took quite contrary meaſures,
which rendred his whole Deſign abortive, and loſt
his Son <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the Crown of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as he
himſelf, by his own miſmanagement had loſt that

if he would march to <hi>Smolensko,</hi> the Capital of the
Province of the ſame name, it would be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
into his hands at his firſt appearing before it.
This City, which is ſeated on the Banks of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſthenes,</hi>
and ſurrounded with a very good Wall of
Stone and Brick, was in thoſe days much larger
than it is now, it having been much altered from
its former Beauty and Wealth by the various Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54715:181"/>
of War; and tho' it had no out-works or Ditch,
yet this Defect was ſupply'd by a very numerous
Garriſon, conſiſting of thirty thouſand Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Inhabitants, whoſe number amounted to
as many, if not more, that were able to bear
Arms; The Weywode or Governour of the Place,
was one <hi>Michael Sehin,</hi> an intimate Friend of <hi>Zus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi>
who being ſufficiently provided with Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Artillery, Proviſions, and all other Neceſſaries
for a long Siege, was reſolved to defend it to the
laſt drop of Blood, knowing it to be the only place
of Importance in the whole Empire, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
ſtedfaſt in the Intereſt of <hi>Zuski<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sigiſmund</hi>
being miſguided by ſome of his flattering Courtiers,
as ſoon as he had paſſed the <hi>Boryſthenes,</hi> reſolved
upon an haſty March, and being cajol'd into a Belief,
that he was rather going to receive than force <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi>
leaving all his Cannon behind him, marched
with all poſſible ſpeed towards that City. He was
no ſooner come in ſight of it, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
miſerably miſtaken, both in his Intelligence

                  <hi>Sehin</hi> rejected his Offers with Scorn.
There were not a few at that time in the Army,
who adviſed the King not to hazard his Army in
the Siege of a Place, which being provided with a
numerous Garriſon, and reſolute in its Defence,
would prove a work of great difficulty to gain;
but to take hold of this favourable Juncture, which
invited him to <hi>Muſco,</hi> the Capital City of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
before they were re-inforced with the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi>
Auxiliaries; but the Opinion of the <hi>Lithuanian</hi>
Chancellour and his Friends, was moſt prevailing,
who remonſtrated, that a few Months would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſo great a Multitude, however well provided
at preſent, to diſtreſs, when reſtrain'd from Forage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and bringing in Proviſions, or at the worſt,
that a vigorous Attack would in a little time, bring
them to better terms; by which the King having
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54715:182"/>
ſecured himſelf a ſafe Retreat, might with the leſs
danger march to the Capital City of <hi>Muſco.</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to this Reſolution, the King ordered all the
Avenues and Paſſages leading to the City, to be
taken up by his Cavalry, and afterwards by making
a Line of Circumvallation, to cut off all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
betwixt the Garriſon and the Country.
But having not long after received certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that the Place being provided with great
ſtore of all Neceſſaries, this Attempt would in all
likelihood prove abortive, they alter'd their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
it being judged moſt adviſable, to change
the Blockado into a formal Siege.</p>
               <p>For which purpoſe,<note place="margin">Sigiſmund <hi>beſieges</hi> Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſko.</note> the King having ordered his
Cannon for Battery, and other Inſtruments for a
Siege to be carried thither out of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> the
City was beſieged in due form. The King's attack
was carried on, on the Weſt-ſide of the place, his
quarters extending from the Banks of the River
<hi>Boryſthenes</hi> to the South. The attack of the <hi>Coſacks</hi>
was on the Eaſt-ſide, their Quarters reaching from
the South to the ſame River. The Sieur <hi>Potocki,</hi>
Palatine of <hi>Braclow,</hi> had his Poſt aſſigned him on
the North-ſide; on the oppoſite ſhoar of the <hi>Bory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi>
to prevent any Succours from coming to the
Relief of the Town that way. But the Beſiegers
advanced but ſlowly in their Works for want of
Foot; for, tho' the King had late<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y received a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement
of five thouſand <hi>Coſacks,</hi> yet there
being not above ten thouſand Foot in his whole
Army (which according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
was chiefly compoſed of Horſe) theſe bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no proportion to ſo numerous a Garriſon, they
were continually harraſſed by the frequent Sallies
of the Beſieged, who often drove them from their
Trenches, before they could be ſeconded by their
Horſe. Their approaches being thus carried on,
not without great difficulty, a conſiderable time
was ſpent, before they could poſſeſs themſelves of
ſome advantageous Poſts near the Walls of the
City, which being very convenient for the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54715:182"/>
to fetch in their Supplies of freſh Water, put
them to ſome Diſtreſs that way, yet not ſo, but
that they had ſufficient Opportunity to furniſh
themſelves with it in the night-time, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived by the Enemy, by reaſon of the
nearneſs of the River. Thus the Siege continued
with abundance of Toil, but ſmall Succeſs; the
King, who now began to be ſenſible of his Error,
being reſolved upon a Punctilio of Honour, not
to leave the Place till it were reduced, coſt it what
it would; ſo that many of the <hi>Poles,</hi> but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> paid with their Lives for their
King's Obſtinacy, who might have been employed
with much more Probability of Succeſs againſt the
City of <hi>Muſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, whilſt the King was thus waſting his Forces
before <hi>Smolensko;</hi> the <hi>Zuskians</hi> having received Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the approach of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops, ſent
to their Aſſiſtance, began to concert meaſures how
to remove at a further diſtance the <hi>Demetrian</hi>
Forces, that had lain ſo long at their Doors. They
were not ignorant of the Inconveniencies, which
the <hi>Poles</hi> labour'd under in the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Camp.
They had ſufficient Intelligence of their Diviſions
and Animoſities in their Councils, occaſioned by
the Multitude of their Chief Commanders, who
being ſway'd more by their particular Intereſt and
Ambition, than the Good of the common Cauſe,
loſt many times an Opportunity of annoying the
Enemy. This Inſtability in their Councils, cauſed
much Careleſneſs in the whole Conduct of their
Affairs, which frequently turn'd to their great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
as it happned in <hi>May</hi> in the ſame Year,
when a ſharp Engagement hapning betwixt the
Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> and the <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
theſe had at firſt the better of them; but
making a diſorderly Retreat, without the leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and falling to plunder the Dead, gave the
Enemy opportunity to Rally, and being reinforced
with freſh Troops out of the City, they ſo furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>The Diſgrace they received not long after at

The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe attack'd the two Wings
of the Enemies with an irreſiſtible Courage, and
the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> fighting for the laſt Stake, behaved
themſelves like Men reſolv'd either to overcome or
die; notwithſtanding which, they were forced to
give Ground, both Wings being after a bloody and
obſtinate Fight routed by the <hi>Poles,</hi> who killed
8000 (among whom were 1000 <hi>German</hi> Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
upon the Spot. But the Foot ſtood all this while

without great Diſadvantage. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe
being extreamly tired by the Fatigues of the Day,
and the whole Army much inferiour in Number
to that of the Enemy, it was not thought adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

to reſt contented with what Advantage
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54715:183"/>
they had gotten, and to withdraw to ſome more
advantageous Poſt. But <hi>Zlarowski,</hi> emulo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him reſolute, and obſtinate againſt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
they quartered themſelves in ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Villages. The Enemy having by ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters,
got notice what Effects their divided
Counſels had produced, ſoon rally'd their Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and having rejoined their Foot, by break of Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
fell with ſuch Fury upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> that ſeeing
themſeves thus ſurprized, and in no Capacity to

making the beſt of their Way to their Camp near

                  </note> they
were encounter'd by a great Body of the <hi>Demetrian</hi>
Horſe, who falling in their Rear, brought the
whole Arrier-guard in Confuſion, till ſeconded by
ſome freſh Regiments they forced the <hi>Poles</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
Beſides this, the Licentiouſneſs of their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Camp, had occaſioned ſeveral
Seditions for want of Pay; ſo that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to
ſatisfie their Demands, was forced to lay ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Taxations upon the Provinces which had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54715:184"/>
to his Obedience, that at laſt becoming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
moſt of the great Cities revolted, and
the Country refuſed to pay any further Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
looking upon them as the Fuel that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Flame which had almoſt conſumed them.
In ſome Places they grew ſo outrageous as to ſeize,
impriſon and kill the Tax-gatherers. <hi>Demetrius</hi>
therefore to maintain his Authority and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
his Officers, being obliged to ſend ſtrong
Parties into ſeveral Parts of the Country, his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Camp were conſequently reduced to ſo
ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Number, as not to ſuffice to check the
ſtrong Sallies made by thoſe of the City, much leſs
to hinder them from being ſupplied with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Neceſſaries out of the Country; which
having been ſeveral times attempted by the
<hi>Poles,</hi> they were as often baffled by the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
always much ſuperiour to them in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and becoming every day more courageous,
both by the Aſſiſtance of their Foreign Auxiliaries,
and their Succeſs againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> whoſe General
<hi>Roſinski,</hi> in one of the Sallies, the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very hot, was ſhot in his ſide with an Arrow,
of which he never perfectly recovered. There is
no queſtion, but that if King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> could as
yet have been prevailed upon to transfer his Arms
from <hi>Smolensko</hi> to <hi>Muſco,</hi> that by his Authority
theſe Diviſions in the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Camp might have
been ſoon compoſed, and the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> frighted by
the Acceſſion of ſo conſiderable a Force to their
Enemies, to have been brought to better Terms;
but inſtead of that, he abſolutely reſolved not to
quit the Place till he had taken it, and his Army
being extreamly weakned by the long Continuance
of the Siege and the frequent Sallies of a numerous
Garriſon, and not receiving ſufficient Recruits out
of <hi>Poland,</hi> or at leaſt not ſo opportunely as the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
State of his Affairs required, he took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to draw his Subjects out of the Service of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> to come to his Aid at the Siege of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi>
which entirely ruin'd all his affairs in <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54715:184"/>
It was in vain, that his ableſt Counſellours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to him, that this unſeaſonable diſtracting
and weakening the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Party muſt needs
turn to the great Advantage of <hi>Zuski,</hi> who, when
the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> ſhould be delivered of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that lay at their Gates, would thereby be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in his Throne; that the circumjacent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
which were kept in awe by the <hi>Demetrian</hi>
Army, would ſoon revolt from him, and <hi>Zuski</hi>
thus ſtrengthened by the united Forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
would not fail to come to the Relief of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko.</hi>
That therefore he ought rather to furniſh
<hi>Demetrius</hi> with new Supplies, or at leaſt keep fair
with him, and by no means to diſtract his Forces
till he had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Smolensko,</hi>
which when taken, he might march without the
Oppoſition to <hi>Muſco;</hi> there being no queſtion but
that all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces, and the Places in their
Poſſeſſion, by Promiſes of great Rewards would
without Reluctancy ſide with him; which would
infallibly oblige the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to fall off from <hi>Zuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi>
and embrace his Party. It was alſo call'd in
queſtion, whether the <hi>Poles</hi> would be prevailed
upon to quit <hi>Demetrius,</hi> from whom they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Rewards of all their Toils and Labours,
eſpecially ſince the exhauſted Treaſury of the
Commonwealth of <hi>Poland</hi> was not at preſent in a

               <p>But the King perſiſting in his Reſolution, ſent
ſome of his Emiſſaries into the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Camp,
to endeavour by all means poſſible to perſwade the
<hi>Poles</hi> to abandon the Intereſt of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and to
join with the King's Forces before <hi>Smolensko.</hi> At
firſt the King's Agents met with little Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the <hi>Poles,</hi> who told them that they
would not by ſuch an untimely Deſertion defraud

in their Faith which they had ſworn to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
and ſent ſome Deputies to excuſe their not
joining with the King's Forces before <hi>Smolensko.</hi>
But <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> having promiſed them their Arrears
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54715:185"/>
to be paid, and brought over <hi>Roſinski</hi> their General,
<hi>Zlarowski,</hi> and ſome others of the Chief Commanders,
to his ſide, a great many of the Soldiery promis'd to
to be obedient to the Orders of their King and
Cheif Commanders, and the reſt ſeeing their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affairs
to be in a declining Condition began to waver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> not a little terrified at theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and fearing, not
without Reaſon, that theſe few Troops which
remained faithful to him might ſcarce be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to reſcue him out of the Hands of the <hi>Poles,</hi>
whom he believed to have an Intention to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
him to their Avarice and Intereſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to withdraw ſecretly out of the Camp,
and retire to a Place of more Security. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he came to this Extremity, he thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to try once more, whether by fair Means he
could not prevail upon <hi>Roſinski</hi> to ſtand ſtedfaſt to
his Intereſt; but this having proved fruitleſs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

could invent, there paſs'd very hot Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

and Breach of his Word; and <hi>Roſinski</hi>
calling <hi>Demetrius</hi> an Impoſtor, and Son of a Whore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who would not have brook'd theſe

Marina <hi>taking advantage from their Animoſities

She ſpoke to all ſhe met, and calling ſuch of the

flatter your ſelf into a Belief, that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelf to reward the Services done to another; It
is from the Great Duke <hi>Demetrius,</hi> you ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
your Stipend, and the full Reward of all your paſt
Labours; It is out of the Immenſe Treaſure of the
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire, and the prodigious Riches, gathered
by the preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and the Plunder of the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>Theſe Words were like Fuel, added to a raging

the <hi>Coſacks,</hi> declared they would follow

               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in the City had ſufficient Information
of the Diſſentions that reign'd in the Camp, which
they fomented under hand, keeping themſelves
cloſe within their Walls all this while; for fear, if

that threatned them, be re-united for their mutual

the ſame puiſſant Army, which had given Laws to

being now freed from that Thorn that ſtuck ſo

                  </note> at that very time when

               <p>From thence he turn'd his Arms to <hi>Oſſipo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which he alſo took, but not without great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and the Loſs of a great many of his Men.
For, this Place being garriſon'd by a thouſand
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> they beat off the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
in ſeveral bloody Aſſaults, and obliged them to
turn the Siege into a Blockade, which having redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Garriſon to the laſt Extremity for want of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54715:188"/>
all manner of Neceſſaries, they took a Reſolution ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to force their way with their Swords in their
Hands thro' the Enemies than tamely to ſurrender up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
diſhonourable Conditions. They choſe Midnight as
the fitteſt time for the Exploit, when, having refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves with what Proviſions there was left,
and having taken their farewel of one another by
Embraces, and drinking each a Cup of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi>
they made a Sally out of the Gate which leads to
<hi>Smolensko,</hi> and like Men reſolved to die, attacked
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in their Poſts, with an unparallel'd
Bravery, of whom a great many were kill'd before
they could be relieved by freſh Troops; when their
Number increaſing continually, they kill'd moſt of
the Garriſon (but not without great Slaughter on
their ſide) two hundred only eſcaping to King <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi>'s
Camp; And the reſt ſold their lives ſo
dearly, that ſome thouſands of the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were
ſlain upon the Place.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had made
ſeveral fruitleſs Attacks upon the City of <hi>Smolensko,</hi>
the Garriſon of which Place defended it ſelf with
a moſt gallant Reſolution. The Attempt which
was made at the Gate of S. <hi>Michael</hi> by one <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wodorski</hi>
a <hi>Polander</hi> and Captain of the King's
Guards, deſerves among the reſt a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
here. For he, having faſtned a Petard
to the abovementioned Gate, laid open a Paſſage
into the Town, and with a few young <hi>Poliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
entred the City with their Scymetars
drawn, cutting down all before them; There is no
queſtion but that if they had been vigorouſly ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the reſt, the Place muſt have infallibly
fallen into the Hands of King <hi>Sigiſmund;</hi> But
moſt of them not daring to follow, he and his
ſmall Company were over-powered by the great
Number of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who flock'd to the
Defence of the Gate; yet they made good their
Retreat, with the Loſs of two only of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
leaving behind them moſt evident Proofs
of their Valour among the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> They being
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54715:189"/>
now forewarn'd, took care to block up their Gates
with Earth, and making deep Trenches before them
to prevent their being ſurprized upon the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

               <p>
                  <hi>Zuski,</hi> being fluſh'd with the variety of theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,

was reſolved to puſh on his Fortune, and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,

no queſtion but that he might have deſtroyed him

his <hi>Tartarian</hi> Troops, whilſt he with the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> having received timely Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of their Deſign was not unprepared for their
Reception, and having ſent <hi>Staniſlaus Zolkievitski</hi>
with ten thouſand Men, to take Poſſeſſion of ſome
advantageous Poſts near <hi>Cluſin,</hi> he reſolved there
to expect the Enemy. Not many days were paſt
before the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were advanced within ſight
of the <hi>Poles,</hi> when purſuant to a Reſolution taken
in a Council of War, the whole Army was drawn
out in order of Battle to attack in their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>The left Wing of the <hi>Zuskian</hi> Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

and a good Number of <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſe, the

inferiour in Number to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> but truſting
upon their Courage and the Advantage of the Ground
they received the Enemy with great Bravery, who
confiding in their Number attack'd them with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Fury. The Fight was very bloody, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
doubtful for ſome Part of the day; for
tho' the <hi>Poles</hi> ſoon routed the Left Wing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54715:189"/>
by the Brother of <hi>Zuski,</hi> yet the <hi>Swedes</hi>
and the <hi>Tartars</hi> in the Right fought it out very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
and the <hi>Germans</hi> in the main Body being plac'd
upon a Ground full of Shrubs and other Rubbage,
where the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe could not advance without
great Difficulty, repulſed them ſeveral times with
great Slaughter; till at laſt the Right Wing of the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Army being brought firſt into Confuſion,
and afterwards totally routed; the <hi>German</hi> Foot
ſeeing themſelves deprived of the Aſſiſtance of their
Horſe,<note place="margin">Zuski <hi>rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </note> and on all ſides ſurrounded by the <hi>Poles,</hi>
gave the Signal for Parley, which being readily
granted by King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and the Hoſtages inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed,
it was agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch as ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to enter into Pay in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army ſhould
be entertained by the King according to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Stations, the reſt to remain Priſoners of War.</p>
               <p>Scarce had the Treaty been ſigned, and was
juſt upon the Point of being executed, when <hi>De la
Garde,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Auxiliaries
in Hopes that the <hi>German</hi> Foot had maintained
their Ground, having rallied the Wings that were
broken before, returned to the place of Battle, but
being informed of what had paſs'd, he intreated
the <hi>Germans</hi> to return in Conjunction with the
Horſe to the Charge. But theſe were deaf to all
his Admonitions and Perſwaſions, declaring that
they would not be guilty of the Breach of the
Treaty ſo lately made with the <hi>Poles,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
afreſh attack'd the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Horſe, entirely

Loſs of <hi>Zuski</hi> and his Party, after ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
an overthrow, he aſſured them, that if they did
not make uſe of this laſt Offer the King intended
to make them of deſerving his Mercy; they muſt
infallibly expect to be involved in his Ruin. Moſt of
the Inhabitants ſhewed a great Inclination to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
upon ſuch honourable terms as were offered
by King <hi>Sigiſmund;</hi> But <hi>Sehin</hi> their Weywode being
a Man of an undaunted Courage, would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to any Propoſitions tho' never ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous;
and having repreſented to them that their
Condition was ſuch as to be able to ſtop the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer
of the Victorious <hi>Poles,</hi> and to their eternal
Glory, to deſerve the Honour of having upheld the
declining Fate of their Country againſt its mortal

to the laſt Extremity.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> began to feel the
direful Effects of the loſs of this Battle; For, <hi>Sapiha</hi>
(now the <hi>Demetrian</hi> General) had routed the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian
Tartars,</hi> near <hi>Twitza,</hi> and cut to pieces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſiderable Body of their Troops at <hi>Borowsko;</hi>
King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> having got notice, that <hi>Volviowitz</hi>
the <hi>Zuskian</hi> General was, after the laſt Defeat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> retir'd
with a Body of ten thouſand Men under <hi>Czarow,</hi>
ſent thither part of his Army, the very ſight of
which, ſo terrified the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> that without
ſtriking one Blow, they ſurrendred to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
diſcretion; the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Army began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
a ſecond time their Capital City, and the <hi>Poles</hi>
had detatch'd a conſiderable Body from the Siege of
<hi>Smolensko,</hi> whom they expected to ſee every day at
their Gates. The worſt of all was, that in the laſt
Battle, they had loſt the Flower of their Army, and
moſt of their Foreign Auxiliaries, in whom they moſt
confided, the <hi>Germans</hi> having taken Service among
the <hi>Poles;</hi> ſo that, having not the leaſt proſpect of
repairing their ruined Troops, nor any other Means
left to defend themſelves againſt the Power of two
Armies, that were on their march to beſiege them
more cloſly than ever, they were at the greateſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54715:190"/>
Plunge, how to extricate themſelves out of theſe
impending Miſeries.</p>
               <p>After various Debates among the Nobles, who
moſt took to Heart the preſent miſerable State of
their Country, they had recourſe to the ſame States
Policy, which had prov'd ſucceſsful to their Affairs
before, to wit, to try whether by raiſing new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
among the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Demetrians,</hi> they
might not find once more an Opportunity to ſave
themſelves from this imminent Danger, which, if
not ſoon prevented, threatned their infallible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
To encompaſs this Deſign, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſeize upon the Great Duke <hi>Baſili Zuski</hi> and
to give it out that they were reſolved to put <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> upon

infallibly ruin the Intereſt of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
rid themſelves of a vile Impoſtor, whoſe
very Name was become odious to them, and at the
ſame time, reſtore immediately Peace to their harraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Country. It was repreſented, that, tho' they ought
to look upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> as their moſt dreadful and
mortal Enemies, that nevertheleſs, their only Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
being now to get time, and to breath a little;
the <hi>Poles,</hi> inveigled by their fair Promiſes, would
ſoon become ſecure, and furniſh them with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
either quite to elude the Election of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladiſlaus,</hi>
or, if that was not thought adviſable, they
might find ſufficient Means, at one time or other,
to rid their hands of him, under pretence of his
Childhood, which, if well tim'd, they might make
uſe of ſo favourable a Juncture, to endeavour to
return their Government into its antient Channel,
from whence it had been diverted by the Artifices
of their Enemies, and had been the occaſion of all
the Miſeries they had endured of late. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
laid upon deep Reaſons of State, ſucceeded
at laſt according to their Expectation, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
of the <hi>Poles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who were, by the good
Conduct of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> not long after, obliged
to leave that Empire, and reſtore to it that Repoſe,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54715:191"/>
which with vaſt Expences, and the effuſion of a
great deal of Blood, they had robb'd it of, for
near twenty years before. The <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Boyars,
and Nobles, having thus concerted meaſures among
themſelves, according to which, the Ruin of <hi>Zus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>
was reſolved on, as the only means to encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the intended Deliverance of their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
it was by their Inſtigation whiſper'd about
among the Populace, how that <hi>Baſili Zuski,</hi> the
preſent Great Duke, ought to be conſidered, as
the Chief Author of all their Misfortunes, who by
his Sorceries and Tyranny, had drawn down upon
the People of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the vengeance of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
and that by his Miſcarriages, they were
again plung'd into theſe Miſeries, wherewith they
ſaw themſelves environed paſt all Redemption,
unleſs they took new meaſures for their common
Safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zuski</hi> had, ſince his acceſſion to the Crown, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his Government very obnoxious to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Nobles; For, having mounted the
Throne, by Blood and fraudulent Means, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be jealous of his moſt truſty Friends, and,
to gratifie his Fears, exerciſed his Cruelties upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Perſons of an eminent Rank, whom he cauſed
to be put to Death upon no other Pretence, than
his having ſecret Intelligence of their Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
As his Reign was one continued Series of
Troubles, ſo when he was at a Plunge, he uſed to
have recourſe to Sorcerers and Witchcraft, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infatuated by their Perſwaſions, he committed
ſuch Barbarities as are ſcarce to be named without
horror. It was upon this account, he cauſed the
Wombs of big-bellied Women, to be ript open,
to make uſe of the immature Fruit, to accompliſh
his Enchantments, which, he was vainly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
would be more efficacious againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi>
than his Sword. Some of his Wizzards having
foretold him, that one, whoſe name was <hi>Michael,</hi>
ſhould ſucceed him in the Throne, he cauſed three
of his moſt faithful Friends and Servants to be made
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54715:191"/>
away, for no other reaſon, but becauſe they bore
that name, which for all his barbarous Precautions,
was verified in the Perſon of <hi>Mich. Federowitz,</hi> the
preſent Czar's Grandfather. There were in the great
Church within the Caſtle, amongſt other Things of
great Value, thirteen Statues, repreſenting our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and the twelve Apoſtles, all of maſſie Gold,
each of them of the bigneſs of a Man, valued at
near three hundred thouſand Pounds Sterling.
<hi>Zuski</hi> being at laſt reduced to great Straights for
want of Money, and having, in vain, try'd all the
Skill of his Sorcerers, who were not able to ſupply
his preſent Occaſions, he had recourſe to the twelve
Apoſtles, whom he diſplaced from their Station in
the Church, and having cauſed them to be melted
down, made uſe of the Metal for the Payment of his
Soldiers. He had ſo much Grace as to ſpare the
Statue of our Saviour, which the <hi>Poles,</hi> not long
after, converted to the ſame uſe.</p>
               <p>All theſe Enormities, being now by the Nobles,
who had conſpir'd his Ruin, improved to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
the Populace (whoſe Darling he was

The Ambaſſy being compoſed of ſome of the

the King, that in regard of the near Intereſt he
now had in their Preſervation, he would vouchſafe
to take them and their afflicted Country into his
Royal Protection, as the only Means to revive the
former flouriſhing State of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire,
which had been reduced to the very Brink of Ruin
by their inteſtine Diviſions. That their late Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
having been unanimous and founded upon
Hopes of their future Felicity, they begg'd of his
Majeſty not to deny them their earneſt Requeſt,
but to ſend as ſoon as poſſibly might be, their Prince
into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> in order to let them enjoy the Comfort
of his Preſence and Protection, and to compleat
their Election by Crowning him Great Duke and
Emperour, with the uſual Ceremonies, in the
Royal City of <hi>Muſco.</hi> They related to him the
Conditions upon which he was to be received, as we
have related them in the foregoing Chapter; They
enlarged themſelves much in praiſe of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Religion, and how neceſſary it would be for the
Prince to accommodate himſelf to the Rites
of the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Church, which they ſaid,
ought to be looked upon as the Foundation-Stone
of that Monarchy, from whence depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the common Safety, both of Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54715:194"/>
all which they recommended to his Royal

               <p>King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> who was not ignorant that theſe

Neceſſity of their Affairs, than any good Will

wanting to give them an Anſwer ſuitable to the
preſent Occaſion. And having received their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
with a very ſerene Countenance and ſeeming
Gladneſs, he anſwered them in general Terms;
That he could not but receive the Honour conferr'd
upon his Son by the Offer of the Crown of ſo great
an Empire with a great deal of Gladneſs, but that
as the chiefeſt Satisfaction he took in their Election,
was their unanimous Conſent, ſo he aſſured them,
that he ſhould look upon it as an indiſpenſible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to aſſiſt at all times hereafter their Country
with his Aids and Counſels, by which means he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a mutual good Correſpondency might be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

Crowns of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> to their mutual
Advantage. And as to what related to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of the Treaty, they being of ſuch a Nature
as to deſerve a particular Conſideration, he would,
after having well weighed the Matter, ſend his full
Inſtructions to his General <hi>Zolkievitzki,</hi> Reſident in
the City of <hi>Muſco,,</hi> with whom the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might be compleated at their own Homes,
to the Satisfaction, as he hoped, of both
Parties.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors being in all outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
very well ſatisfied with this Anſwer, there
paſſed abundance of Careſſes betwixt them and the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords, by whom they were ſumptuouſly
feaſted at ſundry times, with ſuch mutual Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Friendſhip, as if they had been but one
People; The ſame Kindneſs was ſhewn betwixt
the <hi>Muſcovites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi>
whereby the Inhabitants being inveigled into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

to creep into the Caſtle, to the Number of ſix or
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54715:194"/>
ſeven thouſand, which afterwards proved fatal to
that City.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors having not long after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their Audience of Leave from <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> in
order to their Departure; the King in return

unto which they having anſwered, That they

to ſurrender a Place of ſuch Importance
till the Great Duke were come in Perſon to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City, and Crowned and ſworn to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the beforementioned Articles, they were
not permitted to depart till further Orders. For,
Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> having fully weighed the whole
State of the Matter, and eſpecially their Refuſal
of the Surrender of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> began to be more
and more convinced of their fraudulent Dealings;
and knowing that it was not their free Choice, but
the abſolute Neceſſity of their Affairs that had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Son to the Throne, he had all the Reaſon
to fear, that when he had withdrawn his Forces
out of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> they would make their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by the Unexperience of his Son, and juſtle
him out of the Throne. But if he ſhould forbear
to ſend him till he came to his riper Years, they
would from thence, without queſtion, take Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to recall their Choice, and elect another in his
ſtead. And, conſidering that he had reduced them
to ſuch Straights, as had made them take thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſo little ſuitable to their Incinations, but meerly
invented to diſintangle themſelves out of their
preſent Diſtreſſes, he looked upon it not only as
inglorious by accepting their Conditions to receive
inſtead of impoſing Laws upon them, but alſo
quite inconſiſtent with his own Intereſt and the
Safety of his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54715:195"/>
All his Thoughts therefore, were bent upon the
Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which when taken, he
ſuppoſed he might appear among them as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
and preſcribe ſuch Laws to the dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tful
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> as ſhould be moſt conſiſtent both with
his Honour and Safety. This was the Reſolution
of <hi>Sigiſmund.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his ableſt Counſellors were of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinion; For, tho' they were no leſs ſatisfied
in the deceitful Intentions of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> than
the King himſelf; yet did they not judge it adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to drive Matters to extremities, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that to the hazard of the Sword, which might
be obtained without Oppoſition. They repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King, that the Conqueſt of ſo vaſt an
Empire, could not be obtained without the effuſion
of much Blood, and the Expence of vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
whereas, if what had been ſworn to by <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kievitzki,</hi>
by the King's Orders, were confirmed,
he might in one day, make himſelf Maſter of all
<hi>Muſcovy.</hi> They adviſed him therefore, not to give
the opportunity to an unſtable People to take new
meaſures, who perhaps, when driven to Deſpair,
might ſide with <hi>Demetrius;</hi> which would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all his Pretences of invading that Empire,
ſince he had undertaken his Expedition under the
pretext of aſſiſting him in the Recovery of his
Right; But to ſend Prince <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> aſſiſted by
a good Body of Troops, and ſome able Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
to the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> where he being receiv'd
and Crown'd Great Duke <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> might with their
Aſſiſtance eaſily elude the Practices of the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi>
That by this means, <hi>Smolensko</hi> would fall on
courſe into his Hands, and his Army, beſides this,
might be paid all their Arrears out of the Great
Duke's Treaſure, as belonging to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> their
Prince, who elſe, as the Caſe now ſtood; would
be an intolerable Burthen for the Commonwealth
of <hi>Poland.</hi> And as to what related to the Articles,
they might without much Difficulty, be either
quite evaded, or at leaſt delay'd, till the Prince,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54715:195"/>
ſtrengthened with freſh Supplies out of <hi>Poland,</hi>
ſhould find himſelf in a Capacity to Rule this falſe
and ſtubborn People by ſuch Laws, as he ſhould
judge moſt convenient, and ſuitable to his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
But theſe wholeſome Counſels had no
great Influence over the King, who being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
with a vain Punctilio of Honour, not to
riſe from before <hi>Smolensko</hi> before it was taken, and
with the pernicious Inſinuation of his Flatterers,
who perſwaded him, that the Place was reduced
to that extremity, as not to be able to hold out
long againſt him, he reſolved to leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted
which might contribute to the Rendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or forcing of that important City.</p>
               <p>For which Reaſon, he cauſed a new Battery to
be raiſed, from whence, and ſome others the <hi>Poles,</hi>
fired ſo furiouſly upon the Town, that after ſome
time, they laid flat a great Part of the Wall, and
ruined two Baſtions.<note place="margin">Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko. <hi>ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
                  </note> Upon which it was reſolved
to aſſault the Place, which was executed with a
great deal of Bravery; But thoſe within, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Numerouſneſs of the Garriſon, having
had ſufficient time to raiſe ſtrong Retrenchments,
fortified with Palliſado's, and a good Ditch behind

in the Breach, notwithſtanding their reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Attacks, made with the greateſt Bravery ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,

               <p>After this ill Succeſs of the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>

Violences upon the Citizens, their Wives and Saints,

which being a thing intolerable to People infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

would certainly have produced violent Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

in the Continuation of the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and

Adminiſtration of Affairs, putting ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
into all Places of Truſt, as he thought moſt
convenient for his Purpoſe, they began to conceive
great Jealouſies; and being now by the Death of
<hi>Demetrius</hi> delivered from their Fear on that ſide,
prepared for an open Revolt, in order to prevent
their Empire from becoming a Province of <hi>Poland,</hi>
which they look'd upon to be the main Deſign of
King <hi>Sigiſmund.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt he therefore waſted himſelf at the Siege
of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which he thought ignominious to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
before it was reduced, and thereby let ſlip
the moſt favourable Opportunity in the World, of
Eſtabliſhing his Affairs in that Empire, the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
had, by his Delays, ſufficient Leiſure given
them to reunite themſelves and make Proviſions
for their future Security.</p>
               <p>The firſt that appeared in Arms, towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Spring in the Year 1611, was one
<hi>Lepanovits,</hi> a Man of a great and ancient Family in
<hi>Muſcovy;</hi> he having a great Intereſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
had made ſecret Levies, and appearing with a
Body near <hi>Pereſla,</hi> invited and gained moſt of the
Boyars and Nobility of the neighbouring Provinces
into his Party; He alſo ſent his Meſſengers into the
more remote Parts, to repreſent to his Countrymen
the Breach of Faith of the <hi>Poles;</hi> how they had
poſſeſſed themſelves of their Capital City, broke
the Articles agreed on betwixt both Nations, by
continuing the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and not ſending
their Prince <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> into <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> how that
they, not only kept the <hi>Zuski</hi>'s, but alſo their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
Priſoners againſt the Laws of Nations,
and, in all other Reſpects, treated them not like
a free People, but as Slaves depending from the
Mercy of their Conquerours. He exhorted them
to ſhake off this Foreign Yoak, and by giving
timely Aſſiſtance to ſecure themſelves and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
againſt the Inſolencies of their mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the <hi>Poles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54715:198"/>
This had the deſired Effect; for the Country
flocked in from all Parts, ſo that another great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was raiſed near <hi>Niſi Novogorod,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Proſowecki</hi> a Lord of a very eminent Rank
in <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> and <hi>Zarucki</hi> joined his Forces with
them, under Condition, that ſo ſoon as they ſhould
have cleared their Country from the <hi>Poles,</hi> they
ſhould proclaim the Young <hi>Demetrius,</hi> their Great
Duke and Emperour, which they were very free to
promiſe, tho' they had not the leaſt Intention to
perform it, as <hi>Zarucki</hi> found afterwards to his
Coſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> were not unadvertiſed of the Deſigns
of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> but the King's Forces before
<hi>Smolensko</hi> being ſcarce ſufficient to carry on the
Siege againſt a ſtrong Garriſon, he could not ſpare
any to diſperſe theſe Levies, and the <hi>Poles</hi> within
the City of <hi>Muſco</hi> had enough to do to maintain
their Poſts, and keep that vaſt Multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in ſubjection; ſo that theſe Levies, from a
ſmall Beginning being improved into a great Bulk,
the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces which were quartered up and down
in the Country, to keep it in Obedience, were ſo far
from being able to attack them, that they were
ſcarce ſufficient to keep on the Defenſive.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of the City, being now encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by theſe <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Lords appearing in Arms,
thought it now time to throw off the Mask, and to
give the <hi>Poles</hi> very ſenſible Proofs of their Averſion
towards them. A Deſign therefore was laid among
them, upon a Signal given to aſſemble and maſſacre
all the <hi>Poles</hi> within the City.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Muſco</hi> was at that time much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than it ever was before or ſince, by Reaſon of
the vaſt Confluence of Strangers, who during theſe
inteſtine Commotions were retired thither out of all
the neighbouring Provinces for Sanctuary, ſo that
it was computed to comprehend in its Circuit above
a Hundred and fifty Thouſand Houſes. All this vaſt
Multitude of Inhabitants being enrag'd to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Pitch againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> were ready to lend a

helping Hand to accompliſh the Deſign of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
they only wanting a Head to lead them
on to put it in Execution.</p>
               <p>A thing of this Nature could not be carried on
ſo privately, but that <hi>Gaziowski,</hi> who then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the <hi>Poles</hi> in Chief, had timely Notice of
their projected Deſign, but thinking it not adviſable
to be the firſt Aggreſſor, he diſſembled his Notice,
and contented himſelf with fortifying the two
Quarters of the City called <hi>Catangorod</hi> or the Mid-City,
and <hi>Czargorod</hi> or the City-Royal, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurrounded with good Stone-Walls, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Caſtle, with the Royal Palace, all the
Magazines, and great Houſes of the Nobility and
Merchants, he propoſed to himſelf as a ſafe Retreat
upon all Occaſions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> General <hi>Gaziouski</hi> had ſcarce finiſhed
his Works, before the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> finding by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions

taken vent, reſolved to put it in Execution, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more in their Number than their Conduct, and
having on the third day after <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> drawn
together an incredible Number of People by the
Ringing of the Bells, they attack'd the <hi>Poles,</hi> with

that moſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Muſco</hi> were retired
to the Suburbs called <hi>Strelitza Slavoda,</hi> which lies

               <p>It is computed that a Hundred and twenty

               <p>The Remainders of the Inhabitants ſeeing their

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54715:199"/>
their Forces, they forced the <hi>Poles</hi> into their Works
where they were ſo cloſely beſieg'd, that they had

now riſen to that height, that the King began to
dread every day a Mutiny, having not wherewithal

means before break of day to raiſe Ladders in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places upon the Walls, unperceived by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
ſo that, at the Signal given, the <hi>Germans</hi> firſt
mounted and got up to the Top of the Walls, as
did alſo, not long after, the <hi>Poles,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Palatine, without much Oppoſition
from the Enemy, who being thus attack'd upon a
ſudden, when they leaſt expected it, thoſe Forces
that were left for the Guard of the Walls were not
ſufficient to ſtop the furious Aſſault of the <hi>Poles.</hi>
But the Deſcent from the Wall into the City being
very ſteep, and the whole Garriſon having by this
time taken the Alarm, came flocking in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to the defence of their Walls, the Combat
grew very hot, the <hi>Poles</hi> puſhing forward with
great Bravery to maintain the Advantage they had
got, and the Garriſon armed with Deſpair fighting
like Men either reſolved to vanquiſh or die; ſo that
the Diſpute remained very doubtful, and perhaps
would have ended to the Diſadvantage of the <hi>Poles,</hi>
if the ſame <hi>Novodorski,</hi> whom we mentioned before
to have ſo bravely attacked the Gate of S. <hi>Michael,</hi>
had not come to their Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>For, he having, whilſt they were engaged upon the
Walls, found means to apply a Petard at a certain
ſmall Gate on the ſide of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> he open'd a
ſufficient Paſſage for him and the King's Guards which
were under his Command: In the Head of whom he,
being ſeconded by the Marſhal of <hi>Lithuania, Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanski,</hi>
with ſome Volunteers, aſſaulted and entred
the Place, and having ſlain a few who oppoſed
their Entrance, they marched without any further
Oppoſition directly to the Market-place, where
having fix'd their Banners, they ſoon made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

without diſtinction of Age or Sex, ſo that
the Streets were every where fill'd with Blood and
Slaughter.</p>
               <p>A great Number of the Citizens run with their
Wives and Children, who made moſt horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries,
to the great Church, where being aſſaulted
by the <hi>Poles</hi> they defended themſelves valiantly for
ſome time, but being at laſt overcome, they ſet
fire to ſome Barrels of Powder that had been laid

                  <hi>Sehin</hi> the Weywode or Governour was retired
with about twenty of the principal Officers into a
little Tower upon the Wall, where being ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>Thus was this great City, after having endured
a Siege of near two Years, taken in a few Hours,
in <hi>June,</hi> in the Year 1611. The Honour of which
ought chiefly to be aſcribed to the Bravery and
Conduct of <hi>Bartholomew Novodorski,</hi> Knight of
<hi>Maltha,</hi> and Captain of the King's Guards; who
by his timely opening a Paſſage with his Petard
was the main Inſtrument of the Gaining of the
Place; without which that Attempt of Sealing the
Walls would in all likelihood have prov'd unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or at leaſt would not have been effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Slaughter of a great many of the Beſiegers;
whereas it was now purchaſed with the Loſs of a
few among the <hi>Poles.</hi> The Place being thus ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſtrict Orders were ſent throughout all the
Quarters of the City, to give Quarter, and that the
King had given the Pillage of the City to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as the Reward of their paſt Fatigues and
Dangers. But the Soldiers, eſpecially the <hi>Germans</hi>
and <hi>Poles,</hi> not agreeing about the diſtribution of it,
were upon the point of coming to Blows, when
the King ordered all the Booty to be brought, into
one place in order to make an equal Dividend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. But whilſt they were buſie in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the King's Command, a Fire hapning, by

a great part of it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding a Siege ſuſtained of near two
Years, there was found in the Magazines Proviſions
and Ammunition for three Years longer; ſo that
if they could have had freſh Supplies of Men,
the Place might have been defended much longer,
the Garriſon and Inhabitants which at the beginning
of the Siege conſiſted of near fourſcore, thouſand
Men, able to bear Arms, being reduced to eight or

the Wall, if they had not been more conquered
by their own Fears occaſioned by the ſudden En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of <hi>Novodorski,</hi> than by the Power of their
Enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being under a great Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after the taking of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> who expecting
no leſs than to ſee the whole <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army in a little

their Fury, attacking the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Garriſon in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

               <p>
                  <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> on the other Hand, was adviſed by his
moſt able Counſellours, not to loſe the Fruits of his
Victory, but to improve it to the utmoſt, by carrying

of his late Succeſs could not fail to produce

That if he would but march to the Relief of

to ſettle it by the ſame Arts, by which he had
gained it. And knowing the, <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to be a
People the moſt unſtable in the World, and ſoon
hurried from one Extream to another, he had at

Recourſe to Witchcraft and other violent

The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being, by the Departure of the
King, delivered from what they dreaded moſt, to
wit, his Marching to the Relief of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in <hi>Muſco,</hi> re-aſſumed new Vigour, and, by
their repeated Attacks, preſs'd ſo hard upon the

he contriv'd Counterfeit Letters to be brought to

with Promiſes of a moſt powerful Relief in a
very ſhort time. To take away all the Pretence
from the Soldiers of demanding their Diſmiſſion for
want of Pay, he cauſed a Statue of our Saviour's of
maſſie Gold, valued at near fifty thouſand Pounds,
which ſtood with the Twelve Apoſtles in the Great
Church of the Caſtle (the latter being melted down
by the Order of <hi>Baſili Zuski,</hi> as was mention'd before)
to be divided among the Soldiery, who quickly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed,
the ſame Statue to their Avarice, which they
had adored but a few days before. The General
having by this and ſome other Dividends taken out
of the Treaſury of the Great Dukes of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
(which was in his Poſſeſſion) appeaſed and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
his diſheartned Soldiers, he kept them in
continual Exerciſe by frequent Sallies, from
whence they ſeldom return'd without Advantage,
they were much fluſh'd with this Succeſs againſt
the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a Magazine of Salt without the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications

The Beſiegers and the Beſieged ſtanding equally in

Employment on both ſides.</p>
               <p>This Magazine was at ſo near a diſtance from
the <hi>Poles,</hi> that it would have been no difficult
Matter for them to incloſe it within their Lines,
but their General knowing that their own and the
Enemies Wants would engage them in continual
Skirmiſhes, did not think convenient to take
away this Opportunity of keeping his Men in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>He made it alſo his Buſineſs to ſow the Seeds

ſerved in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Army, from whence he hoped
to reap no ſmall Benefit, if he could bring over the
<hi>Coſacks</hi> to his Party, and at the ſame time contrive
the Deſtruction of <hi>Lepanowitz</hi> the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> General.
For which purpoſe he cauſed ſeveral counterfeit
Letters to be diſperſed in the Provinces written in
<hi>Lepanowitz</hi>'s Name, wherein he commanded the

Money to ſatisfie their Demands, and Strength to

to Entreaties and Promiſes not only of
their Arrears, but alſo of vaſt Rewards; but theſe
verbal Temptations not making the leaſt Impreſſion
upon the Souldiers, the King declar'd that if they

               <p>Some of the Horſe, overcome with Shame and

being at laſt prevail'd upon, not to leave the King

at this critical Juncture, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> reſolv'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute

               <p>I had almoſt forgot to have mention'd here an

which is call'd the <hi>Kings Gate,</hi> the ſame was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
as an inauſpicious Omen to <hi>Sigiſmund.</hi>
For it hapned, that juſt at the ſame Inſtant as he
was to go thro' the abovemention'd Gate, the

               <p>Whilſt the King, who was always dilatory in his
Affairs, was advancing with ſlow Marches towards
the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> had preſſed on the
Siege of the Caſtle with more Vigour than before,
and having perfected their Lines on all ſides, and
fortified them with Redoubts at convenient diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and reduc'd the <hi>Poles</hi> within to great Straights,
who, for want of a ſufficient Number of Foot,
were no longer able to maintain their Works, much

they ſupplied the Defect of their Foot by
the Service of their Horſe, who during the whole
Summer, notwithſtanding all the Paſſages were
fortified and guarded by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> at ſeveral
times broke thro' their Lines and brought in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for the Garriſon. But theſe Supplies being
brought in ſo ſmall Quantities as not to bear any
proportion with the Neceſſities of the Soldiers, who
were at laſt reduced to extream Want, <hi>Chodkievitski</hi>
reſolv'd to make his laſt Effort, and to try whether
he could not by the ſame Way of the River,
which he had made uſe of before, bring in a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of five hundred Waggons, laden with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

For which purpoſe having order'd a Sally to be

draw the greateſt part of their Forces out on that
ſide, ſo that at their Return they were warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the whole Power of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who
knowing the Fate of the Siege to depend from the
Succeſs of this days Action, fought with great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinancy.
The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe, induced by the ſame
Motives fought like Men reſolved to conquer or to
dy, and, notwithſtanding the great Inequality of their
Number, had brought the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Horſe into
Confuſion, and would in all likelihood have carried
the Day, if they had been duly ſeconded by their
Foot commanded by <hi>Struſius.</hi> But he being a near
Kinſman and Creature of <hi>Potocki,</hi>

mentioned before, look'd with an ill Eye upon the
Advancement of <hi>Chodkievitski,</hi> under pretence of
guarding the Convoy of Proviſions, advanced ſo
ſlowly to the Reſcue of the Horſe, that being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
on all ſides, they had enough to do to
fight their Way thro' into the Caſtle, without being
able to execute their Deſign, and were ſoon after
followed by the Foot, who were forced to leave
all the Proviſions intended for their Relief to the
diſpoſal of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Thus the Hopes which King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the conquering of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire
vaniſhed with his Overthrow, which at once loſt
him all the Fruits of his former Victories, acquir'd

their Avenues leading to the Caſtle, and ſo ſtraightly
enclos'd the Garriſon within the Limits of their Walls,
that they took from them all Hopes of receiving
any further Supplies of Proviſions. The <hi>Poles</hi> on
the other Hand knowing the Importance of the

whence depended in a great Meaſure the Fate of
the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Empire; and living in dayly Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Approach of their King, endured all
the Extremities of Famine with an unparallell'd
Reſolution. For after having conſumed every
thing that was eatable, not only Horſes, Cats, Dogs,
Rats, Mice, and other living Creatures, but alſo
the Leather and Coverts of their Trunks and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;
they proceeded to Human Fleſh, feeding

his time at <hi>Viaſna,</hi> where having received this

he and the whole Army were put into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
as is not eaſie to be expreſs'd. Being at
the greateſt Incertitude that poſſibly could be, what
to reſolve upon at this critical Juncture, he called
together all his ableſt Counſellours and moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Officers, to conſult what was beſt to be
done. There were not a few who adviſed him to

Crown, and, in a far advanced Seaſon, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Perſon and the whole Army to eminent
Danger among a Treacherous People. But the

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54715:210"/>
the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire ought not to be quited at ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
a Rate; that if he, without any further Delay,
advanced into the Heart of the Country, it was
not improbable that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> over-awed by
his Preſence at the Head of a good Army, whilſt
their Affairs were yet in an unſettled Condition,
might be induced rather to adhere to their former

in caſe they ſhould be diſappointed in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would be more glorious for them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
an honourable Peace with their Swords in Hand,
than ſhamefully to turn their Backs to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whereby they would be encouraged to carry

               <p>The King having given his Approbation to the

<hi>Federoviſcum,</hi> where having ſet up their
Head Quarters, the King detached a conſiderable
Body of Horſe, to advance to the very Walls of the
City of <hi>Muſco.</hi> They were no ſooner come within
ſight of that City, but they were received with
good ſtore of Shot from the Walls, which being
ſeconded by a furious Sally, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe were
forced to retire with the Loſs of ſome of their
Companions. The King judging by the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given to his Troops before the Imperial City
that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had laid aſide all Thoughts of
receiving his Son <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> for their Great Duke,
and finding himſelf not in a Capacity at preſent to
force them to a Compliance, was uncertain what
Meaſures to take. The worſt of all was, that the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> in the circumjacent Provinces, upon the
firſt News of the Surrender of the Caſtle of <hi>Muſco,</hi>
and the Approach of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, had carried
all their Proviſions into their ſtrong Holds; ſo that
King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Army which conſiſted moſt of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
was in great Diſtreſs for want of Forage
in a Country where the Winter-Seaſon affords no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

ſo Majeſtick, and out-braving her preſent

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54715:211"/>
as for her own part, ſhe had of late been ſo much
accuſtomed to the perpetual Viciſſitudes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as not to be terrified at her approaching
Death, by which ſhe hoped to exchange her Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for everlaſting Joys; That her only Concern
was for the young Babe, whoſe tender Age, as it
was incapable of committing any Crimes, ſo her

in her Ruin by the Inſatiable Revenge of her
Enemies. Being not allowed to ſay any more, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a few Minutes beſtowed in pious Ejaculations,

               <p>She was a Lady of an immenſe Ambition, and of
a Greatneſs of Mind uncommon to her Sex; as her
aſpiring Thoughts gave place to all other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo the Deſire of Empire was the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Paſſion of her Soul, which had made her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark

Deſtruction. The Greatneſs of her Courage and
Conſtancy was ſuch, as that ſhe refuſed even to the

And in the very loweſt Ebb of Fortune, ſuch was
her Ambition as to refuſe the Letters of certain

               <p>The Loſs of ſo great an Army, put the whole

when the People began to murmur openly, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54715:216"/>
ſome of the great ones were ſuſpected to have a
Finger in the Treaſon. King <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> ſent an
Ambaſſador to the Great Duke immediately after
this Defeat of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who by his Inſolent
Behaviour ſufficiently expreſt the Senſe the <hi>Poles</hi>
had of the preſent turbulent State of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi>

and to uncover themſelves firſt, (which they
refuſe to all other Nations) declaring publickly,
that he was not come there to do the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
any Honour, but to receive it from them. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the Great Duke's Horſes at his Entrance and
made uſe of his own. At his Audience he would
needs make his Propoſition Sitting, and perceiving
that when he pronounced the Name and Titles of
his King,<note place="margin">Inſolence of a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> the Boyars did not uncover themſelves,
he ſtopp'd till ſuch time as he ſaw the Great Duke
command them ſo to do. King <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> had not
ſo much as ſent the uſual preſents to the Great
Duke (without which otherwiſe Ambaſſadors are
never admitted to publick Audience) the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
only preſented him, as from himſelf, with a
very rich Coach, which the Great Duke having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of, he ſent him before his Departure a
rich Preſent of Sables, which the Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
with Scorn. The Great Duke thereupon ſent
back his Coach, which he was ſo angry at, that he
kick'd the Priſtaff, (who brought the Meſſage)
from the Top of a very high pair of Stairs to the
Bottom.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke being highly incenſed thereat,
yet was fain to diſſemble his Reſentment, in the
preſent ill Poſture of his Affairs, he only ſent
word to the Ambaſſador, that he knew not whether
this Behaviour of his was according to his Maſter's
Order, or whether it proceeded from his own violent
Inclinations; That if he had acted according to
the King's Commands, he muſt have Patience till a
more favourable Juncture ſhould preſent to give
himſelf Satisfaction for the Affronts put upon
him; That tho' by his late Diſgrace before <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko</hi>

he was at preſent not in a Capacity to ſhew
his Reſentment as he ought to do, the Event of

done was without the King's Order, (as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd)
and upon his own Account, Complaint
ſhould be made of it to the King his Maſter, from

               <p>The Father having obſerved ſomething more than
Ordinary in him, had been very careful of giving
him the higheſt degree of <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Education,
which conſiſts in Reading, Writing, and Singing,
ſo that he was look'd upon in thoſe Parts as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of an uncommon Capacity. The Excellency
of his Voice and his Skill in Singing, had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
recommended him to the Archbiſhop of the
Place, who took him into his Service, wherein he
behaved himſelf ſo well, that he beſtowed one of

               <p>After the Archbiſhop's Death, having ſquandred
away his Wifes Fortune, he ſettled himſelf in the
City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> where by the recommendation of a

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54715:218"/>

told, that one of the chiefeſt Merchants of <hi>Volog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>

being willing to ſhew his Friend the higheſt Act of

to lend him his Wifes Pearls and other Jewels,
which were of a conſiderable Value. His Friend ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
without the leaſt difficulty granted his Requeſt,
lent him the Jewels, without the leaſt Precaution,
or taking any thing under his Hand for the Receipt
of them; ſo that, when he demanded his Jewels,
<hi>Timoska</hi> averr'd that he had not lent him any. <hi>Spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>
clapt him up in Priſon, but having no Evidence
againſt him, he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of making up his Accompts with the
Money he received for the Jewels, which he ſold, he
ſquandred it away upon his Extravagancies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
great differences ariſing betwixt him and his
Wife, who had a very lewd Tongue, and would
frequently upbraid him with his treacherous Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
both to his Prince and Friend, and fearing that
he might be called to an Account for his Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and that his Wife might be the main Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſaw <hi>Timoska</hi> without the leaſt Alteration in his

That it was poſſible that one <hi>Timoska Ankudina</hi>
might have converted the Great Duke's Money
to his own uſe, and committed many other Villanies,
but that this was no Concern of his; That his

evaded thereby what he had form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that as to what he ſpoke of his Wife's Jewels
could not have the leaſt Relation to him, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
having put him above the Rank of a poor
Mechanick or Seller of Pins, alluding to the Word
<hi>Spilki,</hi> which in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Tongue ſignifies as
much as <hi>Pinmaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had ſome time before upon the Perſwaſion of
a certain <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Gentleman writ a Letter with his

he had writ, That he was a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> born, and

That he had once (when he was at the <hi>Ottoman</hi>

but that he had been diverted from this pernicious

with an Intention to return into <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> That
it would elſe have been no difficult Matter for him
to have made his Eſcape out of Priſon if he had
not ſtayed for the Great Duke's Command.</p>
               <p>This Letter being look'd upon as a material
Point to overcome his Obſtinacy, was produced and
read in his Preſence, but this had no more Influence
over him than the Preſence of <hi>Spilki,</hi> whom he
called a Cheat who had conterfeited the Letter to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54715:220"/>
his Deſtruction. To confirm which, he writ ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Letter ſo different both in the Stile and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
from the former, that the moſt quick-ſighted
could not find the leaſt Reſemblance betwixt
them.</p>
               <p>His Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> ſeeing all their
Endeavours of making a true Diſcovery of the
Impoſture to prove unſuceſsful, ordered ſome of
his Privy Council to examine him, and to try
whether, out of his former Depoſitions they might
not be able to convince him concerning the true
State of his Affairs. They asked him, For what
Reaſon he was proſecuted by the Great Duke;
what could be the Reaſon of his having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo particular a Prejudice againſt his Perſon?
What Houſe and Family he was deſcended of?
And whether he were of any Kin to the Great
Duke? He anſwered, That he was no Kinſman of
the Great Duke, foraſmuch as his Father was a
Prince born; whereas the Great Duke's Father was
but a Gentleman; That he was a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> by
Extraction, but born and brought up in <hi>Poland;</hi>

               <p>But theſe Depoſitions varying much from what

with all the uſual Pomp, they wanting time to

<hi>Moroſou</hi> changed the Quality of Governour into
that of Protector, exerciſing, during the Princes

The Maid remained a Virgin ever after till her

that his former Intereſt being now ſtrengthned by

was not altogether anſwerable to his great Fortune

               <p>They had alſo found out another Invention to
raiſe the Price of Salt from twenty to thirty Pence

This proved a heavy Burthen to the People, and of

They were as yet not ſo bold as to dare to

They had watched ſeveral Opportunities to

his Devotions or Divertiſements, but in vain; for
the <hi>Boyars,</hi> who attended his Perſon had always
took it from them, telling them that they would
make a Report of it to the Great Duke; but this
being done according to the Inſtructions received
from <hi>Moroſou,</hi> the Petition was not as much as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
much leſs their Grievances redreſſed.</p>
               <p>This hapning ſo often, that they found themſelves
abſolutely miſtaken in their whole Expectation, it
was reſolved, that they ſhould meet together, and
inſpite of all the Oppoſition from the <hi>Boyars</hi> make
their Complaints to the Great Duke by way of
Mouth. The ſixth of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1648<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
pitch'd upon as a day fit for the execution of their
Deſign, when they knew the Great Duke was to
be preſent at a Proceſſion to be made to a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the City, called <hi>Stertenski.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People were got early together in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the great Market-place before the Caſtle, to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54715:228"/>
ſee him and his Cavalcade paſs by as they were wont
to do upon ſuch like Occaſions; But, whether it
was that they did not think themſelves ſtrong
enough, other that their Leaders were not
preſent, they did not make the leaſt Signs of diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
at his going to the Monaſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, at his
return, they broke through thoſe that attended the
Great Duke, came up to him, ſtay'd him, and
taking hold of his Horſes Bridle, intreated him to
take their preſent Caſe into his Conſideration, to
hearken to the juſt Complaints of his Subjects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Injuſtices and Violences committed by
<hi>Pleſſou,</hi> deſiring that a Perſon of known Integrity
might be put in his Place, who ſhould better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
ſo great a Truſt.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke was not a little ſtartled at this
unexpected procedure of the populace, but diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
both his Surprize and Reſentment, he ſpoke
to them with a very chearful Countenance, telling
them, that he was much troubled to underſtand the
Grievances of his good Subjects, occaſioned by the
Miſmanagement of <hi>Pleſſou,</hi> that he would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
examine the whole Matter, and take care that
they ſhould receive due Satisfaction in relation to all
their juſt Complaints.</p>
               <p>The Generality of the people appeared to be well
ſatisfied with the Great Dukes Promiſe, which they
teſtified by their joyful Acclamations; but ſome
thronging ſtill about the Great Duke's Horſe, the
Boyars who attended at this Solemnity, being for
the moſt part Friends of <hi>Pleſſou,</hi> gave abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

which ſo incenſed the Populace, that the Stones

The Strelits (or the Czar's Guards of Muſqueteers)
uſed all their endeavours to ſtop the Current of the
Populace that were thronging into the Caſtle Gates,
but their reſiſtance proving fruitleſs, by reaſon of
the infinite number of the People, it rather enflamed
than abated their Fury, who cried out with one
Voice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if <hi>Pleſſow</hi> were not immediately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into their Hands, they would force the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>The Clamours and Threats of the People had put
thoſe within into a great Conſternation, and not
knowing what courſe beſt to take, <hi>Moroſſou</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to appear in the great Balcony, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by his Authority, to appeaſe the Tumult, deſiring
them in the Great Dukes Name, to repair to their
reſpective Homes. He had ſcarce leiſure given him
to ſpeak a few words, when ſome of the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
among them tells him, That they were glad
to ſee him there, knowing him to be of the ſame
Stamp with <hi>Pleſſou,</hi> and that he ſhould expect no
better treatment than the other, which he ſhould
ſoon experience to his coſt. They had no ſooner
ſaid theſe words, but they led the Populace to his
Palace, which being within the Precinct of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
they forced, ranſack'd, and pull'd down in an
inſtant, after they had thrown ſome of his Servants
out of the Windows, becauſe they had made ſome
Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> generally ſhew a great deal of
Veneration to the Images of their Saints, whom

and not ſparing the Images of the Saints; they
broke to pieces his Coach of State, the richeſt that
was ever ſeen in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> beat out the bottoms of
the Strong Water Barrels, threw his Ladies Jewels
and Pearls into the Street, trod on them with their

Great Dutcheſs her Siſter, and the Great Duke, for
whom they had ſtill a great Veneration, that they
did not make her pay with her Life for the Villanies
of her Husband.</p>
               <p>But this was only the Prologue to the enſuing
Tragedy. For from thence they went ſtraightway
to the Houſe of <hi>Pleſſou,</hi> which they ranſack'd and
demoliſh'd in a moment: The ſame Game they
play'd with the Palace of <hi>Nazri Ivanovits Tziſton,</hi>
Lord Chancellour of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whom they Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to their fury, becauſe he had Farm'd the new
Impoſition upon Salt. It was his misfortune to be
juſt then ſick in Bed, by reaſon of an accident that
had hapned within ſome days before, when meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſtreets with a mad Ox, he was thrown
by his Horſe with ſo much violence, that it had put
him in danger of his Life; but hearing how the
Populace was in Arms, and in what manner they
had ranſack'd the Palace of <hi>Moroſou</hi> and <hi>Pleſſou,</hi> and
judging, not without reaſon, that they would alſo
give him a Viſit in his turn, he hid himſelf under a
great heap of Birch, which at a certain time, the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> make Proviſion of againſt the Winter, to
ſerve their Stores; and to take away all ſuſpicion,
he had cauſed a good number of Flitches of Bacon
to be laid acroſs of them. He had ſcarce had leiſure
enough to prepare this retiring place, before the
Clamours of the approaching Rabble gave him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
warning what he had to expect from them:
To be ſhort, they forc'd open the Doors, took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all his rich Movables, and knowing him to be
in no condition of ſtirring abroad, ſearch'd for him in
all the moſt abſtruſe corners of the Houſe, even to
the Cella<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him out, he had certainly eſcaped their Hands for
that time, if he had not been betray'd by one of
his Servants, who being inticed by a good Summ of
Money which was immediately given him, ſhew'd
them the place where his Maſter lay concealed.
The enraged Multitude, without any further delay,
draggs him out by the Heels into the ſtreets, where
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54715:229"/>
they immediately cudgelled him to death. This
done, they threw his Body upon the Dunghil, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd
his Houſe, and laid it level with the ground.</p>
               <p>The ſame they did to the Houſe of <hi>Peter Tichtono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits
Trochaniſtou,</hi> whom we have mentioned before
to have been conſtituted Overſeer over the Great
Duke's Arſenal, and to all others whom they knew
to have any Relation or Dependance on <hi>Moroſou;</hi>
which afforded them ſuch a Booty, that they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
the Pearls in their Caps; and as for rich Furs
and all Sorts of the beſt Silk Stuffs, they had ſuch a
Quantity of them as to throw them about in the
Streets for any body to take them up at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Populace ſpent the whole day in ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacking
and pulling down of the Houſes, thoſe in
the Caſtle had leiſure given them to barricado and
prepare themſelves againſt their Return, which
they expected the next Morning, they continuing
in ſuch a Poſture all the Night as ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they only expected Daylight to renew the old
Game.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke in the mean while, having found
his <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Guards inſufficient the day before to
make head againſt the Inſolencies of the People,
had ſent for the <hi>German</hi> Officers with their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that were quartered near the City, to meet
at their ſeveral Rendezvouſes, and to march with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay to the Relief of the Caſtle. Purſuant
to theſe Orders they marched the next Morning
with Drums beating, and Colours flying, and Arms
ready, thro' the Heart of the City to the Caſtle;
whereat the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> being not a little terrified,
durſt not attempt to ſtop their Paſſage, but inſtead
of Oppoſing them, gave them Way, telling them
as they paſſed by, that they knew them to be Men
of Honour and Courage, who had no dependance
on thoſe Villains who by their Miſmanagement abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the People, and that they had no Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. Having therefore without the leaſt
Oppoſition taken up their ſeveral Poſts aſſigned
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54715:230"/>
them for their Guards, the Great Duke laid hold
of this Opportunity, to endeavour the Appeaſing
of the Tumult by the Authority of Knez <hi>Nikita
Ivanovits Romanow,</hi> whom he knew to be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
by the People.</p>
               <p>He appear'd before them with Cap in Hand, and
told them in the Name of the Great Duke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that he hoped they would be ſatisfied with the
Promiſe and Aſſurance given by his Czariſh Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
own Mouth, that he himſelf would take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
of the Matter, and remedy the Grievances
of which they complained. That his Majeſty had
ſent him on purpoſe to give them freſh Aſſurances,
that he was not unmindful of his Word, but would
give them all the Satisfaction in this Point they
could reaſonably deſire, and to adviſe them to
break up the Aſſembly and for every one to repair
to his own Home, that he might the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he had promiſed them the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>This Meſſage being received with the joyful Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the People, ſufficiently teſtifying their
Approbation, anſwer was made that they had no
reaſon to be diſſatisfied with the Great Duke, but
with thoſe who made uſe of his Name and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to execute their execrable Villanies upon the
People; And that therefore they could not reſt
ſatisfied, nor would they ſtir from the Place, till
<hi>Boris Ivanovits Moroſou, Leponti Stephanovits Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou,</hi>
and <hi>Peter Tichtonovits Trochaniſtou</hi> were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might revenge upon
their Heads all thoſe Miſchiefs they had done the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romanow</hi> ſhewed them his Acknowledgment
for the favourable Audience they had afforded
him, telling them, that he would immediately go
and acquaint the Great Duke with the Zeal and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they had expreſſed for his Perſon, and that
he did not queſtion but that the Great Duke would
grant their Requeſt, and order the Execution of
thoſe three Lords, who had drawn upon themſelves the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54715:230"/>
Hatred of his good Subjects, by their Miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but that he was ready to ſwear to them
by the Croſs, that <hi>Moroſou</hi> and <hi>Trochaniſtou</hi> had
made their Eſcape at the firſt beginning of the
Tumult, and for the third, he dares engage his
Word, he ſhould be brought to Execution immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romanow</hi> being returned to the Great Duke, it
was, after a ſhort Debate, reſolved to ſacrifice
<hi>Pleſſou</hi> and <hi>Trochaniſtou</hi> to the Fury of the People,
who with a great deal of Impatience waited at the
Caſtle Gatefor the Great Duke's Anſwer, but to
endeavour by all means poſſible the Preſervation of
<hi>Moroſou;</hi> but that, to appeaſe the Rage of the
People, Word ſhould be ſent them immediately,
that <hi>Pleſſou</hi> was coming out forthwith to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed,
and that the other two ſhould receive the
ſame Puniſhment, ſo ſoon as they were found,
which was done accordingly; and the People being
deſired to ſend for the Executioner to do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
they had him ready at Hand with all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
attending at the Caſtle Gate; whence, in leſs

                  </note> in order to cut off his Head. But
the People were ſo exaſperated againſt him, that
they fell upon him immediately with Cudgels ſo
outrageouſly that they diſpatched him in a Moment.
His Body was dragged by the Feet thro' the Streets,
accompanied with Millions of Curſes of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace;
till at laſt a Monk who had a particular
Spleen againſt the deceaſed, cut off his Head, and

to eſcape the Hands of his Enemies, but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
upon the Road by ſome of the Great Duke's
Meſſengers (who for fear of being thought to have
conſented to his Eſcape, had been forced to employ
all his Care in finding him out) he was brought the
next day, being the 8th of <hi>July,</hi> to the ſame place
where he uſed to ſit as Judge over the Cannoniers,
Armourers, and others belonging to the Great
Duke's Arſenal; where, by order from the Great
Duke, he had his Head cut off.</p>
               <p>By this time the People being informed how <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſou</hi>
had been ſeen in the Country, and ignorant of

with the Execution of <hi>Trochaniſtou</hi> for this
time, forbearing to preſs any further upon the Great

reducing to Aſhes all the Houſes within the
compaſs of the White Wall (which ſurrounds that
Quarter) down to the River <hi>Neglina:</hi> Towards
Night it got over that River into the Great Duke's
Taverns, into his Store-Houſes for Strong Waters
and other Proviſions, where it conſumed above ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand Flitches of Bacon, and an incredible
quantity of <hi>Aqua-Vitae;</hi> which being the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Fuel in the World to nouriſh the Flame, it
grew ſo violent, that the Caſtle was in moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger to have been reduced to Aſhes by this

fury, becauſe thoſe who had the Charge of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of performing that Service; many of them
lying in the ſtreets choak'd with the Smoak and
Vapours, which ſo terified the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> that none

               <p>About Mid-night ſome Foreigners looking with
no ſmall aſtoniſhment on the Fire, which juſt then
had ſeiſed upon one of the Store-Houſes, where
were kept a great quantity of Bacon for the Great
Duke's Proviſion, they perceived, at ſome diſtance,
a Monk with a Sack upon his back coming towards
them, as if he carried a very great Burthen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near to them, they asked him what made him
thus blow and be all in a ſweat? He to told them,
that he had made all the haſte he could, to come
to quench the Flames' that if they would but lend
him a helping Hand, to throw the Body (which he
ſhew'd them) of the curſed <hi>Pleſſou</hi> into the Fire,
they ſhould ſoon ſee the Flame loſe its force. The
Strangers having refuſed to comply with his deſire,
which they looked upon as ridiculous, he heap'd
upon them a thouſand Curſes, till ſome <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
upon his perſwaſions, were prevailed upon to do
him the good Office, and to help him to caſt the

               <p>Thoſe in the Caſtle-having thus weathered the
Storm that threatned them, the following days were
taken up in Conſultations how to continue this Calm
among the People, and by which means to preſerve
<hi>Moroſou</hi> from falling into their Hands: For which
reaſon, the Patriarch having ſent for thoſe among
the Prieſts and Monks, whom he knew to be of

of <hi>Muſco;</hi> they were enjoin'd to do their utmoſt

the imaginable Thanks and Promiſes of their future
Fidelity; ſo that the Czar thinking this a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to declare his Sentiments concerning <hi>Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſou,</hi>
he reaſſumed the Diſcourſe, telling them, That
he was not forgetful of what he had promiſed them
ſometime before concerning <hi>Boris Ivanovits Moroſou,</hi>
and that he was obliged to confeſs, that he had
tranſacted many things, which he would not in
any wiſe juſtifie; but that on the other Hand, he
had ſo much confidence in his good People, as to
hope they would excuſe him,. if at this time he
could not immediately reſolve to condemn him to
Death. That this being his firſt Requeſt, he lived
in hopes they would not deny it him, which was,
that for once they would pardon the paſt Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of <hi>Moroſou,</hi> on whom he deſired them to
look as one who had been the Guardian of their
Prince, and had Married the Great Dutcheſs's Siſter,
who upon this double account muſt needs be very
dear to him, and conſequently that it would be the
hardeſt thing in the World, for him to conſent to his
Death. That he himſelf would be anſwerable for
his future Good Behaviour, not queſtioning but
that he would behave himſelf ſo as that they ſhould
not have the leaſt reaſon to complain of him; and,
that if they would declare him incapable by their
unanimous Vote, of being admitted into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
for the future, he ſhould be diſmiſs'd.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke being then not twenty Years of
Age, and of a very tender Conſtitution, could not
forbear to accompany his laſt words with ſome
Tears, which ſo moved the People, that they cried
out with one Voice, <hi>Long live our Great Duke, God

his Thanks, and extolled their Zeal and Affection
for his Perſon, returned to the Caſtle well ſatisfied

in having been ſo ſucceſsful, to reconcile his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law
to the Citizens of his Imperial City of
<hi>Muſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some days after, the Great Duke according to
Cuſtom, went a Pilgrimage to the Monaſtry of
<hi>Troitza,</hi> about Threeſcore Miles from <hi>Muſco,</hi> when
<hi>Moroſou</hi> took this opportunity of appearing again the
firſt time in Publick. As he went through the City
he was uncovered, Saluting the People on both ſides
of the way with great Submiſſion. He countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Old Nobility for ſome time, and ever after
laid hold on all occaſions to gratifie the People, and
aſſiſt thoſe who Addreſs'd themſelves to him in any
Buſineſs they had at Court; ſo that in a little time
there appear'd a great change in the Affairs of the
Government of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> and <hi>Moroſou</hi> became the
Favourite of the People, and the Patron to all
Strangers, maintaining his Greatneſs till his Old
Age, when he died much lamented by the People, but
not the Nobility; and as much beloved by his Prince
as he had been always ſucceſsful in his Counſels.</p>
               <p>But to return where we left off, notwithſtanding
this Remarkable Alteration in the Government,
there hapned not long after another Revolt, which,
if it had not been timely prevented by the vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of thoſe at the Helm, might have proved of
dangerous Conſequence to the Empire, which was
occaſioned thus:</p>
               <p>Some differences were ariſen betwixt the two
Crowns of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> by reaſon that the
Subjects of both Kingdom, leaving their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their Reſpective Native Countries, uſed to
ſeek for ſhelter in the others Dominions, to avoid
the Payment of their Debts. Theſe differences im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by ſome Reaſons of State were riſen to that
height, that both States ſeem'd to be threatned with
an inevitable War, unleſs prevented by a ſpeedy
Compoſition: In order to which the Great Duke
<hi>Alexis Michaelovits</hi> ſent in the Year 1649. (the next
following after the Inſurrection in the City of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co)</hi>
a Solemn Ambaſſy to <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:54715:233"/>
the Chief whereof was a certain <hi>Ocolnitza</hi> called
<hi>Bonis Ivanovits Puskia.</hi> And in regard that it was
32 Years ſince the Accounts had been cleared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Nations, it was Agreed by certain
Articles made at that time, That for the firſt Thirty
Years there ſhould be a Liquidation of all Accounts;
but that in regard there were more <hi>Swedes</hi> now in
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> than there were <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> by
which the firſt remain'd conſiderably Indebted to
the laſt; the Great Duke ſhould pay to the Crown
of <hi>Sweden</hi> 190000 Rubles, which amounts to Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
odd Thouſand Pounds Sterling of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
whereof 300000 Crowns were to be paid in
ready Caſh, and the reſt in Rye; and the whole
Payment to be at the beginning of the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Year, which was but a few Months after the
Concluſion of the Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Purſuant to this Agreement, the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi>
had ſent one <hi>John Rhodes</hi> in Quality of her Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner
into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who received the above-named
300000 Crowns in Ducats, and as to what related
to the Rye, he was ordered to receive it from one
<hi>Fedor Amilianou,</hi> a <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Merchant in the City
of <hi>Pleskou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Merchant having been Impowered by the
Great Duke to buy up thereabouts ſo much Rye for
his Uſe as would anſwer the remaining part of the
Debt, which amounted to 90000 Crowns, made
uſe of this opportunity to enrich himſelf at the coſt
of his poor fellow Subjects. For having, under the
Cover of the Great Duke's Authority, caus'd all
the Rye thereabouts to be ſeis'd, and not permitting
any body either to buy or to ſell any without his
leave, he Engroſſed the whole Commodity for his
own uſe, ſelling it at his own Rate, which was ſo
exceſſive, that a great many poor people were
droven to the greateſt extremity for want of it.

of the fair Sex, and for his Satisfaction enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a good Number of very handſom <hi>Poliſh</hi> and
<hi>Tartarian</hi> Female-Slaves. His eager purſuit after
amorous Pleaſures had almoſt loſt him the Czar's
Favour; as an Apoplexy diſabled him at laſt in
Body and Mind, ſo as to know no Body without

               <p>He was ſucceded in his high Employments, by
the juſt now mentioned <hi>Naſhockin,</hi> who was alſo
made Chancellor of the Ambaſſadors Office, and
Governour of <hi>Ruſſia Minor.</hi> He was a Perſon of
more than ordinary Integrity, not to be corrupted
by Preſents or other Illegal means; very ſober and
indefatigable in Buſineſs. The firſt proofs of his
great Capacity he gave at the Concluſion of the

               <p>This <hi>Bogdan</hi> was bred up with the Czar from a

High Sreward of the Houſhold, having in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal

the Whiſpering Favourite, becauſe the Czar asked
his Advice oftner in his Cloſet than at the Councel-Board.

would frequent Mid-night Prayers, ſtanding four

Ground. During the great Faſts, he would eat but
three Meals a Week, being contented for the reſt,
with a piece of Brown Bread and Salt, a pickled
Muſhroon or Cucumber, and a Cup of Quas, or
ſmall Mead. In ſhort, it has been obſerved of him,
that no Monk was ever more obſervant of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
hours, than he of Faſts; it having been
computed, that he faſted above Eight Months in
the Year. He would alſo frequently appear at the
Proceſſions bare-headed and on foot, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a declared Patron of the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Church;
notwithſtanding which, he would ſometimes make
bold with the Church Revenue upon Loan, in

knowing that the Church Treaſury, which is
ſupplied out of the beſt part of the Empire, may now

Publick. He alſo made an Ordinance to reſtrain
the profuſe Bounty of dying Men to the Clergy;
neither would he ever ſuffer a Monaſtery to be
Founded without his Licenſe.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Good-Friday</hi> he uſed to viſit in the Night
all the Priſons in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> to take Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Cogniſance of all the Priſoners; among whom
he would buy out ſome that were in Debt, and
releaſe others that were Criminals; and beſtow
ſometimes great Summs for the uſe of ſuch as he
knew to be really neceſſitated. He would cauſe
the Empreſs to do the ſame, and to redeem yearly
a certain number of Women out of Priſon. He
ordered alſo at about ſeven or eight Miles diſtance
from the Imperial City, Work-Houſes to be built
for Hemp and Flax, in that good Order, Beauty
and Capacity, that they were ſufficient to Employ
all the poor in the Kingdom with Work; having
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54715:238"/>
ſettled for that uſe a good many Miles of waſte
Lands, by which he improved the Manufactury of
the Country, and fed his Labourers at a very
cheap rate. He Aſſign'd that part of the Building
where the Women were Employ'd, for the Uſe
and Profit of the Empreſs. He was of ſo mild a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that he ſeldom condemned any to Death, but
moſt commonly to the Strapado and Baniſhment
into <hi>Siberia.</hi> Being one time urg'd by ſome of
his Foreign Officers, to make it Death for any Man
to Deſert his Colours; he anſwered them, <hi>That he

under the Conduct of the Premier Miniſter, Knez
<hi>Gallizin</hi> (her Creature) with a great deal of dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for ſome time, till at laſt by the removal of
this her faithful Councellor, being deprived of his

not been diſcovered before the Conſpirators could
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54715:242"/>
meet with an opportunity to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This was a <hi>German</hi> by Birth, whoſe name was
<hi>Sickler,</hi> who having a conſiderable Command in
the Czar's Army, and being extreamly beloved by
him, had a free Acceſs to his Perſon. This Man
being inticed by the hopes of extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(even of the Crown of <hi>Muſcovy)</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took

executed his Deſign, if the Conteſts that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

               <p>
                  <hi>Sickler</hi> in the mean while, who was a good Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Companion,
having utter'd ſome Words to a
Friend of his at ſeveral times, relating to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Project, he conceived ſo much a horror at it,
that he was reſolved to diſcover, what he had heard
<hi>Sickler</hi> ſay concerning the Conſpiracy; But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be in great favour with the Czar, he was
not without reaſon afraid, that his Depoſitions
might be interpreted by the adverſe Faction, as
proceeding from Envy or Malice, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
inſtead of ſerving his Prince, turn to his own
deſtruction, he reſolved to proceed with as much
caution as poſſibly he could in a Matter of ſo much
Moment.</p>
               <p>For which purpoſe having one day met a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the Conſpiracy, as he had heard him ſay at ſeveral
times in his preſence; he began to enter upon a
Diſcourſe of their common Friend <hi>Sickler,</hi> and in
a careleſs Manner to repeat ſeveral Paſſages, which
he had received from <hi>Sickler</hi>'s own Mouth. His
Friend being not a little ſurpriſed at the Imprudence

very ſtrong and well-ſet, being above ſix Foot
high, and tho' in his whole demeanour there appears
a great deal of Majeſty; yet is his Converſation full
of an engaging Familiarity, without the leaſt
appearance of Pride even to the meaneſt of his
Subjects; but his chief delight is in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of Strangers, with whom he will at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Times converſe no otherwiſe than if they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54715:243"/>
were his Equals, and be very frolickſome in their
Company.</p>
               <p>Thus he did ſome Years ago in the River of <hi>Arch-Angel</hi>
with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and a Captain
of a Ship belonging to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Company. This
Ship, called the <hi>Perry</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> carrying 30 Guns,
arrived in the Year 1694, in the beginning of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in the River of <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> at the ſame time,
that the preſent Czar was come thither to take a

to be bought for his Service in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour having ſome days after, invited

at 3 a Clock in the Afternoon, with 40
or 50 of his Attendance, where he paſſed away his
Time ſo pleaſantly, that he did not depart till next
Morning after Sun riſe.</p>
               <p>The next day he invited the Captain, all the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Merchants, and Maſters of Ships, to dine with
him at a Houſe in an adjacent Iſland, where being
ſeated at the ſame Table with the Emperour, he,
after Dinner was over, cauſed them all to be wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an Engine brought lately from <hi>Holland;</hi>
Which done, he made them all, without the leaſt

what they had to do.</p>
               <p>Having diſmiſſed them for that time, they
were invited again a few days after to the ſame
Iſland, where they all play'd at Nine-Pins and Bowls
till Night, when expecting the Czar's Orders to
depart, he told them that they muſt ſtay with him
till the Wind turn'd fair; ſo that they were forced
to ſtay two days and nights, during which time
they ſpent the days in Merriment, and a few hours
in the Nights upon the hard Boards; when the Wind
veering about, they got leave to depart, and ſet
Sail for <hi>England.</hi>

As he takes great delight in the Company of
Strangers, ſo he makes uſe moſt commonly of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Habits, even in his own Country; which the
preſent Patriarch of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> looking upon as not
agreeable to their own Cuſtoms, took the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he met the preſent Czar one day at his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Palace, then lying upon her Death-bed, to tell
him in her Preſence, That the Czars his Predeceſſors
uſed always to endeavour to maintain the good
Will of their Subjects, by accommodating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their moſt antient Cuſtoms, and to appear
in the ſame Habit with their Subjects; To which
the Czar made anſwer: <hi>Father, are you not the Head
of the</hi> Muſcovian <hi>Church; to which he having reply'd,
yes Sir, by your Favour? the Czar</hi> ſaid, <hi>and why

               <p>But a Prieſt of his Attendance did not come
at ſo cheap a Rate in the <hi>Hague;</hi> For the Czar,
having been informed, that all the Day of the
proclaiming of the Peace he got exceſſively drunk,
laid this Penance upon him, to wit, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in twiſting of Ropes for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which having cut the poor Fellows Hand

               <p>Beſides which, he took all the Precaution

the Deſigns of his Enemies, if perhaps in his
Abſence they ſhould have a mind to try their
Fortune.</p>
               <p>For which Reaſon he not only committed

Thus much is unqueſtionable, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of improving himſelf in the Art of
Navigation and all Sea-Affairs, is ſuch as to
ſurpaſs the induſtry of moſt private Men, who
apply themſelves to it out of a bare Proſpect

               <p>I have heard it related by very credible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that he would not only go frequently to
<hi>Sordam</hi> (a large Village on the oppoſite Shore
of the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> on the ſame Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
moſt inhabited by Shipwrights employed
there in the building of Ships, in Diſguiſe,
on purpoſe to inſtruct himſelf in every thing
belonging to that Trade; But he uſed often
to go diſguiſed in a Sea-man's Habit into the
Yard of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe, where he would
be employed in fetching and carrying ſuch
Materials as are requiſite for the building of
Ships, which he would ſee put in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

himſelf in working in concert with the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights.</p>
               <p>It is by this incredible Deſire of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf in this, as well as all other uſeful
Arts and Sciences, that he has ſo improved his
Judgment, as to be able to examine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf concerning all Matters relating to
Military Affairs, whether by Sea or Land; both
which he endeavours to improve, far beyond
whatever was attempted by any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
which is ſufficiently apparent by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
communication betwixt the two Rivers,
<hi>Wolga</hi> and <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the diſcovery of <hi>Nova

that his generous endeavours have not proved

in regard of his illuſtrious Extraction, or
the high Station he was ſettled in, of being Chief
Miniſter of State, by the favours of the eldeſt Czar
<hi>John,</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Sophia,</hi> who's Creature he was.
He was undoubtedly one of the beſt Head pieces
in the Kingdom, and the moſt Knowing, and moſt
Accompliſh'd of all the <hi>Muſcovian Boyars,</hi> always
addicted to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of the preſent <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. that
he cauſed his Son to wear his Picture conſtantly
upon his Breaſt. It was chiefly owing to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and dexterity, that the Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> had
ſeized upon the Adminiſtration of the Government
during the Minority of the two Czars, her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in which ſhe continued for ſeveral Years; by
the extraordinary Conduct of this her faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
till the Boyars and Chief of the Nobility,
who were altogether in the Intereſt of the Youngeſt
Czar <hi>Peter</hi> the preſent Emperour, being reſolved
not to ſuffer themſelves any longer to be Impoſed
upon by this Favourite, found means to remove
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54715:246"/>
him from his Miniſtry, of which the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
relations appeared to be the Fatal Preſages.</p>
               <p>The firſt was undertaken by a private perſon,
who having watched his opportunity one morning
as <hi>GalliZin</hi> was going in his Sledge to the Czar's
Palace, threw himſelf upon him, and ſeized him
by the Beard to ſtab him. But whilſt he was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his dagger which (according to the <hi>Muſcovian</hi>
faſhion) ſtuck in his Girdle, the Princes Servants
running up to the Sledge, had the good fortune
to ſtop his hand, juſt as he was about ſticking the
Dagger in their Maſter's Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſaſſin was ſo far from being dejected, that
on the contrary his rage ſeemed to be encreaſed,
which ſufficinetly appeared by his furious looks, and
his utmoſt, tho' vain efforts, of putting his deſign
in Execution; But finding himſelf overpowered, and
all his endeavours in vain, he ſpoke to</hi> GallaZin
<hi>with unparrallell'd reſolution, in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi>
Infamous Tyrant, It is not the fear of death,
but the regret I feel of being diſappointed in my deſign,
that you ſee me thus changed in my Countenance; But
know, that tho' I have been ſo unfortunate as to fail
in this attempt, to deliver my Native Country from the
moſt horrid Monſter that ever was bred upon the face
of the Earth; tho' this hand has been unſucceſsful in
making thee a Sacrifice to the juſt reſentments of thy
fellow Subjects; Know, I ſay, that this feat is reſerved
for ſome happier hand than mine, and that among
three hundred Citizens, who, out of pity to the people,
that daily groan under the burthen of thy moſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
oppreſſions, have conſpired thy final deſtruction;
there will be ſome, that will take ſurer meaſures than
I have done.</p>
               <p>He was going on in his diſcourſe, if he had
not been dragged away immediately to Priſon,
where after having been put to the Rack, he was
executed privately, for fear of incenſing the
people.</p>
               <p>This Outrage was ſoon after followed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
leſs dangerous in its Contrivance, but ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54715:246"/>
convincing to <hi>GalliZin</hi> of the Sentiments the
people had of his Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>He was then juſt upon his departure for the
Army, which he was to Command, as General, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> when one night a covered
Coffin was found at his Pallace Gate, with a Note
in it, containing theſe Words: <hi>GalliZin, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs
the Campaign which thou art now going to open, prove
more ſucceſsful than the former, we are reſolved to make

               </p>
               <p>The worſt of all was, that theſe menaces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
true in the Event; for, after his return from
the Army, he was ſo cloſely preſs'd upon by the
reſt of the Boyars, that not being able to juſtifie
himſelf againſt the manifold miſcarriages laid to
his charge, he was diſmiſſed from all his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>Much about the ſame time Prince <hi>Archilla,</hi> King
of <hi>Iveria</hi> and <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> who had for ſome Years
laſt paſt lived with his Princeſs in the Court of the
two Czars, was preparing for his return into his
Kingdoms. This Prince being originally a <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
by Birth, had been prevailed upon to embrace
Mahometiſm, for the peaceable enjoyment of the
two Kingdoms of <hi>Iveria</hi> and <hi>Mengrelia,</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </p>

                     <hi>Prince</hi> Archilla.</note> who's Vaſſal he was, and
to purchaſe whoſe favour he had changed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
was very favorable to him at firſt; and tho'
he not long after return'd to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion,
which he profeſs'd before, did not uſe him with the
ſame ſeverity as he did the reſt of the Petty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that were his Vaſſals. But this ſeeming kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his, proceeded, (as it appear'd afterwards)
not ſo much from any inclinations he had for his
perſon, as the Beauty of his Princeſs. For having
received great recommendations of the excellency
of her Perſon, as he was inſatiable in his Luſt to
Women, ſo, tho' he never had ſeen her, he was
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54715:247"/>
reſolved to purchaſe the enjoyment of ſo much
Beauty at any rate; ſo that he made this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Prince ſufficiently ſenſible that he had no
longer any regard for his perſon; being now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no leſs troubleſome to him, than he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
kind before.</p>
               <p>His firſt endeavours were carried on by fair
means, by vaſt promiſes, and hopes of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but theſe proving inſufficient to obtain his
deſire, he proceeded from mildneſs to Threats,
but finding theſe alſo not to have the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
he had recourſe to open Violence; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his forces to advance into the Territories of
<hi>Archilla,</hi> to ſeize him and his Princeſs, and carry
them priſoners to his Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archilla,</hi> dreading the indignation of the Chan,
who's Forces he was not ſtrong enough to oppoſe,
was obliged to ſeek for ſafety in his flight, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Princeſs to the utmoſt confines of this
Kingdom of <hi>Iveria,</hi> which being the moſt diſtant
from <hi>Perſia,</hi> border upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories, on
that ſide towards the Black Sea; in, hopes to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves there againſt the forces of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But the Chan of <hi>Perſia</hi> reſolved not to quit his
pretenſion at that rate, found means to engage the
<hi>Turkiſh Grand Seignior</hi> in his Quarrel, who having
ſent ſome forces to ſeize the Prince, they ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and carried him to a Caſtle under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> on the borders of <hi>Iveria,</hi>
where he was detained Priſoner till further orders.</p>
               <p>They had ſhewn ſo much favour to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
whom they were unwilling to uſe with violence
that they had not detained her perſon; But ſhe
being exaſperated to the higheſt degree, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
committed upon her husband, retired ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into <hi>Iveria,</hi> where without any further delay,
having aſſembled ſome Gentlemen, the braveſt and
moſt truſty among her Subjects, ſhe, like another
<hi>Amazon,</hi> marched at the head of them to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:54715:247"/>
The Garriſon had got ſome intelligence of her
approach ſome hours before her arrival near the
place, wherefore having prepared themſelves for
a reſolute defence, the <hi>Iverians</hi> met with a ſtout
reſiſtance. But being encouraged by the preſence
and example of their Princeſs, who was reſolved
either to deliver her Husband, or to fall in the
attempt; they at laſt forced the Caſtle where their
Prince was kept Priſoner, in ſpite of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
the Soldiers could make, carried him off,
and ſet him at Liberty.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as they had time to reflect upon their
preſent condition, they were ſufficiently ſenſible that
an act ſo extraordinary, and ſo bold, muſt needs
draw upon them the indignation of both theſe Great
Princes, their Neighbours, and that conſequently they
could not tarry long with ſafety in their Kingdoms,
encompaſſed as it was, on all ſides, by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore they were forced to abandon
their Subjects to the mercy of theſe two Potent

               </p>
               <p>They were received with all the demonſtrations

                  </note> who aſſign'd them
a Palace in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and during the ſpace

their Quality, till their Subjects having compoſed
matters with the Grand Seignior, and become
weary of the <hi>Perſian</hi> yoak, ſollicited their return

to Sacrifice all what was dear to them for

               <p>The ſame Year the Youngeſt of the two Czars,<note place="margin">The preſent Czar mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>
(the ſame who lately honoured this Kingdom with

upon it as an effect of the Jealouſie of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
as being by this marriage excluded from the
hopes of that Alliance they had aſpired to, had let
their vengeance fall upon their young Prince.
But this accident not being attended with any
further ill Conſequences, theſe Rumors were
ſoon diſperſed, and the rejoycings continued to the
Great Satisfaction of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the chief hopes of their future proſperity in the
Activity and Courage of a Prince, who ſoon after
gave them ſuch evident proofs of his great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

After the Concluſion of this Alliance the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

and <hi>Perſian</hi> Silks, Stuffs, and Tiſſues of Gold, and
Silver; valued in all at 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. The
Ambaſſadors themſelves were moſt richly dreſs'd,
their Habits being of Cloth of Gold and Silver,
covered with rich Embroidery, and abundance of
Pearls and precious Stones. They paſſed thro' the
Electors Guards, which was placed on both ſides

               <p>The Ambaſſadors having made the uſual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,

his Czariſh Majeſty did not in the leaſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
but that the Elector would aſſiſt them in ſo

The Letter concluded with the thanks from
the Great Duke to his Electoral Highneſs, for the
Engineers and Bombardiers, which he had ſent
ſometime before, and which by their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Skill had been very inſtrumental in the Siege
of <hi>Aſoph,</hi> and other places, taken by the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>

                  <hi>The Elector anſwered;</hi> That he acknowledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
much obliged to the Czar, for his aſſurances of the

their Complements, in terms ſo obliging,
that the Ambaſſadors were extreamly ſatisfied with
his Generous and Genteel behaviour.</p>
               <p>Being afterwards reconducted to their Lodgings
in the ſame manner, they were Treated with a moſt
Splendid Dinner by his Electoral Highneſs, and
were the ſame Evening, Entertained with variety
of extraordinary Fireworks, which laſted, to their

on the 30th of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> having drawn together their

               <p>In order to which, they advanced under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Sultan <hi>Galga,</hi> and attacked them with their

utmoſt Vigor, but were received by the <hi>Muſcovian</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
with ſo much Reſolution, that they were repulſed
and droven back in great diſorder; but truſting in their
number they rallied again, and charged the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
with great Fury, till being, after ſome Hours
engagement quite broken, they were forced to quit
the Field, being purſued by the Enemy to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

a great part of their Army not being able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the reſt, with ſo much haſte as their preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
required, were either cut to pieces, or drowned
in the River, or taken Priſoners.</p>
               <p>This Victory was the more advantageous to the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> becauſe moſt of the <hi>Tartars</hi> having been
ſlain in the flight, the loſs was not conſiderable on
the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> ſide, for which reaſon great Rejoycings
were made in the City of <hi>Muſco,</hi> and all over the

               <p>In the mean while the Embaſſy was arrived in
<hi>Holland,</hi> where they received the firſt News of this

over which they ware their Smocks, and on them

at the Waſte: Some of them wear under theſe a
kind of narrow Waſtcoats, the Sleeves whereof
reach no further than the Elbow, being naked from

Years of Age, and it ſeldom appears that they ſtay

Die before the Conſummation of the Marriage; but
all the Ornaments are to be taken from her, and her
Hair to be cut of immediately after the Husband's
Death. Nevertheleſs they are not obliged to burn
themſelves with the Dead Bodies of their Husbands,
neither are they hindred to do it if they have an
inclination thereto. Thoſe Widows in <hi>India,</hi> who
cannot diſpenſe with a ſingle Life, get in among
the Dancers of that Sex, where they have ſufficient
opportunity to exerciſe the Fleſh, and to allay the

to procure their Husbands Deaths. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make them to be more careful of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Lives, it was ordered, that ſuch as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be accounted honeſt Women, ſhould be
engaged to keep their Husbands company in their
Journey to the other World, and be burnt together
with their Bodies. So that tho' this obligation of
dying with their Husbands was only impoſed upon
ſuch Women as ſtood upon the reputation of their
Honeſty, without any puniſhment to be inflicted
on ſuch as refuſed to conform themſelves to ſo
dreadful a Cuſtom, unleſs they were not admitted
into the Company of Perſons of Quality, as being
looked upon as Infamous; yet has this principle of
Honour been ſo prevailing upon a vaſt number of
the <hi>Indian</hi> Women, that there are innumerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
of ſuch as have ſacrificed their Lives upon
the Pile which burnt the dead Carcaſſes of their
Husbands.</p>
               <p>But as among all the Sects of the <hi>Indians,</hi> there
have been Women, who, with the ſame chearfulneſs
have thrown away their Lives to the memory of
their Husbands, as thoſe of the Sect of <hi>Samarath,</hi>
whoſe Perſwaſion is, that if a Woman hath ſo great
an Affection for her Husband; as to burn her ſelf
with him after his Death, ſhe ſhall live with him in
the other World ſeven times as long, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
him with ſeven times as much ſatisfaction as ſhe
has done in this; it is moſt probable, that they are
induced to this reſolution, not altogether by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of a Punctillo of Honour, but look on this
kind of Death as a Paſſage, thro' which they are
to enter into a beatitude of theſe Pleaſures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they had but a ſmall ſhare in this World.</p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Banyans,</hi> who having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſhare in the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> very

The <hi>Banyans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Religion of the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yans.</hi>
                  </note> therefore, are <hi>Pagans,</hi> uſing neither
Baptiſm nor Circumciſion; yet they believe that
there is but one God, Creator and Preſerver of the
Univerſe. Neither does this perſwaſion hinder it,
that they acknowledge one <hi>Braman,</hi> who they ſay,
is God's Vicegerent, (as they call the great God of
all the other Gods <hi>Etvara)</hi> and out of who's Brains,
they ſay, their <hi>Bramans,</hi> or Prieſts derive their firſt
Being. They are highly reſpected among the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Their</hi> Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens.</note>
as well as the other Pagans in <hi>India,</hi> not only
upon the account of their auſterity of Life, and
their extraordinary Abſtinence, they faſting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeveral Days together, ſcarce eating any
thing at all, but alſo in regard the Education
of the Youth is committed to their care, and that
they expound the myſteries of their Religion to the
ignorant People; ſo that making what impreſſion
they think moſt convenient for their purpoſe, on the
minds of the ſuperſtitious <hi>Indians,</hi> their Words are
conſidered as Oracles; from whence it comes, that
the <hi>Banyans</hi> ſeldom engage in any buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
unleſs with the Advice and Approbation
of the <hi>Braman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are diſtinguiſhed from the other <hi>Banyans,</hi>
only by what they wear upon their Heads, which
is a certain Head-dreſs made of Linnen Cloth,
wrapt ſeveral times round the Head, to cover their
Sacred Hair, which is never cut. Beſides which,
they wear three pieces of ſmall Packthread next
their Skin, which comes croſs over the Breaſt from
the Shoulder to the Waſt, which Packthreads they
never pull of, tho' it were to ſave their Lives.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Malataps,</hi> they are looked upon as ſo
Holy, that no Marriage is contracted there, but
the firſt Fruits of the Bride muſt be Conſecrated to
the <hi>Braman,</hi> to whom ſhe is brought to be deflour'd,
and being thus purified in her lower parts, the
Bridegroom may enter without danger. For the
cunning Prieſts have cajoled the poor ſimple People
into a belief, that the Marriage could never be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Bleſſed, unleſs the <hi>Braman</hi> has initiated the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54715:255"/>
Bride with a Sanctifying touch. From whence it
comes, that many times he muſt be very earneſtly
intreated, before he will undertake the Task; and
if the Perſons be of any Quality or good Subſtance,
he will ſcarce be engaged to take of the drudgery
from the Bridegroom's Hands, unleſs he be hire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Work, and have a good reward for his Pains.</p>
               <p>Thus the crafty Prieſt, by impoſing upon the
ſimplicity of his Flock, improves his natural Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to his utmoſt Advantage, ſatisfies at one ſtroak
both his Appetite and Purſe, and fells his Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
at an exceſſive price, which a Layman would
be glad to beſtow generouſly, for nothing. But
this is not all, for if the Prieſt once gets ſure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a good place, he is ſure not to part with it
at an eaſie rate, but remains a ſtanding Friend to the
Family; for the Married Men retain ſo much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ever after for their Copartners, that, if they
go any Journey, or upon any occaſion are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from Home, they recommend their whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
(but eſpecially their Wives) to the care of
the <hi>Braman,</hi> while they are abſent, to ſupply their
places with them, till they return, which you may
be ſure the Prieſt will perform to the utmoſt of his
Power, unleſs the good Woman happen to be very
old or ugly, or he be diſabled to do his Office
by his long faſting, in which caſe it is the
Womans buſineſs to cheriſh the Father's languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits, with powerful Reſtoratives, at which
the <hi>Indian</hi> Women are the moſt expert in the
whole World, as they are very skilful to ſend their
Husbands upon certain occaſions, to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the other World.</p>
               <p>But to return to the more ſerious part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
they hold the immortallity of the Soul, but
believe, withal, that at its departure out of the firſt
Body, it tranſmigrates into that of ſome other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus they affirm, that by example, the Soul
of a good natur'd and meek Perſon, is tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Body of a Pidgeon or Chicken; that of a
Cruel and Rapacious Fellow into a Crocodile, a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54715:255"/>
Lyon, or a Tyger; that of a Cunning and Crafty
Man, into that of a Fox, That of a Glutton into
the body of Swine; that of a Treacherous and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Perſon into a Serpent, before they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the enjoyment of Spiritual Beatitude. For
which reaſon it is the <hi>Banyans</hi> abſtain as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before, from killing any living Creatures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Inſects, be they never ſo troubleſome or
dangerous. Nay they Act with ſo much Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
in regard of all Living Creatures, of what
kind ſoever, that they forbear keeping any fire, and
lighting of Candles, in the Night time, out of fear,
that the Flies or Moths ſhould chance to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
therein; they ſcarce can be induced to make
any Pits in the ground, for fear of drowning the
Slegs and other Inſects.</p>
               <p>If the Mahometans among them do ſell any Birds,
they will be ſure to redeem them, if poſſibly they
can, and feed them well, becauſe, ſay they, we
don't know, how ſoon our ſelves may ſtand in need
of the ſame kindneſs; and they will Erect Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
for Beaſts that are Hurt or Wounded.</p>
               <p>They have a more then ordinary reſpect for
Cows, ſo that if they know of any one that is to
be killed for the Market, they will not only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
and redeem it at a high rate from the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but there is ſcarce a family, but what breeds
up one, almoſt as tenderly as their own Children;
For they will comb and feed it, and lodge it as
cleanly, and as carefully as if it were one of their
beſt Friends or Relations.</p>
               <p>They never eat but in private, and before they
touch the Victuals, they throw ſome ſmall quantity
of it ſeparately into the Fire, the Water, the Air,
and upon the Earth. They have abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pretended niceties, too many to be inſerted
here; but it ought not to be paſſed by in ſilence,
that tho' they acknowledge one Supream God,
they nevertheleſs worſhip the Devil, alledging for
a reaſon, that God having created him to govern
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54715:256"/>
the World,<note place="margin">They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Devil.</note> and to do hurt to Mankind, he ought
to be appeaſed by Prayers and Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>From whence it is, that his Statues of Gold,
Silver, Ivory, Ebony, Marble, Wood or Stone are
every where to be ſeen in their Moſques, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of which appears moſt dreadful to the eyes
of the Beholders. For his Head, out of which
come forth four Horns is adorn'd with a triple
Crown in the ſhape of a Taira. His Face reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that of a large Boar, with two great Teeth
coming out of his Mouth; and a great ugly.
Beard on his Chin. He bends his Breaſt to his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where the Hands hang down negligently. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
his Thighs there appears another Head with
two Horns upon it, as ugly as the firſt, thruſting out
of the Mouth, a Tongue of extraordinary bigneſs.
Inſtead of Teeth it hath Saws, and a Cows Tail
behind. This Figure ſtands always upon a Stone
Table, this being the Altar where the offerings are
to to be made. They have no other light in their
Moſque, than what they are furniſh'd withall by
the Lamps which are kept burning perpetually
near the Idol: And after the Prieſt has finiſhed
his Devotious, he purifies his Head, by putting
it into theſe Flames, as the other <hi>Banyans</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
themſelves before the Sacrifice, by waſhing in
a Trough, which always ſtands on the right ſide
of the Altar.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54715:257"/>

growing ſome Years, when the ſeaſon proves kind,
Six or Seven foot high, with a flower like that that
of a Thiſtle, and the ſeed altogether like Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek.
It is ſeldom ſown till in <hi>June,</hi> and is ready
to be cut towards towards the latter end of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
or the beginning of <hi>December.</hi> They Sow it
but once in three Years, but the firſt year produces
the beſt, when the leaves are cut off within a foot
of the ground. The Stalks are thrown away as 
uſeleſs, and the leaves laid a drying in the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which done they are put a put a ſoaking for four
or five days in a Stone Trough, the Water with
the leaves is often ſtirred, till ſuch time that the
Water has ſufficiently extracted the whole tincture
of the Herb. Then the Water is ſmoothly drawn
off into another Stone Trough, in order to let it
ſettle for one night. The next day, all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is again drawn off to the ſettlement, and what,
is thus left in the bottom of the Troughs, is ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through a courſe Cloth, and ſo ſet a drying in
the Sun.</p>
               <p>And this is true Indigo, which however the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yans</hi>
frequently adulterate; by mixing with it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Earth of the ſame Colour. And becauſe the
excellency of this Commodity is judged by its light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they have cunning enough to add to it ſome
oyl, to make it ſwim upon the Water. The ſecond
year, the Stalk which was left in the ground the
year before, ſhoots forth other leaves, but they are
not comparable to thoſe of the firſt, tho' they much
exceed the Wild Indigo. Wherefore they reſerve
the greateſt part of the ſecond Years product for
Seed. That of the third Year, is as much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rsour
in goodneſs to that of the ſecond, as that is
in compariſon of that of the firſt, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
