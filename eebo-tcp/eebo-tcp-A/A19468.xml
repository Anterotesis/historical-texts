            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yet ſhould we not deſpaire of life. The true Phiſition of our ſoules came downe from heauen, &amp; through his paſsion hath he made vs a plaiſter for our wounds, onely let vs vſe it and lay it to the ſore. The faithfull Samaritane poureth oile and wine into our wounds, taketh vs vp to cure and to heale vs, onely let vs follow him, &amp; faſhion our ſelues after his image. He is the braſen ſerpent without ſinne, whome with the eyes of faith we must behold hanging, and lift vp vpon the croſſe for vs, hee taking our ſinnes vppon himſelfe, giueth vs his owne innocencie.</p>
            <p>If the burthen of ſinne now oppreſſeth and grieueth vs, we ought to runne vnto him, he ſhall eaſe vs &amp; giue vs reſt, for his bloud waſheth awaie our ſinnes, him hath the father giuen vnto vs to be our righteouſneſſe and redemption.</p>
            <p>Beſides this great treaſure that God hath giuen vs in Chriſt, he is ſet foorth vnto vs, eſpecially in his paſsion, for a patterne or example, whereby we may learne to die from ſin, and finde a preſeruatiue against vices to come. For ſelfeloue and high eſteeming of a mans owne ſelfe is the wel-ſpring of all vice, Conſider that Chriſt was not proude himſelfe of his owne highneſſe, but tooke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, &amp; come to ſerue vs, humbled him most lowly, loued not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſought not his owne, deſired not his honor, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his father: all deſpite and reproch fell vpon him. If we ponder this by ſaith, all greedy loue of our ſelues ſhall fall away.</p>
            <p>The obedience of Ieſu in true beleefe conſidered, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and healeth our diſobedience, and the idolairie of our owne carnall heart. With his obedience couereth he the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of all men, ſo farre as we abide in the obedience of faith, that Chriſt be dearer vnto vs than the whole world, for the which cauſe we freely giue ouer our ſelues into his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:4"/>
ſuffering all things for his ſake. Pride and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie is healed through Chriſts humilitie and contempt, which he ſuffered for vs manifolde. Learne of me (ſaith he) for I am meeke and lowly of heart. Why are wee ſo greadie of temporal things, when Chriſt the Lord of heauen and earth became for vs ſo poore, hanging bare and naked vppon the croſſe? The chaſt pure life of Ieſus Chriſt expelleth in vs all vncleanneſſe of the fleſh. Alſo his martirdome, anguiſh and trouble which in his fleſh hee ſuffered for vs, quencheth the luſt and concupiſcence of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>O how euill doth it become a beleeuer, to be irefull and greedie of vengeance, when his fore-runner, beeing in moſt humilitie like vnto a ſheepe, praied for his enemies?</p>
            <p>Enuie and hatred is highly expelled, if we conſider the excellent deepe loue of Ieſu towards vs. Gluttonie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of life ſhall fall awaie from vs, if we well remember that Chriſt for vs dranke vineger mixt with gall.</p>
            <p>As it is here ſhewed in certaine points, euen ſo againſt all vices and blemiſhes of the ſoule, there may remedie be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſound in the paſsion of Chriſt, if it bee rightly vſed in the contemplation of faith. The old Adam ought we to lay aſide, to mortifie the members vppon earth, and to put on Chriſt the Lord, as the new wedding garment. In the croſſe ought to be our exerciſe, our ioy, comfort, and life.</p>
            <p>Herevnto alſo helpeth vs our heauenly father, who vnto vs his children (whom he most entirely loueth) ſuffreth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold paſsions, afflictions, troubles, and anguiſhes, ſickneſſe, pouertie, and perſecution to come: to keepe vs vppon the croſſe, leaſt we as negligent people gape for temporall earthie things. And if we will needs follow our owne lusts, he hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our waie with thornes, nourturing and humbling vs through trouble, that we being tried and purified as the gold
<pb facs="tcp:22982:4"/>
in the fire, may crie and call vnto him, and that we may giue our earthly things, ſeeing we finde no quietneſſe in them. He bringeth vs into the land of promiſe, howbeit through the wilderneſſe, through much trauell and labour. Bleſſed are they that in patience without murmuring, ſuffer the Lorde to worke, and doo faithfully follow him.</p>
            <p>All this, and more than I can ſaie, ought to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and exerciſe, when we celebrate the ſupper of the Lord Ieſu, that wee ſo ſprinkle the bloud of Chriſt in our heartes, and drinke it into vs, that it may worke in vs, and bring forth fruit. Our eies and hearts we ought to lift vp in to heauen, and conſider what the bread and wine pointeth vs vnto, namely, vnto the bodie of Chriſt, that was offered vp vpon the croſſe for our ſinnes, and to his bloud, that was ſhed for the waſhing awaie of our offences: and that we faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelues vnto his image, and practiſe alſo ſuch loue one towardes another. This is the proofe that Paul ſpeaketh of, with the which a faithfull beleeuer ought to exerciſe himſelf before, and in the Lords ſupper examining well his faith and loue, which out of the loue of God towards vs, is kindled and increaſed. Firſt ought a man to conſider the excellent loue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſo loued vs, that he died for vs. And ſeeing that he biddeth vs to ſo high a feaſt of his grace we ought alſo to ponder the ſame, in ſuch ſorte, that wee bee thankfull vnto him, and prepare our ſelues thereafter.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul ſaith, that there is a feeding with milke, and a feeding with ſtrong meate, which is to bee obſerued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature and propertie of thoſe that receiue the meate. And in the Church of God there be three ſortes of men, as the ſame, by the high illuminated goodwiſe teacher Auguſtine, and by others is written.</p>

time paſt, in paſtime and wantonneſſe of the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the carefull end thereof, (as they be inwardly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the grace of God) haue vndertaken to ceaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from ſinne, and from all occaſions of ſinne, &amp; in moſt diligent wiſe, as neere as they can, with the aſſiſtance, grace and helpe of God, to be circumſpect and warie thereof: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they are yet weake, and haue not ſo ſtrong a ſpirite, as to laie aſide and deſpiſe all worldly things out of hand. And theſe are the right true beginners of repentant and penitent perſons: though they be not new beginners, yet are they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Lord ſo deare, that all things cannot ſufficiently commend and praiſe it.</p>
            <p>This is witneſſed vnto vs by the holy Goſpell, of the vnthriftie ſonne: who when with ſhamefull riot hee had wantonly conſumed his inheritance, did in time of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hunger, conuert and turne againe to his louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and receiued not onely gracious forgiueneſſe of his treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, but alſo ſpeciall tokens of his fathers loue: as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the kiſſe, the fat calfe, the ſweete minſtrelſie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie. This is the firſt anker of true repentance. This is the firſt ſtate concerning the bleſſed ſwineheard, who forſaking the hogges wiih the coddes, (draffe or ſwillinges) that hee ſometimes greedily filled his belly withall, and returning to his louing father, is now in his firſt comming againe to his mercifull father, graciouſly taken vp, receiued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>Who ſo now with this vnthriftie ſonne forſaketh his ſinnes, and comming agayne in true and heartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto God his moſt louing and gracious Father, ſaith meekely: O Father, I am not worthie to bee called thy ſonne, for I haue ſinned againſt heauen and before thee, O make nice one of thy hired ſeruants. To him ſhall the father
<pb facs="tcp:22982:5"/>
denie nothing. Who ſo nowe with an vnfained heart and mouth may ſpeake this vnto God, and truely and vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeketh Ieſus, aſſuredly hee findeth him, and hath with him a cheerefull ſupper. Looke vnto whom God in his great mercie giueth ſuch a taſt of his geace, let him render thanks and praiſe vnto almightie GOD, let him nowe looke for it, that the Father who hath receiued him, will alſo nourture him in his owne ſchoole, and through manifolde aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties furniſh him, prepare him, and make him more perfect. Hee hath beene fedde with the milke, hee muſt learne alſo to knowe, what harde meate meaneth. Through aduerſitie and trouble, ſome chaunces, hee muſt bee tempted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whether hee haue ought in him of the bleſſed ſeede that groweth vpwardes vnto eternall life. Which thing ſhall well appeare and bee made manifeſt, if in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and troubles, hee bee not choaked with the thornes, nor troden downe by the high waie ſide, nor withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſtones, but founde fruitfull in a good and fertill ground.</p>
            <p>Other men there bee, which are called reformers, to whome belongeth ſomewhat more than there doth vnto the other. For like as it appertaineth to the firſt repentant or prnitent perſons, that they continually and feruently, with the confeſſion of their ſinnes vnto God, with ſorrowe and lamentation, with praier, watching, and chaſtiſing of the the bodie, doo breake out a waie from theyr olde ſinnes, harneſſing and arming themſelues agaynſt others for to come, and earneſtly withſtanding and forſaking their owne euill and naughtie cuſtomes, (if they minde to bring foorth fruite, and not to fall awaie againe:) Euen ſo the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the ſeconde order and manner, after the harde
<pb facs="tcp:22982:6"/>
rooting out of vice and wickedneſſe, muſt ſtill exerciſe them ſelues in the will of God and in good works, ſeeking diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience thereof in holy Scripture, and of thoſe teachers who by reaſon of long practiſe, and by the Scriptures, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and teach the ſame waie. When theſe men in ſuch a ſtedfaſt purpoſe to walke and practiſe themſelues in the will of God with his grace and power, doe goe vnto the ſupper of the Lord, they inwardly with ioy and fruit of the godly feaſt are nouriſhed and refreſhed. For who ſo deſireth to cleaue vnto vertue and to a godly life, ſhall no where find the ſame ſo euidently and plaine, as in Chriſts paſsion, whereof hee is mindfull at the ſupper with faith and thankeſgiuing.</p>
            <p>The third ſort of men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lled perfect: not that anie man here in time may be perfect, as to lacke nothing, or to haue no ſinne in him, but therefore are they named perfect, becauſe theyr exerciſe is ſuch, that after long accuſtomate doing of vertuous deeds, after many ſpiritual fruits brought forth by them in patience, after many temptations, which they with the help of God haue ouercome. They haue ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled and caſt downe themſelues before God, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with him, that they are become one ſpirite with Chriſt their head, whom they cleaue vnto, whoſe croſſe and holy paſsion they follow without fainting, ſo farre as theyr wit and power may ſuffer, being dead from the world &amp; the fleſh, following onely the Lord Ieſu Chriſt, ſuffering with him, and liuing with him.

like not. For the deuill keepeth no holy daie, he ſleepeth not, runneth about as a roaring lion: he ceaſeth not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe men continually get them to their weapons, with the conſideration of the paſsion of Chriſt. Abraham the good friend of God, muſt ſtil driue awaie the rauenous birds from the ſacrifice, till the Sunne goe downe, and till a man cheerefully ſaie, In peace will I laie me downe and take my reſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This probation muſt be well taken heed vnto, for many men not iuſtly conſidering themſelues, neither right diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this meate from others, receiue the foode of life vnto death. Not that this holy bread was inſtituted and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chriſt, to hurt any man, but becauſe the euil man doth wickedly receiue that which is wholſome, &amp; abuſeth it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough vnbeleefe. Therefore iuſtly doeth Paul exhort, that there be firſt had a diligent examination of a mans ſelfe, &amp; that then he eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. Thus let euerie man take good heed to his owne ſtate and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this banket may ſet him forward, not vnto his hurt but to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Who ſo taketh not heed vnto this difference, &amp; to him ſelfe, as (alas) carnall people do, which are not ſpiritually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. The ſame faileth oft in many things, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to flie high, yea, higher than his knowledge &amp; power may attaine. Hereof then it alſo proceedeth (as we ſee before our eyes) that ſo fewe folkes come to ſteadfaſt amendement, namely, euen hereof, that when men are not exerciſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning of Gods matters from others, a mad headie motion of ſenſualtie prouoketh them inordinatly to ſitte higheſt at the table, wheras yet they are not worthie of the loweſt place, and ſo will they forthwith poſſeſſe the ſeate roiall, afore they haue found the aſſes, or kept the ſheepe, as of Dauid &amp; Saul

in figure it is read. But thus ought it not to bee: for though the grace of the holy Ghoſt vſe not long fetches about, yet commeth no man ſodainly to the happieſt ſtep. I ſpeake after the common courſe, as it beſeemeth vs to talke and do in the Church of God, namely, after the ordinance which he hath appointed vs.</p>
            <p>Behold Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being ſo perfect in the law, that the world could not accuſe him, being alſo chaſt, earneſt, feruent and well exerciſed in all vertues, whom God that had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated him from his mothers wombe, would cal to his ſeruice. Though he was taken vp into the third heauen, and ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets that no man can expreſſe, yet doth not he truſt ſo much thereto, as (by reaſon of that great grace) to magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to take vpon him the office of preaching, before he being taught at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet, and baptiſed and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Ananias,</hi> had perceiued in himſelfe, and proued, that ſame which he afterwards out of the perfectnes of the ſpirit, might distribute abrode vnto al Chriſtendome. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture laughed to ſcorne of the vnexpert, proud, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe: but who ſo hath eares circumciſed with the feare of God, will thinke more vpon the matter.</p>
            <p>He that will ſit now at the table of the high king let him diligently conſider what hee receiueth in his ſoule through faith, namely, the body end bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and nouriſheth him to eternall life, and draweth him to God, altereth him, and maketh him ſteadfaſt, which the outward bread taken with the moueh, doth point and leade vnto: yea, let vs ponder, how great loue, and what an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Chriſt ther ſetteth before him, that he alſo muſt prepare the like: that is, that he to his power muſt follow the loue, life and paſsion of Chriſt, to the intent, that hee being wounded with Chriſts loue, &amp; faſtned with him vpon the croſſe, may
<pb facs="tcp:22982:7"/>
abide in him vnto the end.</p>
            <p>For in the paſsion of Chriſt, is the inſtrustion of the way which we ought and muſt follow vnto eternall life. There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is information where and how the ſame waie and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting truth is ſhewed &amp; found.

Then ſayd Ieſus to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Know ye, that after two daies ſhall be Eaſter, and the ſonne of man ſhal be betraied and crucified. At the ſame time were the chiefe prieſts and councell gathered together in the pallace of the high Prieſt, whoſe name was Caiphas, and there they counſelled, how they might craftily apprehend take, and kill him. Howbeit they feared the people. Therfore ſayd they together, Not on the holie daie, leaſt there bee an vproare among the people. But Satan was entered into Iudas (called Iſcarioth) one of the twelue, who went out to the high Prieſts &amp; rulers, intending to deliuer him vnto them: therefore how he would deliuer Ieſus vnto them, he told them and ſayd: What will you giue me and I will deliuer him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.

               <p>On the firſt day of ſweet bread, when they offer paſſah, the Diſciples came to Ieſu and ſaid: where wilt thou that we go and prepare Paſſah for thee? Then ſent he two of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: namely, Peter and Iohn, ſaying: Goe and prepare for vs, that we may eat Paſſah. They ſaid: where? then ſaid he: Goe into the citie to one, beholde when yee enter in, one ſhall meet you bearing a pitcher with water, follow him into the houſe that he entreth into, and ſay vnto the houſholder: The maiſter ſaith vnto thee, my time is now heere, that I will eat Paſſah with thee: Where is now the place where the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhall be kept? Where is the Parlour that I ſhall eat Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſah in with my Diſciples? then ſhall hee ſhewe you a great Parlour that is paued, there make ye ready.</p>
               <p>So the Diſciples went and found as the Lord had tolde them, and they made readie the Paſſah. At euen came Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus with the twelue, and when it was time he ſate him down at the table and the twelue with him.</p>

                  <p>GOod vertuous children ſhould harken moſt diligently vnto the wordes of their father, and faſten them in their hartes: but ſpecially thoſe wordes which hee ſpeaketh and committeth vnto them, now when hee mindeth by death to departe from them, and to take his leaue of them. For the ſame wordes (beeing the laſt) pierce verie deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, and are neuer forgotten. Seeing then, that we are Gods children, and Chriſt heere nameth vs ſo to be, with his Diſciples: wee ought verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ponder and conſider all his words and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but ſpecially ſuch as hee vttered vnto them, when hee now would goe to his paſſion. For there ſhal we find an ardent, earneſt, and feruent doctrine, full of moſt excellent, godlie, and ineſtimable loue,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:13"/>
proponed and thruſt into their heartes, with wordes ſweeter than honie. In this Oration bringeth hee foorth ſpecially that ſame, which moſt of all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Diſciples. Firſt the eternal wiſedome decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that hee is ignorant of nothing, that vnto him there is nothing hid. Hee knoweth what ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them through weakeneſſe of the fleſh, and feare of men: albeit our feeblenes and imbecillitie doth alwaies breake foorth, preſume, and brag more, than wee euer are able to performe, as wee haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Peter.</hi> Such headie raſhneſſe the Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh, admoniſhing vs of our owne weakeneſſe, and fall.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, wee ought to conſider in Chriſt our head and fore-runner, how earneſtly, and louingly, he mentioneth and warneth the traytour, ſetting his great offence before his eyes, and alwaies touching him, to remoue him from his wicked purpoſe. Yet maketh hee mention of him, and of the vice, in ſuch ſort, that hee neuer deſireth his hurt, but onely his conuerſion and amendment. His deſire is, that hee were reformed, not that hee ſhould be bewrayed, or that any harme ſhould happen vnto him by him or others. Such lenitie and gentlenes ought wee alſo to ſhewe and declare vnto our enemies, and thoſe that hurt vs: if it only concerne vs, we ſhould not be deſirous of vengeaunce. And though wee all ought ſore to mourne in the Church, that is to ſaye, in the Chriſtian congregation, if there be tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and naughty people, applying our diligence the beſt we can, that ſuch bee not therein: yet whereas
<pb facs="tcp:22982:14"/>
their vices be ſecret, and as yet not opened, we ought in loue and patience to beare and ſuffer them vntill the harueſt, when the Lorde ſhall purge and cleanſe his ſtoore. Beſides this, wee ought not to ceaſe with warning and aduertiſement, with correction &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they may leaue off from their obſtinate wickednes.</p>
                  <p>And when the congregation of God through his grace is quite of ſuch euill people, and diſcharged of ſuch wicked blemiſhes, God muſt bee thanked, and diligence applyed, that no wicked thing breede therein againe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Loue.</note>But aboue all things muſt we regard that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and new commaundement which Chriſt giueth vs; namely, vpon the loue, that he after a new ſorte hath declared and performed: by the which loue he reneweth thoſe that are his, and plentifully indueth them through the holy Ghoſt, whome hee giueth in their hartes. Loue comprehendeth and fulfilleth all lawes: therefore Chriſt leaueth all other commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and admoniſheth vs onely of loue.</p>
                  <p>Loue hath he himſelfe ſhewed vs afore-hand: of him muſt we learne to loue. Loue is the aſſured and vnfailing euidence of the children of God. Who ſo hath not it, though he had all other vertues, yet hath he nothing, neither is it profitable to him that hee hath. If he haue loue, then hath he all thinges that are neceſſary for his health &amp; ſaluation. Therfore ought we to regard nothing ſo much as loue.

How can wee then doubt of his loue and faithfulneſſe? How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in all our trouble and heauineſſe, we ſhould not vnto him onely haue recourſe, ſeeking helpe and comfort at his hand? The ſonne for our ſake, came forth from the father, humbled and made himſelfe of no reputation, tooke all reproch, ſhame and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vppon himſelfe for our welfare.

honor and glorie, which he had from euerlaſting, &amp; giuing vs therein a hope and ſure comfort, that wee alſo ſhal with him haue euerlaſting ioy and glory for euer.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that he came out from the father, we ought to hearken vnto him, and not to deſpiſe his word: he is the eternall wiſedome of God, he is the truth, no falſe teacher can he bee, foraſmuch as hee commeth from God, and is his onely begotten ſon.<note place="margin">Heb. 1</note> To contemne ſo deare an embaſſadour and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, muſt needs haue great puniſhment, and though we are not able, in moſt perfection to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his doctrine, truth, and loue (for heere in this time is our knowledge vnperfect) yet ſhuld we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the father loueth vs,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Some firſt fruits and beginnings of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge haue we receiued alreadie. God hath caſt and planted a litle ſeed of knowledge in our harts, which through his grace and moiſture, ſhall daily grow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and proſper.

nor yet aſcribe too much vnto our own ſtrength He that ſtandeth, let him looke that he fall not. We think many times that we are verie ſtrong in faith, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie ſheweth how feeble we bee, and how ſoone we ſhrinke. Therefore in all trouble and diſtreſſe of this world, we ought to comfort our ſelues, and truſt onely in the grace and ſtrength of Chriſt. In him ſhal we finde peace and quietneſſe, in him ſhall we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all our enemies: for his ouercomming is our victorie, his power is our ſtrength. The world is not able to hurt and plague vs, more than of our gracious father is permitted vnto them for our wealth.</p>
                  <p>While we liue here, we are in miſerie, affliction, &amp; diſtreſſe: but ſeeing the head hath ouercome, the members ought not to doubt of the victorie. Let vs with ſtedfaſt beleefe looke vnto Chriſt the fountaine of life, our foregoer, and finiſher of our faith, &amp; let vs ſtoutly ſtep forth after him: let vs go the waie that he is gone, and hath troden, &amp; made before. Afflictions ſhall ſerue vs vnto high honor, as they ſerued Chriſt the Lord vnto glorie. In Chriſt we finde the peace &amp; reſt of our conſciences and ſoules: in him we knowe and find the goodnes &amp; loue of God the father: out of him receiue we power, ſtrength, comfort, &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: only let vs loke that we turne not the eies of our heart, &amp; faith, away from him. Our welfare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſtedfaſt beleefe and loue of Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God. Though we many times ſtumble, fall, and be proued by ſundry temptations and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet is the ſame good and profitable for vs, that we may the better learn to know our own weaknes,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:34"/>
and againe, the ſtrength and grace of God. If it were not profitable for vs, Chriſt had not ſuffered his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to fall ſo greeuouſly. But in all diſtreſſe, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his hand vnder vs, and in aduerſitie he leaueth vs not alone, as hee alſo left not his owne Sonne alone.

As thou ſenteſt mee into the world, ſo haue I ſent them into the worlde, and for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelfe, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth. I pray not for them alone, but for thoſe alſo which ſhall beleeue on

                  <p>THIS praier of our high Prieſt and mediatour Chriſt Ieſus, is feruent, earneſt, full of the fire of godly loue, ful of great ſecrets and ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Herein may we learne to know, what hie honor, dignitie, and power, Chriſt by his obedience and patience, hath obtained with his father: wherein conſiſteth our peace, ioy, &amp; welfare. What care and loue Chriſt beareth towardes thoſe that are his, and how he committeth them vnto his father. Firſt, hee praieth for his Diſciples, whome hee did chooſe to publiſh his truth: afterward praieth he for all ſuch as ſhould come to the faith by their preaching vntil the worldes end. And for aſmuch as the Diſciples had a great waightie matter in hand, full of danger and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, for they muſt needs procure to themſelues great hatred of the world, hee firſt praieth for them, that the Father will ſtrengthen, comfort, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them thorow his power, &amp; defend them from all euill.</p>
                  <p>In this are we taught diligently, chiefly, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:22982:37"/>
to pray for thoſe vnto whome is committed the preaching of the Goſpell:<note place="margin">How the Miniſters of the word ſhould be praied for.</note> for a chargeable and great worke carry they vppon their ſhoulders, by meanes whereof (among all others) they haue ſpeciall neede of the grace, helpe, &amp; aſſiſtance of God. But our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought we to frame, as Chriſt hath framed his. Firſt we muſt in our praier to God, make ſpeciall mention of his owne grace and mercie, whereby hee chuſing them to ſuch an office, hath giuen them vnto Chriſt his ſonne. Foraſmuch then as they are the Miniſters of him and of his Sonne, and ſeeing the Sonne is ſo deare, worthie &amp; beloued vnto the Father, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt bee, that hee for his Sonnes ſake will defende and preſerue them, as in him, and by him they are worthie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſidering that for his ſake and his word, which they declare, they are perſecuted of the worlde, it is requiſite that God preſerue them in his owne worke. For great need haue they of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protection, while they yet liue in the weake feeble fleſh, and are mortall men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their office ſerueth to many mens health and welfare, their office is neceſſary and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the whole world, which walketh in blindneſſe and darknes: for they are the light of the world,<note place="margin">Math 5.</note> that thorough doctrine and liuing, muſt ſhine to manie mens life: which without the aſſiſtance and helpe of God cannot come paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus ought wee to praye for the miniſters of the word, &amp; to deſire, that God throgh his holy name, &amp; power, will defend, ſtrength, comfort, and preſerue
<pb facs="tcp:22982:38"/>
them in all aduerſitie: but principally that hee will giue them grace to bee one, coupled together in the band of peace, loue and vniformitie: that they may be of one ſpirite, and of one mind: that in one ſpirite they may further and plant the honour of God:<note place="margin">Ephe 4. Phil. 2.</note> that like as Chriſt neither ſpake nor did anie thing but that which was acceptable and wel pleaſing vnto the father, they alſo in their ſayinges and dooinges may haue reſpect vnto Gods glorie: and that they being rooted and fortified in loue,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> bee not vanquiſhed nor ouercome of the pleaſures or threateninges of this world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that in all their labour and trauaile, in al aduerſitie and perſecutions, hee will put into theyr hartes, his owne comfort and ſpirituall ioy. For the worlde hath manifolde mirthes, paſtimes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: much bragging and wilfulneſſe vſeth it in the riches and fleſhly voluptuouſnes thereof.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> But the true Miniſters of Chriſt (ſeeing hee hath ſeuered them from the worlde) muſt and ought to refraine and abſent themſelues from all worldly ioy and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſnes: yea, it is they, that ought to diſwade the worlde from ſuch wantonneſſe and vanitie: by meanes of whoſe faithfull admonition, there fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much hatred and trouble vpon them: Neither were it to the furtheraunce of Gods honour and our commoditie, to haue them vtterlye taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of this worlde. Therefore dooth Chriſt deſire (and ſo muſt wee with him) that from euill, namely from the Deuill the Prince of this worlde, who ſtirreth the world againſt them, they may of the
<pb facs="tcp:22982:38"/>
father in the world be defended and kept.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he will ſanctifie and cleanſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other men, that they may be holy and pure veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the houſe and temple, that is, in the Church of God, for they are means &amp; inſtruments, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God miniſtereth his grace and truth vnto men, therfore is it alſo conuenient, that they be pure and holy.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> This commeth throgh the truth that God putteth in their mouth and heart by the holy Ghoſt, which inwardly purifieth them. But then are they holy when they teach truth, and liue godly. Into the worlde hath Chriſt ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the father ſent him into the world. The father ſent Chriſt into the world, that he ſhould deſtroy the kingdome of the deuill and of the world, that he ſhould declare vnto the world, the grace and mercie of God towardes mankinde, that he ſhoulde bring men from ſinne, and from falſe idolatriſh faith, to the true liuing God, and to a vertuous conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he with the light of truth, ſhould ſhine vpon thoſe which ſate in darknes: that he ſhould bring the knowledge of God into the world, &amp; exhort men to the amendement of life. Euen this hath Chriſt giuen in commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and to all miniſters of the worde to doo. This is their office, this is their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, vnto this haue they greate neede of the grace, power, and aſſiſtance of God, therefore ought we moſt earneſtly to praie for them, for if they fail or fal, it hurteth the whole Church: yea, out of the ſame there groweth ſlaunder vnto the name of God in the ſight of the vnbeleeuers, and an occaſion of falling,<note place="margin">Ezech. 36</note> to ſuch as are weake of faith. Therefore Chriſt alſo
<pb facs="tcp:22982:39"/>
offered himſelfe to the father for them, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that they might bee pure and holy: not in outward apparance, but from the heart, and in the truth, that through their vniformity &amp; loue, through the word of truth, which they preach, through the holynes of their doctrine and liuing, all men and the whole world might know and vnderſtand, that God hath ſent them, yea, that God ſent his ſon Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, vnto whome they with mouth and life beare record, and who alſo euery where ſhineth out of them with wordes and deeds.</p>
                  <p>Not onely for them hath Chriſt praied, but alſo for vs, as many as hearken and beleeue the worde of truth preached by them. Wherein firſt wee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and ſee, the loue, faithfulnes, and great care of Chriſt for vs, how earneſtly the truſtie ſhepheard of our ſoules, committeth his poore ſheepe into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers protection, how faithfully our mediatour and aduocate praieth for vs, whereby alſo he ſetteth forth a doctrine vnto vs, how and what we ſhal pray of the heauenly father.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that he will make vs one by his holy ſpirite, in the truth, in the vnitie of faith, and in loue vnſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,<note place="margin">Phil 2.

Therefore Chriſt (who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs better than we our ſelues) willing to expell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all pride and preſumptuouſnes, teacheth vs to bee lowly minded and humble, to bee euer watching, &amp; with continual praier to cleaue only vnto him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we are able to do nothing, and in whome we may do all things and euen ſo doth he alſo in his feeblenes, which aſſaulted him as a very true man: to the intent, that wee alway remembring our owne weaknes, might vnderſtand how to tame the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleſh, &amp; in no caſe to truſt it: and that wee might bee carefull and vigilaunt, leaſt the ſubtill enemie in temptations, come behind vs, fall vppon vs, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vs. It is no time to ſleepe, the battaile is yet a fighting, the enemie is yet aliue, and as yet beſeegeth

hee our caſtle that Chriſt hath in keeping. All is full of ſnares and dangers, which no man is able to eſcape ſaue onely hee, which in feruent beleefe and prayer doth earneſtly watch and ſtoutly fight, yea, and that continually vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>Neither the preſent anguiſh and trouble, nor yet Chriſtes exhortation can bring ſo much to paſſe in the Diſciples, as to keepe them from ſleepe: ſo little it helpeth, where the ſpirite giueth not life. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe Chriſtes talke and admonition vnto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is not vtterly vnprofitable, for that they nowe vnderſtand not, the ſame afterwardes (when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite commeth) is made playne and euident vnto them, and then are they feruent and earneſt in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer. Wherefore wee ſhould neuer ceaſe from comforting and exhorting the feeble and weake: for though it helpe not at this preſent, the houre ſhall come, that the ſpirite will make it to haue life, and to be fruitfull in them.</p>

                  <p>IN the perfect example and mirrour of our life Chriſt Ieſus, we find an earneſt feruent loue, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine how wee ought to behaue our ſelues in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie. Firſt, wee ſee that Chriſt of an exceeding great loue, taketh vpon himſelf al infirmities of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and becommeth like vnto his brethren in all thinges, ſinne except: beeing a very true man, hee is therfore not aſhamed before his diſciples to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his infirmitie, ſorrow, heauines and feare, and to complaine thereof vnto his father. A feare by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the death and paſſion, hee receiueth as a verie man: for not to feele trouble, is not the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and paſſion is no paſſion, if it ſmart not, if it bee not felt, Chriſt therefore both in his mind and body fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the paſſion, hee feeleth the conflict of death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in wraſtling withall, he ouerthroweth it. Oh the exceeding feruent loue of our head and foregoer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who for our helth, commeth into ſo great an agonie and trouble, that aboue naturall moyſture, through the fearefull conflict of the paſſion &amp; death,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:44"/>
he ſheddeth his bloud and ſweateth it: but with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deſire runneth he to his heauenly father: to him complaineth he of his weaknes and diſtreſſe: to him giueth he ouer himſelfe in al obedience and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mind: of him alſo receiueth he comfort and ſtrength. In the meane ſeaſon, he forgetteth not his Diſciples, but commeth to them, exhorteth them to watch and pray, &amp; hath great compaſsion with their feeblenes and ſlouth.</p>
                  <p>If we now be the diſciples and ſchollers of Chriſt Ieſu, and haue ſurrendered our ſelues vppe into the ſchoole of the heauenly Schoolmaiſter, we ought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to looke, what Chriſt here in him ſelfe, doth teach and preſcribe vnto vs: that wee learning the ſame of him, and following his foot-ſteppes (when temptations of ſinne, and conflicts of aduerſitie, tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and death fall in vpon vs) may know how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and frame our ſelues therein.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that wee know our ſelues to be poore, full of faultes; mortall men and ſinners hauing nothing of our owne but feeblenes. So when the temptation of ſinne and of the fleſh aſſault vs, we muſt not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to open ſuch our faults and conflicts vnto God our heauenly Father, and to complaine vnto him of them. God hath not made vs to bee vtterly without temptation, but hath ſuffered the ſame to remaine in the fleſh, that we therby might be exerciſed &amp; prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſeeke helpe at him, and to learne, in how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a caſe we ſhould be, if he withdrew his hande from vs When we now feele that the ſpirit is willing and the fleſh weake,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. Gal. 5.</note> and that the law of the members
<pb facs="tcp:22982:45"/>
withſtandeth the law of God in vs, that the fleſh figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſtriueth againſt the ſpirit: we muſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to confeſſe our feeblenes before our heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father (yea though of weakenes wee had lyen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the battaile already) deſiring his helpe, that we may riſe againe, and valiauntly to fight it out. Thus muſt wee alſo doe, when the croſſe and hatred of the world for Chriſtes ſake (or that is contrary to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) falleth vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>The cuppe which the father hath filled in, that we ſhoulde drinke it, the ſame ought wee willingly to drinke: and if there growe in our fleſh a terrour and feare to taſt it, we muſt not be aſhamed to complaine thereof vnto our Father, foraſmuch as we ſee heere, that Chriſt for our ſakes beeing in ſuch heauines and feare, did not yet (for all that) ſteppe aſide from his Fathers will. The patience therefore of Chriſtians ſtandeth not in this, that they feele no paſſion, or bee not feareful, heauy, or ſorie: but in this, that no croſſe bee ſo great, as to bee able to driue them away from Chriſt. Yea, the more the croſſe that God the Father hath laid vpon them doth make them to ſmart, &amp; the more it preſſeth them (ſo that they yet beare it) the more pretious and more excellent is their patience: which patience we ought to declare, but not as they that ſuffer or feele no paſſion at all.</p>
                  <p>For heere wee are inſtructed and certified of the kindnes of our louing Father, that hee is not angrie, neyther taketh it in euill part when we complaine to him of our preſent trouble, ſo that we giue ouer our will vnto his. All they therefore that be in afflictions, 
<pb facs="tcp:22982:45"/>
aduerſitie and temptations, muſt ſet this example of the Lorde directly before their eyes, and ponder it in their harts. Not only is the father not angry when wee complaine vnto him in our neceſſitie, but in all trouble hee ſendeth vs his owne helpe and comfort, either by his Angell, or inwardly by his ſpirit, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by ſome other meane, he ſendeth vs ſtrength, giueth vs his hande, draweth vs, deliuereth vs, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vs not to be tempted aboue our power, or elſe in the middeſt of our aduerſitie, he giueth vs conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ſtrength to ouercome it.</p>
                  <p>O how great comfort bringeth this vnto vs in our afflictions in life and death, if we ponder, weigh, and conſider the exceeding loue of GOD our heauenly Father, who giueth his deare Sonne into ſo greate trouble, that wee might bee deliuered from eternall aduerſitie and ſorrow. If we alſo remember the loue of our Lorde Ieſus towards vs, who for our ſakes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon himſelfe ſo great a feare and paſſion, how cannot wee looke for all good thinges at his hande? What thing is ſo great, that wee his members would not ſuffer for his ſake, if wee behold the head in ſuch anguiſh and trouble? And for as much as hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all this for the ſatisfaction of our ſins, we ought to applie great diligence, that we fall not againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, for the which Chriſt ſuffered this, and from the which Chriſt with ſo great a paſſion hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and cleanſed vs. Wee learne heere alſo to loue our neighboures, to care for them, to pittie them if they bee impotent and ſlowe, to pray for their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, ſeeing wee are all weake and feeble: and vnto
<pb facs="tcp:22982:46"/>
ſuch weakneſſe muſt we ſo haue reſpect, that we bee not arrogant, nor hold much of our ſelues, when wee ſee that <hi>Peter</hi> and others are ſo full of ſleepe &amp; ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhnes, that all the admonitions and exhortations of Chriſt, could at that time do little with them. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in humblenes of minde, and in the feare of God, ought wee to ſtand: to aſcribe all good thinges vnto him: to be carefull and watch, leaſt the Deuill draw vs into his temptations.</p>
                  <p>O mercifull Father, giue vs grace with feruent hartes to conſider the vnſpeakeable loue of thee and of thy Sonne, and neuer to forget the ſame: that our fayth and truſt in thee may bee ſtrengthened: that loue in vs towards thee and our neighbour may bee kindled: that aboue all thinges wee may loue thee, the welſpring of all goodneſſe: that wee may ſerue our neighbours in loue, care for them, and doe them good, according to the loue that thy deare Son hath beſtowed vppon vs O giue vs patience and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in aduerſitie, ſtrengthen our weakneſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs in trouble and diſtreſſe, helpe vs to fight: Graunt vnto vs, that in true obedience and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mind, wee may giue ouer our owne willes vnto thee our Father in all thinges, according to the example of thy beloued ſonne: that in aduerſitie we grudge not, but offer vp our ſelues vnto thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. Giue vs ſtrength conſtantly to ſubdue the rebellious and ſtubborne fleſh, and to make it obedient vnto the ſpirit: to caſtaway al tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and carnall feare: to reſort oft vnto prayer: to bee earneſt and feruent therein: to mortifie all our

                  <p>Oh what an vnſpeakable great loue is heere! The ſhepheard dieth, to ſaue the lyfe of the poore ſheepe: the Lorde goeth vnto death, to the intent that the ſeruants ſhould not die: the creator ſpareth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſaue his creature.

                  <p>And though he be verie God, and ſheweth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies the brightnes of his godly ſtrength, in that he ſo throweth them to the grounde, yet will not he in the ſame houre vſe ſuch his diuine power to deliuer himſelf: albeit he admoniſheth them therby, to ceaſe from their conceiued mallice, for his godly ſtrength caſteth them downe, his mercie &amp; grace lifteth them vp again.

Lette couetouſnes blind no man: let the deſire of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good poſſeſſe and rule no mans heart: for out of couetouſnes the roote of all vice, groweth nothing but treaſon and deſpaire. No righteouſneſſe, no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, no truth, no honeſty, can be in that hart wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in greedie couetouſnes hath taken root. <hi>Iudas</hi> for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie greedines of money, giueth ouer God &amp; all loue: and hee that afore was a fellowe and companion of the holy congregation of Gods children, is become a mate, companion and Captaine of the wicked &amp; vnbeleeuers: hee that was choſen to the preaching of the Goſpell, is become an enemie, perſecutor, and traitour againſt the truth. O from how high &amp; great honour, to what ſhame, diſhoneſtie, and vile ſtate falleth <hi>Iudas,</hi> who hauing woluiſh conditions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſheepes cloathing, doth vnder the token of loue, practiſe treaſon againſt the trueth?

                  <p>Of theſe (the more pittie) there bee at this daie in the church of God many, which vnder the pretence and colour of truth, fight againſt the truth, and that taking the name of Chriſt in their mouth, betraye Chriſt, yea with the ſword of their venemous tungs kill Chriſt, and in ſheeps cloathing are very wolues, falſe teachers, and moſt noyſome enemies, whome couetouſnes and vaine glorie blindeth.

But this is your houre, and the power of darkneſſe. All this commeth to paſſe, that the Scriptures ſhould bee fulfilled. Then the Diſciples forſooke him, and fledde all from him. There was a yong man that followed after, who had a white linnen cloth vpon the bare, and him they tooke. But he left the linnen cloth behind him, and ranne away naked. The multiude, and the captaine and Ministers of the Iewes, apprehended Ieſus, took him, bound him, &amp; lead him first to Annas the chiefe Priest: for he was Father in lawe vnto Caiphas, which Caiphas was high Priest, and was the ſame Caiphas which gaue counſaile vnto the Iewes, that better it were one man to die, than the whole people to periſh.

would <hi>Peter</hi> haue gone with Chriſt his maiſter into priſon &amp; death. But now he is ſo afraid at the words of one Damoſell, that hee denieth the Lord. Of the which fall, Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Diſciples afore for a warning: but they beleeuing it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came preſumptuous, and aſcribed too much vnto themſelues: therfore the Lord ſuffereth them to fall, that they may learne what they haue of themſelues, and what they haue of God: yea, that we all may ſee what the Apoſtles were afore the receiuing of the holy Ghoſt, and what they became after the power that was giuen them from aboue. Afore they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy Ghoſt, they were weake, feeble, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt and wauering: but when God hath cloathed them with power from aboue, they became feruent, earneſt and ſteadfaſt. Greeuouſly dooth <hi>Peter</hi> fall in deniyng of his maiſter: which thing yet turneth to the wealth of him &amp; all men, to the intent that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might learne, how hurtfull and daungerous it is for a man to truſt to himſelfe, to his own ſtrength, and not onely vnto God, without whome we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe nothing that good is. Good godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do fall many times, and thorow feare and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the battaile, they ſhould vtterly giue ouer, if they were not fortified and preſerued by the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the mercie of God which continually careth for vs, hath brought to paſſe and appointed, that ſuch examples ſhould be noted in the ſcripture, to teach vs, &amp; to declare vnto vs his power &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in euerie thing. Thus the ſinnes &amp; falles of holy
<pb facs="tcp:22982:53"/>
and vertuous men are ſet before vs: partly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that if we ſtand, we ſhould ſo continue vpright, looking well to our ſelues that we fall not: and partly that if we be fallen, we ſhould learne to riſe vp again, to amend our liues, and to bewaile our ſinnes. And ſo haue the holye Euangeliſtes perfectlie and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formelie deſcribed the fall and deniall of <hi>Peter,</hi> not that thereby they thought to deface <hi>Peter,</hi> or to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe and make knowen his treſpaſſe: but that the power of GOD in him might be knowen and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>As for ſuch ſinnes as holy men commit through weakneſſe and ignorance, God vſeth them to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and our commoditie: that with the woundes of his Saintes, he might heale ours, and that the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of the godly, might bee vnto vs, a ſure port &amp; hauen. Peters fall ſerueth firſt to the knowledge and praiſe of the power and goodneſſe of God, in that we ſee how mightily he ſetteth Peter vp again, &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth him, howe graciouſly hee forgiueth him his ſinnes, that we which are fallen, ſhould not deſpaire, but hope for aſſiſtance and forgiueneſſe of God, who giueth ſtrength and power vnto thoſe that are his. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, it ſerueth to our commoditie and profite, in that we ſee a good godly man fall and ſinne, and afterward riſe vp againe and amend, leaſt we ſhould ſaie: Alas, I am loſt, I haue done this, and I haue done that: but foraſmuch as wee ſee that Peter by repentance, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and conuerting agayne, doeth obtaine grace, it is meete and conuenient, that wee acknowledge our offences vnto GOD, deſire grace, weepe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne
<pb facs="tcp:22982:53"/>
of our ſinnes before GOD. For both are heere ſet before vs, the fall and the repentaunce: and this enſample is good and profitable to thoſe that are in the right waie of godlyneſſe, and alſo vnto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The godly, iuſt, and righteous, learne by this to bee circumſpect, and not to preſume. Sinners by occaſion of this doo learne, immediatly to riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from theyr fall, and not in anie wiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre.</p>
                  <p>Yea, our owne fall learne we to knowe, by Peters fal, but alaſſe, our fall is much more grieuous &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Peters. Peter ſinned through weakneſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time doe wee ſinne wilfully and aduiſedly: hee once, we daily: he was conſtrained thorow feare, we many a time thorowe light occaſions, fall from the way of truth and righteouſnes: hee riſeth vp againe forth-with, we ſeldome and ſlowlie: he wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſcarce doe confeſſe and knowledge the ſinne. Yea bitterlie wept he: which thing al the electought to doe, if they haue ſinned. There ſhould nothing greeue vs more, than to haue ſinned againſt GOD, than to haue diſpleaſed God. This doe not wilfull ſinners, which paſſe little or nothing vpon ſinne, and when they come into the deepenes thereof, care not for it, neither confeſſe nor acknowledge their ſinne, vntill afterwarde with diſpaire, as it is to ſee in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</p>
                  <p>But Peter bewailing the greeuous fall and wickedneſſe of his deniall, without further falling away into horrible deſperation, is preſerued thorow the goodnes of God: in the confidence of gods oft

prooued and accuſtomed mercie, is hee lift vp vnto bleſſed repentance, and ſo healed. Chriſts looke (the true Phiſitian) is vnto him as much as a worde or ſpeech. Wherein wee may learne to knowe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable loue of GOD, who (euen in the middeſt of ſinne) forgetteth not his own, forſaketh them not: but graciouſly looketh vppon them with the eyes of his mercie, admoniſheth them, ſpeaketh vnto them through the outward and inward worde, with the which gratious countenance he diſwadeth them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, and calleth them againe to himſelfe, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to ſorrowe, and mourning lamentation &amp; weeping.

                  </note> for as much as it was the day of preparation afore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, there came a rich man of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, named Ioſeph, ſuch a principall &amp; famous Senatour, as was iust and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. The ſame had not conſented to their counſaile and doings: for he alſo was one of thoſe that waited for the kingdome of God, a diſciple of Ieſu, but ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for feare of the Iewes. Boldly went he in vnto Pilate, and begged the bodie of Ieſu. But Pilate wondered, if he were now dead alreadie. And when hee had learned of the Captaine that it was, he graunted him the bodie of Ieſu, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to bee giuen him. Ioſeph had bought a white linnen cloth, and tooke downe the bodie of Ieſus,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and wrapt it in the faire linnen cloth. There came alſo Nicodemus (who was come to the Lord afore by night) &amp; brought mirrhe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes vppon an hundred pound, mixt together. So taking the body of Ieſu, they wound it with clothes, and prepared it with
<pb facs="tcp:22982:81"/>
ſweet ointments according as the maner of the Iewes was to burie. And by the place where Ieſus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new ſepulchre. There Ioſeph laid Ieſus in his owne new ſepulchre, which he had cauſed to be hewen out of a rocke, into the which no man had yet been laid. Foraſmuch then as it was the Iewes day of preparing, the ſepulchre being at hand, they laide Ieſus into it, and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph weltred a great ſtone afore the entrance of the ſepulchre and went his way.</p>

This
<pb facs="tcp:22982:81"/>
holy ſacrifice was offred vnto God the father for our welfare, and euen the ſame it is that hath taken awaie the ſinne and wickednes of all the world.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer is read and ſpoken concerning the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, it is altogether done for our eternall wealth and comfort. Now is it deſcribed of the holy Euangeliſtes, with what honour and glorie his holy body was buried: and that not of mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but of noble and famous iuſt men, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who while Chriſt yet liued, fauored him and were ſecretly his Diſciples. But nowe after his death, they ſteppe forth ſomwhat more ſtoutly and boldly, begging of Pilate the body of Ieſu, to burie it. In the which act, is declared their worthy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant beliefe and loue vnto the Lord Ieſu. For their bodies, their eſtimation and goods muſt they needes put in ieopardy, and procure vnto themſelues the hatred and diſpleaſure of all the world, if they hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably burie him, who in his life time was taken to be an euill doer, a deceiuer, a ſedicious murtherer, and ſo was condemned vnto death. But thus it pleaſeth God, in weakenes:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. Iohn 12.</note> to declare his owne ſtrength and glorie: Thus the dead wheat corne bringeth foorth fruit in the death of Chriſt, and thus appeareth the power of his death. For though he verily and trulie died as touching the body, yet after the ſpirit, and in mighty power, he liueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea hee himſelfe is the life of all things.</p>
                  <p>This is the power and fruite of his paſſion, when a mightie and ſtrong ſpirit dooth exerciſe it ſelfe in faithfull beleeuing harts. They that afore were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:22982:82"/>
to go openly vnto the Lord, ſteppe now foorth manfully, all fearefulnes ſette apart, ieoparding their bodies and goodes. For beſides that they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in perill of looſing their life and eſtimation, they beſtow alſo great coſt in linnen cloth, &amp; in coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweet ointment. For they bury not Ieſus as an euil doer, but as an honourable man and friend of God, according to their cuſtome. Loe, what a thing it is, to cleaue ſomewhat vnto Chriſt, how feeblie ſoeuer it bee doone: it bringeth alwaie great fruite in his time. No man therefore ought to bee reiected that cleaueth anie thing vnto Chriſt, and earneſtly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him. Faith is ſtrengthened in affliction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, the death of Chriſt giueth power vnto the fearefull. In death beginneth his honour and glorie to appeare, there are all thinges faire and beautifull. <hi>Centurio</hi> giueth teſtimonie, and maketh an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion, and ſo doo they that were vnder him.</p>
                  <p>Neceſſarie it was we ſhould beleeue and confeſſe that Ieſus verilie died vpon the croſſe: therefore do the Euangeliſts deſcribe it ſo perfectly, howe his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was taken downe from the Croſſe by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and was laid in the Sepulchre: To the intent that wee alſo might beleeue and confeſſe, that he hath broken the bands of death, and is from death mightily riſen againe. For life might not bee holden captiue in death, neither might death with the rules thereof alwaies binde him, that of all thinges is the life, in whome wee liue, mooue, and haue our bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

How be it his buriall and reſt muſt needs bee honourable, as the Prophet ſaith, Eſa. 11. For when hee by death had finiſhed the courſe of his life, and the woorke of his father, this reſt appertained to his honour, and the father heard him as hee praied afore: Father, (make thy ſonne honourable) or glorifie thy ſonne.<note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> This began in the buriall, there was the faire white linnen cloth, the new ſepulchre, the honorable men and excellent dead buriers, as witneſſes of his death, there were the hundred pounds of pretious &amp; coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyntment. All theſe thinges were euidences of a glorious, new, and immortall life, which Chriſt had in his bodie as the firſtling of his deed, and as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall haue according to our meaſure. The ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre is newe: partly to preuent all wrong ſuſpition, (for if anie man had lyen in that ſepulchre afore, it might eaſily haue beene ſuſpected or talked, that Chriſt was not riſen againe from the dead, but ſome other) partlie to declare the newneſſe of lyfe in Chriſt, and in thoſe that are his, as it is ſayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>By this alſo wee ſee into what pouertie Chriſt ſubmitted himſelfe: hee that in his life time had neyther houſe nor place where to lay his heade, is nowe couered with ſtraunge cloth, and layde in a
<pb facs="tcp:22982:83"/>
ſtraunge Sepulchre. In the which thing (though Chriſts bodie was alwaie vncorrupt) we are taught fruitfullye to conſider the corruption of our body. We are earth, and to the earth muſt wee yeelde and paie earth againe. Aſhes wee be, and into aſhes wee muſt returne. Why bragge wee then? Why are we proud and high minded, ſeeing that ſhortly we ſhall become foule doong and carrion? Why haue wee ſuch deſire to the wicked worlde, conſidering it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vs out ſo vilely? We ſhould alwaie remember, that within a ſmall ſhort time, we ſhall be laid down into a foule pit. There is the harborow of all fleſhe: There lie the rich and poore together in one bedde: There is no difference betweene noble and baſe of bloud: There, neither goods helpe the rich, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile craft, the wittie. There the tender is worms meat, and he that a little while agoe went bragging vp and downe in coſtly apparell, is now an vglie ſmell to the noſe: There the hardie Giant, is faine to play ſtoupe gallaunts parte. The praiſe and commendacion of ſuch as are puft vp in fooliſhe pride, departeth as the duſt before the wind. Thus paſſeth away all mankind and all fleſh falleth to the place whence he came, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolued by reaſon of originall ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore let vs learne in this time ſo to liue, and ſo to ſubdue the fleſh through the ſpirite, that when the fleſh corrupteth,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> our ſoule may bee taken into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall peace and reſt. For all we that be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt Ieſus, are baptized into his death, beeing buried with him rhrough baptiſme into death: that as Chriſt was raiſed vp from the dead through the
<pb facs="tcp:22982:83"/>
glory of his father, ſo we likewiſe might walke in the newneſſe of life. For if we be graſſed in him through the ſimilitude of his death, we ſhall aſſuredly alſo be partakers of his reſurrection: knowing this, that our olde man is crucified with him, that the bodie of ſin might be emptied, and that we ſhould ſerue ſinne no more, for he that is dead, is made righteous from ſin, if we now be dead with Chriſt, we beleeue, that wee ſhall alſo liue with him. Looke vpon the whole ſixte Chapter to the Romanes.</p>
                  <p>We muſt die from the world, and from our owne fleſh, that the world may be crucified, and dead vnto vs, as we vnto the world. The olde Adam, who in vs did liue and rule, muſt bee ſubdued and mortified, that Chriſt onely may liue and raigne in vs. We muſt burie our bodies with mirrhe and Aloes, that is, with lamentation and ſorow for our ſinnes, with weeping with faſting, and with abſtinence, which workes of repentance are bitter vnto the bodie. But lyke as thoſe bitter things, Aloes and mirrhe, doe keepe the bodie from corruption, ſo the croſſe and aduerſitie ſent of God and borne for his ſake, preſerueth our fleſh from ſinne.</p>
                  <p>If we thus die with Chriſt from the world, &amp; bee buried in his death, we ſhall riſe againe to a new life, here and in the world to come: &amp; ſo as for death, we need not be afraid of it. For the ſepulchre is new, and lieth in the garden: which noteth vnto vs, the return to the pleaſant garden of paradiſe, which is opened vs through the death of Chriſt, for hee as a guide is entered in before vs, Iohn. 14. Heb. 9.10. that we alſo
<pb facs="tcp:22982:84"/>
after a new ſort might eſcape from death, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to a new life. For in the death of Chriſt, is death killed, ouercome, and wholy nenued, and as much as altered into a ſleepe. For we liue vnto God, and our bodyes (as the Scripture teſtifieth) ſhall alſo liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this is the cauſe that the Scripture affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe which are dead in Chriſt, to be aſleep. Eſay 26. 1. Theſſ 4.</p>
                  <p>Afore time had death mightily and openly raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, euen ouer thoſe alſo that had not ſinned like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Adam (yet had they put on Adams image, &amp; were therefore ſubdued vnto the curſe) but when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15</note> namely Chriſt, appeared, &amp; purchaſed lyfe agayne for mankind, through the death of his fleſh, deſtroying the dominion of death, and riſing from death againe. Then was death renued &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and became like vnto a ſleepe, for it deſtroyeth vs not for euer, but is a gate and enterance into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and eternall life, therfore haue we a much more perfect hope of the reſurrection in Chriſt, than they of olde, which therefore buried the bodies ſo coſtly and honorably, becauſe they hoped in the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come. As for vs, wee muſt beſtowe ſuch coſt vpon Chriſt in his members, clothing &amp; feeding the poore, and being ready alſo to looſe all things for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Graunt vnto vs, O God, that as concerning the world and the olde life, wee may die with thy ſonne our head, and be truly buried in his death, that with him and in him we may riſe againe to a new life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we weak and feeble, may with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nichodemu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead is verie diligently and perfectly deſcribed of the foure Euangeliſtes, for right profitable and neceſſarie is it for the ſtrengthening and ſtabliſhing of our beleefe in Chriſt. And whereas in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this hiſtorie they ſpeake not all alike, the ſame happeneth to our wealth through the ordinaunce of the holie Ghoſt, that we ſhould exerciſe our faith
<pb facs="tcp:22982:86"/>
therein, and applie our diligence, perfectly to learne and comprehend the ſame Reſurrection of Chriſt: For where that is right conceyued and beleeued, there is faith perfect. The Euangeliſtes nowe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Chriſtes Reſurrection, doo moſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, to what high honour Chriſt came after death, and that in one order and degree, according as our beleefe and weakeneſſe increaſeth and groweth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt, is faith in vs feeble and vnperfect, but through the grace of him that hath giuen it, it daily groweth. Verie hard alſo is it for our naturall reaſon, to receiue and beleeue the reſurrection of the dead: therefore doe the Euangeliſtes right diligently and with manie wordes ſet forth the ſame reſurrection of Chriſt, that our beleefe therein might be aſſured and ſtedfaſt. For whoſoeuer truely and conſtantly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the reſurrection of Ieſu Chriſt, is readie &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to beleeue all that concerneth Chriſt. Neither is there anie thing that maketh a man more ioyfull then when he beleeueth, that at the comming of the Lorde, he ſhal riſe againe, and receiue a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die after Chriſt, and with Chriſt. What can be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſuche a faithfull beleeuing man, when hee beholdeth ſo high a rewarde from God. Diligently therefore ought we to heare, what the holy Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts write of his reſurrection, and to giue credence to the witneſſes that ſaw it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wee heare agayne the great zeale, and the feruent loue and diligence of theſe deuout women, in that they deſire to ſhew honour vnto the Lorde

Heauenly is the meſſenger and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the reſurrection, for it paſſeth farre all natural reaſon and all fleſh. Therefore are the women alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him, and at the faire brightnes of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and apparel. For our feeble fleſh is not able to ſuſtaine the glorious ſhine of the heauenly light and godly clearenes, but is afraid at it, and feareth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe God by his Angell doth right ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the womens weakenes, taketh from them their feare, ſpeaketh louingly vnto them, maketh them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that is, meſſengers and proclaimers of the ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſurrection. So little doth God reiect our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he maketh euen women to be the declarers of his reſurrection: for he euer delighteth of the laſt to make the firſt. Foraſmuch then as they were the beginners of death in ſinne, they are heere firſt afore the Apoſtles, choſen to bee declarers of that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, which euen out of death is come forth vnto vs in Chriſt.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtanding may comprehend it. For if Chriſt had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly at once opened himſelfe to his Diſciples, ſo that other exhortations &amp; warninges were not gone before, then ſhould they haue taken it but for a plain fantaſie and viſion,<note place="margin">Math. 14.</note> as they did when the Lorde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto them vppon the water. Therefore the Euangeliſtes deſcribe the matter verie diſtinctly and ſundrie wayes, ſo that no man can bee able to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect anie deceyte. Firſt, how the women and men came to the ſepulchre, looked and went in, and how they viewed euerie thing throughly, not once, but oft and manie times: the clothes wherein the Lorde was wrapped, the heade kerchiefe, euerie thing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den together in his ſeuerall place: and how they ſaw and perceyued, that the bodie was not there, that the Sepulchre was open, the ſtone rolled away, and how the Aungels and heauenly ſpirits teſtified, that hee was riſen agayne. Yet for all this, they are weak and beleeue it not ſtedfaſtly, but bee as yet in a doubt. Thus GOD permitteth them to wauer, and to bee feeble of beleefe, and doth not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade them forthwith, and that altogether for our ſakes.</p>
                  <p>Hee might well ſodainely haue certified and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Thomas</hi> and them at the firſt, but thus is it better both for them and vs. For the more a ſicke man feeleth his owne diſeaſe and woundes, the more
<pb facs="tcp:22982:89"/>
acceptable is the medicine vnto him: The weaker that our beleefe is, the more cauſe haue wee to call vpon God for the increaſe of faith: the more weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we find in our ſelues, the farther are we in debt and the more bound to praiſe God. When hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs ſtrong, and ſeeing it is his onely ſtrength that ſtaieth vs, we ought the leſſe to reioyce in our owne. Chriſt in his life time had oft tolde them afore,<note place="margin">Math. 20.</note> of his reſurrection, but their mind was ſo dul, that they vnderſtood it not, neither perceiued they that great myſterie. The reſurrection of the bodies they could not comprehend, but alway vnderſtood it otherwiſe There was much written thereof, and that with eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent woordes, in the Scripture (as in the ſixteenth Pſalme, and in the figure of <hi>Ionas</hi>) and yet could not they vnderſtand it. Which thing neuertheles to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, Chriſt had giuen them occaſion ſundrie wais: As in that hee raiſed vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> &amp; other which were dead, and made them aliue againe.<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.</note> In all his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doctrine he declared, that this was vnto him in no wiſe vnpoſſible, by reaſon of the diuine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er working in him. For all this, the diſciples are yet ſo weake that they vnderſtand it not all.</p>
                  <p>Therfore doth the godly wiſedome lead them ſtill by little and little, to make them ſtronger, declaring vnto them certaine aſſured euidences: as that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was not in the ſepulchre, but that the clothes lay there wrapt together: for theſe were vndoubted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that he was riſen vp againe. For if any man had taken him out of the ſepulchre (as <hi>Magdalen</hi> thoght) he could not haue had ſo much time and leiſure, as
<pb facs="tcp:22982:90"/>
to looſe vp the bands, and to vndoo the clothes from the bodie, but had taken and carried awaie the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes and bodie together. For the clothes dyd cleaue hard faſt to the bodie, partly by reaſon of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly through the Aloes and Myrrhe than the bodie was dreſſed withall. But for all this, they are weake ſtill, and in doubt, vntill ſuch time as the Lord himſelfe doth ſtrengthen them. Therefore euen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> alſo, as feruent as ſhee is, iudgeth not the bodie to be riſen againe, but to bee ſtollen and priuily carryed awaie: thus God openeth himſelfe vnto whom and when hee will, for though wee ſee ſometimes many great and wonderfull workes, though wee reade and heare much of the Scriptures, yet remaineth our hart ſtill ignorant, neither doth the doctrine take effect, till Chriſt open it, and till he himſelfe be ſchoole-maſter within.</p>
                  <p>Who ſo would rather haue another and higher ſenſe or expoſition than this, it may bee vnderſtood that Chriſt appeareth vnto thoſe which mourne and weepe, and ſtande in death with Chriſt in ſubduing of the fleſh, in mortifying of the body, in abiding of the croſſe. For while they bee in aduerſitie vnder the croſſe, and buried with Chriſt, the greatneſſe of the trouble cauſeth them to thinke, that Chriſt is not riſen againe, that is, they haue nothing but heauines, and ſorrowe. Notwithſtanding Chriſt appeareth vnto them, comforteth and refreſheth them, and maketh them partakers of his reſurrection and ioy.</p>

The croſſe and trouble was not able to bring Chriſt out of her heart,<note place="margin">Mark. 16</note> it could not quench her loue vnto Chriſt: the ſeede of faith was in her heart, it had taken roote, although it were not yet ripe. Verie earneſtly and with great diligence ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhee him whome ſhee loueth, declaring her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentneſſe by her weeping, and her zeale by tarrying ſtill at the ſepulchre, when the two Apoſtles were gone awaie alreadie.

                  <p>The Angels which are miniſters for the wealth of the elect, diſſwade her from weeping and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and bring her tidinges of great ioy: for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nowe is no iuſt cauſe to weepe, but rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, ſeeing that Chriſt hath ouercome death for vs, deliuering and ſetting vs free from the power thereof, and placing vs in eternall lyfe. Lyke
<pb facs="tcp:22982:91"/>
as the Aungels at the birth of Chriſt in this mortall life, did bring tidinges of ioy: ſo doe they heere alſo when Chriſt is riſen againe into an immortall life. And hervnto alſo ſerueth the brightnes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and whitenes of the clothes: for all ſuch are tokens of ioy.</p>
                  <p>But ſome man might maruaile, why Chriſt will not ſuffer <hi>Marie</hi> to touch him, ſaying: hee would afterward bee touched of the other women, of the Diſciples, and of <hi>Thomas,</hi> yea he prouoketh <hi>Thomas</hi> and the Diſciples thereto.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth that <hi>Marie,</hi> with the ointment which ſhe brought with her, thought to annoint the bodie of Chriſt (as ſhe did afore in his life time) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence him, and to deale with him as with a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man: which thing Chriſt forbad her to do. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall wee heare how hee offreth vnto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples his hands, feete, and ſide, willing them to touch him. But with this inhibition, and that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath reſpect to one onely thing: namelie, to deliuer <hi>Marie</hi> and the Diſciples from vnbeliefe, from weake faith and doubting. Vnto <hi>Marie</hi> hee will ſay: Touch mee not of a carnall deuocion, as though thou wouldſt anoint me. I need it no more. As for ſuch corporall ſeruice, it is not neceſſary to do it vnto my body any more. The cauſe why I became man, was not that yee ſhould alway hang vppon my corporall fleſh, and honour me with bodely ſeruice. Thou ſhalt now ſhortly vnderſtand, that I haue like power with the father.

                  <p>Thereto alſo hath our ſauiour Chriſt inſtituted the figuratiue tokens and ſacraments of his grace, to helpe our infirmitie: for Sacraments are gracious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidences of the faith that men haue or ſhoulde haue to God. In the which they comfortably exerciſe and practiſe themſelues towards Gods promiſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo they declare the obedience of theyr inwarde ſaith, and that they faithfully beleeue the words and promiſes of almightie God. For the token without
<pb facs="tcp:22982:92"/>
beleefe is nothing profitable, but rather hurtfull. All bodyly ſeruice that the fleſh imagineth pleaſeth not God. Hee ſitteth at the right hande of GOD, there ought we to touch him with the lifting vp of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, and with the worſhip which hee through his ſpirite worketh and directeth into vs: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, roſe againe, and aſcended vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that hee might fulfill all things, and raigne true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritually in our heartes. Our heartes muſt wee lifte vp,<note place="margin">Col 3. Phil 3.</note> there as Chriſt ſitteth at the right hande of God, and our conuerſation ought to bee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Lorde willed his diſciples to touch him, it was done to baniſh theyr doubtfulneſſe, and to ſtrengthen theyr weake faith.

Chriſt dyd not therefore take vppon him his fleſh, that we ſhould alwaie hang and depend thereon, but that we by his humanitie, ſhould aſcend vp to his godhead: for when wee knowe the high and holy myſterie of his Paſſion and Reſurrection (with the which hee hath ſerued our turne) wee ought to ſtirre vp our mindes to knowe the Godhead, wherein he is lyke vnto the father.</p>
                  <p>Therefore vnto <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> alſo doeth Chriſt ſpeake of aſcending vp to the Father, which thing he commandeth to ſhew the Apoſtles, as if he

                  <p>Oh how great a grace is this? Oh howe high is the glorie that heere is promiſed vnto vs in CHRIST? The onely begotten ſonne of God, deſcended and became man for vs, that wee (ſo much as were poſſible for our nature) ſhoulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp vnto his Godhead.

                  <p>LOne is not idle, but diligent &amp; zealous: which thing may well bee perceiued in theſe women, that ran againe to the ſepulchre, although they had found it empty afore. Gladly would they haue found the body, and done reuerence to their Lorde, whom they loued. This feruent zeale of the women confoundeth our coldnes &amp; vnmercifulnes towards the poore. Oft times do they ſeeke him that is abſent, and that with great diligence: wee receiue him not, when (in the poore) he commeth vnto vs. No trauel, labour, nor coſt greeueth them: as for vs, we pitie our ſubſtance, when wee ſhoulde diſtribute to the poore which are Chriſts. O that we could rightly conſider, how pretious a treaſure we gather vnto our ſelues in heauen, when we giue of our goods into the hands of the poore, lending the ſame vnto Chriſt! Then ſhould not wee garniſh and build timber and ſtone, but the liuing temples of God, keeping them from wind and raine, and from decay: namely, that they ſuffer no extreme pouertie, nor be deſtitute of helpe.

declare his reſurrection to the Apoſtles, their weake faith muſt be ſtrengthned, to know and to be aſſured that hee was verily riſen againe. For not onely the Angell, but Chriſt alſo himſelfe commandeth them ſo to do. He comforteth them, and taketh from them the fearfulnes and ſorrowe. Thus wee ought not to doubt, he ſhall in all aduerſitie and trouble meete vs, he ſhall chearfully appeare vnto vs, and with his ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preſence and reſurrection ſhall hee comfort and preſerue vs.</p>
                  <p>But we lacke an earneſt and ſtrong faith: our harts are ſlow and cold: Diligent we be in ſeeking of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, but godly things wee either deſpiſe or neglect.

                  <p>IN that the Euangeliſts deſcribe the true reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, they declare withal, vnto whom ſuch a high myſtery was opened and ſhewed For when we heare how the diſciples were minded and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues, we learne therby what becommeth vs, that we alſo may beleeue, that Chriſt is truly riſen againe: yea, not only to acknowledge the ſame with the mouth, but alſo to proue and feele it in the taſt of the ſpirite. So haue wee heard afore, what the deſire &amp; ardent loue which God ſtirred vp in Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene, dyd bring to paſſe, and what good came of the feruentneſſe and diligence of Peter. This we ſee now here, for God hath a pleſure to ſtir vp our deſire when hee will open himſelfe vnto vs. And therefore all the ſame daie from morning early vntill nyght, were the diſciples ſtill more and more endued with new ioy, that the deſire to ſee Chriſt, might be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more and more in them. And as they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in loue &amp; vniformitie (for thoſe two things pleaſe God wel) Chriſt commeth and appeareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro

them. He openeth himſelfe vnto thoſe, that long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him, are coupled in loue and vniformitie, &amp; being aſſembled, doo hold themſelues together, for where loue is, there is God: where diſcord is and diuiſion, there is the deuill.</p>
                  <p>O deare brethren, let vs regard charitable loue, let vs care for our brethren, that the brotherhood be not broken, and that loue be not ſpotted, for els fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel ſaith. No man needeth to boaſt himſelfe of faith that hath not charitable loue, but ſtirreth vp and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth diuiſion.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we ſee here that the diſciples of Chriſt ſtood in great danger of their bodies and life: for when the Iewes had no more power to rage agaynſt Chriſt, they raged agaynſt his diſciples. Looke what men are partakers of the croſſe and paſſion of Chriſt they verily ſhall vnderſtand the high myſterie of his reſurrection. For vndoubtedly, God with his owne conſolation ſhall viſite and comfort thoſe, that ſuffer anie danger &amp; harme for his names ſake. Foraſmuch then as the good diſciples of Chriſt, muſt ſtill bee in conflict and battel with the Iewes, the Lord ſpeaketh vnto them with this comfortable worde, Peace bee with you: as if he ſhuld ſaie, be of good cheere, your matter ſhal ſtand in good caſe, in mee yee ſhal haue peace &amp; be ſafe, &amp; quiet, how hard ſo euer it go out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: Feare not, be not afraid, howſoeuer the Iews doo rage, ye ſhall doo right well. This ſalutation was common among the Iewes, therefore doeth Chriſt alſo vſe it. Such a charge gaue hee lykewiſe vnto his Diſciples, when hee ſent them to preach, that ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:22982:100"/>
into an houſe, they ſhould ſaie, Peace be to this houſe.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though the diſciples were ſomewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and afraide at the firſt bluſh, yet was theyr glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe great, when they were throughly inſtructed, that it was the Lorde. Now was fulfilled that which Chriſt had ſaid and promiſed vnto them afore. Io. 16 Yee ſhall mourne, and the world ſhall reioyce, but I will ſee you againe. Your ſorrow ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gladneſſe, your heart ſhall reioyce, and your ioye ſhall no man take from you. For the ioye of a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beleeuing heart is conſtant, and endureth. If the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt were truely and rightly beleeued, and the ſame ioye comprehended as it ought to bee, all ſorrowe muſt needs vaniſh, all hurt and aduerſitie muſt needes bee little regarded. For what can bee grieuous vnto a man, when by faith &amp; hope hee is aſſured, that hee in a glorified immortall bodie ſhall ariſe agayne with Chriſt his head, and haue euerlaſting ioy with him.</p>
                  <p>And this is the cauſe that Chriſt appeareth ſo ofte vnto his diſciples, inſtructing them ſo much and ſo perfectly of his reſurrection, euen to make them ſteadfaſt in this faith, and to aſſure them of this ioy. Therefore ſheweth hee them his bodie, and giueth it them to handle. The palpable bodie certifieth them, that it is a true bodie: the immortall bodie ſheweth, that it is glorified, and of higheſt honor: the printes of the woundes declare, that it is euen the ſelfe ſame bodie that it was afore. Hee ſheweth them the tokens of victorie, as a mighty ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:22982:100"/>
of death, and ſo doth hee the woundes that hee had gotten for them in the battell: and likewiſe the ſide that was opened, declaring his great loue. His woundes ſheweth he to them, to heale the wounds of theyr vnbeleefe. As if hee would ſay: looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee, and fight manfullie: Without a battaile ſhall no man bee crowned.<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Where as hee eateth before them, it is done for the probation of the true humaine nature, and not for the great neceſſitie of the bodie: To them was it verie needfull, not vnto Chriſt. Euen ſo we, knowing howe to further our neighboures faith, muſt, and ought manie times to doe ſomewhat, and to leaue ſomewhat vndone, that for our ſelues wee need not.</p>

                  <p>THat which was ſpoken afore, is heere euident and plaine, namely, that Chriſt openeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto thoſe, which are deſirous of him, and long after him aſſociating themſelues together one with another in true loue, and being partakers of the paſſion &amp; croſſe. Foraſmuch then as Thomas is leſſe feruent, and therefore abſent from the reſt, hee ſawe not Chriſt with the other diſciples, but when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a deſire to ſee Chriſt, &amp; was aſſotiate and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the other, he became alſo partaker of the ioye that they had.</p>
                  <p>And here we learne the nature and condition of true beleefe (which is an illumination of the grace
<pb facs="tcp:22982:101"/>
of God, yea a verie godly propertie) that he maketh others partakers of his holy and glorious ioyes, and that through loue, which ſeeketh not her owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, neither is diſdainefull, to the intent that the glorie of God may be preferred among all men Therefore the Diſciples of the Lord make <hi>Thomas</hi> their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion partaker of ſuch gladneſſe as they had receiued of Chriſts Reſurrection opened vnto them: for hee was verie faithleſſe, and too ſtiffe in his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which vnbeliefe God ſuffered to happen vnto him, and to continue ſomewhat the longer, that his ſlacknes and lacke of faith might ſerue to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie: that through his vnbeliefe, wee might bee prouoked vnto faith, for as much as we heare, that he ſo perfectly proouing, ſeeing and feeling the thing, came ſo to an vndoubted faith: that wee alſo might beleeue, that the bodie of Chriſt which was hanged vpon the croſſe for our ſinnes, was of the Father ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againe vnto life. For if wee beleeue in our heart,<note place="margin">Acts. 2. Rom. 10.</note> and confeſſe with our mouth, that God hath rayſed him vp from the dead, we ſhal be ſaued. Yea beleeue we muſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> that Chriſt (according to his wordes afore) hath through his godly power, erected vp againe from death, the temple of his bodie. Therefore tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the doubting of <hi>Thomas,</hi> wee learne the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the reſurrection of our own bodies. For Chriſt hath ſufficiently proued, and <hi>Thomas</hi> hath confeſſed that the bodie of Chriſt which was hanged vpon the croſſe, is verely riſen againe from death. Wherin, our faith is confirmed, to beleeue, that our bodies alſo ſhall truely and liuely riſe againe to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22982:102"/>When <hi>Thomas</hi> is with the other diſciples, Chriſt ſheweth himſelfe vnto him. For they that in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith and of vndiuided loue, doe not aſſociate and accompanie themſelues with other faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers in the Church, ſhall not be partakers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioyes. Truth it is, that to beleeue with the hart iuſtifieth: but the confeſſion that is made with the mouth, belongeth vnto health, &amp; ſerueth vnto loue and vnitie of the Church and congregation of God, without the which there can bee no hope of health. He that ſaith he beleeueth, and doth not ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto other Chriſtians, his faith is vaine and of none effect. And therefore did Chriſt for his church inſtitute the ſacraments, that is to ſay, exterior ſignes of his grace, that his people might be aſſociate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vnitie of faith. The Church of God is it, that preſerueth vs poore ones (as did the Arke of <hi>Noe</hi> afore time) in the floud, and bringeth vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough this raging ſea vnto the hauen of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Not that the grace and health is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee aſcribed to the elements and outwarde thinges: but that it may appeare how effectuous fayth is, and what it woorketh through charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loue in the Church. Chriſt maketh mention of the wordes which Thomas had ſpoken afore to the Diſciples in his abſence: Namely; Except I ſee in his handes the print, &amp;c. Therefore ſayth Chriſt: Thomas, bring thy finger hither, and ſee &amp;c. Whereby it is euidently prooued, that Chriſt is God, and euen ſo doth Thomas vnderſtand and confeſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22982:102"/>The woundes are ſhewed of Chriſt, ſpecially to this intent, that his paſſion might be printed and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in mens mindes. For a verie deepe and high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie is it, that Chriſtes ſide is opened, out of the which floweth bloud and water: whereby the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and faithfull beleeuing mindes may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſtes good louing will towardes mankind. Now when we looke vpon his handes, touching his ſide inwardly with our deſire of inward fayth, and conſidering why and with what loue Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs, it ſhall be no hard thing vnto vs to beleeue his reſurrection. If Chriſt were deade but euen as an other pure man or Prophet, we could haue no hope of the reſurrection. Who ſo beleeueth it, commeth ſoone to this knowledge, that immortall life is giuen vnto vs. Now where there is hope of an immortall life, there is the Lorde ſerued with great diligence. For if God hath not ſpared his ſonne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> but giuen him for vs all, what good thing then may wee not looke for at his hand? If wee bee onely true beleeuers with Thomas, then ſhall God faithfully performe that hee hath promiſed vs. Chriſt deſireth no more of vs weake feeble ones, than that we be not faithleſſe, but ſtedfaſt beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Thomas is immediately obedient vnto the voice of Chriſt, and becommeth foorth with a newe man. The Phariſies could by no doctrine, by no myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, bee brought to giue credence vnto Chriſt, and to beleeue in him, although they ſawe Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus rayſed againe from death: malice and hatred
<pb facs="tcp:22982:103"/>
did ſo hinder them. But <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledgeth him freely to be his Lord and God. He ſeeth and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth man, he confeſſeth God, whom he ſaw not. Hee acknowledged, that he whom he ſaw was his God &amp; Lord. Through the ſame faith was his vnbeleefe and ſinne forgiuen him.</p>
                  <p>O mercifull God, graunt vs loue, that we ſeek not our owne commoditie nor honour, but the profit of our neighbours, and thy glorie in all thinges.

or for vaine glorie, but to confirme our ſayth therewith. To write all, <hi>Iohn</hi> thought it not needful: for who could haue written all? Or who could haue faſtened and borne them all in minde? Who ſo will not beleeue theſe few that are written, ſhall neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a greater multitude. A faithfull beleeuer is well ſatisfied with theſe. For theſe that be written of him, are therefore written, that wee ſhould beleeue, that Ieſus is Chriſt the Sonne of GOD, and that we through his fayth might haue eternall life. Seeing then that all thinges which are written, doo extende and ſerue to this ende, that wee might beleeue in him, and bee ſaued by him, what lacke wee then? Or what can we deſire more? So that hereby we learne, with great diligence to reade, to conſider, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie into our owne lyfe, whatſoeuer the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes haue written of Chriſt: as they haue written nothing but that which is altogether excellent, deare holie and godlie, and ſuch thinges as doe liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, ſette foorth, and print Chriſt vnto vs: that our fayth, hope, loue, patience, meekneſſe, and all good thinges might growe with bleſſed fruite: that wee in our life might become thankfull for ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent grace, and in no wiſe to contemne or deſpiſe it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:22982:104"/>
doth <hi>Iohn</hi> comprehend the whole ſum of fayth: which conſiſteth in this, that Ieſus is the ſon of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, who for our ſaluation came downe from heauen, died, roſe againe, &amp; purchaſed for vs eternal life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ieſus the ſon of Mary, is the annointed king and high Prieſt, the ſauior of the world promiſed of God, &amp; ſpoken of afore by the Prophets.

Seeing now that we honor &amp; worſhip Chriſt, we worſhip God, for only God is to be worſhipped. Foraſmuch now as we worſhip the ſonne no leſſe than the father, it is certaine, that Chriſt is of one nature with the father: yea this ought we to beleeue, &amp; that he came downe into this world to die for vs, to waſh and wipe away our ſins, &amp; to kill ſin in our mortal fleſh, when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs partakers of his paſſion, &amp; mightily worketh in vs by his ſpirite, in mortifieng our carnall deſires.

Simon Peter went vp, and drew the net to the land full of great fiſhes, an hundred and three and fiftie. And for all there were ſo many, yet was not the net broken. Ieſus ſaith vnto them: Come and dine. And none of the diſciples durst aske him: What art thou?

                  <p>WE read in the holy Euangeliſts, that at the firſt Chriſt called his diſciples, namelie, Peter and the others from fiſhing, which they alſo left, and came to Chriſt, who told them that he would make them fiſhers of men. Now when hee wil ſend them out to that office, &amp; depart from them he appeareth againe vnto them at their fiſhing. And (like as he did afore at their vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he doth before them a great miracle: in the which hee admoniſheth them of their office, and chargeth them diligently to care for his ſheepe committed vnto them. But firſt he proueth his reſurrection, to ſtabliſh and confirme their weake faith therby, commaunding them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to bring other folks alſo thereto.</p>
                  <p>This hiſtorie in it ſelfe is euident enough, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought wee firſt to conſider it after the letter, for the letter alſo teacheth for it ſelf.

Therefore Paule alſo vſed not that liberty at certaine times, but labored with his owne hands and wan his meate. So did the Diſciples of Chriſt exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their labour. For when they were come
<pb facs="tcp:22982:105"/>
into Galelee, from the feaſt of Eaſter which they had kept at Hieruſalem, afore the holy ghoſt was giuen them, they would not goe idle, and thereby become a burthen vnto other men: (for he that goeth idle, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon other folkes, eating that theirs is, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth them) but vndertake to get their owne ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with their handy worke, which they had vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whereby wee muſt learne to apply our ſelues vnto labour, and not to bee idle: for idlenes is the mother of many and great vices. Euery man ought to haue an honeſt traiuaile, to bee exerciſed either with the body or with the minde. Who ſo labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, muſt not eat.

                  <p>Now when we in true faith and confidence vnto God, doe take in hand the worke that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto our charge, we ought not to doubt, God ſhal proſper it, and giue vs his rich and gracious bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in it, as it is written, Prouer. 3.

                  <p>Heere is alſo to bee conſidered, how Chriſt vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his godly power before his diſciples, in the great miracle that hee did in their ſight, to confirme our faith in him. For out of the appearing of Chriſt grow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth

                  <p>Heere wee ſee the ardent deſire of Peter, which leapeth into the ſea, as ſoone as he heareth that it is the Lord: he that afore had denied him, maketh now ſpeedie haſt againe vnto him.

                  <p>In the corporall workes and deedes of Chriſt, there is nothing in vaine, nothing without effect.

This (as no man can denie) was an outward act, and they commaunded outwardly to doo it, albeit in the remembraunce of him. Beſides and aboue the outward eating &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the faithfull beleeuer muſt lift vp his heart, and looke with the eyes of faith vnto that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, namely, how that Chriſt is the true liuing bread which feedeth our ſoules to eternall life, how his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was broken for vs vpon the croſſe, how we tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his death are made liuing, and waſhed awaie from our ſinnes by his bloud. In this is ſet forth vnto vs the higheſt loue of all, namely, that Chriſt gaue himſelfe vnto the death for vs, whereby wee are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of his grace, yea, not onely in this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto vs, but alſo the holy Ghoſt doeth mightily land fruitfully worke the ſame in the heartes of the true beleeuers, which in faith at the ſupper receyue the true body and bloud of Chriſt: whereby theyr heartes are kindled in loue towardes God and their neighbor, ſo that they dwel in Chriſt, &amp; he in them. &amp;c.</p>

holie ghoſt worketh not with vs inwardly. But when Chriſt biddeth caſt out the net: that is, when hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his ſpirite, wee are able to draw vp many men, and to winne them vnto Chriſt. For all the night long had they taken nothing, till Chriſt came vnto them: Euen ſo can we doe nothing if Chriſt bee not with vs by his ſpirite.<note place="margin">Acts. 2.</note> On Whit-ſonday when the ſpirite came vpon his Diſciples, they brought foorth much fruit, and drue many men vnto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Heereby declareth Chriſt vnto them in this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of fiſh, how it ſhould go in their office, and how the time was now at hand, that they ſhould ſhortlie drawe many men out of the ſea of this worlde vnto him, and that they ſhould proſper and haue good ſucceſſe therein. The world is this wilde raging ſea: the ſhore is the quietnes of eternall life that we haue in Chriſt, vnto whome we make haſt with <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Diſciples: neither doe wee bring men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues, but vnto Chriſt, and to the hauen of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life. Faith is not idle, but is alwaies occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in the Lords buſineſſe, cauſing vs to contemne all perrils, and to ſpeede vs a pace vnto Chriſt with the cloathing of vertues, eſpecially with fayth, the wedding garment: that wee appearing not naked, may make haſt vnto the land of the liuyng, where Chriſt is, the conquerour of death: For the faythfull beleeuers are not far from the land, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is in heauen. Without Chriſt wee muſt begynne nothing,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> without fayth may no man pleaſe God.

<pb facs="tcp:22982:107"/>
Vpon the right hand muſt the net be caſt out: That is, in the office of preaching, muſt reſpect bee had to the onely glorie of God, and edefiyng of the church and not to our owne profit or preferment.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt hungreth after our health, this is the meat which he deſireth: that we doe the will of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father: that wee put our truſt in him,<note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> and loue one another: that wee lead a iuſt and innocent life:<note place="margin">Iohn. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such meat is brought vnto Chriſt by the Apoſtles, when they through their teaching doe catche men, and bring them vnto God. Therefore doth he aske them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue any thing to eat. They ſaid: nay, for afore the receiuing of the ſpirite, they could doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but when he came, they brought many profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things to paſſe. The harueſt was ſo great, that they muſt needs haue many workmen.</p>
                  <p>So when God helpeth the faithfull miniſters of the worde, that they in the miniſterie of preaching haue proſperous ſucceſſe, ſo that they draw vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men through the nette of the Goſpell, and finde much fruite: Then the Diſciples whome Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and which loue him againe, doe know that it is the Lorde, and that the ſame commeth not of their owne virtue, but of the power of God. And heereof then groweth there in them a great deſire to come vnto Chriſt, and to be with him. The office therfore of Apoſtles &amp; of all miniſters of the word is this, that when they do what Chriſt commandeth them, they turne them to Chriſt againe, and aſcribe the honour

Iohn knoweth Chriſt afore Peter, but Peter commeth to the Lord before him, whereby we may note the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of miniſtrations and giftes in the Church. Though Peter bee more feruent, yet is hee not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to learne of Iohn.</p>
                  <p>The fiſhers come with the fiſh vnto Chriſt, the ſhepheards with the ſheepe to one manner of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for they are not carefull onely for themſelues how they may be ſaued: but alſo for thoſe whome they haue caught, to bring the ſame with them vnto the ſhore of eternall reſt. It is our ſaluation, when we become Chriſts meat, yea when Chriſt is our foode and ſuſtenance. For they that in the ſea of this world doe faithfully labour to drawe the fiſhe vnto the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſhall obtaine great fruit, and enioy an eternall banquet at Chriſts table in his kingdome. For Chriſt prepared them a dinner, wherein hee ſet foorth vnto the miniſters of the worde, what they ought to doe, namely, to feed the people committed vnto them. A great honor is it, to bring much people vnto Chriſt. Great commendacion, and vnſpeakable ioye ſhall thoſe teachers haue, that faithfully trauel in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and word of God.</p>
                  <p>By the multitude and great number of the fiſhes that the Apoſtles drew in the net, is figured the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Heathen, who through the preaching in the whole world, ſhould be brought into the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the faith.

Thus ſhall there euer bee one onely Church, which cannot by vs be throughly purged: Euermore wil Ipocrites do all their diligence to continue therein, though the makers of diuiſion ſhall not be without great trauail and labour. As for ſuch vices as bee manifeſt, great, and offenſiue, they that bee in authority, are bound to ſuppreſſe them, according vnto the ordinaunce of Chriſt. Mat. 5.13.18.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they that be faithful beleeuers and ordained vnto life, doe cleaue vnto Chriſt their head, and then to the members, that is to ſay, all faithfull Chriſtians.

And for an euidence hereof, I put thee in truſt to keepe my ſheepe: In no wiſe doe I refuſe thee, but a ſhepheard of my ſheepe will I make thee. Neither doth he caſt him in the teeth with his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but ſaith: If thou loue mee, then take vppon thee the care of the brethren. The loue that thou haſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to declare vnto mee in all thinges, and wherein I delight, the ſame declare thou now vnto my ſheepe, whom I ſo dearely haue bought. Thy life that thou wouldeſt haue offered for mee, giue nowe for my ſheepe. Now to the intent Peter ſhould not ſay that hee were expelled from the Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſhip through his deniall, the Lorde therefore giueth him a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to keepe his ſheepe. As for Peter, hee was no more ſo raſh and fooliſh hardie, but anſwereth more aduiſedly than afore, and taketh the Lord to witnes: for hee remembreth how it had happened vnto him alreadie, therefore ſtandeth hee not arrogantly in his owne conceite, neyther ſpeaketh hee agaynſt the Lorde, ſo wittie and circumſpect is hee become tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the fall.</p>
                  <p>Arrogant had hee beene and high minded, and therefore through the denyall he fell very ſore. But his weeping through faith and ſure confidence pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth him againe, and in loue he becommeth more feruent, pondering, that much is forgiuen him: ſo
<pb facs="tcp:22982:110"/>
that where ſinne was great, grace is more abundant and plentifull. <hi>Rom. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Peter is the office of the other Apoſtles, and of all preachers of the worde deſcribed: for heere may wee ſee, who are meet to be called to guide the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and what care and diligence they ought to take for them.</p>
                  <p>But here principally we muſt note this, that Chriſt minding to ſtabliſh his ſpeciall excellent doctrine, did euer firſt worke a notable token and miracle. As when he fed the fiue thouſand men with few loaues, he taught immediatly vpon the ſame,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> how wee muſt bee ſuſtained with the bread of heauen. Euen ſo here when the Diſciples had taken a great heape of fiſhes at Chriſtes commaundement, and were afterward fedde of him, hee tolde them immediately vpon the ſame, what their office is, and that they ſhould looke, euen ſo to nouriſh and feede thoſe that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. This was ſpoken vnto Peter, and in him to all others.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt who ſearcheth and knoweth all harts, doth not aske this queſtion as one ignorant, or as one that firſt would proue &amp; learne, but to teach faith, and to declare it vnto others. Such a queſtion demaundeth he. <hi>Math. 16.</hi> Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay the people that the ſon of man is? ſhewing therby what confeſſion &amp; faith he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of thoſe that are his. Euen ſo here: the ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter of the whole world, minding to put them in truſt, wil declare vnto them with this queſtion, how they ought to be, and the ſame wil hee print ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with this threefold interrogation. Here alſo
<pb facs="tcp:22982:110"/>
will the Lord teach, how neceſſary it is, that he who is to be made a ſhepheard &amp; teacher of chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, be firſt well knowne, proued and tried, &amp; that in many things afore-hand he bee found faithfull. It is not requiſite to take children vnto ſuch an office, but ſuch godly and apt men, as haue beene tried &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: namely, ſuch men as haue proued, ſuffered and felt ſomwhat by experience, wherby they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned humilitie and nurture.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that Chriſt in his examination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thoſe, which muſt guide the people, is a great, feruent, and notable loue to GOD. Without this loue ſhall ſoule ſhepheardes doo no good. This loue to GOD, ſhall bring with it loue towardes the ſheepe committed vnto them. For as much then as at this day the loue of Chriſt is ſo greatly quenched, therefore are manie Curates and ſoule ſhepheardes ſo faint and colde to preach and teach Chriſt. They burne not in the loue of God againſt vice, they print not vertue and godlineſſe feruently into the people, for there is no loue of Gods name in them. Seeing then that they haue no heauenly zeale vnto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of GOD, and to the amplyfiyng of his name, it is no maruaile that their preaching is ſo cold and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>Therfore ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt vnto Peter: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gapas me?</hi> Loueſt thou mee? For <hi>Agapao</hi> among the Greeks ſignifieth, feruently, earneſtly, &amp; right hartily to loue: yea to loue with a great good will. And this word he vſeth in the two firſt queſtions. In the third queſtion he ſaith: <hi>Phileis me?</hi> Loueſt thou me? <hi>Phileo</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22982:111"/>
ſignifieth ſo to loue, that one be louing to another, &amp; ſhew him friendſhip: therefore doth Peter take the Lorde himſelfe to witneſſe. As for the high excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent loue, hee dare not bragge of it, but ſaith: <hi>Philoſe:</hi> which is as much to ſay, as, I haue hitherto doone all that becommeth a friend to do. If any derogation or hinderance bee done to thy honour and name, I am hartily ſorie for it: as a friend is iuſtly greeued, if his friend be vilely intreated.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lorde with the three queſtions layeth hard vnto Peter: for a notable loue is it that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of thoſe, to whom he committeth his ſheepe in his abſence. Peter had a good conſcience, &amp; knew no falſhood or deceite by himſelfe, but bare a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and feruent loue vnto Chriſt: yet by reaſon of his former fall, and this oft queſtioning, he was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of quiet, fearing leaſt peraduenture there laye yet hid in him ſome ſecret thing, that diſpleaſed the Lord, or were againſt him, or that happily he ſhould not ſtand in ſuch fauour with Chriſt. Therefore ſaid he: Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt the harts of all men, and woteſt, that I beare thee a good heart, and friendly mind: which wordes proceed of a meeke feruent hart. Chriſt knoweth better how we loue him, than we our ſelues. Thus a ſhepheard oght to haue an ardent loue vnto Chriſt, and yet not to ſtand high in his owne conceit, or to bragge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, although he loue, and bee garniſhed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues more than other men.</p>
                  <p>Wherein may it bee perceiued, that a ſoule ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard loueth Chriſt, and is his friend? Verely in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:22982:111"/>
his ſheepe which Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him. Therefore ſaith Chriſt alway vpon the ſame: Feede my ſheep. But Chriſt vſeth here two diſtinct words. Firſt he ſaith: <hi>Voſce,</hi> that is, feed them, paſture them, fodder them. Secondly, he ſaith: <hi>Poimene,</hi> that is, bee thou vnto them a heardman, take thou care for them as it beſeemeth a ſhepheard: be thou a ſhepheard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſheepe, keepe them from the wolfe, &amp; from al ſuch hurt. Firſt, he requireth of him a feruent loue, then committeth hee his ſheepe vnto him, a treaſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> great &amp; deare, redeemed &amp; bought with the pretious bloud of Chriſt. As if he would ſay: If thou loue me declare the ſame in care and loue toward my ſheep, whom I commit to thy charge.</p>
                  <p>The ſheepe are Chriſtes, not the ſhepheards. As forſuch ſhepheards as keepe them ſo, that they make them hang vpon themſelues, thoſe loue themſelues, not Chriſt. They that ſeeke their owne glorie, profit, and lucre among them, are not faithfull ſhepheards. Againſt ſuch doth crie the threefold voice of Chriſt: Feed &amp; keepe my ſheepe: mine (ſaith he) not thine. Feed them, oppreſſe them not, flay them not: Feede them not thy ſelfe: Seeke my glorie, not thine own.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> For ſome there bee, which (as Paule with weeping teares complaineth) that ſeeke themſelues, not the glorie of Ieſus Chriſt. Of theſe ſpake Paule alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>2. Timoth. 3.</hi> Men ſhall be louers of themſelues, couetous, &amp;c. Where the wicked roote of ſelfe loue is in a Curate, there followe all the vices which hee in the ſame place maketh mention of. Who ſo nowe will bee a louer of Chriſt, and a faythfull ſhepheard

ſciences, that they may be fruitfull and comfortable to the whole Chriſtian congregation. If this might come to paſſe, then ſhould there be no lacke of wiſe counſellors and actiue men, profitable to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon authoritie: and alſo amongſt chriſtian people, there ſhuld be found men meet to be made ouer-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the miniſtery of Gods word, with which men the people ſhould be wel &amp; worthily prouided for.</p>
                  <p>Good vertuous teachers bring foorth a vertuous and godlie people. And doubtleſſe, the meaning of thoſe that gaue ſuch goodes to monaſteries &amp; chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, was at the firſt, that they thoght therby to ſerue God, and to doe good vnto the poore. If ſuch goods then as heeretofore haue beene euill beſtowed, bee now profitably and bleſſedly turned to the honour of God, and commoditie of the whole Church, then is the laſt will and meaning of the founders fulfilled. They alſo that muſt pay ſuch rentes, tithes, &amp; goods, will be the readier ſo to doe, if they ſee, that the ſame is well and profitably beſtowed. Then ſhall not they vntruly, but faithfully performe and pay all thinges, when they conſider that they doe ſeruice vnto God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Graunt vs all (O God) to harken and be obedient vnto the voice of true ſhepheards: and giue vs hearts to haue in great honour, and worthily to eſteeme of ſuch faithfull ſhepheards as vppon earth are thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ſtewards, by whome and in whome thou ſpeakeſt to vs, and with vs: that wee ſhewing vnto them all reuerence and honour which they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of for thy ſake, may giue them honeſt liuinges;

                  <p>IT is not ſufficient to haue begunne, except the ſoul ſhepheard continue in his office and faithfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>For to take the cure and charge of the ſheepe, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth great danger, loſſe, trauaile, and labour with it. Many a time muſt a faithfull ſhepheard ieoperd his life for his ſheepe. Such perrill doth Chriſt promiſe vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> namely, that hee muſt die, and with what death. Afore-time when hee was young, he ſought that which pertained to the fleſh, he might not away with the croſſe: but nowe after the receiuing of the holy ghoſt, he is ſtout, and dieth for Chriſts ſake, and for his ſheepe. Beholde, ſuch an end had <hi>Peter,</hi> that of loue he dieth for him, with whome to die he raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:22982:113"/>
promiſed afore. But neceſſarie it was, that Chriſt ſhould firſt die for Peters health, and that Peter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhould ſuffer death for his names ſake.</p>
                  <p>The preſumption and headines of man would haue ſet the cart before the horſe, but the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting truth hath appointed this order. <hi>Peter</hi> thought he would haue ieoperded his life for Chriſt, &amp; haue redeemed the redeemer: but Chriſt came to giue his life for his ſheepe, of whom Peter was one. Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Chriſt died for thoſe that bee his, there is ſtrength giuen in the hearts of ſuch ſhepheards and ſheepe as be faithful, to ſuffer death for Chriſts ſake. Death is not now ſo to be feared of vs, that we wold therefore goe backe from the truth: for by death do not wee loſe life, yea Chriſt hath made death to bee the way vnto life: And by his Reſurrection he hath ſet forth vnto vs an example of another life, which is immortall. Peter was firſt afraide and feared death, and would haue diſſuaded Chriſt that he ſhould not die:<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> but now that the precious treaſure of Chriſtes bloud is ſhed, hee followeth his redeemer, yea euen vnto the death of the croſſe goeth hee after him, therefore is hee nowe no more a ſatan, but a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">Petrus of the rocke.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But from whence commeth ſuch ſtrength into a feeble man? Euen from God who dwelleth in the hearts of the faithfull, for elſe is the nature and fleſh of man impotent and weake, beeing afraid of death: which feare (naturall heate being abated) is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them that are olde. And though we all wiſh to to be with Chriſt, and be deſirous of eternall life, yet
<pb facs="tcp:22982:113"/>
would we faine haue it without any griefe of death, if it might be. Thus came the conflict of death euen vpon Chriſt, whereby hee declared himſelfe verie man, but the wil of God had the maſtry aboue mans in the wraſtling: Peter alſo went not with his wil to death, but with his will he both ſuffered it, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it. Chriſt likewiſe, to comfort vs, was heauie: who neuertheles came vpon earth, that he wold die: neither was it neceſſitie that moued him to die,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10</note> but his owne good will and loue: for hee had power to giue his ſoule, and take it agayne.</p>
                  <p>Now though the feare of death be great in nature yet is it ouercome through the ſtrength and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the loue,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> which wee beare vnto him who is our life, euen Ieſus Chriſt. And albeit he was the life it ſelfe, yet pleaſed it him to ſuffer death for vs. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that hee alone dyed for vs, wee ought not to be aſhamed, neither ſhould it grieue vs to die alſo for him, ſpecially conſidering that the publiſhing of ſo excellent grace is committed vnto vs. When the ſhepheard dyeth for the ſheepe, it is no great matter if the ſheepe die for the ſhepheards ſake. Foraſmuch now as the faithfull ſhepheard with his loue, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and encourageth many of the ſheepe, to die for his names ſake: how much more meete is it, that the ſhepheards bee the firſt which ieoparde theyr liues, ſtriuing for the truth, and euen vnto bloud to reſiſte ſinne, when Chriſt hath put them in truſt to feed his ſheepe? This is now the occaſion why our Sauiour Chriſt telleth Peter of his death afore hande, and ſtrengtheneth and incourageth him therevnto: for
<pb facs="tcp:22982:114"/>
though the will bee conſtaunt in the ſaints, yet is the fleſh feeble and weake.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. Math. 26.</note> No man dieth without paine and griefe: which thing is appointed vnto vs by the wiſedome of God, to the intent no man ſhould kill himſelfe: For ſeeing the deuill doth now and then perſwade ſom to murther themſelues, how ſhould it go, if the ſoule were not ſo loth to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? With theſe words therefore thought nor Chriſt to make <hi>Peter</hi> afraid, or to diſcourage him, but to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, and make him ripe. For <hi>Peter</hi> had a good deſire to ſuffer ſomewhat for Chriſts ſake: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, beeing yet young, hee could not follow: but when he was olde, he followed him: therefore will Chriſt perfourme his deſire. As if Chriſt would ſay: <hi>Peter,</hi> thou haſt hitheto bin weake &amp; fearful, but I wil ſtrengthen thee: ſo that hence forth thou ſhalt deny mee no more, but manfully die for mee. Thou haſt bene tender, in that thou waſt afraid at one womans voyce: but now ſhalt thou ſtretch forth thy hand to the croſſe to be bound. For by the ſtretching out of the handes, hee vnderſtandeth and ſignifieth with what death hee ſhould die, namely, vpon the croſſe. Which death afore time was moſt ſhamefull: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Chriſt was hanged vpon the croſſe, it is now an honorable and glorious death, with the which the faithfull doe glorifie God: and therefore ſaith the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, that the Lord would thereby ſignifie, with what death <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>For in Gods quarrell, and for Chriſts ſake to die, is the higheſt honour, whereof no man ought to be aſhamed. This ought all ſoule ſhepheards to ponder
<pb facs="tcp:22982:114"/>
and conſider, that they faithfully and conſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt the Lord,<note place="margin">2.

Therfore ſhould they conſider afore hand, what things they muſt ſuffer for the truth: leaſt they deſtroy that, which they haue of long time builded and taught.</p>
                  <p>O gracious father: ſtrengthen thou vs in thy worke and in thy truth: that in the thing which thou haſt begun in vs, we may ſteadfaſtly continue to the end.

But in aſmuch as Peter is a figure of the Church, Chriſt ſpake thoſe wordes, not onely vnto him, but vnto all faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers. For the Church of Chriſt while ſhee dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth heere temporally in many troubles and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe foloweth Chriſt her ſpouſe and head, who alſo deliuereth her from all aduerſitie.

To followe Chriſt, is nothing elſe, than ſtoutly to ſuffer and ouercome deſpite and pouertie in this world for his ſake. And God truly, euen in his wrath (which wee with our ſinnes deſerue) cannot forget his mercie. Ouer and beſides the manifolde comfort and helpe which he otherwiſe declareth vnto vs, he hath giuen vs his own ſonne, to be our mediator: by whom, if we put our truſt in him, we ſhould be ſaued &amp; deliuered from eternall death, that we liuing from hence forth ſtill in faith, hope, and charitable loue, as pilgrimes in this world: and beeing in all troubles &amp;

It is no vile thing to ſuffer, &amp; to be put to death for Chriſt and his truths ſake: yea, a man cannot die a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable death, than when for the truth innocently, he ſuffereth with a good conſcience and with an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right minde.

                  <p>Wheras Peter asketh a queſtion concerning the diſciple whom the Lord loued, what he ſhould doo, it is a niceneſſe and vnprofitable curioſitie, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing to edification, and therefore it pleaſeth not the Lord. Whatſoeuer edifieth not, that ought not we to deſire of Chriſt. Let euery man looke to himſelfe, waiting vpon his owne buſineſſe and office and not to be curious in another mans matter: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not committed vnto his charge, and belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not vnto him, let him not meddle withal. Peter loued Chriſt, ſo did he them alſo: therefore asked he what ſhould become of him, and whether he ſhould remayne ſtyll ot die, for hee was verie loth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to departe from him. And ſo he paſſed more vpon Iohn, than vppon the precept and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt. Such curious backe looking doth the Lord rebuke.</p>
                  <p>Wee many and ſundrie times doo regarde and eſteeme more the thing that wee loue, than that which God commaundeth and biddeth vs. But ſuch loue is verie hurtfull, and eſpecially in thoſe

that ſhould be ſoul ſhepherds. Chriſts wil is, that they haue reſpect to his worke and commandement, and with a feruent loue to perfourme the ſame, not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with other buſines not needfull.</p>
                  <p>To enquire curiouſly of other mens matters, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not alway profit, but much rather vnquietnes. Therefore Chriſt remoouing <hi>Peter</hi> from ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous queſtions, draweth his mind vnto a better thing, namely, to follow him. As for that which he deſireth to know, Chriſt telleth him that it is no point of his charge, as if Chriſt would ſay: what haſt thou to doo with other folkes buſines? Thou haſt heard what I haue commanded thee: look that thou faithfully do the ſame. What inquireſt thou after other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

For thoſe twelue did not continue in this life vntill the ende of the worlde: and yet hee ſayth: I will be with you vntill the end of the world. Wherefore wee may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that Chriſt vntill the end of the world, will be with all faithfull beleeuers: that is to ſay, with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie church, to inſtruct, teach, ſtrengthen, comfort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and deliuer it, againſt all malitious violence of this world.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10</note> In his hand they are ſafe and well kept, &amp; no man is able to plucke them out of his hande.

                  <p>Now foraſmuch as the diſciples of Chriſt ſhould bring the heauenly doctrine throughout the whole

world, man being yet of himſelfe vnable to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the doings of God: he therefore firſt expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and declared the Scriptures vnto them, as Luke mentioneth: and ſeeing they were ſimple vnlearned men, hee opened to them their vnderſtanding. But to the intent they might not think: What ſhould we poore ſimple bodies doe againſt ſo many learned &amp; wiſe men? Who wil arme vs againſt thoſe that are ſo mightie? Therfore he breatheth vpon them, &amp; ſaith: Receyue the holie Ghoſt, whome hee there giueth them, and therewith ſtrengtheneth them inwardly, but with much more power and might vpon Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonday: whereupon he commandeth them to wait at Hietuſalem,<note place="margin">Ioel 2.</note> where he will ſend them the promiſe of the Father: cloathing the weake with heauenlie ſtrength, as with a garment, and arming them as with a ſhield.</p>
                  <p>What good thing then can hee lacke, or what euill thing can hurt him, which is his meſſenger (that hath all power in heauen and in earth) and with whome ſuch a king is euer abiding?</p>
                  <p>But when Chriſt would ſend out his diſciples, he ſaith vnto them: As my father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you. Whereunto did the father ſend his ſonne into the world? Euen that hee ſhould open the glorie of the father vnto the world: that he ſhould declare the will of the heauenly Father: that hee ſhoulde offer health vnto the worlde. This to doe, Chriſt alſo ſent foorth his Diſciples. He ſent them not to ſeeke after vaine-glorie, after power and riches, after bodilie pleaſure and worldly pompe, but to do as he himſelf

did.<note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> Chriſt ſought the loſt ſheepe, brought men vnto the knowledge and loue of the true liuing GOD, taught them to lead a vertuous and honeſt life. Hee was a Phiſition,<note place="margin">Math. 9.</note> went to the ſicke, helped them, and healed them:<note place="margin">Iohn 6. Iohn. 3.</note> he was not come to do his owne will, but the will of his Father: hee was not come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the world, but to ſaue it.</p>
                  <p>In all this, ought the miniſters of the worde to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Chriſt, and to do as he did. Vnto this new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and godlie life and worke, Chriſt giueth them the holie Ghoſt. For like as hee himſelfe was riſen into a newe life: Euen ſo through his holie ſpirite, will hee graunt and giue a newe life vnto thoſe that are his. Therefore breatheth hee vppon them, to declare, that it is hee, who at the beginning made man, and nowe by his death had quickened him, and renewed him: and that euen he is the fountaine and giuer of the ſpirite. Thus vnto his Diſciples he gaue the firſtlinges of the promiſed ſpirite, and with it a taſte of more and greater perfection, as an earneſt pennie.</p>
                  <p>All this declareth, what belongeth to true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters of the worde, which are ſent of Chriſt (for no man ſendeth himſelfe) what their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is: and that they which ſeeke the pleaſures of the bodie, honor, praiſe, and riches, are not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, and ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt diligently ought wee to pray vnto GOD, that he will giue vs faithfull Miniſters of the worde, which looking truelie to the worke of Chriſt, maye leade vs vnto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22982:120"/>But foraſmuch as without the holy Ghoſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be fruitfully done, we muſt neuertheleſſe praie for his holy ſpirite, who may in vs ſtirre vp ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts and deuout deſires, directing and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our will, and ſo giuing power and ſtrength to accompliſh the works of God, and ſteadfaſtly therin to continue: and that the ſame holy ſpirit may illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and kindle our minds, and prouoke them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all good and godly works. Conſidering then, that the keies which were promiſed vnto Peter, &amp; in him to the whole Church. <hi>Matthew 16.</hi> are heere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Chriſt, wee will alſo intreate ſomewhat thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe keyes are nothing elſe than the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Of the keies.</note> Chriſt now deduceth his oration from the common cuſtome of men. Like as things corporal are ſhut and opened with the key: ſo be the conſciences of men ſhut or bound with the Goſpell. Thus are theſe the keies which Chriſt giueth vnto the Apoſtles, vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of conſciences and ſouls. And that commeth to paſſe, when the holy Ghoſt illuminateth the mind that it vnderſtandeth the miſteries of Chriſt, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it ſelfe therevnto. To bee diſcharged or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, is, when the minde that hath deſpaired of health or ſaluation, is lifte vp to an aſſured and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted hope. To binde, is, to leaue the obſtinate &amp; vnbeleeuing minde vnto it ſelfe. Ieſus therefore ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth foorth his diſciples, to publiſh this health vnto the whole world, and to exclude &amp; ſeparate no man from this grace.</p>
                  <p>But firſt he giueth them the holy Ghoſt (as Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:22982:121"/>
ſayth) that is, he openeth their mindes that they may vnderſtand the Scriptures, as Luke ſaith: for what is it elſe to open the vnderſtanding, but to giue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt? Meete is it alſo and conuenient, that they which by the Goſpell ſhould beare Chriſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, ſhould receiue the holy ghoſt. For if they ſhould preach Chriſt, it was neceſſarie they had Chriſts ſpirit, ſeeing that Chriſt &amp; they had one manner of thing in hand: as, Chriſt was ſent of God, ſo were they ſent of Chriſt. Without fruit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſhould the miniſters of the word preach the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, if they were not endued, illuminated, and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Preach (ſaith he) the goſpel, that is the key where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the gate of heauen is opened. Who ſo belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Goſpell when hee heareth it preached, and vnderſtandeth it, feeleth comfort in his conſcience, that he is deliuered from ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Now doth the Goſpell ſet before vs, not onely the grace of God by Chriſt, throgh the which grace our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, but alſo it teacheth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a new life. Neyther doth anie man begin a new life, vnles he firſt be aſhamed of the former old and wicked life.<note place="margin">Luk. 24</note> Therefore ſaith Luke, that Chriſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the mindes and vnderſtanding of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they might perceiue the Scriptures, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might thus and thus ſuffer, and riſe again: and that in his name, that is, in his commandement and power, conuerſion of life, and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes ſhould bee preached and declared among all people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22982:121"/>Therefore when the poore ſinner through the preaching of the holy Ghoſt, heareth his wicked and ſinfull life (for the holy goſpel rebuketh the world of ſinne) he beginneth to knowe himſelfe a ſinner, and to be diſpleaſed, repentant and ſorrie for his ſinnes: he conſidereth alſo, that he is well worthie of eternal puniſhment and damnation. By meanes whereof, through the multitude and greatneſſe of his ſinnes, he vtterly diſpaireth in his owne power and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and eternall ſaluation. But therewithall, he heareth alſo, that Chriſt (by reaſon of his ſins) came downe from heauen, and dyed for him vppon the croſſe, waſhed away al his ſinnes with his bloud, hath reconciled him with God, made him Gods child, &amp; an eternall inheritour of his kingdome. And this he ſtedfaſtly beleeueth: I pray you doth not ſuch a mans heart leape for ioy, when hee heareth, that thorough Chriſt he is diſcharged of all the ſinnes that ſo ſore preſſed him?</p>
                  <p>The keies therefore are the pure word of God, which teacheth men to know themſelues, and to put their truſt in God through Chriſt. With that word, with thoſe keies do the miniſters of the worde open. For they that ſo are taught &amp; inſtructed by the word of God, that they put all their confidence in God, through Chriſt, thoſe verily are looſed and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of their ſins. But he that either wil not heare, or when he heareth, will not receiue and beleeue this grace declared to the world through Chriſt, &amp; offred vnto him by the miniſters of the word, him doo the miniſters bind, that is, they leaue him ſtil in his error
<pb facs="tcp:22982:122"/>
according as Chriſt commandeth his diſciples, Mat. 10. that from ſuch as will not receiue and heare their word, they ſhal depart, &amp; ſhake off the duſt from their ſhooes vpon them. Thus dyd Paul binde, Act. 13.18.</p>
                  <p>To bind then with the word, is nothing elſe, but (when the word of the grace of God is preached, &amp; not receiued) to leaue ſuch impenitent people, and to haue no fellowſhip, neyther ought to do with the deſpiſers of the truth and grace. For in the daie of iudgement, it ſhall bee eaſier vnto Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha, than vnto ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Now although the word that the Apoſtles preach, is not theyr own, but Gods, &amp; no man may cleanſe, vnbinde, and diſcharge from ſinne, but onely God, yet Chriſt of his grace, and (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the Scripture) aſcribeth ſuch vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For the gracious father of his aboundant loue and kindneſſe (and by reaſon of the couenant that he hath made with vs) doeth oft aſcribe vnto vs many things, which can properly belong vnto none, ſaue onely to himſelfe. Neither is this any maruell, ſeeing he hath giuen vs his onely begotten and moſt deare ſonne, to be our owne: for how cannot he geue vs al things with him?</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, we ought not by reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be high minded and proud, and to aſcribe vnto our ſelues, that which onely is Gods: but much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be thankfull for his grace, and diligent in our vocation, faythfully to employ and beſtow the high treaſure &amp; gifts of God, and not to abuſe them. This thing therefore extendeth not ſo farre, as that euerie
<pb facs="tcp:22982:122"/>
one man (properly to ſpeake) doth of his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authoritie forgiue ſinne. But foraſmuch as the Apoſtles and miniſters of the word, doo publiſh and declare remiſſion of ſinne, they bring the keyes and forgiue ſinnes miniſterially, and as miniſters. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, if here withal the ſpirit of God do not worke in the hearer to beleeue the word when it is prached, then is not the ſinne forgiuen: All the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and working is Gods.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtles may damne no man, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they may by the word declare damnation to the vnbeleeuers. Where an aſſured promiſe of grace is declared, there ſinnes are forgiuen.<note place="margin">The holy Ghoſt that worketh in the Apoſtles forgiueth the ſinnes.</note> Nowe when the Apoſtles ſhew vnto ſinners remiſſion of ſinne, they doo it out of the holy Ghoſt, and are not deceiued: for they preach, that our ſinnes are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs through Chriſt, who hath made ſatisfaction for them. If this faith vpon Chriſt, bee liuely in vs,<note place="margin">Note this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel</note> ſo that we abhorre ſinne, and bee deſirous of heauenly things, then are our ſinnes forgiuen vs through the holy Ghoſt, for no man can ſay, that Ieſus is the Lord but by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The key there extendeth to this end, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter declare remiſſion of ſinnes thorough Chriſte. Who ſo now beleeueth the Goſpell preached, ſhall be ſaued: hee that beleeueth not ſhall bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And ſeeing that faith is an inwarde thing in the ſoul inſpired of God, the miniſter cannot know who in the ſight of God beleeueth, or beleeueth not: for God onely knoweth the heart. Howbeit by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confeſſion, which is done with the mouth, &amp; by
<pb facs="tcp:22982:123"/>
receiuing of the preaching, and by the fruits, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may iudge. For who ſo receiueth the word, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly confeſſing Chriſt, and doeth not outwardlie defile himſelfe with vile deedes, to ſuch the miniſter openeth with the key, and diſchargeth them: that is, he taketh them into the Church of Chriſt, numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them among the people of God, and receiueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the kingdom of heauen. As for thoſe that wil not heare the worde preached, or that when they heare it, doo refuſe it, not confeſſing Chriſt, or vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theyr vnbeleefe with foule groſſe and open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe the miniſter bindeth: that is, hee ſhutteth them out of the Church, and baniſheth them out of the realme of heauen. To him that is in the Church, is forgiueneſſe of ſinnes promiſed: who ſo deſpiſeth charitable loue, hath not faith: vpon ſuch one remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſinne ſtill, and the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Apoſtles &amp; Miniſters of the word doo, that doo they not in theyr owne name, not in their own power: but as they which are ſent of God and that declare his word, the holy goſpell, out of the power of God, euen out of the holy Ghoſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen vnto them, doth ſpeak and work by them. What theſe binde, is bound before God, and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for out of God is it that they iudge: and what they vnbinde, is vnbound before God, for God wyll ratifie and allowe what they doo, that beeing ſent of him, keepe themſelues in exerciſe, and meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his word and commiſſion. As for him that is not ſent of God, and declareth not his worde and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, but of his owne proper power will binde one

                  <p>Heere alſo we learne, with what deſire and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, wee ought to receiue the miniſters of God, that bring vs his holy word, and comfort of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: how wee ought to eſteeme them that haue the holy Ghoſt, who ſpeaketh vnto vs by them.<note place="margin">Luke. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when he had brought them together, hee ſpake vnto them of the kingdome of God, &amp; commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: but to waite for the promiſe of the father. For Iohn (ſaith he) baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghost after theſe few dayes. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying: Lorde, wilt thou at this time restore againe the kingdome to Iſrael?

O how feruent words ſpake hee then vnto them? How deepely entred he into their hearts? How earneſtly printed hee thoſe his laſt wordes into them? The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſedome ſpeaketh nothing vainely, nothing ſlenderly, nothing without profite. Although the Diſciples (as men yet ſomewhat carnall) doe aske queſtions concerning the reſtitution of a bodily and temporall kingdome: yet maketh hee no aunſwere vnto their demaund, but directeth them vnto that which is for their profie, and belongeth to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, drawing their hearts from the earthly kingdom, (from the which they ought to bee mortified) vnto the kingdome of heauen, euen vnto the kingdome of God: in the which he himſelfe is king, &amp; into the which they now were receiued as citizens, that they ſhuld declare the ſame throughout the whole world and offer it vnto all men.</p>
                  <p>This is the goſpell of the kingdom of God, which for a teſtimonie vnto all nations, muſt bee preached in the whole world, to witneſſe the grace of GOD vnto the elect. But to the damned and vnbeleeuers,

a teſtimonie of their damnation: in that they are conuinced of their owne infidelitie, and ſhall haue no excuſe, if they contemne and deſpiſe the grace offered vnto them. By this ought wee alſo to learne, to ſee ſuch thinges which are moſt profitable, and wholeſome vnto vs: and which bring vs the neareſt way to put our truſt in God, and to loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for that part of the play is ours. As for vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and contentious queſtions, if we meddle not with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the leſſe diuiſion, and the more loue and edifieng in the Church of God ſhall follow. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times are wee too much carefull, for ſuch things as wee deſire our ſelues: as what ende this thing or that will come vnto, when God will ſet vp our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, and what ſhall bee done hereafter, when and how God will puniſh thoſe that are againſt vs. And this temptation, carnall zeale, and curioſitie, chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth oft euen in the hearts of the faythfull: as we ſee heere in the Diſciples of Chriſt. Sometimes there bee froward and wicked mindes, which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bee Chriſtians, ſeeke out of the Goſpell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but honour, lucre, and profite. but ſuch bee both falſe and fained. Notwithſtanding (all theſe ſet apart) wee ought to commit and refer all things vnto our mercifull creator and gracious father, who can right well order and diſpoſe them, how &amp; when he will, as he thinketh beſt to further his glorie, and to edifie his elect children. Our care ought rather to bee, how we may lead a godly life, and beautifie the faith of Chriſt with good woorkes. Wee muſt looke, that wee bee neither vngodlie, nor hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:
<pb facs="tcp:22982:127"/>
but to liue vertuouſly and innocently in his ſight, and paciently at his hande to wayte for our deliuerance. The kingdome of Chriſt that is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and offered through the Goſpell, is not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall but a ſpirituall kingdome: neither conſiſteth it in outward things, but in a pure and faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing heart, and yet reacheth it throughout the whole worlde, and amongſt all nations. In the hearts of all faithfull beleeuers doth Chriſt raigne through his ſpirite, and there ouercommeth hee the deuill, ſinne, and death.</p>
                  <p>And to the intent they ſhoulde well vnderſtande this kingdome, he commaundeth them to waite for the holy ſpirite, whom he had promiſed them: as if he would ſay; Now goe I to my Father, now enter I into my kingdome, that I may mightily raigne vpon the earth: this thing yee vnderſtand not, but when the ſpirite is giuen you, yee ſhall perceyue it well. All thinges in heauen and in earth, are giuen into my power: In thoſe that are mine ſhall I raigne, and make them righteous through fayth: yea inuincible ſhall I make them againſt all enemies: heereof ſhall yee beare witneſſe when yee are baptized through the holie Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>This my kingdome ſhall ye publiſh in all nations, from one ende of the world to another. Thus ſhall I raigne from ſea to ſea, of the which my kingdome the Prophetes ſpake ſo much before. Of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome dooth Chriſt take poſſeſſion through his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending vp to the Father, at whoſe right hande, and in this kingdome hee ſitteth: raigning much more
<pb facs="tcp:22982:128"/>
mightily in his Church, and working more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in thoſe that be his, than hee did before when he liued yet corporally with him.</p>
                  <p>Thus taking his leaue, hee giueth them louing wordes, comforteth them, and admoniſheth them of their office, that they all may be diligent therin, that they continually direct and lift vp their heartes into that kingdome. and that they take in hand to bring all men to the ſame into the obedience of Chriſt. His bleſſing hee giueth them, ſaluting them, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good, and praying hartily vnto his Father for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus was hee taken from them, and carryed into heauen. By the heuen we vnderſtand the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible light in the which God dwelleth: &amp; which no mortall man can attaine vnto. From thence came Chriſt vnto vs, and thither is hee gone againe, euen into the inuiſible glorie and clearenes of God. For the eternall worde and power of GOD, dwelling in Gods incomprehenſible light from euerlaſting, became man: and had his conuerſation vpon earth in all partes (ſinne excepte) as a verie true man. But when hee had fullie finiſhed and throughly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worke that was giuen him in commiſſion of his heauenly Father, and had obeyed him euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death, for as much as in all thinges hee had honoured and glorified his Father vppon earth: it was conuenient that the Father alſo ſhoulde glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Sonne. And therefore rayſed hee him from death, and tooke him vp into heauen: not after the Godhead (for ſo was hee alwaies in heauen) but
<pb facs="tcp:22982:128"/>
after the manhoode. For his true humane nature which hee tooke vppon him for our ſakes, is carryed and taken vp out of this world into the inuiſible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie, into the higheſt incomprehenſible, and into the perfect fruition of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>In this honour and glorie Chriſt dwelleth and raigneth, and yet amongſt thoſe that are his, doth he finiſh and performe all things by his ſpirite, hauing gouernance in the harts of the faithfull, through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, through loue, through patience, and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of life.</p>
                  <p>To the intent now that this kingdome might be erected in the hearts of men, it was neceſſarie that he ſhould giue his diſciples commiſſion to publiſh the ſame, and to prepare mens minds thervnto through the preaching of the Goſpell. But firſt hee made the mindes of his diſciples readie and apt to receiue the holy ghoſt, whom he afterwards poured into others by them, and therefore he commaunded them (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſpirite appeare and open the worke) to waite ſtill at Hieruſalem: from the which place the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt was afterwardes planted in all the world. Of the promiſe of the ſpirite, reade Eſay. 44. Iere. 31. Ezech. 36. Ioel. 2. Iohn. 19.16.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering that the myſterie of Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great and excellent, and that there is notable power contained therein to thoſe that be faithful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers: the Euangeliſts doe therefore deſcribe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie perfectly, the time, the place, the perſons, with all circumſtances and aſſured teſtimonies thereof. Hee aſcendeth vp before his diſciples, that they might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb facs="tcp:22982:129"/>
and euidently ſee it with theyr eyes: there did appeare Angels, as meſſengers and witneſſes from heauen, euen two of them, that in the mouth of two all trueth might bee eſtabliſhed. The white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell ſignifieth the euident glorie, into the which Chriſt is taken vp, as a noble, royall, and mightie king and conquerour, entring into his heauenlie kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Thus the high and glorious king, cloathed with our nature, is entred into our royall pallace, as one that mindeth faithfully to diſpatch our matters. Hee is our owne mediatour and aduocate in the preſence of the Father: notwithſtanding our ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee haue a free entraunce vnto GOD by him. Our fleſh hath hee in himſelfe carryed vp, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our nature vnto the right hande of GOD the Father. Wherefore wee that are bones of his bones and fleſh of his fleſh, doe iuſtly conceyue a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and aſſured hope, that our mortall bodyes alſo ſhall bee taken vp, and haue immortall and eternall ioye.</p>
                  <p>The earneſt pennie of his ſpirite hath hee giuen and left behinde him vnto vs, and contrariwiſe hee hath of vs taken an earneſt pennie and pledge: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſinfull and wicked fleſh, which hee in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath carryed vp into the kingdome of heauen. Nowe where the parcell is, there ſhall alſo bee the whole ſumme.</p>
                  <p>By this, wee that are fleſh and bloud, haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and aſſured truſt, that in Chriſt wee ſhall haue the poſſeſſion and inheritaunce of heauen. Our
<pb facs="tcp:22982:129"/>
ſinnes in him are recompenced, heauen in him is opened, in him is the hope of immortall life ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made ſure vnto vs: Chriſt the victorious &amp; glorious conquerour is able to defend his church. So that from henceforth no man ſhall haue power, to condemne his elect and faithfull beleeuers. <hi>Rom. 8. Heb. 5.7.8.10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That his fleſh is with-drawne from vs, and taken into heauen: it is our great profite, to the intent that all our deuotion and Gods ſeruice may bee directed vpwardes in the ſpirite: and that the mindes of faythfull beleeuers maye bee drawne from earthlie vnto heauenly thinges, euen vnto the place where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hande of GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſciples ſawe that theyr Schoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was taken away from them into heauen: they perceiued and conſidered the thing that they knewe not before, although Chriſt had told it them. <hi>Iohn. 6.</hi> Namely, that by the Aſcenſion they ſhould receyue vnderſtanding. Therefore they worſhipped Ieſus Chriſt, and according vnto his commaundement, they returned to Hieruſalem: where they kepte themſelues vntill the time that the ſpirite came: neyther were they idle, but continued in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fellowſhippe and godlie exerciſes, with praier and deuotion, preparing and making themſelues readie vnto the comming of the ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>By occaſion heereof (all niceneſſe, curioſitie, and contentious queſtions, all pride, vaine-glorie, and fonde affections and deſires ſette aparte) wee
<pb facs="tcp:22982:130"/>
ought with vpright mindes, and with the eyes of faith to be alway taken vp into heauen, and there to haue our dwelling, where Chriſt our head ſitteth at the right hand of God, king and Lord of all thinges, our faithfull aduocate and mediatour. Then ſhall true godlyneſſe increaſe, then ſhall vertue bleſſedlie grow and bring forth fruit in vs, if wee with ſteadfaſt faith doe conſider, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt dyed for our ſakes, roſe againe from death, and is exalted at the right hand of God, raigning mightily aboue all things in heauen, and finiſhing our ſaluation, if wee in ſpirite and in the truth worſhip and honour him, as the eternal God: confeſſing with a true faith, that all power is giuen vnto him of God the father, that he careth for vs, and that for our healths ſake hee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and ſhall raigne, vntill all things be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet. In the meane time he dayly in his church purifieth al his members by his ſpirit, cleanſing them ſtill more and more from all their ſinnes. And when hee ſhall haue rooted out all ſinne in his elect, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming death the laſt enemie, ſo that God ſhall be all in all, then ſhall Chriſt alſo giue vp his kingdome vnto God the father, namely, the mediation for our ſinnes, the purging of the ſame, defence againſt the deuill, and deliueraunce from death. For then ſhall there be no more ſinne in the elect, ſo that he ſhal not need to be mediator for them, to purge from ſinne, to defend againſt the deuil, or to deliuer from death.</p>
                  <p>Oh mercifull father, graunt vs perfectly to know thy bleſſed and glorious kingdome of Chriſt thy ſonne, drawe vp our hearts in ſuch ſort, that we with
<pb facs="tcp:22982:130"/>

Not that God is cloſed or ſhut in with things of men, but that celeſtiall and heauenly things forſoorth vnto vs by ſuch as bee earthly, might be of vs the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For els euery man of knowledge wotteth well, that the holy Ghoſt is not a dooue, neither a winde, a tongue, fire, nor water: For GOD is not a thing corporall, neither a thing that can bee felt or comprehended, with outward ſenſes. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things inuiſible are the better knowen and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of vs, when they be ſet forth and repreſented by viſible thinges: namely, by ſuch as haue ſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with the inuiſible and ſpiritual things: And (ſo farre as naturall things may ſet foorth heauenlie matters) doe perfectly deſcribe before our eies, the nature and propertie of them. Therefore doth the ſpirite appeare in the fourme of firie tongues, and with a ſound, that thereby the two principall ſenſes of man might bee mooued, namely, his hearing and ſeeing: for the ſound toucheth the eares, and the fire mooueth the ſight.</p>
                  <p>Like as Chriſt alſo in the ſupper with bread and wine, to mooue the outward ſenſes of man: thought to repreſent his body and bloud. For by bread is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnto vs, the true body of Chriſt which died for vs vppon the croſſe, and by wine the bloud that was ſhed for our ſinnes, which true fleſh and bloud,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:134"/>
they that beleeue, doe at the ſupper eate and drinke through faith. By the which foode and ſuſtenance, their ſoules are vpholden to the gratious and eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Thus with exterior tokens it pleaſed the wiſedom of God, to guide the outward ſenſes of his Diſciples into the obedience of faith, and vnder the ſame, to ſignifie and declare the ſtrength &amp; operation of the holie Ghoſt. For like as the winde bloweth through the whole earth, piercing, moouing and altering all priuie and ſecrete places: Euen ſo the ſpirit of God goeth through all things, ſearching all ſecret corners and inward mindes of men. Mightily alſo hee woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in mens hearts, kindling and chaunging them. He is the cleare, pure, and hote fire, that conſumeth all filthines of ſinne, inſpiring mens harts, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them vpward to God.</p>
                  <p>Without this ſpirit may a man worke no fruitfull thing, yea thinke no good thing: For man is nothing but fleſh, neither conſidereth hee of himſelfe ought that is ſpirituall or godly, but onely carnall thinges. Foraſmuch now as the wiſeſt &amp; moſt gratious God, knoweth this ſo to bee, whereas hee hath made man his creature, to haue fruition of himſelfe: he wil not ſuffer him to corrupt in the fleſh, but giue him his owne holie ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>God the father, through Chriſt his eternal word, did ſhape man out of the mould of the earth, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him after his owne ſimilitude and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that the noble man who at the firſt was of God, ſo faire and goodly faſhioned and beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſimilitude of God: became after ſinne like vnto the deuill, filthie, and ſhamefull, yea altogether carnall, hauing nothing more of the ſpirite in him, as the ſcripture in the booke of creation teſtifieth.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.</note> For as much now as the miſerable man was degenerate from the noble, ſpirituall, and godly nature, to an vncleane, carnall, and diueliſh diſpoſition, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming altogether fleſh: hee was able no more ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thinke or woorke any ſpirituall or godlie thing.</p>
                  <p>All his thoughts and imaginations are carnall, in that he is fallen into eternall death, and hath loſt the life of the ſpirite: for the affections and luſtes of the fleſh are death; but the deſires of the ſpirite are life and peace.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The affections of the fleſh are enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, for the fleſh is not ſubiect vnto the lawe of GOD, neyther can bee: they therefore which are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe GOD.

                  <p>THE eternall wiſedome hath indued all good minds diligently to learne and ſearch the thing wherein they thinke to finde that which they deſire: and what can be more worthie to be deſired, or more acceptable to the mind of man, than eternal life and ſaluation, which onely conſiſteth in God the higheſt good of all. Now was the ſacred ſcripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the holie Ghoſt, that man thereby might bee guided and lead vnto ſaluation, and to moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent felicity. For they that exerciſe themſelues in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcripture, ſtudying and peruſing it, ought thus to doe; euen to direct themſelues and others vnto life. Therefore by the ordinance of God, there hath been euer men in all nations, which to inſtruct others, haue applyed themſelues to the ſcripture: as among the Iewes wee finde Leui, of whome in the Prophet Malachie it is written,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> that the lawe of the truth was in his mouth, and no wickednes in his lippes, that he
<pb facs="tcp:22982:137"/>
walked before God in peace and equitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted many from vngodlines: for the lippes of the Prieſt are ſure of knowledge, and the law is required at his mouth, for hee is a meſſenger of the Lorde of hoſts. Thus as it may wel be coniectured, there were at Ieruſalem congregations of learned men, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed themſelues in the holy ſcripture. For though all wiſedome come of God (as the fountaine &amp; wel) &amp; no man can be learned whom God himſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not: yet will not he giue his grace, ſpirite, and knowledge, to the idle, ſlouthfull, and vnthankfull, neither to the proud, but vnto thoſe that with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; feare of God practiſe themſelues in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that applying vnto feruent praier, doe not deſpiſe the meanes and gratious giftes granted them of God.</p>
                  <p>And if any man will ſay, that all falſhood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, all erroneous doctrine and diſcorde were come into the church by ſuch as be learned, let him conſider, that the thing which in himſelfe is good, ought not for the abuſes ſake to bee refuſed, remoue the abuſe, and then the thing is good and profitable. Wine is a profitable and wholeſome thing, created of GOD for the behoofe of man, and is neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed of any witty man to bee euill, becauſe many doe abuſe it, and is drunken: Euen ſo is holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and other profitable ſciences, to be eſteemed as high giftes, although many men puft vp with pride, blinded in couetouſnes, and intangled with other affections, haue miſuſed the ſame ſcriptures.</p>

Churches, and Monaſteries, haue highly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pope and his falſe faith, and by falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſcripture brought him ſo farre, that the doctrine of the faith and Chriſt is vtterly darkened. Now whereas lewd learned with falſe ſcience, with wrong vnderſtanding of ſcripture, haue broght ſuch high thinges, great goodes, and plentifull riches to paſſe, drawing ſo much people vnto themſelues: we ought not therefore to ceaſe from reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of the ſcripture, but to take vppon vs to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true religion, and fayth of Chriſt, and to ſette it foorth againe with no leſſe diligence than they doo theirs. If wee will that the true fayth of Chriſt ſhall growe, continue, and increaſe, then wee muſt bring the ſame to paſſe by true vnderſtanding of the ſcripture, by pure, ſounde, and wholeſome doctrine. With the trueth muſt lyes bee baniſhed, with ſound doctrine muſt falſe bee rooted out, with the light muſt darkneſſe bee expelled. But how can the true vnderſtanding of the ſcripture, the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wholeſome, and ſound doctrine bee had: when men doo neyther exerciſe and imploy themſelues, nor applye theyr endeuour, ſtudie, and diligence therein?</p>
                  <p>All the charges therefore and expences, which heretofore haue been beſtowed vpon the vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and noiſome learned men, ought now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to godly Colleges and ſtudies, to the intent that litle ſeeds which God hath laid vp in yong wits, may fruitfully growe, be planted and brought forth.

Cor. 1. Math. 11.</note> the wiſedome of God, and preaching of the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, is but a deriſion and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But bleſſed are they that in the ſinglenes of their heart, with pure minds in meeknes, obedience, and in the true feare of God, ſubmit themſelues vnto his doctrine:<note place="margin">Math. 11. Luk. 24.</note> from them cannot God hide himſelf, but openeth their mindes, that they may vnderſtand the ſcriptures. For they that of a good mind do here aske the queſtion; What meaneth this? are afterwardes conuerted by Peters preaching. Peter the feruent Diſciple of Chriſt, the faithful ſhepheard of Chriſts ſheepe, as ſoone as he receiueth the ſpirit, is bolde to ſteppe foorth, and to confeſſe him, whom before he had denied.</p>
                  <p>But firſt hee perſwadeth that the Diſciples were not drunken; for if ſuch vice were in the Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; they truly conuinced thereof, it ſhould bring vnto the Goſpell and name of Chriſt, great hinderaunce, ſtaine his doctrine, &amp; make it to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed and ſubiect. Moſt diligent therefore ought we to bee, in keeping vs from ſuch vices, whereby our office, mniiſtration, and doctrine, might bee ſuſpect and ſet at naught. Yet muſt we not deferre too long
<pb facs="tcp:22982:139"/>
in aunſwering ſuch euill reports; for more diligence muſt we apply in ſetting foorth the name and glorie of GOD, than in defending and maintaining our owne eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtle Peter in anſwering that obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning drunkennes, dooth ſhortly paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſaith: Brethren, theſe are not drunken, as ye ſuppoſe, for why the time doth not permit, it is yet too earely in the morning. Immediately vppon the ſame, he proceedeth forth, to admoniſh them of the excellent graces and gifts, which the God of mercie had promiſed before, and now performed them. But this ſatisfaction concerning drunkennes, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ignorant, is made with all meeknes, and yet with ſinceritie and ſtedfaſtnes, not lordly, or braggingly; although he was highly endewed with the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus we that be Miniſters of Chriſt, and teachers of his congregations, ought not by reaſon of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or high giftes, to take too much vppon vs, that with bragging or arrogancie wee would outface the weake: but worthily and valiantly with ſinceritie &amp; truth of the ſcripture, to inſtruct ſuch as be ignorant and out of the way. Our mouth is an inſtrument of the holy Ghoſt, and of the truth, not of any lightnes, bragging, or preſumption.</p>
                  <p>This word prophecie is taken not onely to tell &amp; ſhew before of godly and high thinges, but alſo to harken vnto the ſame, and to perceiue them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; this maketh for the vnderſtanding of this place. For the holy Ghoſt declareth by Ioel, and promiſeth alſo (as

This is the deare and excellent treaſure, which in ſtead of it that was giuen before by the incarnation of Chriſt, is now offered, that the knowledge of God, which by the holy Ghoſt is the preaching of the Goſpell, is come forth into all the world,<note place="margin">Pſal. 75.

before: by the which holy Ghoſt, the captiuitie of of the law and ceremonies is taken away, &amp; heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freedome giuen to the children of God.</p>
                  <p>For as much as to know Chriſt &amp; his kingdome, it miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eth true godlines and eternall life: Peter in his oration trauelleth eſpecially to this end, that the Iewes being there preſent, which helde Chriſt for a wicked doer, and put him to death, might know him to be the true ſauiour of the world, and to be riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from death: and therefore hee alleadgeth the prophecies which in Chriſt were fulfilled. As if I would ſay, Behold Ioel tolde before of the time that theſe your children ſhould prophecie, now ye ſee it performed in them: whereby ye may well perceiue that the kingdome of Meſſias (which is a ſpirituall thing) is now begun already. In the which kingdom muſt bee not onely Iewes (which haue the outward temple &amp; ceremonies) but all as call vpon the name of the Lord, whereſoeuer they be in the world. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iew was promiſed a ſauiour, neuertheles ſuch one as ſhuld not onely ſaue them, but alſo the whole world, and whoſe kingdome ſhould be euerlaſting, that hee alſo ſhould deliuer and bring them, yea all mankind, from the captiuitie of the prince of this world. Of theſe things there were amongſt the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh people many ſignes and figures, whereby in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and corporall thinges God did partly ſet foorth theſe thinges ſpirituall: which they alſo which are ſpirituall and elect amongſt the people of the Iewes, vnderſtood right well (though darkely) in that they with the eyes of inward fayth had a further reſpect
<pb facs="tcp:22982:141"/>
than to gaze onely vppon the outwarde corporall things. Thus God the holie Ghoſt by viſible thinges lead and taught them (euen as a yong ſcholler is firſt taught by letters and ſyllables vnder the ſchoolmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) vntill the time that the glorious kingdom came that in Chriſt the true Meſſias, all things were refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and became ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Thus had the Iewes the corporall kingdome of Dauid and of other kinges, and thus for their ſinnes they were brought vnto Babylon into captiuity. By the which captiuitie was figured the greeuous bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldome of mankind, vnder the violent power of the deuill. But when they were in captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at Babylon, God comforting them by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, promiſed to bring them thence, and to reſtore them to their owne land: in the which deliuerance was figured the redemption of the world by Chriſt. This cuſtome had all the Prophets, that when they told the people before hand, and promiſed of Gods behalf, deliuerance out of the captiuity before they came into it: they alwaies made mention alſo of the puniſhment of the ſinnes that ſhould go before. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie ſhall come (ſaid they) but firſt there muſt bee an horrible plague for ſinne, the iuſtice of God muſt firſt be ſatisfied. Thus doth Ioel heere alſo, in whom partly we learne, that God will not ſuffer our ſinnes to paſſe without puniſhment, as wee ſee alſo in the greeuous captiuity of all mankinde, that God will haue the ſinne ſo worthily ſatisfied, that euen his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſonne, by whom no ſinne was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt therefore die, and by his innocent death

thereby vnto the Iewes, to ceaſe from theyr vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and ſhamefull life: declaring vnto them, that if they proceed foorth in wickednes, it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them, as it did before vnto theyr forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vnto whome Ioel opened the puniſhment of God. Whereby wee muſt learne, paciently to beare it, and to take it in good part, when our ſinnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, our vices ſpoken againſt, and we told that the puniſhment is at hande. For this cuſtome had the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their preaching and declaring of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that they not onely made mention of the grace of God offered vnto the world by Chriſt: but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall likewiſe, they threatned ſore puniſhment to thoſe that eyther deſpiſed ſuch excellent grace, or hauing knowledge of the truth did cleaue vnto vice, which thing in the worde of Peter is yet more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpell alſo preacheth amendment of lyfe, and not remiſſion of ſinnes onely through the bloud of Chriſt. But nowe at this preſent time there bee many dainty Chriſtians, as certaine Princes and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the countreys, and citties, whoſe opinion is, that the grace of the Goſpell is to bee preached, yea, and they permit Chriſt and his grace, gently &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to be ſpoken of: but if the falſe Gods ſeruice, as the honoring of Images, and all that is crept in and erected vp in the Papiſtry agaynſt Gods word be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, or if the preacher ſpeake agaynſt theyr ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, vniuſt actes, theyr malitious violence and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, whereby they oppreſſe poore widowes and fatherleſſe children, dooing right vnto no man, or if
<pb facs="tcp:22982:142"/>
the preacher touch them on the gald backs for their exceſſiue pompe and pride, for their rioting, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, adulterie, gluttony, drunkennes, fighting, and extortion, if ſuch vices (I ſay) wherein they ſtill lead their liues, be touched to the quicke, then is all fauor gone, then burne theſe preachers (ſay they) drowne them, they be ſeditious fellowes, they will ſet vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the eares, and bring the common people in our necks. But ſuch men ſhould conſider, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this office of the preacher it belongeth to crye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vice, leaſt he bee called of God a blind watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a dumbe dogge,<note place="margin">Eſay. 56.57. Ezech. 5.</note> and leaſt all the ſoules which periſh through his ſilence be required at his handes: their wilfulnes, pride, and vaine lyfe they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and reforme themſelues, and ſo needed not the preacher to crye out agaynſt them. Now conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Prophets vſed (as I ſaid before) to make mention of the kingdome of Ieſu Chriſt, and of the calling of the heathen to the grace and knowledge of God, eſpecially in their orations when they ſpeak of captiuity, and deliuerance from the ſame. Ioel in his prophecie doth alſo keepe that order. For ſeeing that the Iewes were euer ſtill continually as ſtifnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, rebellious, and vnbeleeuing people, vnthankful to the grace of God: the holy Ghoſt foreſawe theyr reiection, declaring it by the Prophets, and that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people, namely the heathen, ſhould bee recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their ſtead. For in as much as they deſpiſed the grace of God, which firſt was offered vnto them, it was meet that the kingdome of God ſhould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and giuen to another nation. Seeing
<pb facs="tcp:22982:143"/>
they thought ſcorne to come to the marriage, &amp; to the royall feaſt whereunto they were bidden, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued others to be called vnto the ſame. Therfore is Peter earneſt vpon this ſentence: Whoſoeuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued. As if he would ſay; O ye Iewes, bragge not of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of Abraham, of the temple, or of other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, thinke not that ye onely are the people of God, the time is now come, that God wil beſtow his grace vpon thoſe whom ye eſteeme to bee vncleane. God is no accepter of perſons, but among all people who ſo calleth vpon him ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſentence dooth Peter now take occaſion more manifeſtly to ſpeak of the kingdom of Chriſt: for much more pithily, and with more euidence doth the Apoſtles deſcribe the kingdome of Chriſt, than do the Prophets. Who ſo calleth vppon Gods name, muſt knowe God: Now can no man knowe God but by Chriſt: Therefore in this little worde (to call vpon the name of the Lorde) is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole ſumme of the Chriſtian faith. Like as oftentimes in the Prophets, bee theſe: to ſweare by God, is contained his whole religion. But foraſmuch as the Iewes knew not Chriſt, by whome commeth the true knowledge of God, therfore beginneth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and declareth with ſtrong argumentes, how the name of God is to be called vpon: namely, through true faith in Chriſt, who is the true Meſſias, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed king and ſonne of God, which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Prophets. This doth Peter prooue by the ground of the reſurrection of Chriſt from death, by
<pb facs="tcp:22982:143"/>
his aſcenſion into heauen, and by that he now ſitteth at the right hand of God, Lord &amp; king of al things. Firſt let vs heare the text.</p>

                  <p>TO the intent now that no man ſhould bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the death and croſſe of Chriſt: Peter ſheweth firſt, that in the councel of God it was concluded, foreſeene, and determined, that the ſon of God, the true Meſſias, ſhould and muſt die: and how that the ſame ſacrifice was ordained from the beginning of the world, to bee ſlaine and offered vp vpon the croſſe for our ſins. And that no man ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:22982:144"/>
make any ſtoppe by reaſon of his death, Peter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declareth, that he was no miſſe-doer, which had deſerued his death by any tranſgreſſion, but that hee was ſent vnto vs by GOD the father, to dye for vs; whereby we might perceiue the loue of our Father in heauen. And if they now would thinke; well, if it were ſo concluded in the councell of God, then are not we guiltie of his death? hee aunſwereth vnto the ſame, &amp; ſayth; Vnrighteous men broght him therto, &amp; it is ye your ſelues that ſlew him &amp; crucified him. As if he would ſay, yea euen ſo behoued it to be, that the righteouſnes of God for the ſinne of mankinde, might be ſatisfied. Chriſt muſt needs die, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and waſh away with his bloud the ſinne of all the world. And yet yee Iewes which haue betrayed Chriſt, and brought him to the croſſe, are not vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed: yee cannot through the fore ordinance of God diſcharge your ſelues that ye be without ſin, ſeeing ye haue ſlaine the ſauiour of the worlde, hee being guiltles. By this now we learne, that when we do wrong and euill, wee may not excuſe our ſelues, with the free ordinaunce of God, for it is not God, but the deuill and our owne wickednes that prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And heere we ſee, that when the grace of GOD through the Goſpell is offered vnto the worlde, the ſinne and vice alſo wherein the worlde is intangled, muſt be ſpoken of and touched, for no man can bee iuſtified, and come to the helth of his ſoule through Chriſt, which doth not firſt know &amp; confeſſe his ſin &amp; wickednes. How can he be made whole, that will
<pb facs="tcp:22982:144"/>
will not know his owne diſeaſe and ſicknes? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Peter ſette before their eyes their great ſin which they had committed againſt the innocent ſonne of God, ſaying: The innocent and righteous whom God had giuen vnto you, haue ye ſlaine and crucified, which is a great wickednes &amp; ſinne. Now go to, on your behalfe it was euill done, and greuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly offended, but on his behalfe it was ſo ordayned before. Therefore at his death, which in the ſight of the world was ſo ſhamefull and vile, yee ought not to bee offended, that yee therefore would holde the leſſe of him, or not receiue and know him for a ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For if you looke vpon his former conuerſation, the ſame was innocent, pure, and holie: therefore cannot yee doubt but hee was ſent of God. Beſides this, ye haue perceyued and ſeene God to be euerie where in his workes: for the tokens and wonders which hee ſhewed and declared amongſt you, giue euident knowledge that God was in him, &amp; wroght in him preſently, for no man had beene able to doe the tokens that he did, vnleſſe God had beene with him. Which tokens alſo were ſpoken of before by the Prophets concerning Chriſt, and by thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens muſt ye know and confeſſe, that he is euen the true Meſſias, of whom the Prophets ſpake. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidering that by his former doctrine &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, ye knowe that hee is the true Meſſias, yee ought not to bee offended that hee as an euill dooer was crucified vpon the croſſe; for it was the ſpeciall determination of God, that Meſſias ſhould be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, according to the foreſayings of the Prophets.
<pb facs="tcp:22982:145"/>
Conſider yee alſo, that the Prophets likewiſe ſpake of his reſurrection from death, by the which ye may well perceiue that he is the true Meſſias.</p>
                  <p>Thus earneſt is Peter, beating into them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, and that out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For Chriſts reſurrection from death, is a ſtrong argument to proue his godhead, as it is taught. <hi>Rom. 1. Iohn. 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea he died (ſaith Peter) for our ſinnes, but nowe he is aliue and riſen againe from death: death hath no more power ouer him, for he liueth for euer, and his kingdome is euerlaſting. Yea vnpoſſible it was, that the ſonne of God ſhould corrupt in the earth &amp; ſepulchre: namely, he that is the firſtling riſen from the dead, and that from his owne godly power. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe wordes of Peter concerning the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and life of Chriſt, were little credited among the Iewes: he alleadgeth the 15. pſalm of Dauid, who amongſt them was in great reputation.</p>
                  <p>But now might the Iewes ſay or thinke, Dauid ſpeaketh theſe words of himſelfe, and not of Chriſt: that weapon therefore dooth Peter take from them, and proueth, that the ſame words may in no wiſe be referred vnto Dauid; but that Dauid as a Prophet hauing knowledge of things to come, ſpake them of Chriſt, in whom they be now fulfilled, and thus hee ſaith.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of one whoſe fleſh ſhould not corrupt; now could not hee haue ſpoken this of himſelfe, for his fleſh corrupted in the ſepulchre, which wee yet haue, and his bones lie yet in the ſepulchre, by the which it may well bee perceiued, that Dauid as a Prophet knowing of things to come, ſpake of another, which ſhould bee borne out of his owne loynes and ſeede,<note place="margin">Pſal 88. 2.

And this king is Chriſt the true Meſſias, who as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fleſh was borne of the ſeede of Dauid, and is his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>If this ſonne now of Dauid had after death remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in death, and not riſen from death againe, how could hee then raigne for euer? It is euident therefore, that Dauid out of the holy Ghoſt (who had opened this vnto him) prophecied it of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt his ſonne, the eternall king. For
<pb facs="tcp:22982:146"/>
though hee as a verie man died indeede vppon the croſſe, and was then buried: yet his ſoule or life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained not in death: neither did his body reſolue into corruption as other mens, but on the third day he roſe again from death to life. This muſt we needs teſtifie: for after his reſurrection he appear doſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. We ſaw him, we heard him, we handled him, we did eate and drinke with him. Heere wee learne, that the Saintes in the old Teſtament, vnderſtood &amp; knew by faith, the reſurrection and eternal kingdom of Chriſt, ſeeing they prophecied of it ſo euidently.

Let vs thankfully receiue ſuch excellent grace (deare brethren) being ware, that we ſtain not the temple of Ieſus Chriſt, and of his holy ſpirit with filthineſſe of the worlde, that wee neuer make our ſelues partakers in the iniquitie of wicked and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe men, but to leade here a pure and cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with a good conſcience before GOD our moſt louing father, and alwaie lift vp our minds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place, where Chriſt our Lord and king raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at the right hand of God,<note place="margin">Col. 1</note> from whence he ſhall come and take vs vnto himſelfe. At all times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought we to watch and wait for his comming, that we may ioyfully receiue him, and bee partakers with him in eternall bliſſe.</p>
                  <p>Heere alſo we learne, how faithfull beleeuers vſe themſelues in the outward Sacraments. They that being moued by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt in theyr hearts, doo heare the eternall word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, giuing credite vnto it, &amp; gladly receiuing it, theſe doo not afterward deſpiſe the outward Sacraments, which GOD hath inſtituted for the welfare of his Church: but vſe the ſame with all obedience, good will and reuerence. To vſe the Sacraments without faith profiteth not, but rather hurteth: to be loth to vſe them, declareth a compulſion and vnbeleefe.</p>
                  <p>For though the water in baptiſme be an outward thing, and cannot cleanſe the ſoule from ſinne, yet the faithfull doo know right well, that Chriſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſedome in whom they beleeue, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb facs="tcp:22982:149"/>
it in vaine, and therefore will not they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne or leaue vnexerciſed the ordinance of theyr head, to whome they as members are incorporated by faith. For they knowe, that Chriſt with theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde tokens, thought to couple and knit together the members of his holy Church, in obedience and loue one towards another, whereby they knowing one another among themſelues, might by ſuch exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, ſtirre and prouoke one another to loue and godlyneſſe. They know alſo, that the ſacraments are euidences of the promiſe &amp; grace of God, which they after a viſible and palpable manner, do ſet forth declare, and repreſent vnto vs. Theſe tokens of grace doth no man vſe more deuoutly and with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, than he that in himſelfe is certified and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the gracious fauour of God, as we ſee in <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> and in Queene <hi>Candaces</hi> chamberlaine.</p>
                  <p>What fruite followeth the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, it is heere euidently ſeene: for in one daie at Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters preaching, by the working of the holy Ghoſt, there came three thouſand men to the Church of God. God ſuffereth not his word to paſſe voide and vnfruitfull. Verie earneſt therefore &amp; diligent ought we to be, and to ſpare no trauell, coſt, and labor, that the pure and ſincere Goſpell, the word of truth, may euerie where be preached by good and faithful men, not doubting, God wil giue bleſſed ſucceſſe thereto, that the ſeed ſowen by the miniſter, ſhall bring forth fruit.</p>

                  <p>Firſt now doth faith in Chriſt bring forth this fruit in the Church, namely, in faithfull beleeuers, that it draweth them to the doctrine of the truth, by
<pb facs="tcp:22982:150"/>
the which they became beleeuers: and in the ſame it maketh them to continue, that they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearken nor giue credite to anie falſe errro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious doctrine: for they do verie aſſuredly know, that ſuch doctrines are not wholeſome, but veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and hurtfull. But in the Goſpell of our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, and in the doctrine of the holie Apoſtles, they are ſure to finde the truth, which nouriſheth and preſerueth them vnto eternall lyfe.</p>
                  <p>The Church of God abhorreth all vntruth, for ſhe knoweth it is of the deuill: but of the trueth is ſhe deſirous, for ſhe knoweth that the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God, and bringeth vnto GOD againe.</p>
                  <p>This Euangelicall truth and doctrine of the Apoſtles, in the which the Church of God, and all the members of Chriſt muſt continue, hath beene of long time, euen from the beginning, comprehended in certayne Articles, which wee call the Creede, whereof there is ſufficient men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Catechiſme. Among the true children and ſeruauntes of God alſo, there is no ſchiſme, doubt, nor diuiſion, concerning the head and chiefe Articles, in the which they are well and firmely eſtabliſhed, fully perſwaded, and of one minde and conſent.</p>
                  <p>And whereas there be ſome men which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach and goe beyond this marke, willing other men, and compelling Chriſtians, as farre as in them lyeth, thereto, teaching thoſe to bee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
<pb facs="tcp:22982:151"/>
and damned, that cleaue to the onely doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtles. The ſame commeth and proceedeth of the preſumptuous arrogancie of fleſh, who eſteemeth his owne inuention, more than that which God ſpeaketh: As when they ſaie that Images muſt bee had in Churches, that pardons muſt bee bought with money, and ſuch lyke things, which are not grounded in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt nor of the Apoſtles, nor mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Articles of the right and true auncient beleefe, but inuented by the fantaſie &amp; couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing that muſt bee conſtantly and inuiolably kept in the Church of God, is the communion and fellowſhippe, namely, that none looke vnto his owne ſingular profite, that no man ſeeke himſelfe, but that euerie member loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one to another what hee lacketh, ſupplye the ſame, helping him, and comforting him, and giuing him the beſt counſell he can. This friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue and louing fellowſhippe ought to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>All temporall and outwarde goods ought to bee common among them. Not as ſome fondly thinke, that I muſt defraud another of that which is his, or take it agaynſt his will, whether hee wyll or no, or that I ſhoulde goe idlely and loytering, eating and conſuming that which other men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trauaile for, or to thinke, that when I doo ſeruice and am profitable to no man, euery
<pb facs="tcp:22982:151"/>
man ſhall giue and ſerue mee. Chriſtian loue which groweth out of the beleefe and doctrine of the Goſpell, muſt diſtribute the goods and make them common: it muſt not bee anie mans gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deſire, preſumption, nor wilfulneſſe that ſhall doo it.</p>
                  <p>All faithfull beleeuers are one bodie: nowe lyke as in the bodie, one member ſerueth to the profite and wealth of another, ſo ought one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to helpe and ſerue another in loue. The eye looketh not to himſelfe onely, but vnto the whole bodie: the mouth eateth for the whole bodie, and for all the other members: the ſtomacke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth for all the whole bodie, and for all the members. Thus ought it to bee lykewiſe among the ſpirituall members of the bodie of our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt. No man muſt bee wiſe and learned for himſelfe onely: no man ought to be rich for himſelfe, but euerie mannes giftes muſt ſerue to the profite one of another, and to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyfieng and ſuſtaining of the whole bodie. Euery one is bound to ſerue the bodie, according to the gift and meaſure which the ſpirit of God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Among all liuing creatures, there is none created to a more louing and friendly ſocietie and fellowſhippe than man. Heerevnto ſerue all ſciences and handie crafts, that men after a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner agreeing among themſelues, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue one anothers neceſſitie and want, and helpe
<pb facs="tcp:22982:152"/>
beare one anothers burthen. Heereunto ſerue all inwarde giftes of the minde, as reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will, and remembraunce. Alſo the ſpeech giuen of God vnto man, whereby one is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and diſcerned, and made priuie one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore is man borne into this world without anie defence or weapon, bare, naked and feeble: whereas all other creatures liuing in this worlde, bring with them euerie one his weapon and defence. The Beare hath his clawes and teeth, the horſe his hoofe, the oxe his hornes, the hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hegge his prickes, and the ſerpent his poyſon. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Onely man is borne ſmooth and vnweapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to ſignifie, that hee muſt not bee madde, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and terrible, but milde, louing, and gentle, there muſt bee one minde, one meaning, and one will. Man alſo commeth into the worlde bare and naked, weake, feeble, and impotent, not able to doo anie manner of thing to helpe himſelfe, but muſt ſtande vnto the curteſie of another; for if he be not helped, releeued, and ſuccoured, he coulde not chooſe but periſh, there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Whereby almightie God will declare, that there is no man that eyther may or can liue without the helpe and comfort of another. Thus the poore wretched and diſtreſſed childe, lying vppon all foure, (whome if it were not for pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no man woulde take vp, but let it lye ſtill) is helped, nouriſhed, and brought vp of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:152"/>
nourſe, &amp;c. Other folkes muſt cheriſh it, by other folkes helpe muſt it liue, for nothing doeth it bring with it into this worlde wit muſt begge and borrowe euerie thing, and therefore it weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and crieth.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth vs to doo good, to bee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, louing, and thankfull to our parents, and vnto thoſe which bring vs vp and doo cheriſhe vs, that wee recompence them according to our power. By this alſo wee learne to helpe others, and to haue compaſſion of them when they are in need, remembring and conſidering out of what miſerie and pouertie other folks haue helped and brought vs.</p>
                  <p>Who is hee that is at this preſent ſo rich, ſo mightie and ſtrong in this worlde (if hee wyll liue) but hee muſt vſe the helpe and ſeruice of poore and feeble folkes, as the Husbandman, the Miller, the Baker, the Shepheard, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp;c. yea, the higher and greater anie man is in office or authoritie, ſo much the more muſt he vſe and haue the helpe of other people that are not ſo great as himſelfe. Therefore doeth GOD ſette vp ſome ſo high, that they muſt make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion and helpe all thoſe which are ynder them, ſeeing that they muſt haue the vſe of them all. For the poore and they that bee vnder, muſt ſupporte and beare vp the rich and mightie (as pillers doo the houſe) that they fall not: For without the helpe and ſeruice of ſuch, are not
<pb facs="tcp:22982:153"/>
they able to liue in theyr dignitie and calling one daie. Therefore it is ordayned of Almightie God in his ſecrete wiſedome, that certayne Countries lacke ſome things, whereof others haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and too much, that one might bee ſuſtayned by another, and that no man ſhal be inough to him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>GOD hath giuen vnto man remembraunce, to the intent that hee ſhoulde neuer forget the benefites, which hee from his youth vpwardes hath receiued of others, and dayly doth receiue, without the which hee cannot liue. And alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne remember and forget not, howe and in what manner hee ought to behaue himſelfe in loue, in compaſſion, in ſuccour, and in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towardes thoſe that haue anie wayes neede of his helpe. To this is hee moued, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth and pondereth in his thoughts the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, feebleſſe, and neceſſitie of mannes corrupt nature, which conſtraineth vs to lacke ſo manye things.</p>
                  <p>Heereof groweth vnitie, loue, and fellowſhip among men, when we caſt and call to our minds thus: eyther hee hath beene, or is nowe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto vs, or he doth good vnto ours, of whom wee haue profite, or heereafter hee may doo vs ſome good. This to bee ſo, there is not anie man that can denie. And whereas wee perceiue not this, and are not of one minde, friendly and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in loue and good wyll one towardes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:22982:153"/>
but giuen vnto ſuch variaunce, diſſention, ſtrife, and diſcorde, it commeth through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our owne wicked and frowarde natures and diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch now as our eies are ſo blinded, that wee ſee not Gods ordinance and creation in man, our eares are ſo ſtopped, that wee will not heare the playne and perfect voyce of nature: our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and remembrance ſo dull and blunt, that wee will not once regard or thinke anie ſuch thing, whereby wee might the ſooner forſake the diuiſion and ſtiffeneſſe of our heart, and in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnitie and brotherly loue, to doe good one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. Chriſt therefore, the reſtorer of our decayed nature, and the onely true and eternall light, came into this worlde, to illuminate and lighten our blinde eyes, to crie with his voyce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that bee dumbe, and to ſette that agayne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, which wee our ſelues haue made darke and dimme.

The eares doe heare Chriſtes wordes ſpoken by the Miniſter in the perſon of Chriſt Ieſus, by the which the promiſe is renewed, by which meanes thoſe that are his, and of his Church, are by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine feeling and comfort in their ſoules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences refreſhed.
