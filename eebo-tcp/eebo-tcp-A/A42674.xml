            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THis is an abſtract of a Treatiſe written by <hi>Mr. Gheſt,</hi> a learned and pious <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> Divine, when the Uſurpers over: <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Title by Conqueſt.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>COnqueſt is no ſufficient Title to Rule;</hi> for then all Conquerors are lawful Princes; but they are not, for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Juſtice only gives right, and the rule of juſtice is <hi>ſuum cuique,</hi> we are commanded. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. to <hi>Render to all their dues;</hi> but here in the <hi>Caſe of Conqueſt</hi> right is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that, which is anothers, only by taking it from him, and ſo Juſtice founded upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Right continues, as long as the Cauſe remains, and force cannot reach that, for it cannot deſtroy the gift and donation of God, nor bring to paſs, that a Father ſhall be no Father, or an Heir no Heir, or one Lawfully choſen not choſen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Conqueſt be a ſufficient title, then there never was an Uſurper in the world; for, till he prevails, he is but an Attempter, and as ſoon as he prevails, he is a Lawful Prince.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then it would not only be Lawful for the Uſurper to withhold anothers Right, but unlawful for the wronged King, or his friends to ſeek the recovery of his own, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 1.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> did in the caſe of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and <note n="‖" place="margin">2 Kings 11.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If Conqueſt gives a title, then a ſtrong Thief hath right to all he takes away by violence; or elſe God hath left every private man in better condition than his own Deputies <note n="*" place="margin">See Deut. 1. 17.</note>, ſince force can take away the Royalty of theſe, but not the property of thoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If Conqueſt give a ſufficient title, then that deviliſh Maxim is true, Proſperum ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus virtus eſt, <hi>that wickedneſs crowned with proſperity commences virtue;</hi> and there is no difference between good and evil, but event. A Rebel falls, and is a Traytor; he proſpers and is a lawful Prince; which pricks up apace towards Atheiſm.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This proclaims liberty to all ambitious, and covetous perſons to embroyl the world, if whatever they can get is their own. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God, who loves mankind, and delights in order, peace and righteouſneſs, never made this Law.</p>

It ſeems the <hi>Alcoran</hi> hath not been Engliſh'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> indeed all is their own fiſh that comes into the net: but if every attempt crowned with ſucceſs, proves, that God gives a right, then he, who deſtroys the true Religion, and ſets up a falſe; he, who kills, raviſhes, robs, hath right on his ſide; 'tis <hi>par caſus,</hi> unleſs they ſhew, that Event ſhewes God's Will in one thing more than another, which it does not, ſince all comes alike to paſs by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Should it be objected, that this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion muſt be reſtrain'd to Kingdoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe War between thoſe, who have no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour on earth to judge them, is an appeal to God to determine the right: I Anſwer, 1. Then this extends not to Subjects, who have a King to judge them. 2. If it be meant of all thoſe, who acknowledge, or pretend to have no Superiours, then all wicked men may make uſe of it; ſince 'tis but to pretend, and then appeal to God, and, if they prevail, God, it ſeems, gave them leave. 3. 'Tis to throw God's Law (the rule of right, and wrong) behind us, and to tempt him to give a particular ſentence; againſt <hi>Matth. 4. 7. Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> 4. How knows the Objector, that every King, who fights for his own, makes ſuch an ungodly appeal? 5. Suppoſe both parties are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, how knows he, that God is bound to liſten to every preſumptuous Appellant, and give judgment at his beck? the Truth is, Event ſhews no more; but that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it, becauſe he can work good out of it, and fulfil his own wiſe, and juſt, tho' hidden counſel; but to ſay, he approves whatever he permits, is blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond colour is from Scripture, <hi>Dan. 4. 17, 25, 32. The moſt high ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will.</hi> To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. If you mean this of <hi>God's gift of right to rule,</hi> 'tis not ſaid, he giveth it to every one, who is in poſſeſſion, but to whom he pleaſeth. 2. If you mean it of poſſeſſion (and ſo it is to be underſtood, as it appears from verſ. 25. and the whole Context) it follows not, God gives poſſeſſion to whom he will, therefore he gives right, whenever he gives poſſeſſion; the ſcope of all was to cure <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s pride, and to ſhew him, that whoſoever poſſeſſeth a Kingdom, doth it by a Providence which can diſpoſſeſs him. Indeed no one poſſeſſes a Kingdom without ſome gift from God, but 'tis often only permiſſive, it creates no right. Thus <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 10. c. 26. 23.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45287:3"/>
To ſhow what really the people hath to do in the giving title, or right to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we will conſider in general the means of acquiring dominion;—All power is from God, we take that for granted, therefore whoever hath a title, muſt ſhow ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God's will for it; now this in the caſe of Governors muſt be either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſupernatural deſignation, as in <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> the <hi>Judges, Saul, David, Jehu,</hi> &amp;c. or by a general Law, that may hold in all ordinary caſes; (for as to event, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts only God's permiſſion, not his gift, as I ſhew'd before) as for the firſt of theſe, it was good, where it could be ſhown, which now it cannot: The ſecond cannot be any humane Law; for tho' juſt Laws are in their kind, and degree ſignifications of God's will, who will have us obey his Deputies for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, yet in giving title to ſupreme power they have no place. For 1. National laws preſuppoſe it, and are made by it. 2. The law of Nations is either the ſame with the law of Nature, which is God's law, binding all Nations, or if it be taken for a humane law, enacting that, which the law of nature hath left at liberty, 'tis a meer empty name, for there is no humane ſupreme power, to which all Nations are ſubject, that ſhould enact ſuch a law. <hi>Jus gentium</hi> indeed, or <hi>right of Nations</hi> there is, but no <hi>Lex gentium;</hi> one Nation may have right againſt another, either by the law of Nature alone, or by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pacts, which bind by vertue of the law of Nature, <hi>which obliges all to perform their covenants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then none can claim right to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by the Laws of God, and they are two-fold, of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> but both to be uſed here promiſcuouſly; the rule of both is, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> which ſubjects the children to both Parents, but firſt to the Father, as ſupreme; no place is left here for popular election, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that children ſhould chooſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who are in ſubjection as ſoon as they are, and to govern whom the Father hath a natural capacity, even before he hath them.</p>
            <p>In this Paternal right is founded the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of whole Nations, as appears from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 10. 5, 20, 31, 32. where it is often obſerved, <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that by thoſe three ſons of Noah were the nations divided in the earth after their families,</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> which confutes the common dream, that Nations were conſtituted by collection of ſeveral Families into one Maſs, (like <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi>'s world out of Atomes) for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes it clear to have been quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by ſpreading one root into many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 26.) and this will be eaſily believed, when it is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note n="‖" place="margin">Conſ. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</note>, how long they lived in that Age (ſix hundred, four hundred, all even to <hi>Nahor,</hi> above two hundred years) and that <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 6. 16, 18, 20.</note> in four generations from <hi>Levi</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> Seventy <note n="‖" place="margin">Gen. 46. 27.</note> men were multiplied to ſix hundred thouſand, that were men <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 12. 37.</note>, beſides children, and you will ſee, that one of thoſe Fathers might live to be by his meer Paternal power King of a populous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>Thus much of the means of acquiring ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power; now, how far the people's ſubmiſſion can operate towards the making the Conqueror's title good.</p>
            <p>1. While they have a King of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding by paternal right, they have nothing to do either to confer, or transfer that right. 2. Tho', when the people have choſen a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular government, and are lawfully ſetled under it, their ſubmiſſion (perhaps) to the Conqueror may transfer a right (becauſe then they are in two capacities, being both Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns and Subjects, ſo that their ſubmiſſion includes the conſent of all that are intereſſed) yet in other forms of Government, where the people are meer ſubjects, the ſupreme power is not theirs to give, they cannot give away what is another man's, much leſs what is God's, and by his immediate gift confer'd on the lawful King. 3. When people are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of a Government, and chooſe one, the King choſen holds not his power from them, but immediately from God; their choice, 1. proves not, that the King derives his power from them; the wife chooſes her husband, and the Pariſh the Conſtable, yet the firſt hath his power from God, the other from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45287:4"/>
King; and therefore the power not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the people, they cannot reſume or tranſpoſe it, any more than the wife, &amp;c. 2. The people's choice hinders not the King's receiving his power immediately from God, tho' their choice be an inſtrumental act, by means whereof God's power is conveyed to the King's perſon which is choſen, yet it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not, that God firſt inveſts the people with the ſupreme power, and ſeats it inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in them, and that then they derive it to the King in ſubordination to themſelves, as the King doth to an inferior Magiſtrate: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they want a Father by Inheritance, they chooſe and make an Adoptive one, who derives not his power from them, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God by that Law of Nature, which gives the father power over his children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how is this immediately from the Law of Nature, when there comes a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act of man between?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That voluntary Act of the people is not done by virtue of any ſupreme power ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the people, but by allowance of the Law of Nature, which, as other laws, contains in it conceſſions, as well as precepts.</p>
            <p>1. It teacheth, that power to rule is necſſary for the preſerving of mankind, which cannot ſubſiſt but in ſociety, nor that without order and government. 2. It allows us to provide neceſſaries by any means, that may be uſed without impiety againſt God, or injury to man, and therefore to appoint themſelves a King, when they are deſtitute. 3. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to be ſubject to the King thus choſen; ſo that from firſt to laſt this power is founded immediately on the law of Nature; now not only this, but almoſt all the laws of Nature ſuppoſe a voluntary act of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the matter of their precepts and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, &amp; yet bind meerly by their own force. Prayer, oaths, dedications of holy things, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of religion ſuppoſe acts of men to give words their ſignification, to adminiſter and take the oaths, to dedicate the holy things, but yet the precepts commanding the duties, and forbidding the abuſe; bind immediately without any help from humane authority. So theft ſuppoſeth propriety of goods, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſuppoſeth marriage, &amp;c. but yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that prohibit thoſe ſins bind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by virtue of the Divine authority.</p>

In deciding theſe three queſtions, there is great diverſity both of precedents, &amp; humane laws, but 'tis not material, ſince only divine laws can regulate ſuch tranſlations. If God hath given Kings power to diſpoſe of their Kingdoms at pleaſure, they have no Superior upon earth, that can take it from them; if not, they can neither create it themſelves (for there is no power, but by the gift of a Superior, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 11.) much leſs can their ſubjects, being inferiors, give it them.</p>

He cannot deveſt his Heir, for God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns him by making him firſt-born, or next of blood, nor can the father alter his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance any more than his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture; <note n="*" place="margin">Conſ. Joſ. 1. 2. Hebr. 3. 5. Pſ. 89. 20. Jer. 27. 6. Wiſd. 6. 5. Rom. 13. 4, 6.</note> the King is but <hi>God's ſervant,</hi> and ſo cannot make void his Lord's choice; by God's Law the rights of primogeniture are the firſt-born's, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17.) nor can they be taken from him while he lives; even if he deſerves to be deprived, it muſt be a judiciary proceeding that removes him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he wants an Heir, he cannot transfer the inheritance to whom he will without the peoples conſent; they are Sons and not ſlaves, and therefore cannot be alienated at pleaſure, <hi>Joh. 8. 35. The ſervant abideth not in the houſe forever, but the Son abideth ever.</hi> There are three degrees of Dominion. 1. Over goods inanimate or irrational; we may ſell theſe, or deſtroy them, <hi>Matt. 20. 15. 2. Dominium deſpoticum, vel herile,</hi> the dominion over ſlaves, whom we may alienate, but not deſtroy, <hi>Exo. 21. 20, 21. 3. Dominium Regale,</hi> the dominion of Kings over their Subjects, which neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables to deſtroy nor alienate, being inſtead of the paternal; the King can no more make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other King over his ſubiects, than a Father can make another man the father of his children.</p>
            <p>The ſumm is; a King may relinquiſh his power, but not inveſt a ſtranger with it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the Heir, if he have any, or, if he have none, without the peoples accepting the perſon. Poſſeſſion belongs to the King in being, Succeſſion to the Heir in being, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the People, when deſtitute of both, and none can be deprived of their proper due with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own conſent. Indeed (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when the people is both Soveraign, and Subjects, their ſubmiſſion includes all; as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign they may reſign, and then as a body without a head they may chooſe, and no Heir hath any injury; for the body of the people have no Heir.</p>

            <p>Qu. <hi>WHither a long poſſeſſion can make the Conqueror's title good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. 'Tis abſurd to think, that preſcription can juſtifie wrongs; for the rule of Law is, Non confirmatur tractu temporis, quod de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re non ſubſiſtit ab initio, <hi>that no length of time makes that lawful, which was not ſo from the beginning.</hi> 'Tis true,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In time all obſtacles may be removed, and ſo the Uſurper acquire a Title, the right Heirs being all extinguiſh'd, or relinquiſhing their right, and then the peoples ſubmiſſion doth it, but time it ſelf gives no title.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Long poſſeſſion may be, tho' not the ground, yet the proof of a title; but ſuch a proof, as admits of divers exceptions; for if there be a right Heir, that claims, or elſe would claim, but that he wants either notice of his title, or power to make it good, here preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proves nothing; but Poſſeſſion may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long without any claim, or attempts to the contrary, that it may be (tho' no title, yet) a proof, that either the Poſſeſſor is the Heir, or that the People have choſen him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the failing or ceſſion of the Heir; and thus only do man's Laws approve preſcription in private inheritances, not as if they preferred an Uſurper before the right owner, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his claim and proves his title; and this was the caſe between <hi>Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
