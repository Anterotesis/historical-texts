            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Poem, when it was written firſt, was
far from being deſign'd for the Preſs; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent me by my Friend as a Private Letter.
But on the peruſal of it, I found ſomewhat in it
that affected me extremely; which made me (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it might be beneficial to the Public) perſwade
him to let me have it Printed.</p>
            <p>This I ſay, only to free the Authour from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Vanity, which perhaps ſome would be too
apt to lay on him, had he publiſht it himſelf, at a
time, when we have many Good Poets, and moſt
men are (or at leaſt think themſelves) tolerable
Judges.</p>
            <p>It may be eaſily objected againſt ſuch a Poem in
general, that it is of no uſe; ſeeing there has been,
already, ſo many Excellent Treatiſes in Proſe, upon
the ſame Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97881:3"/>
But the Anſwer is as obvious, for there are many,
who have not the Patience to read them over, yet
nevertheleſs will be drawn to a thing of this Nature,
under the Notion of Diverting themſelves.</p>
            <p>But I needed not to ſay this in its Defence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
before me ſo Excellent an Example ſet by the
Ingenious Authour of a late Poem, Entitled, <hi>An
Anatomy of Atheiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to this Eſſay in particular (if I may be allow'd
to give my Thoughts of it) I take it to be as Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
as the Subject will bear; and much more Solid
than the Poetry of our Age (the more's the Pity) is
generally found to be; and I am very much deceiv'd,
if the Reader doth not find in it, the two main Ends
of Poetry, Diverſion, and Information.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more to its Advantage, but ſubmit
it to the Public, wiſhing, that every one who reads
it, may find as much Benefit by it as I did for my
own particular.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>ENough my Friend, of Love and all its Cares,</l>
               <l>Falſe wandring hopes, and true perplexing fears.</l>
               <l>I'le leave the Barren Soil, and try to gain</l>
               <l>A happier Iſle, far diſtant in the main:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97881:4"/>
In which alone, though Storms around it beat,</l>
               <l>My wearied Soul can find a ſafe retreat.</l>
               <l>She's quite fatigu'd by her rough treatment here,</l>
               <l>And by your help a fairer courſe wou'd ſteer.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Religion</hi> now be her ambitious Aim,</l>
               <l>A worthy Object of her growing Flame,</l>
               <l>And which alone deſerves the Love, I paid</l>
               <l>To a miſtaken Goddeſs I my ſelf had made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tell me, by what ſtrange pow'r I was deceiv'd?</l>
               <l>How the falſe Story was by me believ'd?</l>
               <l>That Happyneſs cou'd flow from Earthly Love,</l>
               <l>And thoſe weak Flames not kindled from above.</l>
               <l>Which when they ſhou'd beyond the Clouds aſpire,</l>
               <l>And in our Souls produce a Sacred Fire,</l>
               <l>Grow flat and languid with a meaner Joy,</l>
               <l>In Childiſh Trifles Noble Souls employ,</l>
               <l>Which ne'r can Satisfie, and often Cloy.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97881:4"/>
Yet this I'le grant, no Crimes our Paſſions are,</l>
               <l>While bounded in our Souls by a due Care;</l>
               <l>And 'tis, at leaſt a part of Happyneſs,</l>
               <l>When bounteous Heav'n our juſt deſires doth bleſs.</l>
               <l>But when th' Impetuous Torrent, bears away</l>
               <l>Our Anxious Souls into the Stormy Sea,</l>
               <l>And no fair Banks can tempt us to the Coaſt,</l>

They never dare attack the Nobler part</l>

               <l>Our Souls Eternal Torments muſt endure,</l>

               <l>To reach the Space which our Fore-Fathers knew,</l>

Nay cou'd we ſpin it out to make it ſtretch</l>

               <l>Come to its end it there muſt ceaſe to be,</l>
               <l>Quite ſwallowed up in an Eternity.</l>
               <l>And what proportion has one grain of Sand,</l>

               <l>Times longeſt Date will not ſo much appear,</l>
