            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPon the ſurvey of this Epiſtle to the Right Honourable <hi>Thomas Atkins,</hi> the now Lord Major, &amp;c. I conceived it not amiſſe to adde ſomething more by way of caution; which howſoever it needed not to thoſe that know me, yet being now caſt upon ſtrange men, and ſtrange times, I cannot ſpeak too plainly; be pleaſed then to know, that the men of whom I ſpeak, are not ſuch as are truly (that is, univerſally, charitably and peaceably) conſcionable, nor ſuch as I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtaſte, becauſe they be of a different opinion in ſome things from my ſelfe: No, the Lord keep me from quarrelling men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their light is more or leſſe then mine, if that be all their crime, and from judging their conſcience; whileſt ther's no more in it but conſcience, reaching after further infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, theſe be not the men I meane, but men of another ſpirit, who condemne the things they doe not underſtand, and goe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </note> for that is the thing we muſt grow to; and for this, conſider the grounds in the Text, conſider the perſon now in queſtion, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a poore man, was in a very great ſtreight, faine he would pleaſe God, faine he would ſave his ſoule; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe could be done without a Chriſt, and Chriſt muſt now be beleeved, in a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>cloſer</hi> way then before; it is not enough for him to beleeve, <hi>Christians,</hi> or in <hi>Christs,</hi> but he muſt beleeve that this is <hi>the very Chriſt,</hi> that this is the man and none elſe. Now here ſticks the doubt; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were mightily divided about this point; the Phariſees and thoſe happily that had been meanes of his converſion from heatheniſme to Judaiſme, they were altogether againſt Chriſt, and looked upon him, and reported him as a ſeducer.

            <p>God did heare him to purpoſe, I ſay, heard him graciouſly; and not onely ſo, 2. but he does ſend him <hi>word</hi> that he heard him, and ſent him word too 3. by an <hi>Angel,</hi> and gives him 4. to underſtand, how that his prayer and all his ſervices
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112929:7"/>are <hi>accepted</hi> of God. Oh! what a comfort was this to a poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul, to have ſo punctuall, ſo direct an anſwer ſent him from heaven unto his prayer, and unto his ſcruples! but thus deales God with his Children, never more kind unto his, then when they come unto him begging; then when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be ſhye and ſtrange, and to ſtand off, and to hold off at a diſtance, <hi>then</hi> is God moſt free, moſt open, moſt gracious unto his people; this we ſee in this <hi>Cornelius</hi> here; <q>goe (ſayes God) when he had prayed, goe, ſayes God unto an Angel, commend me to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> tell him from me, that he is more in my bookes then he is aware of; I take notice of his <hi>name,</hi> I take notice of his <hi>prayer,</hi> I take notice of every <hi>Almeſ-deed</hi> that he does beſtow upon my people, I obſerve all theſe things, yea, I record them, and they ever live and ſtand good <hi>before me:</hi> what could be ſaid more to the encouragement of a poore ſuppliant?</q> thus God deales with <hi>Cornelius:</hi> And thus, you know, he dealt with <hi>Daniel;</hi> the caſe is much what alike, in the 9. of <hi>Dan.</hi> 20. and ſo forward; you ſhall read <hi>Daniels ſucceſſe</hi> upon his prayer; he prayed for the people of God; and how ſpeeds he? very well: Obſerve the circumſtances in the Text, the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when God does anſwer him, even <hi>whilſt he was praying,</hi> ſayes the Text; nay (ſayes the holy Ghoſt there) even at the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> at the firſt ſetting out of his petition, the anſwer, the grant was ſealed, and his petition accepted, God did yeeld unto the ſame at the very entrance; he could no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpeak, but God reſolves of a word of comfort and grace to him. Conſider another circumſtance, and that is, the Meſſenger that God ſends to him, he diſpatches an Angel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Gabriel,</hi> that earſt had been with him (it ſeems) upon other occaſions, he comes to him with a <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and he tels him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that he is accepted of God; the greeting is this; O <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, greatly beloved;</hi> O <hi>Daniel</hi> the great favourite of heaven, underſtand that the great God takes notice of thee, and he writes thy petitions, and hath ſent me to returne his anſwer unto thy ſuite; and the anſwer is very full and very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſatisfying; he grants him what he did deſire, he tels him of <hi>more</hi> then <hi>Daniel</hi> did put into his petition; ſo gracious is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112929:8"/>God unto his people when they ſue unto him in this way of prayer: What ſhould I inſtance <hi>Abraham</hi> now? what ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Hannah,</hi> of <hi>Jonah,</hi> of other particulars in this caſe? I'le conclude with one, <hi>Paul,</hi> and I'le but touch upon it: in the Chapter before my Text at the 11. verſe, you ſhall read how God deales with this ſame <hi>Paul; Paul (alsas Saul)</hi> was ſometime very rough and boiſtrous, breathed out nothing but blood and threats; then God deals with him in a rougher way: but now <hi>Paul</hi> is on his knees, and mark what followes, preſently the Lord diſpatches one <hi>Ananias</hi> unto him; <hi>Ananias</hi> (ſayes he) goe to <hi>Paul,</hi> thou ſhalt find him in ſuch a <hi>place,</hi> thou ſhalt have him there at his prayers, goe to him, tell him from me, <q>that he is a choyce, a precious Veſſell in my eyes, and in my eſteem, let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo much from me;</q> 
               <hi>Ananias,</hi> he begins to ſtartle; Oh Lord! (ſayes he) this man hath been a perſecutor, and he came hither for to doe miſchiefe, I am afraid to come at him: tuſh (ſayes God) be not ſo ſhye of him now; be not ſo ſhye, deliver to him from me a meſſage, and a word of grace and comfort; and why? for (ſayes God) <hi>he prayes,</hi> he prayes (ſayes God) that is the reaſon of it; now <hi>Paul</hi> is a <hi>praying Paul,</hi> the caſe is altered; it is a time of his <hi>praying,</hi> and therefore it is a time of my <hi>pittying,</hi> and of my mercy; now he prayes, I accept of him, doe thou accept of him; and ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> does, for he goes to him, and preſently ſalutes him; <hi>Brother Saul</hi> (ſayes he;) when he is Gods <hi>child,</hi> he is his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſtreight, all quarrels are laid downe aſſoon as ever <hi>Saul</hi> fals to <hi>praying;</hi> he <hi>prayes</hi> (ſayes God,) that is ſufficient. You ſee how graciouſly God deales with his when they fall a praying once.</p>
            <p>Now if you would know a reaſon of this, why God ſhewes himſelfe ſo gracious to us in the time and caſe of prayer; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> the reaſon is not from any <hi>worth</hi> of our perſons, or of our prayers, in themſelves conſidered: for alas! what are they in the ſight of God? or what need hath he of any ſervice from us at all? you know in the law the burning and broyling of ſo many beaſts, eſpecially with hides and all (as ſometime it fell out) was a thing that yeelded no ſavoar of reſt at all in it ſelfe:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112929:8"/>what could come from this, but a filthy ſmoak, a filthy ſtench? but then there was added thereto wine &amp; oyle, and incenſe of Gods appointment, and ſo it was Gods Ordinance, and then there was a ſavour of reſt in it: Think the ſame for our pravers too, as they come from us, and are onely ours; there's nothing in them of worth or acceptance: But when Gods Spirit is in it, when Gods incenſe, Gods perfume is put to it, with his bleſſing upon his owne way and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then they come to be accepted, not (I ſay) ſimply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ours, but becauſe they are Gods; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Affirma∣tion. </seg>2</label> God goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne motives, he graces and reſpects our prayers; but why? becauſe he loves prayers as <hi>his owne,</hi> and the party pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his <hi>owne;</hi> and becauſe he delights in mercy prayed for, and for other reaſons that we ſhall give you by and by.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, God, he does love prayer, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.8. The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the righteous is his delight; it is Gods muſick, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; it is called incenſe, in this reſpect it is pleaſing and acceptable unto God, prayer is his delight, becauſe that it is his own appointment and Ordinance, and that Ordinance that ſets God in the Throne (if I may ſo ſpeak) I meane that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him as God unto his people; for we never give unto God the glory of himſelfe untill ſuch time as we fall a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but prayer gives away <hi>all</hi> from the creature, it carries <hi>all</hi> to God; and ſo ſets up God, and therefore God is pleaſed with prayer, and delights in the ſame.</p>
            <p>And then againe, God loves the party praying (we ſpeak of Gods children that doe pray) I ſay, he loves the party <hi>praying</hi> too; and when the perſon is accepted, then you know any thing paſſes very well; let that Damoſell, in <hi>Mark</hi> 6.22. pleaſe <hi>Herod,</hi> though in a toy, you know what <hi>Herod</hi> ſayes to her ſtraight, aske what thou wilt (ſayes he) it ſhall be given unto thee; let <hi>Esther</hi> pleaſe <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and then ſhee need not wooe him, he will wooe her; ſpeak (ſayes he) O Queen <hi>Esther,</hi> what is thy petition, and what is thy requeſt? and it ſhall be granted unto thee. God delights in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his children, he loves them dearly; and becauſe they are ſo precious in his eyes, their prayers and their entreaties are very welcome to him, <hi>John</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:112929:9"/>
            <p>Thirdly, God is a God that delights in mercy, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels us;<note place="margin">Jer. 9.24. Micah 7.18.</note> 
               <hi>he delights in mercy,</hi> ſayes <hi>Jeremy:</hi> and, ſayes <hi>Micah, mercy pleaſes him:</hi> God is very well pleaſed when he hath an <hi>opportunity</hi> to ſhew his bounty, and to exerciſe his mercy, and his graciouſneſſe towards his people (and when he finds them on their knees, then they are in a capacity of mercy:) God is pleaſed with this, even to ſcatter mercy, and to ſhew himſelfe a bountifull God, he delights herein, therefore does even <hi>heap</hi> mercy upon his people when they are capable of the ſame: <hi>Hitherto,</hi> ſayes Chriſt in the 16. of John 24. <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have asked nothing in my name, aske and you ſhall receive. Nothing,</hi> that is, nothing to ſpeak of, as if he would ſay, nothing that I value at any thing, I doe not ſatisfie my ſelfe in that which I have done for you hitherto, you have hitherto asked nothing to ſpeak of, aske more, I am ready to give you more; ſo large are his bowels and his favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people; God ſtands diſpoſed to his when they come asking, as <hi>Naaman</hi> ſometimes did, 2 <hi>King</hi> 5. toward <hi>Gehezi; Gehezi</hi> comes to aske one talent, and one ſuit of raiment for each Levite (that he ſuggeſts and ſues for;) but what ſayes <hi>Naaman</hi> to him? nay, take two; one is too little, take two, and the Text tels us that he did <hi>preſſe him,</hi> and heaps them upon him: So deales God with his people when they come to him for mercy and for kindneſſe; nay (ſayes God) take more, or at leaſt, I would you were capable of more, I could as willingly give it, as you are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, if the ſtay were not on your owne part: God loves mercy, and therefore is ready to entertaine the prayers of his children when they come for mercy. As there are theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken from Gods gracious and bleſſed <hi>nature,</hi> ſo others may be added from other occaſions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the engagements that lye upon God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his free and gracious promiſes; promiſes very <hi>free</hi> and very <hi>large,</hi> both for the <hi>matter</hi> that we ſhall ask; ask what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you will,<note place="margin">John 14.13. Pſal. 81.10.</note> ask in my name (ſayes Chriſt) you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: as alſo for the <hi>meaſure,</hi> open thy mouth wide (ſayes God) and I will ſill it: as alſo for the <hi>time</hi> when God will doe it, <hi>before you ſpeak I will heare, and while you are ſpeaking
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112929:9"/>I will anſwer,</hi> in the 65. of <hi>Iſatah.</hi> I forbeare to name other places, becauſe they are familiarly knowne to you, ſo that God having engaged himſelf by promiſe to doe great things, and (as he ſayes in the Prophet) to be <hi>very gracious</hi> unto his people in point of prayer,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.19.</note> therefore certainly he will be as good as his word.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all, (which is the maine reaſon of all in truth) the reaſon is from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from that <hi>Covenant</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction that paſſes between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Father: Chriſt, he preſents our prayers, nay, we preſent Chriſt unto his Father; God looks upon a Chriſtian as a piece and a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt, he looks upon his prayer, as the <hi>fruit</hi> of Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion and Prieſtdome; our prayers (being Saints) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by Chriſts <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are preſented by Chriſts <hi>hand</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father; they are perfumed with his interceſſion, and with his incenſe,<note place="margin">Revel. 8.4.</note> and therefore it is certaine they be very pleaſing to God: God for Chriſts ſake will deny none that come in the name and in the Spirit of the Lord Chriſt; nay, God hath left the whole <hi>dispenſation</hi> of this buſineſſe unto the Lord Chriſt, and hath referred all to him, even to doe what he will with the Saints in the Church, as ſometimes <hi>Ahaſuorus</hi> did with <hi>Eſther,</hi> left it to her what ſhe would have done for her people and againſt her enemies; and as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> (ſayes he) thy brethren are come into <hi>Aegypt</hi> unto thee, bid them welcome, take the Land at thy command, place them where thou thinkeſt good; ſo unto the ſame effect does God ſay unto the Lord Chriſt, here be friends of thine, members of thine, that are bone of thy bone, fleſh of thy fleſh, they come to me for ſome reliefe and ſuccour in thy name, here they be, receive them, take them, doe for them what thou ſeeſt good I will ratifie it, I will make it good;</q> this is the maine reaſon: And theſe are the reaſons which I ſhall give you of the point, why the Lord is ſo gracious unto his poore ſervants, when they come a begging and a ſuing unto him. Now give me leave in a few words to bring home this point, and to apply it, and then we will paſſe to another.</p>

Conſider of it I beſeech you, 1. what a long journey we muſt take; and then, how long we muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112929:10"/>wait; and then, how uncertaine we ſhould be of any ſucceſſe or gracious anſwer at all: Weigh theſe things with your ſelves, and then reflect upon Gods goodneſſe, and admire him for the ſame: I inlarge it a little further: A man hath a ſuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly King or Prince, and what muſt he doe? Firſt of all he muſt take a long journey to the Kings Court; and then when he is there, he muſt find out ſome Courtiers, ſome friends to ſpeak for him, and to make way for him, that he may have acceſſe; when that is done, he muſt wait the Kings leiſure, early and late he muſt be ready to wait, and ſo ſtay his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his pleaſure: When this is done, that he hath got acceſſe once, and is brought into the Kings preſence, how then? he is not permitted to ſpeak his heart unto the King, and to ſay at large what his griefe and his affliction is; nay, he muſt not ſpeak at all, onely deliver his Petition, and that he muſt have ready drawne, and fairly drawne, there muſt be no blurre in it, very briefe it muſt be, and very ſuccinct, he muſt not ſpeak any thing in the world that is impertinent, or that would be diſpleaſing, but carry it ſo, as that he may give full content: And when all this is done, and his Petition is received, he hath not preſently an anſwer, but he muſt wait and wait againe, he muſt follow the Court into this place, and that place; and when anſwer does come, it may be it is but halfe an anſwer and a grant, perhaps the anſwer is none other but a bare deniall, at leaſt a man cannot build upon it, becauſe he hath no promiſe before-hand that he ſhall be accepted, and that his petition ſhall be granted: Thus it is when we deale with an earthly Prince, when we come but upon one Petition: But now put the caſe that this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be granted, what is it? it is but for ſome partiall or ſome particular thing; 'tis not a grant that will make me happy, and that will doe my ſoule any good at all, I ſhall need more things; and what if I need againe, muſt I to the Court again? muſt I wait againe? muſt I run the ſame round I ran before? Oh how troubleſome, how coſtly, how tedious would this be unto me? And if this be ſo (my brethren) as you know it is, then I beſeech you doe but conſider how infinitely we ſtand bound to Almighty God for his goodneſſe and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe

Oh conſider of this, and let the meditation of this now ſtirre you up unto thankfulneſſe to God; his grace, his goodneſſe is ſo great this way, as that I am ſwallowed up in the meditation of it, and I have not words to expreſſe what his tenderneſſe and his graciouſneſſe is unto us in every one petition that we put up unto him; you doe not know what a <hi>friend</hi> you have of God, and how many, <hi>many favours</hi> and kindneſſes he ſhewes you in any <hi>one</hi> Petition that he hearkens unto, and grants to you at any time.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> Future.</note> and it teaches us a third thing, and then we have done with the firſt part: The thing is this: Sith God is ſo gracious towards his people impoint of prayer, therefore we ſhould be invited <hi>now,</hi> and encouraged to make uſe of this his kindneſſe, and to goe to him upon this errand of prayer, as need ſhall require: Let us, I beſeech you, think as meanly of our ſelves, and of our ſervices as you will; but let us alwayes have high thoughts of God, and when we come to him in his owne way, then promiſe great things to our ſelves: And know, that he is able and ready to doe abundantly above that we can ſpeake or think (as the Apoſtle tels us;) thus we ſhould goe to God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> and of his goodneſſe herein we have a great deale of experience; if we will not beleeve the <hi>promiſes</hi> that are very gracious, yet let us beleeve our owne <hi>experience</hi> this way to truſt in him: hath not God been gracious <hi>to us</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> hath not God been gracious to us in <hi>common,</hi> for the publike, when we have ſought unto him in this way of prayer? If ſo, then let us conclude, that God is a conſtant God, his power as great as ever, his love as much as ever, his truth the ſame for ever; he loves prayer as well as ever he did; he loves <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as ever he did, who is our Mediator; and he loves the <hi>perſons</hi> of the Elect as much as ever he did; he delights in <hi>mercy</hi> as much as ever; therefore let this encourage us to goe to God in all our afflictions and diſtreſſes, whether they are <hi>perſonall,</hi> or whether they are <hi>publike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For our perſonall defects, and our perſonall diſtreſſes, let us goe to God as <hi>Cornelius</hi> here does; <hi>Cornelius</hi> he is in a ſtreight, and it was in a point of great concernment, he muſt reſolve one way or other, off or on; either be for this Chriſt, or againſt him; <hi>Cornelius</hi> knew not which way to reſolve, he prayes therefore, he deſires God that he would <hi>enlighten</hi> him, that he would direct him: Oh! let us doe the like in theſe diſtreſſed times, when there be ſuch diviſions and diſtractions in the Church of God, and amongſt the people of God, that a poore ſimple body knowes not what is right, and what is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112929:12"/>truth, and what is not; knowes not which ſide to adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Some call him this way, and ſome call him that way; and another ſayes this is right, and you muſt goe this way if ever you will be ſaved; and another ſpeaks quite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: What now ſhould a poore man doe?

What I ſpeak of this particular (becauſe the very caſe leads me to it, in my Text) that we may ſay of all other things too: Carry <hi>all</hi> thy feares to God, and <hi>all</hi> thy ſorrowes to God, and <hi>all</hi> thy ſcruples to God, acquaint him with thy caſe, and beg help and ſtrength from him, he is able, he is ready to heare.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112929:12"/>he is as ready to help thee as <hi>Cornelius.</hi> 2. What we ſay for <hi>private</hi> men, that we may ſay much more now, in the <hi>publike</hi> Caſe, when it comes to publike prayer, and to matter of a publike concernment, here we ſhould be encouraged to goe to God: Is God ſo ready to heare prayer? does he ſo graciouſly anſwer and accept of poore and weak prayer?

In truth, what is a mans mercy to God? our goodneſſe reacheth not to him; whac can we give him, but what is his owne already, and what he hath given us firſt? So that that cannot be the reaſon why God reſpects our niercy, for any worth or dignity that is in our Almes: But the reaſon is this; God is pleaſed in Chriſt to look upon our <hi>perſons,</hi> and then next to accept of our <hi>ſorvices</hi> for Chriſts ſake; <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note>

            <p>If this be ſo, that God takes <hi>particular notice,</hi> and writes downe every work of mercy that is done; then this ſpeakes but ſad newes unto divers ſorts of people.</p>
            <p>The firſt are ſuch men as are meere <hi>ſtrangers unto merey,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and the fruits thereof; they were never guilty of ſuch a thing as Mercy and Almeſ-deeds: If you compare the Books (Gods and theirs) together, you ſhall find the Books much what alike unto ſome <hi>Almanacks,</hi> that are full of letters, both red and black &amp; bloody on one ſide, but on the other ſide there is fair paper, a waſte empty blank, that is all that is to be found there: Even ſo it is with many a mans books, if he be a true recorder of his works of mercy: On the one ſide, you ſhall find, <hi>Item,</hi> ſo much ſpent upon <hi>Pride,</hi> and ſo much ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luſt,</hi> and ſo much ſpent upon <hi>Revenge,</hi> and ſo much ſpent at <hi>Dice,</hi> and ſo much ſpent in <hi>Playes,</hi> and ſo much ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſinne</hi> and Wickedneſſe; this ſide is full of what hath been laid out touching themſelves, and for themſelves in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of their luſts: But now when it comes to a work of mercy, what have you done <hi>for God?</hi> what for <hi>Chriſt?</hi> what for the <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt? what for the advancement of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> or any <hi>pious</hi> work or ſervice? what ſhall you ſind there?

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nay, in the third place, let this be a matter of humbling to the <hi>beſt</hi> of us, for certainly we are all ſhort in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and have cauſe even to bluſh and hang downe our heads, betwixt <hi>man and man</hi> when it comes to a <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi> and we ſee other men underwrite, it may be, ſo many <hi>crownes,</hi> or ſo many <hi>pounds,</hi> we are aſhamed to appeare in the ſame Roll, and to have our names liſted where <hi>farthings</hi> and <hi>half-pence</hi> are ſet upon our heads; much more ſhould we bluſh when we bring our ſelves into the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and there conſider that God ſees all <hi>we</hi> doe, all that <hi>others</hi> have done; he writes downe every mans <hi>name,</hi> every mans <hi>worke,</hi> every mans <hi>Almes,</hi> and they are <hi>bookt,</hi> and this book will be read and produced at the laſt day: This, this ſhould put us to the bluſh, eſpecially when we conſider two things yet found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That is, our <hi>backwardneſſe</hi> unto works of mercy; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> in works of mercy.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for our <hi>backwardneſſe;</hi> how heavily doe we come off (for the moſt part) in works of this kind? <hi>Mercy</hi> is by our Saviour preferred before <hi>kindneſſe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14.13.</note> Sayes he, when thou makeſt a Feaſt, bid the poore, &amp;c. doe not bid the rich; a man may bid his rich friends in a way of <hi>kindneſſe,</hi> but (ſayes Chriſt) preferre the other before that, <hi>mercy</hi> before <hi>kindneſſe;</hi> mercy is better then kindneſſe.

Nay then, alas! I am in debt; then, my purſe is not about me; or elſe, when it comes to the opening of the purſe, every finger is a thumb, and it is ſuch a while before any thing will be got out, that it is very tedious and irk ſome to a man to behold it: Then the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, who ſhall be <hi>firſt?</hi> but, who ſhall be <hi>last?</hi> I'le ſee what my betters doe firſt, there are ſuch and ſuch, they are a great deale richer and better then my ſelfe, I will ſee what they doe; happy is the man here that can be <hi>hindmost:</hi> Oh! my Brethren, is not this a thing, think you, that ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, that ſhould ſhame us? that we in way of <hi>courteſie</hi> to man ſhould be thus <hi>free,</hi> but when it comes to works of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> for God, we ſhould be ſo <hi>bound up,</hi> that we cannot cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, almoſt, part with any thing? this is one of the things we fault in our ſelves, this ſame <hi>backwardneſſe</hi> to workes of this kind.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, there is another thing, and that is <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in works of mercy: If a man will but compare what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on <hi>ſelfe,</hi> and on the <hi>publike;</hi> what a vaſt difference will there appeare upon the very firſt view? If a man read his books, he ſhall find, <hi>Item</hi> ſo much beſtowed upon <hi>Apparrell,</hi> and ſo much beſtowed upon a <hi>Feast,</hi> and ſo much for <hi>my ſelfe,</hi> my <hi>ſelf-credit,</hi> and my <hi>ſelf-delight</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> my <hi>ſelfe I know</hi> not what, ſo much for <hi>ſelfe;</hi> there it amounts to ſcores, to <hi>bundreds,</hi> it may be, to <hi>thouſands:</hi> But then come on the other
