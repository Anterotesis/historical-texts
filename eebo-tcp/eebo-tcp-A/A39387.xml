         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE extraordinary
Conduct of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Court and
Council for ſome
years paſt, having rais'd the
Curioſity of a great Prince
of the Empire, to find out at
any rate the true Cauſes and
Grounds of Counſels and
Actions that had ſo much
ſurprized him, he made choice
of a Miniſter whom he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Deſign, and having given
<pb facs="tcp:44145:3"/>
him Inſtructions for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
diſpatched him private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under other pretences to the
Emperours Court at <hi>Prague</hi>
The Miniſter acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
well, and gave his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
an ample account of his
Buſineſs by Letter, of the 13.

AND
By Whom, and How.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS the duty of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
not to conceal
any thing from his
Prince and Maſter,
eſpecially when he is pleaſed to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44145:4"/>
honour him with his Confidence,
as your Higneſs hath done in
ſending me to this Court: To
clear my ſelf from the Guilt
and Reproach of having been
wanting to this Duty, I take the
liberty to give your Highneſs a
faithful and candid account in
Writing; what I have diſcovered
moſt pertinent and Eſſential to
the buſineſs, you were pleaſed
to employ me in. I ſhall do it
with the leſs ſcruple and reſerve,
having ſent this Letter by an
Expreſs, in whom I have entire
Confidence, and doubt not but he
will, according to my order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it into your Hands.</p>
            <p>To begin with the beſt part of
what I have to deliver, I am to
inform your Highneſs, that His
Imperial Majeſty is, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
a pious Prince, good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
and of a ſweet and gentle
Diſpoſition, and not at all incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44145:4"/>
to contend with the Princes
his Neighbours, or make War
on his Inferiors: That, purſuant
to this natural Inclination for
Repoſe and for Peace, this Prince
hath an Antipathy againſt any
thing that diſturbs or oppoſes his
quiet Diſpoſition, and hath eaſed
himſelf wholly of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and direction of his Affairs
of State, and of War, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all to the Conduct of his
principal Miniſters. 'Tis hard
for a Prince to intruſt a Miniſter
with Affairs of this mighty Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
without opening to
him all his Mind, and imparting
the greateſt and deepeſt of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets:
And from hence, I believe
it hath unhappily followed that
this Prince, having by degrees
accuſtomed himſelf to leave the
greateſt part of his Affairs to the
Conduct of his Miniſters, hath
reſerved to himſelf only the Title
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44145:5"/>
and Pomp, the Splendour and
Name of the Dignities and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
proper to his Character. In
a Word, had his Imperial Majeſty
never ſo little minded his great
Affairs, he would never have
yielded to ſign that ſhameful and
ignominious Peace with <hi>France,</hi>
ſubſcribed by the Imperial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
at the Congreſs ad <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miguen;</hi>
the unhappy Effects
whereof we have ſeen in ſeven
Particulars of great importance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His Imperial Majeſty, by
thoſe few ſtrokes of his Pen, hath
in all probability, loſt for ever the
Eſteem, the Friendſhip and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the Princes his Friends
and Allyes; who would have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
defended and preſerved
him from ruine, by the force of
their Arms.</p>
            <p>Seconldy, That his own Troops
have been ſhamefully forced to
quit all the Countries of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44145:5"/>
while thoſe of <hi>France</hi> have
been actually there, and continue
to this day inſulting and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
as they pleaſe over the
Princes, the Cities, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Provinces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That by the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Peace, the Eſtates,
the Perſons and the Courts of the
three Eccleſiaſtical Electors of
the Empire, and of the Elector
<hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſtand in a
manner expos'd every hour to
the violences and irruptions of
the Arms of <hi>France;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in caſe of an Election
of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> we
may probably find by their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
what may be expected
from Slaves to that proud and
ambitious Crown.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That his Imperial
Majeſty having by that Peace ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
conſented to the late Ceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44145:6"/>
on made by <hi>Spain</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to the Crown of
<hi>France:</hi> It follows, that if His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty, (in Caſe of failure
of Iſſue in the Houſe of <hi>Spain)</hi>
ſhould in his own Right, or in the
Right of the Arch-Dutcheſs his
Daughter, the Heir to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of that Monarchy, he hath
by that Article of the County of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> releaſed his Right to
it, and deprived his Succeſſors,
and the Empire of the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that Country might upon
a favourable Revolution have
afforded them to lead an Army
without oppoſition into the
heart of <hi>France:</hi> And ſhould
<hi>Lorrain</hi> be ever reſtored to the
Empire, yet this Article will be
an infallible means for <hi>France</hi> to
maintain continually an Army
on the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
invade it as often as it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be for the Intereſt and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44145:6"/>
Grandeur of the <hi>French</hi> to attack
the <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That though <hi>Swizzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
be throughly convinced
by the building the Fortreſs of
<hi>Hunninges,</hi> of the Ambitious
deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
concerned and inclined
to make a League with all, or
part of the Princes of the
Empire, in defence of the
Common Liberty; yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Seſſion of the County
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> hath furniſhed the
Penſioners of <hi>France,</hi> (whom no
Counſel or Caution of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
is free from) with a
plauſible argument, to perſwade
that Republick not to ſtir in its
own defence, till it be perhaps
too late, and out of its power
to help it ſelf: For, ſay they,
What ſhall we do? The <hi>Cantons</hi>
of <hi>Bern, Fribourgh</hi> and <hi>Sollurre</hi>
cannot ſubſiſt without the Salt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44145:7"/>
of that Province: Beſides the
Forces his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
keeps actually on Foot
there, may juſtly alarm us to be
cautious to the utmoſt, what
meaſures we take, and conſider
all things before we ingage in
any: By ſuch diſcourſes as theſe
(though groundleſs if we ſuppoſe
an Union of the Forces of the
Empire with the <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> which
would infallibly draw in many
more) it may fall out that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
(if the loweſt party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
not againſt thoſe Traytors to
their Country) may to its own
miſchief, and the ruin of others,
lye ſtill and look on, as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and conſequently be a
Member wholly uſeleſs to the
Publick, for defence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Liberty, which would be
in the preſent Conjuncture of
more miſchievous Conſequence
han moſt are aware of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44145:7"/>
Sixthly, That by this peace
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who hath
had the honour to <hi>Marry</hi> a great
Queen eldeſt Siſter to his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty, hath found as little
reſpect in this Peace, as if he had
married the Daughter of a <hi>Burgo-Maſter</hi>
of <hi>Colmar;</hi> and hath been
violently robb'd, and intirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt
of his Dukedoms of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
and <hi>Bar,</hi> and ſeveral other
Lands he held in Soveraignty,
being his Hereditary Eſtates,
and deſcended to him by unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
right of Succeſſion:
Which others looked on with ſo
little concern, as if this Prince
(ſtript of all he could call his own)
had loſt no more than a Ring, or
a Farm of a thouſand Crowns
value.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That his Imperial
Majeſty, and the Empire by
Signing a Peace (to give it its
right Name) ſo unbecoming and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44145:8"/>
unworthy, have raiſed the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and hopes of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
King to that height, that he
looks on both with ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
and ſcorn, that he hath
openly undertaken at once three
things, which (I believe) were
ever heard of in the Empire, at
leaſt when it had the advantage
of a Head that had the leaſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
and care for its Glory.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that without any
Lawful Miſſion, the Emperor
being young, and in perfect
Health, he ſolicites vigorouſly the
two Electors of the North ſide of
the Empire, for their Suffrage
at the next Election of a King of
the <hi>Romans.</hi> I mention only
theſe two Electors, for as for
the others, he makes no doubt
by fair means or by force to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of them as he ſhall think
fit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44145:8"/>
The ſecond, that, as if he
were dealing only with the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of his Revenues, or the
Poyſoners of <hi>Paris,</hi> he hath by
a Declaration erected at <hi>Metz</hi>
(as formerly at <hi>Briſak)</hi> a Court
compos'd according to the courſe
of that Kingdom, of a dozen
Hangm—where though the
ſmalleſt Duke and Peer of <hi>France,</hi>
is not obliged to appear; His
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, as Judge
and Party, cites by ſome Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole
of that <hi>Clandeſtine</hi> Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
Princes of the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Illuſtrious Houſes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
(which he hath nothing to
do withall) to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to give him Account by
what right they poſſeſs what
their Predeceſſors have for
three or four hundred Years
peaceably enjoyed. This inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the help of the Knight
of the Poſt, and a Map of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44145:9"/>
Country drawn out at pleaſure,
(but of the old faſhion, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to colour the buſineſs) is the
ground of his pretenſions, that
the greateſt part of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the
whole Dukedom of <hi>Deuxpents,</hi>
and the beſt part of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> as

Dependencies of the Biſhopricks
of <hi>Metz, Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and
muſt conſequently be re-united
to the Demeans of that Crown
with as much eaſe, as the Lands
of ſome wretched Treaſurers of
<hi>France</hi> have been reſumed by his
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The third is, that to the end
his new Paper-pretences, may
be as effectual as the right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of the low Countries in
1667 and 1668. He hath upon
the Frontiers on this ſide conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Forces in readineſs to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Reunion, or rather, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that pretence, to do what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44145:9"/>
he ſhall think fit in the Empire;
when all this while, neithe his
Imperial Majeſty, nor any Prince
of the Empire dares openly ſtir.
As if what hath already been
done to the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
and other Princes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Empire in <hi>Alſatia,</hi>
were not only a certain preſage,
but an unqueſtionable Preſident,
whereby all other Princes and
States of the Empire of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

ſee the Fortune of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and States, who have the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to hold of that Crown,
or be Neighbours to its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The conſequences that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow ſo untoward, and
ſo unhappy a State of Affairs will
oblige us to Conclude; Woe
to his Imperial Majeſty, if he do
not wholly alter his Conduct,
and God grant I ſpeak not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
and truly, as <hi>Micajah</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44145:10"/>
when I ſay His Imperial Majeſty
will dearly rue his truſting his
Council with the direction and
management of Affairs of this
Nature: And wo to His Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Majeſty and the Empire, they
ever ſigned that falſe and fatal
Peace, whereby both will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fall (unleſs God by ſpecial
interpoſition prevent it) under
the ſlavery of that abſolute and
deſpotical Dominion. Yet I
would not be thought to be of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that if all His Imperial
Majeſty's Council were ſuch as it
ought to be, Affairs would be in
that ill condition we find them;
but the greater part of that
Council being weak or corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as I dare ſay it is, we are not
to doubt, but if it continues,
things will ſtill grow worſe and
worſe: I have been bold to ſay,
the greater part of the Imperial
Council is Weak or Corrupt:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44145:10"/>
And to make my words good,

deſigns contrary to thoſe of

of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> Commander

order the diſtribution of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
neceſſary for the Army in
ſuch a manner, that when it was
provided of one ſort, it ſhould
certainly want another: When
it had Cannon, it wanted Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages;
and when it had both theſe

for the whole ſtory of that Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
is (in ſhort) no more but a
miſunderſtanding between theſe
Princes, and want of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this was not enough,
for the malice of theſe Emiſſaries,
they poceeded further to hire
one under the name of <hi>Dela Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaine,</hi>
who having been inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

S. <hi>Gall</hi> (of whom we ſhall

was guilded over with ſo

the Duke animated with zeal to
do ſomething great for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Imperial Majeſty, and
the Intereſt of his Country,
greedily hearkned, and quickly
embraced the propoſal. After
ſome neceſſary precautions for
the Enterpriſe, <hi>Duneewald</hi> was
commanded to undertake the
Execution, and having in the
Action diſcovered the Cheat,
the Duke us'd his endeavours to
have the Criminal Arreſted:
But all to no purpoſe; for the
Major <hi>Domo</hi> had already ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him in a place of ſafety: I
make no doubt but every one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44145:13"/>
will grant me, this Rogue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
death, and had not any
colour of pretence, to find eſteem
or ſafety in the Empire: But it
proved quite otherwiſe upon his
Capitulation, (I mean that with
the Major <hi>Domo)</hi> for the Rogue,
having play'd this excellent trick,
had the impudence to go to the
Emperours Court, where he was
very well received, and highly
treated, and ſent thence to <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,</hi>
where Count <hi>Shaftkutſch,</hi>
Preſident of the Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

'Tis fit to know the Perſon the

It is no other than the

confeſt to be the falſeſt of Men.
Yet being a Perſon of a very

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44145:15"/>
naturally active in what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,
ſometimes he openly

for the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> This

is become exceſſive Rich, which
I mention as a circumſtance
whereby it may be the better
known what a Man he is, how
fit to negotiate the Intereſts of

is no ſurer means than to make
the Aſſembly ſuſpect this man

This Prince hath ſince the

and in particular the Garriſon of
<hi>Rhinefeld,</hi> which is of principal
conſequence: Let us weigh the
matter without prejudice: He
hath disbanded moſt of his old
Regiments, and kept on foot
only part of the new. A man

not that the Imperial Council
hath in this particular acted by
inteligence with the Council of

to defend him, and to make
them immediately go over into
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44145:19"/>
the ſervice of <hi>France:</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath fallen out according to
their deſign, and I leave it to
any man verſed in matters of
State or of War, to judge what
a Conduct ſo extraordinary as
this doth naturally ſignifie.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be too tedious to give

or one <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> to deal with.
Nor do I ſee he hath any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Authority than had thoſe two
unfortunate Kings, who were
violently thruſt out of their
Thrones; which neither they,
nor any of their <hi>Poſterity</hi> ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.
The better to convince
the World how foully His Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty is betrayed by his
Council, and in him all the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>States</hi> of the Empire,
and that there hath been of a
long time a horrid and villainous
<hi>Plot</hi> carried on againſt them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44145:20"/>
with great cunning and caution,
give me leave to obſerve that
it proceeds from the ſecret En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of this Plot, that His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty's two Siſters were
Married to Princes, both Robbed
of their Dominions and Eſtates:
As to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of the Elder, he continues
to this day ſtript of all his Eſtates,
and if the late Peace hold, I ſee
little hopes of his Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And it cannot be deny'd but
that the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi>
though reſtored by the Peace to
the Dukedoms of <hi>Juliers</hi> and
<hi>Berg,</hi> was out of poſſeſſion of both
at the time of the Marriage of his
Son to the Emperor's younger
Siſter. The Reaſons of theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
were, that the Princeſſes
being Married (as they are) to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
uncapable to afford His Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty any Succour at need,
neither His Majeſty nor his Allies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44145:21"/>
might have any benfit by the
Marriages. And that when ever
<hi>France</hi> ſhould be deſirous of
Peace, there might be thoſe in
the Imperial Councils and Court,
whoſe Intereſt would oblige them
to deſire and procure it, in order to
their reſtoration and re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their Eſtates, and to free
themſelves from the neceſſity of
begging their Bread elſewhere. It
hath happened accordingly as to
the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> at leaſt,
for having not wherewith to
bear the Charge of the Marriage
of his Son with the Emperor's
Siſter, without being reſtored to
the Dutchies of <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi>
which could not (at leaſt ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily)
be effected without a <hi>Peace,</hi>
what wonder is it, that this <hi>Prince</hi>
hath for the time paſt (being
forced by his Neceſſities) joyned
with that part of the Emperor's
Council that was for <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44145:21"/>
aſſiſted them in perſwading His
Imperial Majeſty to ſign it on any
Condition: Nor can it appear
ſtrange, if this <hi>Prince</hi> for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
joyn with the ſame Council,
and uſe all his Credit and Intereſt
with His Imperial Majeſty, never
to enter into a War with <hi>France,</hi>
though he have never ſo great
Reaſon for it. <hi>For when wants
and Neceſſities enter in at the Door,
Honour and Friendſhip flyeth out
at the windows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Highneſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> (to
give him his due) hath done
bravely on his occaſion, having
generouſly choſen to run the
<hi>Riſque</hi> of loſing all, rather than
ſign ſo ſhameful and unjuſt a
<hi>Peace,</hi> as that propoſed to him
by <hi>France:</hi> And I ſhall be very
much deceived, if he or his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
not their Eſtates rather by
this than any other Conduct:
For Revolutions are Common to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44145:22"/>
all, and I have particular Reaſons
to believe it may one day happen
ſo in the Affairs of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>This I think is more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to Evince that His Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty hath been baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by his Council.</p>
               <p>My next buſineſs is to ſhew by
what ſort of People he hath been
chiefly betrayed, and with what
Covers they have guilded thoſe
Pills, which they have made this
Good and Auguſt Prince ſwallow
from time to time.</p>
               <p>To find the bottom of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
we muſt look a great way
back, as far as the beginning of
the War, which <hi>France</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert
with <hi>England,</hi> the Elector of
<hi>Cologne,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Newburgh,</hi>
and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> made
againſt the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in
1672. After ſeveral Alliances
with the Deceaſed Elector of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44145:22"/>
                  <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi>
and others, which were but too
viſible during that War.</p>
               <p>Several pretences have been
made uſe of to colour that Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the truth is, it was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
only by the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits: To give
your Highneſs full and clear ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in this particular, be
pleaſed to permit me to put you
in mind, that a little before the
breaking out of that War, his
Royal Highneſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
having taken his Meaſures
with the Court and Council of
<hi>France,</hi> made open War againſt
the Republick of <hi>Genoa.</hi> The
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> wiſely judging
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would not
have engaged in that Enterprize
without aſſurance before hand of
Succour and Protection from
<hi>France,</hi> if needful; and that
thoſe petty Sparks might raiſe a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44145:23"/>
General Conflagration in <hi>Italy,</hi>
which in time might draw over
thither all the <hi>French</hi> Forces, and
conſequently expoſe that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to inevitable Ruin; that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
and cunning Court, to ſave
themſelves from the ſtorm, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves ſeriouſly,</p>
               <p>In the Firſt place, to put an end
upon any terms to the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Duke and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
which Monſieur <hi>Gaumont</hi>
ſoon after effected.</p>
               <p>In the next place, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
what formidable Forces His
Moſt Chriſtian <hi>Majeſty</hi> had then
on foot, and that that <hi>Monarch</hi>
could not forbear breaking out
into a new War; the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> reſolved to uſe all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to divert from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Neighbours,
the Effects of the <hi>French</hi> Arms,
and cauſe them to fall on ſome
other Country of <hi>Europe,</hi> the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44145:23"/>
moſt remote that might be from
<hi>Italy,</hi> and where it might be moſt
Convenient for the Intereſt of
the <hi>Pope:</hi> The Jeſuits having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
directions to this purpoſe,
the affair was manag'd with that
ſubtilty, the Storm fell altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſuring it ſelf,
that if that Republique were
once deſtroy'd, the whole <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Party</hi> would naturally come
to ruin, and the <hi>Papal</hi> Authority
in a ſhort time recover it's primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Grandeur and Glory. Great
Obſtacles were quickly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againſt the carrying on this
mighty <hi>Project:</hi> The moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
King who clearly ſaw what
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aim'd at, was,
or pretended to be, unwilling to
engage in Open War againſt the
<hi>United Provinces,</hi> but on two
Conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:44145:24"/>
Firſt, That the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
ſhould ſecretly conſent and give
way that he might, if he could,
joyn the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
with what he could Conquer
from the States of the <hi>United
Provinces,</hi> to form or reſtore the
Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Auſtraſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſhould aſſure him, to their
<hi>Power,</hi> to procure his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and
the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> (who was deſigned
the New King of <hi>Auſtraſia,)</hi> the
Imperial Crown.</p>
               <p>As to the point of the <hi>Spaniſh
Netherlands,</hi> it muſt be obſerv'd,
that to bring about the Deſign,
it was abſolutely neceſſary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
(whoſe intereſts there were
very conſiderable) and there could
be no hopes to give him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
without Sacrificing to him
ſomething very conſiderable of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44145:24"/>
what belong'd to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
It would have been almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for any but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
ſo different, to reconcile
and overcome ſo great and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Difficulties. The two
Branches of the moſt Auguſt
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had heap'd
moſt conſiderable Favours, and
ſhowed their Bounties, on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Jeſuits: But when they
are concerned for the Grandeur
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Intereſts of
the <hi>Miter</hi> (which (by the way)
the Society looks on with the
ſame Ardour a young <hi>Prince</hi> in
Love would eye the advantages,
the Glory and Intereſts of a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and rich Queen, whom he
made no doubt but he ſhould one
day enjoy) all Thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the favours received
from the <hi>Auguſt Family,</hi> are
wholly laid aſide on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> fell immdiately
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44145:25"/>
to find out Expedients for two
Reaſons, full of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi>
according to the <hi>Politick Maxims</hi>
of that Bleſſed <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt was that whereas the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the preſent
Conjuncture was notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to raiſe the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> to
their former Eſtate of Grandeur
and Glory, and that there was
not any but His moſt Chriſtian
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> who by his <hi>Forces</hi> and
<hi>Intereſts</hi> could work this kind of
<hi>Miracle</hi> it was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to remove all Difficulties and
Obſtacles that might hinder the
effecting an enterpriſe ſo <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
and <hi>Glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second, That in caſe the
Deſign ſhould take effect, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
was aſſured of having in
recompence of their pains, two
great Abbies, Heads of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the one in the Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>France,</hi> the other in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44145:25"/>
                  <hi>New Conqueſts:</hi> Which Abbys
were to be added to the vaſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony</hi>
of this Society, beſides
the aſſurances they had by the
protection of <hi>France,</hi> to obtain a
Settlement in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and
elſewhere. Upon theſe Grounds
they procur'd the Treaties to be
privately ſign'd between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> and between <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> by vertue whereof
the War was quickly begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>United Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I paſs over in ſilence the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
was to have, as impertinent
to my preſent buſineſs: It may
be obſerved, that as under the
Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond <hi>France</hi>
was to have been made (as far as
it lay in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Rome)</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to the Intereſts of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Miter,</hi> and the <hi>Monarch</hi> of
<hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis now become the turn
of the moſt Auguſt Houſe of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44145:26"/>
                  <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (according to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
to be Sacrificed to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of the Papacy, the Jeſuits
and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.
And that as the principal deſign
of the Jeſuits, and of <hi>France,</hi>
was the abſolute deſtruction of
the Proteſtant Party, it was
from hence it proceeded, that a
League was form'd and ſign'd by
moſt of the Catholick Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and incorporated into
the Treaties above mention'd,
wherein every of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
had, or at leaſt thought to
have had his deſign, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd
his ends, as afterwards
appear'd: Hence alſo it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>France,</hi> having anciently
had very ſtrict alliances with
the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
conceal'd very carefully
the preſent deſign from all its
ancient Allyes of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44145:26"/>
the Society as carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
it from both branches of
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and all
this for reaſons, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more eaſily apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For the ſame reaſon it was,
that in the beginning of this
War, nothing was omitted by
the Popes Nuncio, the Jeſuits,
and their Emiſſaries, to lull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
the Councils of <hi>Vienna</hi> and
<hi>Madrid;</hi> and that afterwards
they did with all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
reveal to the Miniſters of
<hi>France,</hi> all they could diſcover
of the deliberations of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Council, or the Spaniſh.
For the ſame reaſon it was, that
his Imperial Majeſty by the clear
Remonſtrances of the Elector of
<hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> being made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Trap cunningly laid
for him by the <hi>French,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commanded an Army to
joyn with that Elector on the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44145:27"/>
                  <hi>Rhine,</hi> thoſe Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi>
laid all their heads together, and
for their Maſter-piece to carry
on the Deſign, effected two
things.</p>
               <p>The firſt was the Rebellion of
the <hi>Male Contents</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> not
yet Suppreſſed, whereby they
endeavour'd, if poſſible, to give
the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſo ſtrong a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it might not be in his
Power to aſſiſt his Allies.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, I have from an
Anonimous Author of an Eſſay
of the Intereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant
Princes</hi> and <hi>States, Printed</hi> in
the year, 1676. and treating of
ſeveral things, in this reſpect ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable: The Author in
my Opinion deſerves the more
Credit, in that he hath laſh'd the
Society to ſome purpoſe in his
Diſcourſe, yet not one of it's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
or Partiſans hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to refute him: The account
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44145:27"/>
he gives of the firſt Campaign, I
will repeat Word for Word from
the Original, as very ſutable to
my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1672. when the
Arms of <hi>France</hi> were ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous,
that all <hi>Europe</hi> looked on
the States of the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
as very near Deſtruction,
His Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourgh</hi>
wiſely foreſeeing the
Conſequences to be expected
from the Ambitious Enterprizes
of <hi>France,</hi> if not ſtopped in time,
gained himſelf the Reputation,
not only of having been the firſt
Prince of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> who
drew his Sword in Protection of
that broken State, but by vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Remonſtrances to the Court
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> was the cauſe that His
Imperial Majeſty, awaking out
of the <hi>Lethargy</hi> ſome corrupt
Counſellors had caſt him into,
reſolved to Arm vigorouſly, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44145:28"/>
joyn with his Electoral Highneſs
in Defence of that Republique:
His Electoral Highneſs in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of this Reſolution being
advanc'd towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with
a conſiderable Army, and <hi>Count
Montecuculi</hi> being on his way
thither in the Head of an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Army, with deſign to act
jointly, and to do ſomething
conſiderable in favour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique.
<hi>France,</hi> allarm'd by
the March of the two <hi>German</hi>
Armies, had detach'd Marſhal
<hi>Turenne,</hi> with a Body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to obſerve the motions of the
other two: But by the ſeveral
Marches and Counter-Marches
theſe two Armies had made, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
that of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi>
ſometimes making as if they
would paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> in ſeveral
places, ſometimes in being ready
to fall upon the Allies of <hi>France</hi>
beyond the <hi>Rhine, Turennes</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44145:28"/>
was ſo tyr'd out and haraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that about the end of the
Campaign it was almoſt quite
diſſipated, and found it ſelf in
ſo miſerable a Condition, that
'tis certain all <hi>Turenne</hi> was able
to do, was to be on the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
againſt one of thoſe Armies,
and that if both Armies had
join'd, <hi>Turenne</hi> had been inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
loſt, as was publickly confeſt.
His Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
knowing how eaſie it
was to deſtroy <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the
Conſequence of his Defeat, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a vigorous Remonſtrance of
all to be made to the Council of
<hi>Vienna;</hi> it was ſo effectual, that
poſitive Orders were ſent <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi</hi>
to join his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Fight <hi>Turenne,</hi> without
further loſs of time; which
would have broken all the open
and hidden Meaſures of <hi>France,</hi>
and by one blow freed the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44145:29"/>
and <hi>Holland</hi> from Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But other matters were in
hand for the Intereſt of <hi>Rome.</hi>
His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain</hi>
had permitted himſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to publiſh about that
time, a Declaration (whereof
he made Report to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
whereby a Tolleration
and Indulgence was granted in
favour of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> of
his Kingdom. Though it may
be thought it was not ſo much
for favouring the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
of the Sectaries of
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party, as, under
the name of <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> to
introduce <hi>Popery</hi> again into that
Eſtate, though contrary to the
Deſigns and Intentions of His
Majeſty, who granted it only in
favour of the tender Conſciences
of his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects: This
Step towards <hi>Popery</hi> being the
Firſt Fruits the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44145:29"/>
had promiſed it ſelf from the
Ruin of the States of the <hi>United
Provinces,</hi> 'tis no wonder that
Court ſet all hands at work to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that Ruin. The then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Obſtacles of the Deſign, was
the Reſolution of His Electoral
Highneſs againſt <hi>Turenne,</hi> the
Deſtruction of his Army being
capable to Re-eſtabliſh the States
of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and
that Re-eſtabliſhment would
have deſtroyed all the Projects of
the Jeſuits in <hi>England.</hi> Here it
was the Jeſuits plaid their part to
prevent the blow from fallin on
<hi>Turenne,</hi> and they acted it too
well for the general Good of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
for <hi>Montecuculi</hi> inſtead of
receiving Expreſs Order to joyn
<hi>Brandenbourgh</hi>'s Army, and fight
<hi>Turenne,</hi> received Orders quite
contrary; whereby he was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
forbidden to do the one or
the other. To drive this Nail
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44145:30"/>
to the head; the venerable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
(whoſe impudence nothing
can parallel) made it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeveral ways to infuſe into
his Electoral Highneſs a jealouſie
of the Emperour, as inſincere in
his intentions: this was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the greater facility, for
that his <hi>E. H.</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi>
having received from the Court
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> a formal Letter, which
gave him an exact account of the
true order his Imperial Majeſty
had ſent <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to join him
and fight the <hi>French,</hi> and his <hi>E. H.</hi>
having ſummoned <hi>Montecuculi</hi> to
execute that Order, <hi>Montecuculi,</hi>
who knew he had Orders quite
contrary, but knew nothing of
the former, of which the Elector
had account, could do no leſs
than refuſe the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor could his Electoral
Highneſs chooſe upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal,
but ſuſpect the ſincerity of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44145:30"/>
the Emperor's Intentions. This
was not enough for thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of miſchief, for at the ſame
time thoſe Emiſſaries omitted
nothing that might inſtill into
<hi>Montecuculi,</hi> a ſuſpicion of the
ſincerity of the Elector's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Theſe Jealouſies being but
too deeply eſtabliſhed, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on this laſt ſide, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
His Electoral Highneſs was
at laſt perſwaded (as theſe Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
had by a third Hand infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
to him) that the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> treated under-hand a
ſeparate Peace with <hi>France:</hi>
Which appeared the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
by the daily Advice he
had of the miſerable eſtate of
<hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army, growing every
hour worſe and worſe, and the
obſtinacy of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> neither
to joyn him, nor fight. The
Emiſſaries foreſeeing this miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
would vaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44145:31"/>
time, when the truth ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
made uſe of that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to ſet on the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi>
to manage a particular
Peace between his Electoral
Highneſs and <hi>France;</hi> which
the Electoral, jealous of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,
and vext at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
was at laſt perſwaded
to accept, and with ſo much the
more reaſon, that as to <hi>Holland</hi>
he pretended they had not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their Engagements to him,
and as to the Intereſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
he reſerved himſelf intire
liberty to arm in its defence, if
<hi>France</hi> ſhould attacque it.</p>
               <p>The Elector was concerned in
Reputation to make the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
ſenſible of his juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Montecuculi</hi>'s proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Montecuculi</hi> was ſtrangely
ſurprized, when at his return to
<hi>Vienna</hi> his Maſter called him to
a ſtrict account of his Conduct,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44145:31"/>
and the Reaſons why he had
neither joined <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi>'s
Army, nor fought <hi>Turenne,</hi> when
expreſs Orders had been ſent
him for both. But if <hi>Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi>
was ſurprized at the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his Imperial Majeſty was no
leſs at the Anſwer, when his
ſage General produced for his
diſcharge an Order of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty, in very good form,
expreſly forbidding him either
to joyn with <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> or
fight <hi>Turenne:</hi> And 'tis certain,
this General found all the juſtice
of his Cauſe, and the aſſurance
his Maſter had of his fidelity,
little enough to clear him of this
unhappy Affair. I know this
buſineſs is one of thoſe Riddles
never to be decypher'd, unleſs
the Author will voluntarily
give us the Key. I know 'tis
from hence it proceeds, that one
of the principal Wretches of this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44145:32"/>
Court hath been formerly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with this Forgery: But to
ſpeak the truth, the whole guilt
of this Affair lies at the Doors
of the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> in this
Court, who by ſecret Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi>
found the means to intercept the
true Original Order, and in the
ſame diſpatch to tranſmit a falſe
one, but very well Counterfeit
both the Hand and Seal: And
that by People who are not now
to learn that Trade. It being
certain we ſhould not have ſeen
ſo many Troubles in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as
daily are there, had theſe Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
leſs credit in the Emperours
Court.</p>
               <p>His Imperial Majeſty, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and Count
<hi>Montecuculi</hi> know the truth of
all that concerns them in this
Affair: But I am well aſſur'd not
one of the three knows the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44145:32"/>
Engines ſet at work in the
buſineſs. What I know thereof
comes not from them, but from
a place where every particular
of this Negotiation was known,
and by whom it was animated.
Certain it is, if the point of the
<hi>Catholicon</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had not
been found; the Miniſters of
<hi>France</hi> could not have ſo eaſily
compaſſed this Forgery; but by
that every thing became feaſible,
the Directors of the Society ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
voluntarily undertaken to
maſter all Difficulties.</p>
               <p>By the ingenious Deduction of
this Relation, where the Author
ſpeaks plainly, as a man well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
and acquainted with the
fineneſs, and ſuperfineneſs of the
management, and by what I
have ſaid before, on the ſame
Subject, and every one may of
himſelf apprehend it appears that
it proceeds from a Principle of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44145:33"/>
a Papal, or Jeſuitical Ambition,
the Council of <hi>Vienna,</hi> from the
beginning of the War, hath
been ſo well penetrated, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or altered, that all the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Imperial Army
(except with convenient diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the conſiderable Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
taking of <hi>Bonne,</hi> the long
and languſhing Siege of <hi>Phillipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
and the taking it at laſt,
and the death of <hi>Turenne,</hi> which
was meerly accidental) I ſay all
the Expeditions, theſe three
Points excepted, have been from
the beginnings of the Campaigns
to the end of them, but ſo many
Proceſſions and Pilgrimages of
Shame and of Miſery, of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and confuſion, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Empire know too well,
who have been flay'd to the bone,
and had their Marrow ſuckedout
by Winter quarters, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
or mercy, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44145:33"/>
the Proteſtant States and
people, and other Princes, Lords,
Magiſtrates, Countries and
Towns, who have felt the ſmart
of that fiery Tryal.</p>
               <p>From the ſame principle it is,
that when by the Expulſion of
the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Empire, his Electoral
Highneſs of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and
his Highneſs of <hi>Zell</hi> and <hi>Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi>
were in a condition (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the particular peace
of the United <hi>Provinces</hi> and
<hi>Spain)</hi> to tranſport the chief of
their Forces upon the Frontiers
of <hi>France,</hi> and by ſo glorious an
Action, to oblige <hi>France</hi> infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to make a peace with the
Empire in general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
according to Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
then were the Emiſſaries
of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo powerful in the
Council at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
his Imperial Majeſty, to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44145:34"/>
the prejudice of all his Treaties,
to ſeal privately ſuch a peace
with <hi>France,</hi> as we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
before; which hath been
manag'd with ſo much dexterity,
that that good (but for that time
too credulous) Prince did believe,
and perhaps is ſtill of the ſame
mind, that he acted according
to the moſt judicious Maxims of
Religion and Prudence: And
becauſe it may concern your
Highneſs to be inform'd what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
were uſed by the Jeſuits
and Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> who
went hand in hand, acting by
concert in all this Affair, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
his Imperial Majeſty to ſign
that fatal Peace, there were
ſent from <hi>France</hi> under other
pretences the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbourgh</hi>
to the Court of <hi>Zell,</hi>
and the Count of <hi>D' Epauſe</hi> to
that of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and at the
ſame time the Jeſuits labour'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44145:34"/>
ſo effectually, that his Imperial
Majeſty was made believe
(though certainly without juſt
ground) that the Houſes of
<hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourgh</hi>
had already agreed, or were
juſt upon agreeing, to a ſeparate
Peace with <hi>France;</hi> whereby
his Imperial Majeſty would be
left alone a prey to the <hi>French</hi>
Ambition. True it is, if thoſe
Princes were in that Conjuncture
(as is very probable) very willing
to keep what they had conquer'd
from the <hi>Swede:</hi> I think they
had done well to have diſmiſt
thoſe Envoys from their Courts,
which had they done, it would
at leaſt have taken away from
the Emperours corrupt Council,
all pretence of rendring them
ſuſpitious to his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and haſtening him in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of that ſuſpition to ſign
the peace under Conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:44145:35"/>
To ſum up all, we may from
what hath been ſaid, reaſonably
infer theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
hath been baſely betrayed
by the greater part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
for I am not ſo malicious
and unjuſt to confound the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
with the guilty, and not to
make an exception (out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
clauſe) in favour of thoſe
of his Council, who are men of
Integrity and Honour, who in
truth I think are very few, and
not much in Credit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That his Imperial
Majeſty being ſo villanouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
by his Council, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in general and particular,
through the indiſſoluble union
of the head and Members cannot
but miſerably participate the
misfortune and ſufferings of its
Soveraign, as is very well
known by a fatal, and too long
experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44145:35"/>
Thirdly, that 'tis eaſie for his
Imperial Majeſty, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to know whom they have
equallly cauſe to complain of,
and from what Principle not
only this Treaſon is derived, but
all the miſchiefs that have affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Chriſtendom, for above an
Age, but eſpecially the Empire
ſince the beginning of the late
War: I ſay for above an Age, as
to the General; becauſe that
which his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
inſtigated by the Jeſuits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
in our days, is but the
ſame, which, by inſtigation of
their predeceſſors, <hi>Charles</hi> the
firſt, the Emperour <hi>Fardinand</hi>
the Second, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Spain,</hi> did in their days.
As to the Empire in particular
I ſay, ſince the beginning of the
laſt War; becauſe 'tis certain
his Imperial Majeſty hath been
ſince that time by the means I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44145:36"/>
have mentioned, ſo cloſely beſet,
and ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that 'tis
not in his power to ſpeak, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
to wiſh, or do any thing,
but the Society knows, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
deſtroys it, if not ſuitable
to their particular Intereſts and
Deſigns: There is not a perſon
in the Emperor's Court, but
knows, that no man without
certain ruin dare oppoſe in that
Court that Cabal in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
though never ſo little: To
conclude this Point, His Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Majeſty, as a Slave to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
as things ſtand at preſent,
ſerves only to Authorize his own
Ruin, the Ruin of his Auguſt
Family, and of the Empire in
general and particular: For the
very Moment I write, <hi>France</hi>
publickly ſolicits in the Empire,
(as I ſaid before) the Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44145:36"/>
of the Dauphin, which in
all probability will be managed
with ſo much dexterity and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
that his Imperial Majeſty,
if he follow the advice of his
Council, Spiritual or Temporal,
will think himſelf obliged in
Conſcience voluntarily to give
way to it.</p>
               <p>This, my Lord, is the true
ſtate of his Imperial Majeſty, and
his Council ſince the laſt Peace.
Three things remain to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The particular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the Jeſuits procured themſelves
by the late War.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What Advantages
they deſign'd themſelves by the
late Peace, and its conſequences.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What the Empire
in general and particular may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the preſent ſtate of
Affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44145:37"/>
The Advantages the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits procured
themſelves, by the late War,
have not been ſo great as they
promiſed themſelves, for God
having preſerved the United
Provinces, whoſe utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they had projected; 'tis
certain, moſt of their Projects
in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, were
defeated: Yet the Advantages of
the Papacy over the Proteſtant
Party, in the late War, are very
conſiderable; and conſiſt in five
Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the fire of War,
kindled by the Artifices of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Jeſuits, between <hi>England</hi>
and the United Provinces; thoſe
two Proteſtant Powers have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
conſumed very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Forces in Men, Money, Ships,
Ammunition, and loſs of Trade,
the Soul and Subſtance of the
Riches of both Countries.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:44145:37"/>
2. That the <hi>United Provinces</hi>
have in defence of themſelves
againſt <hi>France</hi> and its Allies in
<hi>Germany,</hi> been forced to ſpend
their Men and their Money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
loſs of Trade during the
War.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>Swede, Denmark,
Brandenbourgh,</hi> and <hi>Zell,</hi> have
conſumed their Forces during all
this War, kindled by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the ſame Party, between
<hi>Swede,</hi> and the three Princes of
<hi>Denmark, Brandenbourgh,</hi> and
<hi>Lunenbourgh,</hi> both by Sea and
Land.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That under pretence of
this War, the Proteſtant States
of the Empire, as well during
the Campaignes as by Winter-Quarters,
have been miſerably
harraſſed and exhauſted with
Exactions, Burnings, Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to that degree, that moſt
of the Proteſtant Imperial
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44145:38"/>
Towns are almoſt ruined; and
ſeveral of them as well as the
<hi>Palatinate,</hi> and other Countries,
out of hopes of recovery in an
Age; while the Hereditary
Countries, and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and
many other places of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion in the Empire, have
been preſerved as the Apple of
an Eye, or ſo little oppreſt they
ſcarce feel it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That <hi>France</hi> by this War,
having conquered the County
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and kept it by the
Peace free from Condition of
Exchange, it is to be obſerv'd,
that whereas this Province, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
heretofore to <hi>Spain,</hi>
was, by reaſon of its diſtance
from the heart of that Kingdom,
not in a condition to hurt the
Proteſtant Cantons of the
<hi>Swiſſes;</hi> now that it belongs to
<hi>France,</hi> we art not to flatter
our ſelves, but it belongs to a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44145:38"/>
Power which may every hour
make a ſudden irruption into
the Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi> and under
the ſpecious pretence of Religion
put the Proteſtant and Roman
Cantons in diſorder, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
work their inevitable ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;
unleſs that Republick have
the Courage and Judgment to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into confederacy with thoſe
that ought to preſerve it from
deſtruction, which the building
the Fortreſs of <hi>Hunningen,</hi> may
ſufficiently inſtruct them, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
intended them.</p>
               <p>I reckon all theſe to be real
advantages the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
and the Jeſuits have by the laſt
War procur'd themſelves againſt
the Proteſtant Party: For where
reſolution is taken to ruine
an Enemy under ſeveral heads,
the beſt way to effect it, is to
divide the Powers, and engage
them as much as may be in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44145:39"/>
War, one againſt another, to
the Conſumption of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and to fortifie your ſelf on
their Frontiers, that you may
make ſudden Inroads into their
Countries when you pleaſe:
The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
by the Acceſs they have had
to the Council of <hi>France,</hi> and
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and by the
help of the Counſellors there,
and in the Proteſtant Courts,
have with great dexterity put
theſe Maxims in practice during
the late War: For His Majeſty
of <hi>Swedland,</hi> managed by <hi>France,</hi>
His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark,</hi> His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral
Highneſs of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
and His Highneſs of <hi>Zell,</hi>
managed by the Imperial Court,
will take the pains to ſearch
to the bottom, by what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Artifices they have
been all four engaged in a War,
which hath ruined their Eſtates
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44145:39"/>
for more than ten years. I
doubt not (with the reſpect and
ſubmiſſion that is due to them)
but they will find that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Romans</hi> have with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
and perfidiouſneſs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
upon them what the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Romans</hi> did for divertiſement
to their Gladiators: for when
theſe men had by bloody, and
oftentimes mortal Combats, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
diverted the Spectators,
and the Magiſtrate made them
a Sign to give out, they were
bound to do it, and in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſoever they were to go
every one home, as theſe four
Princes were in the end forced
to do. This may ſerve for an
excellent and important inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for <hi>England, Holland, Swede</hi>
and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
States and Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to avoid effectually the
ſnares the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> every
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44145:40"/>
day lays for them the ways I
have obſerved, with a ſetled
deſign to deſtroy not only their
Religion but their Temporal
Eſtates.</p>

               <p>The Advantages the Court of
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits propoſed
to themſelves by the concluſion
of the Peace between his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty and <hi>France,</hi> may be
reduced to three principal
Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Maxims obſerved
in the firſt part of my Letter, to
fix (without danger of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
variation) the Deſigns of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Efforts of their
Arms, againſt the Empire and
Northern Countries, as moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from <hi>Italy,</hi> and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
by the progreſs of thoſe
Arms to ruine the Proreſtant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44145:40"/>
Party and conſequently to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the re-eſtabliſhment of the
Papal Grandeur and Authority,
the fall of the one producing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
the exaltation of the
other. And for attaining this
end, to procure this Peace to be
ſo made, that his moſt Chriſtian
Majeſty might be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the
Jeſuits (in prejudice to all other
Powers of Chriſtendom) ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing more than his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and an effectual ſetling
and eſtabliſhing in time an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Monarchick Authority over
<hi>Europe:</hi> And that this project
might be made appear ſo facil and
eaſie to this Prince that he might
be the better tempted to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it: In order to theſe ends,
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits
could not have done any thing
whereby more effectually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
their zeal and cloſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44145:41"/>
adherence to the Grandeur and
Exaltation of the moſt Chriſtian
King, than by making (as they
have done with ſo much craft
and perfidiouſneſs) a Sacrifice of
the Emperour and Empire (with
all that concerned the Glory and
Intereſt of both) the better to
carry on the Deſigns of the
<hi>French:</hi> Their project in this
particular hath proved ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and diſcover'd ſo many
diviſions, ſo much ignorance,
weakneſs, and baſeneſs, in the
Empire, that his moſt Chriſtian
Majeſty may by theſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
rationally judge he may
probably ſucceed in whatever
he ſhall attempt againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
(though I am not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he will find it ſo eaſie a
matter as he hath been made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'tis.) But we are to believe
this Prince is perſwaded, that
to attain all his ends, the Empire
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44145:41"/>
being the natural obſtacle againſt
an Univerſal Monarchy, it muſt
be his buſineſs to attempt the
Empire in the firſt place. Nor
can it be doubted, but the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits, making
full account the moſt Chriſtian
King will be very well able by
his Forces to maſter the Empire,
have haſtened with all diligence
poſſible the ſigning the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Imperial Majeſty and
<hi>France,</hi> upon deſign that his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty being by this
expedient of the Peace free from
War, in caſe the perpetual Plots
of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Jeſuits in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere,
ſhould be ſo proſperous, as, with
the help of Forreign aid, to effect
the re-eſtabliſhment of the Popes
Authority there, they might
make uſe of the <hi>French</hi> Forces
to invade that Kingdom, or other
Countries, for the ends I have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44145:42"/>
mentioned: And if by Gods

damnable Conſpiracy of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
againſt the King the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and State of <hi>England</hi> had
not been diſcovered the laſt
year, I believe <hi>England</hi> had e're

Country which may unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
procure <hi>France</hi> the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Dominion of the Sea, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44145:42"/>
of Trade, and the Conqueſts of
the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> according to
their ancient and primitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and
the Jeſuits having that influence
over the Imperial Council, that
it was in their power to do what
they pleaſed there, there is no
doubt but the ſigning of the
Peace was preſt on this farther
deſign, that His Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
(the Peace concluded) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf in a condition to
diſpoſe of the greateſt part of his
Forces, they might eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to employ them to
root out the Proteſtant Party in
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and perfect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformation in <hi>Sileſia:</hi>
And it was well for that People
that God provided for their
ſafety by very extraordinary
means, I mean the Plague; for
had not that broken out, it is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44145:43"/>
not credible but <hi>Dunewald</hi> the
Apoſtate, now a formal Creature
of the Jeſuits, had been ſent
thither with an Army to do
ſomething. Happy would it
be for His Imperial Majeſty, if
by juſt and ſolid Reflections on
the Diſaſters ſucceſſively fallen
upon his Auguſt Family, for
having too much eſpouſed the
violent and cruel paſſions of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuits,
and by conſidering this Scourge
of God which hath forced him
to quit his Capital City, and in
a manner follows him viſibly
wherever he goes, he would
be ſenſible the Hand of God is
not ſtretched out againſt him,
as heretofore againſt <hi>David,</hi> for
his Sin, but becauſe he hath
ſtretched out his hand to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the only Congregations of
Chriſtians in his Dominions,
whoſe Worſhip is not infected
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44145:43"/>
with Idolatry, and who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Precepts of the
Goſpel adore the Soveraign
and Supreme Creator in Spirit
and in Truth. But far happier
ſhould His Imperial Majeſty be,
if by ſuch reflections God would
give him the Grace, as he did to
the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
before de died, to acknowledge
and own the Truth he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes;
and (ſetting aſide Policy)
embrace generouſly the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. God Almighty would
then certainly bleſs him, and 'tis
credible he would not deny him
the Power to humble the Proud,
and thoſe who by their enormous.
Ambition, put all <hi>Europe</hi> into
Combuſtion. I beg your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Pardon for this Digreſſion;
which the Matter I treat of, and

               <head>The Third Point.</head>
               <p>To make ſome ſolid Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
in a matter ſo dilicate,
I ſay, as to what the Empire in
general and particular is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the preſent ſtate of
affairs; we are to believe his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty (unleſs
notably changed in his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
would boldly and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
carry on his buſineſs, I
mean his pretenſion to make his
Son, the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
His Marriage with the
Princeſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Envoys
and magnificent Preſents he
ſends to the Electoral Courts of
<hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and
his arming ſo furiouſly, ſignifie
ſufficiently two things. Firſt,
His Contempt of the Alliances
and Oppoſitions His Imperial
Majeſty may make againſt him.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44145:44"/>
Secondly, That he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purſue his pretenſion. 'Tis of
extream importance for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in general and particular to
know, whether it be for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the Empire to favour this
pretenſion, or to oppoſe it. This
with your Highneſſes leave, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
briefly to examine; and to
obſerve ſome order: It is to be
conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether it be better for the
Empire in general, and every
Member of it in particular, to
live according to the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
Rights and Priviledges, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they have lived for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages; or that the Empire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtriking a blow, ſubmit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to the Yoke of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which acknowledges no
Law, but that of a Power purely
Deſpotical and Abſolute?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a Dependent on the
former Point, Whether it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44145:45"/>
as to the Revolutions ſince
the Wars for Religion, that the
Empire live occording to the
Concordats and Agreements in
the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> or <hi>Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brug,</hi>
and the laſt Capitulations
with His Imperial Majeſty ſince
his Election: or without regard
to the one, or the other, that
the Empire engage anew in a
Civil War, which by a final Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
may decide the Quarrel in
favour of one of the parties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Concordats, and
thoſe two Treaties of Peace, or
the late Capitulations, as if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
agreed or capitulated?</p>
               <p>I think it the more neceſſary
to examine before hand theſe
Points, for that we may hold it for
certain.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="point">
               <head>As to the firſt Point.</head>
               <p>In caſe the <hi>Dauphin</hi> be ever E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44145:45"/>
King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that
from the days of that Election,
whatever Capitulations ſhall be
ſigned to the contrary, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire will be annexed to,
and made an Hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
To juſtifie this, you need only
read ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Authors, who
have treated of the Rights and
pretenſions of <hi>France,</hi> upon the
Empire, particularly that of the
Advocate <hi>Awbrey;</hi> for though
he hath with good reaſon been
laughed at for his Writings, yet
if that Election take effect, we
ſhall find his diſcourſe ſolid and
well grounded. Beſides, you may
ſoberly weigh what <hi>France</hi> hath
already practiſed upon that part
of the Empire which hath fallen
to its ſhare, and the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parts, both in Temporals and
Spirituals: as to the Temporal
Concerns, <hi>France</hi> ſeizes all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44145:46"/>
and openly in the Face of the
Sun, without pretence of other
Law, or Right, but that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and confidence, as it would
take poſſeſſion of any ancient
Patrimony of that Crown: The
Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Deuxponts,
Mentbeleuard,</hi> and the Ten free
Towns of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> ſufficiently
prove this; as to Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
you need only read the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ordinance of the Biſhop of
<hi>Metz</hi> againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of
thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>For the Clergy in general, all
the free Chapters of the Empire,
whether Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops,
Abbots, Deans, or Priors, may
aſſure themſelves, if this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
take place, they muſt go to
<hi>France</hi> e're they come to thoſe
Dignities; for to imagine the
free Suffrages of the Chapters
ſhall be continued, is ſortiſhneſs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44145:46"/>
and folly. The Biſhopricks of
<hi>Metz, Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and (I
doubt not for the future) <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
which were heretofore Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
of the Empire, may
teach us that under a <hi>French</hi>
Government the only way to
thoſe Dignities is by a Writ of
Preſentation by the Kings, and
conſequently all that ſeek or
depend on thoſe Biſhopricks muſt
be Courtiers and Slaves. Not
but that I believe if the Dauphin
be choſen King of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
his Council is too cunning not
to make him promiſe expreſly to
maintain the Privileges and
Eccleſiaſtical Benefices of the
Empire: And that till he be fully
ſetled they may be content to
write Letters to the Chapters to
chuſe the perſon the Court ſhall
recommend, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
there will be no fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal:
Yet this courſe is not to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44145:47"/>
be expected to hold ten Years to
an end: Which I believe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that <hi>France</hi> pretends
(as hath been declared at large
by ſeveral politick Treatiſes)
that moſt of the great Benefices
in <hi>Germany</hi> have been founded
by Emperors, Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
and that conſequently the Court
of <hi>France</hi> is the true Patron of
them.</p>
               <p>The Princes of the <hi>Empire,</hi>
Eccleſiaſtical and temporal, of
what Rank or Degree ſoever,
may from the day of that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
provide for three things
which will certainly follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt they ſhall be reduced to
the natural Rents and Revenues
of their ancient Patrimonies,
which cannot with Probability
be denied to depend upon the
ancient Kingdom of <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi>
(which the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi>
ſuppoſe to be part of the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44145:47"/>
Monarchy) and conſequently all
natural Rights there being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Law <hi>Salique,</hi> admit
neither of Alienation nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.
For as to the Taxes
and Contributions now paid
theſe Lords by their Vaſſals and
Subjects, there is no doubt but
they will be obliged to diſclaim
them, and conſent with a very
good Will, that the Head of the
Empire ſhall in this Caſe Order
what Taxes and Exactions he
pleaſe to be Levied, and all for his
uſe: To pretend Capitulations or
Reaſons to the contrary, will be
to inſiſt on Trifles, or commence
Suits to be decided only by Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Execution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They will be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
it being againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the policy of <hi>France,</hi> to
permit any Prince, or Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Dominion, to have the
Power to defend himſelf by force,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44145:48"/>
be his Right to do ſo never ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and authentick.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To gain the favour
of the Head of the <hi>Empire,</hi> the
Head of every Houſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Princes muſt actually wait
on His Imperial Majeſty at an
exceſſive Expence, or ſend in his
ſtead his Brothers or Sons to
make his Court, or to receive
Orders and Careſſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Repulſes and Checks: And
the Empire being full of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Jealouſies, there is cauſe
enough to fear the Princes will
ſtrive who ſhall be moſt Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as the Princes and other
Great men of <hi>France</hi> have done,
to their utter Ruin, and total
Conſumption of their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>As for the Counts, and Barons,
and all Gentlemen of the <hi>Empire,</hi>
who are Vaſſals to Electors and
particular Princes, my Heart
bleeds to think how certainly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44145:48"/>
and ſtrangely their Condition
will be chang'd, if ever a <hi>French</hi>
King be made Emperour. Is it
probable the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi>
will have more pity of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Nobility and Gentry, than
the Dukes, Marqueſſes, Counts,
Barons and particular Nobility of
their own Country have found at
their hands? There is no doubt
but the day they change their
Maſter, they muſt bid an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Adieu to all their Rights of
Soveraign Juſtice and Free-hold:
The Great Men and private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>France,</hi> ſeveral of whom
have the Honour to be deſcended
in a right Line from Soveraign
Princes, had no leſs Courage, nor
were heretofore leſs Priviledged,
nor leſs Jealous of their Rights,
than many of the Body of the
<hi>Empire</hi> are at this preſent. Yet
have they been forc'd one after
another to ſubmit to the Yoke,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44145:49"/>
and loſe all their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges:
Nor muſt they think any
more (though they have right)
to lay any impoſition on their
Subjects. For (as I ſaid before
in the Article of the Princes;)
This is a ſweet bit, which the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and Deſpotical Dominion
of <hi>France</hi> always reſerves for it's
own Tooth. They muſt never
think more by Offices and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
under particular
Princes, or the Head of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
to render themſelves conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
make their Fortunes, or
Recover their ſpent Eſtates, as
they could have done heretofore:
At leaſt but few of them ſhall
be ever able to do it. For as to
particular Princes, they will in
caſe of a <hi>French</hi> Emperour be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ruin'd, and forc'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
themſelves and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to a very low Condition;
and as to the Head of the <hi>Empire,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:44145:49"/>
whoever will have Office or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in his Houſe or Courts
of Juſtice, muſt think of buying
it with ready Money, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not an Office or Imployment
in the <hi>French Kings</hi> Houſe, from
the Steward of his Houſe to the
Scullion in his Kitchen, nor in
his Courts of Juſtice, from that
of Chief Preſident to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Serjeant, but is ſold for ready
Money. So that there remains
not for the Nobility and Gentry
of the <hi>Empire,</hi> any Office or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
but what muſt be bought,
ſave only the Military: But the
Nobility and Gentry of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
are too Judicious, (at leaſt,
unleſs (as the <hi>French</hi> Proverb is)
<hi>They are willing to be taken for
Fools,)</hi> not to know they have
no reaſon to promiſe themſelves
in this particular of Military
Employment, any greater Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
than is allow'd the ancient
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44145:50"/>
Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that to procure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Prince or his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Miniſters, they muſt ſerve
in the Wars at their own Charge,
as the <hi>French</hi> Nobility have done.
The neceſſary Expences of every
Office exceeding yearly, by three
fourths, the pay of the Prince:
That is, they moſt reſolve to
conſume the Bulk of their Eſtates
to be known at Court, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſpend a real Patrimony
in purſuit of vain and chimerical
hopes, which will infallibly Ruin
their Families; and bring moſt
of thoſe who take theſe Courſes
to end their lives in Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Griefs and cruel Repentings:
For thus it is, all the Nobility of
<hi>France</hi> ſerve in the Wars, and
ſuch is the end moſt of them
make. If we have heard of a
<hi>Schomberg</hi> or a <hi>Ranſan</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
conſiderable in <hi>France</hi> by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44145:50"/>
the Wars. Let the Nobility of
the <hi>Empire</hi> be aſſur'd it was but a
<hi>Lure</hi> which the Miniſters of
<hi>France</hi> (who have long ſince
Plotted the Conqueſt of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)</hi>
thought fit to hold out to
Delude and Cheat the <hi>German</hi>
Nobility: They are like the Fires
in the Night that lead them
into <hi>Precipices,</hi> who are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
enough to follow them:
All this I know to be true, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on very Authentick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,
and certain knowledge of
the matters I mention.</p>
               <p>As for the Imperial Towns
and free Cities of the <hi>Empire,
Colmar, Schleſtat,</hi> and <hi>Haguenau,</hi>
and the reſt of that Rank, ſituate
in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> may teach their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Councils, what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> put
upon their ancient Rights and
Priviledges, for thoſe are the
things the Miniſters there, or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44145:51"/>
their Envoys under the name of
Commiſſaries or Intendants, call
in Deriſion Stories to make one
Sleep, Illuſions, and Old Wives
Tales, that is, things nothing
worth. If ever <hi>France</hi> come to

                  <p>All theſe Subſidies, and many

way or other punctually paid,
where-ever any Subjects of the

to hold free from Impoſition ſo
many Acres of Land, for their
Maintenance, as may be Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
with two Yoke of Oxen,
(provided the Owner hold that
Eſtate in Demean) for as to
what is let out to Farmers, as
they pay the King Taxes for the

much the leſs Rent to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord;
ſo that in effect the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44145:54"/>
Subjects of the Empire, of what

theſe intollerable Subſidies. The

the Princeſs of <hi>Brvaria</hi>'s
Confeſſor, intimating ſufficiently
the extraordinary Credit that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety

<hi>France:</hi> I ſay, if ever the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
be elected King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
the Empire is to expect
two things. Firſt, To ſee him
at the Head of the beſt Forces of
<hi>France,</hi> (upon the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religion, and reſtoring
the Eſtates belonging to the
Church) undertaking in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44145:56"/>
aganſt the Proteſtant Party
what <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
the Second attempted to
execute. Secondly, That this affair
will be ſo obſtinately fomented &amp;
protected by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that the Empire will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be involved in a War
more cruel, more bloody, and
dangerous, than any the former
Wars raiſed for that Cauſe. And
there is reaſon enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the late War, as well
as the Peace ſince made, were
hatched and carried on by the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able, by the Power of the
<hi>French</hi> Forces, to work the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Ruin of the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Europe,</hi> which we ſee every
day decay by degrees: And I
am much miſtaken if the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
ſent by the Pope into <hi>Poland</hi>
was not deſign'd for a Project of
this nature. Prince <hi>William</hi> of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44145:56"/>
                  <hi>Furſtenberg</hi> might, if he pleaſed,
furniſh us with clear Evidence
of authentick <hi>Memoirs</hi> to this
purpoſe; but we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it from him, leſt by ſuch a
Diſcovery he loſe the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> deſigns
him for the Pains he hath taken,
and continues, to bring to effect
this Popiſh Project in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and conſequently in all
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, your
Highneſs may ſee the Fortune of
the Empire, if ever it fall (by any
means whatever) under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Yoke of the Deſpotical
Government of <hi>France:</hi> And I
think I need ſay no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
every Member of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and all the States of it in
general, (without any great
depth of Policy, or knowledge
of War) what their Duty to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
their Glory and Intereſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44145:57"/>
oblige them to do, for preſerving
themſelves from falling under a
Yoke of that nature.</p>
               <p>But to preſerve themſelves
effectually from this Yoke, I
conceive it extremely conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to enquire firſt, Whence all
this Miſchief proceeds? Which
known, will give us light what
muſt further be done: And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
from what Part the
firſt Attack may be expected,
and what Defence is to be made.</p>
               <p>The Miſchiefs I have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unqueſtionably have their
riſe from the Deſigns and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who (at preſent
at leaſt) direct and diſpoſe of the
<hi>French</hi> Projects and Forces, and
without any Mercy or Reſpect,
pretend, with the Aſſiſtance of
thoſe Forces, and their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Managements of Affairs, to
ſacrifice all to the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44145:57"/>
of the Papal Grandeur.</p>
               <p>I conceive in Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
two things are to be done;
but I doubt much whether the
one will be. The firſt is, That
ſince the Publick Good and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Empire conſiſts in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(without Innovation) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Ancient Rights,
Immunities, and Privelidges, and
the Concordats eſtabliſhed by
Law, (which every Member of
the Empire is obliged to obſerve)
and that the Pretenſions of the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
are as inconſiſtent as thoſe of
<hi>France,</hi> with the Publick Good
and ſafety of the Empire: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Member of the Empire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
flattering themſelves any
longer with hopes of Favour
from <hi>Rome</hi> or from <hi>France,</hi> and
without diſtinction of Religion,
applying themſelves ſeriouſly to
procure and promote the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44145:58"/>
and Publick Good of the
Empire, ſhould without delay
take ſuch Meaſures, that neither
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
nor <hi>France,</hi> may attain their
Ends. And in order to this,
That every Member of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
ſhould put it ſelf into a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
and Condition, by uniting
their Forces, to oppoſe Force to
Force: And if the Princes of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Communion will <hi>Bona
fide</hi> engage in this Union, it will
be neceſſary, firſt, That his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty find means to
gain the Amity and Aſſiſtance
of the three Northern Princes
whom I have formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
engag'd in War by his
means, and afterwards cruelly
abandon'd to the Mercy of
<hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Swede:</hi> Which (by
the ſmall Intelligence I have of
Affairs) will be difficult enough
to effect, eſpecially with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44145:58"/>
of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> without
giving him ſatisfaction in two
Points, on which he doth with
much equity inſiſt. Secondly,
That his Imperial Majeſty gain
over to the Intereſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
the Forces of the Crown of
<hi>Swede;</hi> which will be no eaſie
Task. Thirdly, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and all the Princes of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Communion in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
baniſh and root out of their
Councils not only all <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
and <hi>Monks,</hi> (who by themſelves
or their Superiors have all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
to their General at <hi>Rome)</hi>
but every one that any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on, or hath Society with
theſe Hypocrites, or rather Free
Spies of the Empire; a <hi>Capuchin</hi>
in this particular being as bad as
a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> Though this be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary, as matters now
ſtand, yet (to ſpeak freely) I very
much doubt whether the Princes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44145:59"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion will
have the Generoſity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to do it.</p>
               <p>The Second, and that I take
to be the only ſolid means, is,
That the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party being
now clearly convinc'd that they
are the ſole Perſons aim'd at, and
that all that hath been done ſince
the beginning of the laſt War
was really in order onely to
work their Deſtruction; all
Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates
of that perſuaſion are every one
in his Sphere to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with all induſtry and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
firſt, To Arm with all their
Power, that they may be able
to oppoſe Force to Force: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
To enter into mutual
Leagues and Alliances, that by
joynt Strength they may resiſt
Forces ſo conſiderable as thoſe of
<hi>France,</hi> and others the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> may by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44145:59"/>
their Artifices bring over to that
party. To begin ſo great and
neceſſary a Work, we will for a
while leave the Territories of
the Empire; and looking abroad,
I am of opinion that <hi>England</hi>
and the <hi>United Provinces</hi> ought
without further delay to uſe all
means poſſible to enter into a
League Offenſive and Defenſive,
which may (if poſſible) be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble;
That <hi>Denmark</hi> and
<hi>Swede</hi> are to follow that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and, That all the <hi>Proteſtant
Princes</hi> and States of the Empire,
with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cantons of
the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and the <hi>Griſons,</hi> ought
to do the like: For, 'tis not a
Concern of particular Quarrels
and Jealouſies, but the Faith, the
Religion and Temporal Eſtates
of all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party are
now at ſtake. This I conceive
will be more eaſily effected in
this Conjuncture, for that by a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44145:60"/>
ſpecial Providence of God there
is no War at preſent between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> nor
between the Princes of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Communion in <hi>Germany.</hi>
If theſe three things be effected,
and the particular Leagues incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into a General, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
an intire Union of the
<hi>Proteſtants of Europe,</hi> we need
not fear the Deſigns or Attempts
of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
or the Council and Forces
of the <hi>French:</hi> for (theſe things
effected) we ſhall have power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
not only to deliver the
Empire from all juſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Deſigns of the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi>
againſt its Liberties, but to reduce
his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> (by way
of juſtice &amp; right) to keep himſelf
modeſtly within the Frontiers of
his Kingdom, and (in caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44145:60"/>
to do ſomething more;
which would infallibly produce
a ſure and general Peace.</p>
               <p>I am the more induced to be
of this Opinion, while <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> on the one hand,
and <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> on the
other, are labouring to put an
end to all former Quarrels; and
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of the Empire endeavour
(as I ſuppoſe) a League with the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cantons and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
that (to ſay the truth) I ſee
no other ſolid and effectual
Means to defend the Empire
from the Oppreſſion of <hi>France,</hi>
and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
from the Oppreſſion of
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> all at once: For, (to
rid our Hands of all falſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
at once) What elſe can the
Empire and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
ground their Safety up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44145:61"/>
Will they ground it on His
Imperial Majeſty, as they ought,
and without doubt might have
done, had his Council been gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with right and ſound Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims?
I cannot think, after all
that his Council have cauſed him
to do publickly, and what he
ſtill continues to put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party,
that any rational perſon of that
party can expect the leaſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
on that ſide, at leaſt as long
as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
have that Credit, that Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Support they have
now in his Court. And that we
have little reaſon to hope this
Prince will rid himſelf of them,
who have dangerouſly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Underſtanding and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
by their Education of him,
and the prejudices inſtilled into
him. And ſhould the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
on this occaſion expect help
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44145:61"/>
from the Court of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as
their Intereſt in the Empire ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them, we may very well
imagin the expectation will be
vain, if we conſider the late
ſtrict Alliance of that Court
with <hi>France,</hi> or the ridiculous
Monaſtick Bigotry reigning in
that Court. If then you will
rely on the Eccleſiaſtical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who knows not their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,
and that the greater
part of them will do nothing but
what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhall inſinuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them?</p>
               <p>So that for the future (as well
as the time paſt, at leaſt, for the
laſt Age, and more) the Natural
Defence of the Empire hath (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God) no ſolid Ground, but
the Forces and Induſtry of the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party. It was that
Party ſaved it from the intended
Oppreſſion of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>
in former times: And in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44145:62"/>
the late War, when <hi>France</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to Maſter it by its
Arms and Intrigues, it was the
ſame Party not only preſerved
the Empire, but the Emperor,
from the Yoke of the <hi>French.</hi>
And it will be the ſame Party
which (by the Grace of God)
ſhall eaſily preſerve it for the
future; at leaſt, if the Potentates
of that Party, or the greater
part of them, apply themſelves
to do what I conceive they are
obliged to.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak plainly, and make
appear the neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
League and Confederacy,
we are to conſider; His Imperial
Majeſty will either effectually
perform what he ought in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Empire, by ſaving
himſelf from falling under the
Dominion of <hi>France;</hi> or that he
will do nothing but in ſhew and
appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:44145:62"/>
If His Imperial Majeſty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
as he ought, againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
of <hi>France,</hi> ſuch a League
can never be more ſeaſonably
made to ſecond the Imperial
Forces; nor can His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in that caſe rely on any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(the Nature of the Quarrel
conſidered) that will be more
true to him than thoſe of the
<hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if His Imperial Majeſty
intend meerly to look on, as
unconcerned, and not to engage
really and effectually againſt the
<hi>French</hi> Deſigns, which he is ſo
highly concerned to oppoſe,
there can be no doubt, but the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
have ſecretly carried on a cloſe
Intelligence and private League
between their Imperial and Moſt
Chriſtian Majeſties, for the Ruin
and Deſtruction of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
Party; and, That by ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44145:63"/>
private and myſterious Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Eſtate in the
Empire, or on the Frontiers, in
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> or <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi>
is, according to their Project, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
a Recompence to the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> for the Dukedoms of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barre,</hi> which <hi>France</hi>
hath taken from him, and hath
no mind to reſtore. And by a
captious Contrivance of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party in the
Empire ſhall find it ſelf at once
aſſaulted by the united Forces of
their Imperial and moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Majeſties (who are both of a
Communion.) I leave to your
Highneſs to judge, how much it
concerns the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party, by
the Induſtry and Union I have
mentioned, to prevent ſo great
and dangerous an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>My Suſpicion of His Imperial
Majeſty is the greater, for that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44145:63"/>
it is notorious there are in the
Society of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Men of ſeveral
ſorts; ſome of whom are diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with not onely to lay aſide
the Habit of their Order, but to
Marry, and bear all ſorts of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Dignities: And that if
his Imperial Majeſty was in his
younger days, out of too great
a zeal for his Religion, unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engag'd in this Order, under
the Diſpenſations I ſuppoſe, there
is no cauſe left for wonder at his
Proceedings againſt the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi>
For, though he had been
but of the <hi>Lower Order,</hi> which
is that wherein Marriage is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and a Capacity allowed
of bearing Offices and Dignities;
yet as to all other things, and
particularly in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he muſt have been under
the Obedience of the General of
the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and conſequently
obliged to make Peace and War,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44145:64"/>
as the General of the Society
ſhould judge moſt convenient
for the Intereſt of the Pope and
the Society. The continual War
this Prince makes againſt the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary,</hi>
contrary to all the Maxims and
Rules of ſound Policy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Priviledges (one of
his Miniſters told me, and I am
otherwiſe well aſſured) he hath
ſworn to that Nation; the vaſt
Gifts he hath beſtowed on the
Society in <hi>Bohemia, Sileſia, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
Moravia,</hi> and generally in
all his Hereditary Countries;
with his ſhameful ſigning the
late Peace, in prejudice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all his Treaties with the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, ſmells rankly
of an Obedience which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
no Obligation, nor owns
any Rule of Juſtice or Piety, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the abſolute Command
of his Superior. And I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44145:64"/>
in this Prince, as to his
manner of Living, and conſtant
Attendance at <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Muſick, and Pilgrimages,
ſometimes to one Relique, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to another, with all that
may make out his natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
inclinations, that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way convince this Opinion of
miſtake.</p>
               <p>So that if it be ſo, (as to ſpeak
the truth) I very much ſuſpect
it is; and I am not alone in this
Suſpicion: I leave it to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Empire in general,
and the Proteſtants in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
what ground they have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
on, or expectany Succour or
Aſſiſtance from the Head of the
Empire: For, in caſe this prove
true, ſhould his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
promiſe and deſign effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to aſſiſt the Proteſtants, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Common Liberty;
yet if on the morrow the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44145:65"/>
of the Society ſhould order
him, for ſome greater Good,
(which, according to their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
conſiſts frequently in a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,
a Poyſoning, or Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to joyn at a preciſe Day
and place his Arms to thoſe of
<hi>France,</hi> for the entire extirpation
of the Proteſtant Party in the
Empire, there is no doubt but
this Prince would be obliged to
do it, either on the account of
Obedience due to his General,
or for fear the Society, in caſe of
his diſobedience, ſhould diſpatch
him, as they did by themſelves,
or their Emiſſaries, <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third and Fourth in <hi>France,</hi> Don
<hi>Carlos</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of
<hi>Weymar</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and lately
the Illuſtrious Princeſs of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck,</hi>
ſecond Wife of that Prince,
the laſt Duke of <hi>Brieg</hi> in <hi>Sileſia:</hi>
or as they have newly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do againſt his Majeſty of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44145:65"/>
                  <hi>Great Britain.</hi> For Incendiaries,
Aſſaſſins, and Murderers are the
faithful Servants and inſeparable
Inſtruments of that bleſſed Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Your Highneſs will not be
ſurpriz'd at the vehement Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
I have expreſt of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Majeſty, when you have
conſidered, there have been two
Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> of that Order,
and that <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of
<hi>Spain</hi> did (out of Policy) cauſe
himſelf to be enrolled amongſt
them. But the Order of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
is compos'd (as others) of
two ſorts of People, whom Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
diſtinguiſh by the Names
of <hi>Directors</hi> and <hi>Directed:</hi> And we
are to obſerve, the two Kings of
<hi>Poland</hi> were in this latter Claſs.
The former, by promoting too
zealouſly the Paſſions of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
having loſt the Kingdom
of <hi>Swede,</hi> to which he was Heir;
and the ſecond having by the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44145:66"/>
ſame means incurred the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
hatred and averſion of
the Nobility of <hi>Poland,</hi> to ſo
extream a degree, that to avoid
the threatning effects of it, he
was forced at laſt to quit his
Crown, from a Sovereign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Subject, and go end his
days in a ſtrange Country, with
no better a Character than that
of <hi>Abbot of St. German</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
But as for <hi>Philip</hi> the Second (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
matter of Conſcience aſide)
conſidering him only in quality
of a Politician<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I boldly aſſign
him a Place in the Claſs of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors;</hi>
for he <hi>directed</hi> his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ſo well, he miſt but little of
ſubduing <hi>France,</hi> and effectually
ſeiſed the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> as an Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant.
I am oblig'd, by the
Reſpect I bear his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
to leave it to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to think which of the two
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44145:66"/>
Claſſes he is to be rank'd in.</p>
               <p>But whether his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
be a Member of this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or not, I have ſaid enough to
make appear to your Highneſs
the abſolute neceſſity of a
League and Conſederacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Proteſtant Powers of
<hi>Europe,</hi> to enable them to defend
themſelves againſt the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Deſigns of their Enemies. I
will conclude with minding
your Highneſs, That this is the
Occaſion that calls upon you,
to ſhew to all the World your
zeal for your Religion, and the
Good of the Publick; And that
ſince my longer ſtay in this
Court will be uſeleſs, your
Highneſs will do me the Favour
to permit me to leave it as ſoon
as may be, that I may have the
honour to wait on your Moſt
Serene Perſon, and continue the
performance of my moſt humble

Services. To that happy time
I reſpite acquainting you with
many Particulars I dare not truſt
to Paper, (though altogether
confirming what I have moſt
confidently affirmed, as to the
moſt Eſſential Points of my
Letter.) And in hopes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſpeedily the honour of
