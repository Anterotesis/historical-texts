            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the CHRISTIAN READER, More particularly to the poor suffering <hi>Remnant</hi> of the CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR BRETHREN, and Companions in tribulation &amp; in the Kingdom &amp; patience of JESUS CHRIST,</p>
            <p>I make no other Apologie, for this my present addresse, than that it was amongst the last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, laid upon me, by the great, &amp; now glorified Author of this following treatise, (revised by himself, &amp; almost wholly printed before his death) to prefixe a few lines unto it, &amp; so send it out into the Church; that by it he being
<pb facs="tcp:51835:8"/>
dead might yet speake, particularly to his Brethren in tribulation, to whom living he was so comfortable, by holding forth light, sanctuary light, in their darknesses and difficulties, and now continues still to be, (after he hath no more a being amongst us) by pointing forth the way of life and strength, whereby the suffering saint (without succumbing or sinking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sorrow, misery and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may be made able to do all things, and endure all things, while he walks in that light. But, <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> while I obey the last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my dear Brother, I shall so far consult thy advantage, as not to keep thee back, by my tedious and tastlesse scrible, from the perusal of a peece, which not onely, as to thee, needs not my <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> For the <hi>First Part</hi> (long a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
               </gap>oe in thy hands) is a sufficient Epistle to this <hi>Second,</hi> with all who are in love
<pb facs="tcp:51835:8"/>
with, &amp; know the necessitie of the way of living by faith, which is the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans life, in this life; (for, till the day of immediat vision, and full fruition come, we must walk by faith, not by sight: O blessed walke, which brings with it joy unspeakeable, and full of glory! And so it must, since it is a walking with God; For as faith's first work is the association of the soul with him, so its next and after vvork is the assimilation of the soul to him; whereupon followes that neer, that sweet and dear fruition of him, which hath unspeakable joy, as its inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Companion, or native effect) But, the due, and deserved praise of the Author, is so much in the Church of Christ, as it needs not the Epistle of any else, to command it; For,</p>
            <p>First, If thou be not a stranger in our Israel, whoever thou be; then, if either eminency in grace or learning;
<pb facs="tcp:51835:9"/>
if vastnesse and pregnancy of parts; if fervor of zeal according to knowledge; if unvvearied diligence, in the work of the Lord, (wherein he laboured more aboundantly than any of us all; for no man in the Church of Scotland hath filled up his measure, even as to that: nor know, nor see I a man who is like to doe it, nay who is in capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for it;) If a holy heroick misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of men, and their estimation, in approving himself to God, by a ready and resolute withstanding the corruptions of his time, and opposing all these courses and contrivances, and these unworthy connivings, whereby the cause hath been prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea basely abandoned, and the free course and progresse of the Gospel obstructed; If single sollicitousnesse, and strenuous endeavours, how to have pure ordinances preserved in this generation, and propagat to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie: in a word, if faithfulnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:51835:9"/>
as a servant, in all the house, and matters of his God, even that God, who counted him faithful, and put him in the Ministery; and loyaltie to his princely Lord and Master, (the prerogatives of whose Crown, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of whose Kingdom, and the establishment of whose Throne, were more prized by him, more precious and dear unto him, than all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests whatsoever: nay, he was so far from reguarding any other interest, in respect of that alone valuable one; that, as he was never daunted, from a plain peremptorinesse in owning thereof, by the dread of poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, or the fear of what the stated enemy could doe unto him; so, he was never demurred, into a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or brow-beaten into a base and un - Ambassadour - becoming silence, by the displeasure and disconntenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, even of such of his Brethren, whom otherwise he loved, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:51835:10"/>
honoured, as to a plain contending with them, wherein he perceived them not to walk uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel, and to the former principles of that Church, while she retained first love, and did first works: Yea, he judged it duetie (and in this he had the mind of Christ) to contend earnestly with them, for their not earnest contendings for the Faith; though, for this, he should have been contemned, and accounted (as he was) a man of contention:) I say, if thou be such an one, to whom such a blessed Conjunction of rare Gifts, with such a rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful measure of Grace, can endear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man; I then nothing doubt, but MR BROWN, Great and Gracious MR BROWN, hath such a place in thy soul, and such a preference to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as thou wilt judge it superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in me, to say any thing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what the truely great Elijah of
<pb facs="tcp:51835:10"/>
his time (I mean of this present time, when, having served his generation, according to the will of God, he fell asleep,) the man jealous for the Lord God of Hosts, above all his Brethren, whom he hath left behind him, (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not one Soul, nor am I ashamed, or affraid to give it under my hand) doth here present thee with, as his farewell to the Saints, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ones, in whom he so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and for whose advantage he so much laid out himself, night and day, and for the work and cause of Christ his Lord; In so much as this his kindnesse to the Saints, and care of all the Churches, particularly that poor Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> keept him alwayes neer unto death, through his not reguarding his own life, to supply the lack of other mens service to Christ and to his Church: But, if thou be not such an one; then, as thou decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res thy self unworthy of what is here
<pb facs="tcp:51835:11"/>
presented, so thou canst not quarrel, if I be so far of the same opinion with thee, though I dare not but wish thee to be quickly of another mind. I know very well, this which is here hinted, of the excellent and savourie Author, will be unsavourie to some; yea, will incense not a few, who would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Masters in Israel who have been busie (while he was busied about the work of the Lord) in backbiting defaming &amp; reproaching him, &amp; that, because he withstood them all to the face, wherein they were, &amp; are justly to be blamed: But, I must lay my rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and have done it, with that, and many such things: Onely, by way of Apologie, I must tell such, that it is not my work, to engage with them, at present, on this head; they may exspect to hear of that afterward; yet next, till more come, I doe not crave their libertie or pardon to say, that it shall be amongst the posteritie (as it is

already with the more serious in this generation) a stain, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be vviped off the memorie of the reproachers, vvhen his memorie shall be blessed, and his cognizance, in the succeeding generations of the Church, shall be, that, in the day vvhen he fell a sleep, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was deprived of the most incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably able, and the most absolutly burning and shining light, belonging to that Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may be an appreciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and endearing consideration, unto thee, that this Treatise is not only the work of such a worthy vvorkman, such a Walker with God, such a Wrestler with him, such a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for his Master, and such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Disciple: But it is his last Work; this he wrote at the close of a long walk with God: For, in his walk with him, and after him, having by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found, there neither would,
<pb facs="tcp:51835:12"/>
nor could be courage, nor constancy nor comfort in that course, except faith were acting vigourously, upon its blessed object, that Fountain of all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, both for furniture &amp; frame, both for the light of direction &amp; consolation, and for a measure of life, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the emergent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, &amp; dangers, that are the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable attendants, of the duties of the present day: He was taught, by the things which he suffered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> all hands, to make a blessed, &amp; beneficial vertue of this necessitie, &amp; so he held on in his way, (being thus upheld and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without turning aside to the right hand, or the left, and without being diverted or deterred from following the Lord fully. The things that he suffered of late, especially at the hands of Brethren, (their shame, but his garland and glory) put him to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and learn the obedience of faith, wherein he was helped, and taught to
<pb facs="tcp:51835:12"/>
make such progresse, and proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as he enjoyed a sweet serenitie &amp; calme, in the midst of all these boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous blasts, which, out of all airths, blew in his face; but most bitterly out of that airth, whence the storme could, or should least of all have been exspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; so that, he did not onely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse his soul in patience, as moved by none of these things, which befell him, from foes or friends; but he was quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, quickened, and comforted in his conflictings; yea, he got meat out of the eater, out of weaknesse he was made strong, &amp; enabled to doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits as knowing his God: And finding the sweetnesse of this life, (otherwise of many sorrowes) and experiencing, how much he was enabled for all things, through Christ strengthening him, he was moved and constrained, from the aboundant furniture, the sweet facilitie, yea the begun felicitie he found in this life and course, to
<pb facs="tcp:51835:13"/>
point forth this way of pleasantnesse, and this path of peace, to such as are put to walke in the midst of trouble; that so they may finde, by following this course, the same Light arising to them in Darknesse; and the same life, strength, courage and comfort, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and communicat unto them, whereby they may be enabled to goe foreward, through all difficulties, all dangers, yea and all deaths. Hereby thou who, in the sight of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the sense of thy impotency, art made to say, <hi>What is my strength that I should hope?</hi> Art taught to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by another question, <hi>Since he is strong, why should I despond or doubt?</hi> For, all things are possible to him that believes, all difficulties are superable to faith; for, faith is the engaging of an Omnipotent God, for an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Creature, whereby the believer is more than a conquerour: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that stronger is he who is in the
<pb facs="tcp:51835:13"/>
believer, than he that is in the World, therefore, being, by him that dwells in him, strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and long suffering, with joyfulnesse, conquer he must; and this is the victorie, whereby he overcomes the World, even his faith; for faith's valour is, when overpowered, to cast it self and its burden upon God, who performeth all things for the believer; and so (how weake so ever in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; yet) by faith he carries away the conquerours Crovvn in the issue, and is set dovvn at last to sing, <hi>Thanks be to God who hath given me the victory.</hi> I say then, these are the last vvords, of a great Student in this blessed and mysterious art, and of a noble profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in this happie studie (for he speaks vvhat he knovves, he speakes vvhat he hath found and tasted) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing thee, hovv thou mayest with him hold on in thy vvay, and vvax
<pb facs="tcp:51835:14"/>
stronger and stronger; yea, hovv thou mayst surmount all difficulties, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervvise insuperable, as carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon eagles vvings; and run, vvith the greatest burden upon thy back, and not be vveary; and vvalk, vvith the greatest load upon thy loins, and not be faint. Naturalists, you knovv, and Mariners tell us of the flieing fish, vvhich, vvhen pursued in the vvater by the <hi>Shark,</hi> flies up into the air, as a foul, and so escapes the danger: But it can flee no longer in the air, than its fins continue vvet, and vvhen these become dry it falls down again into the sea: A lively embleme of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely Christian vvho, vvhen in hazard to be svvallovved up of trouble, and devoured by the teeth of sharks, mounts up above them upon eagles vvings, and so escaps them. But that vvhich vvaters these vvings, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by faith flies, and that vvhich gives it this vigour is fresh influence of the
<pb facs="tcp:51835:14"/>
Spirit: The supplie of the Spirit of Christ quicken's and strengthen's faith, and then failing and feeble faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news its strength, as the eagle renews her age: Its this which gives weake and withered faith a fresh, vigourous and youthful greennesse, and puts the beleever in case both to say, <hi>in God have I put my trust, I will not fear what flesh can doe unto me;</hi> and also, <hi>I am able for all things, through Christ vvho strenghtens me, or puts povver in me.</hi> Now the Authors scope and aim is to tell thee, and teach thee how thou mayest be expert in this noble flight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove trouble: (O happy dexteritie in a time of trouble upon earth, to know how to make use of faith's wings, in flieing heaven height, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the exercise of that blessed art, how to make use of thy faith, whereby thou pleases God in thy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie walk, for performing these high heroick acts, in the day of the most
<pb facs="tcp:51835:15"/>
dismal and deep distresse, whereby it is evident, that the sweetest ferenitie of soul, in the sadest &amp; most surprising of troubles, is possible to him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth!)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Books, and without an Epistle of of recommendation, is an Epistle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory sufficient, &amp; makes all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Reader to their perusal, a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous complement, an unprofitable waste of words, yea, &amp; a profuse expense of precious time, is, That what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor writs be not onely upright, and words of truth; But, that the truth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of be pertinent to the present day; &amp; the duty pressed be that which must be known, that it may be practised, when upon the real and right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof depends, in a particular manner more than the believers peace; yea, more than his soul, and eternal happinesse can amount uuto; Viz. the glorifying of God in the fires of fiery
<pb facs="tcp:51835:15"/>
trials, and the bringing up a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upon his vvayes, by a practical proof, that there is a sufficiency of strength communicable, whereby the weakest is made strong; and a singularitie of sweetnesse experienced, whereby a man, otherwise of sorrows can sing in the wayes of the Lord, even when his way lyes thorow fire &amp; water; so that he who hath taken hold of the path of life needs neither faint in the way, because of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, there being everlasting armes underneath, stronglie supporting; nor yet turn aside out of it, when there is a lyon in it; neither wearie in going foreward, through want of what is sweet and refreshing, since there is a well spring of comfort insured unto the walker in these wayes, so as in the greatest pinch and penurie, of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yea, when put to the greatest pain, he hath still everlasting consolation, and can glory in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:51835:16"/>
and rejoyce, not onely in the hope of the glory of God; but sing as alreadie in the suburbs of heaven, while under the shineings of his Masters face, and the shedings abroad of his love in the heart. And according to this rate and reckoning I may make bold to say; the mater herein treated of is of that moment, import &amp; present necessitie, as to draw the eyes of all men towards it, that their hearts may be cast into this mould, and they put in case to practise accordingly; for, this was the happie Authors scope; for this he wearied himself, and was at this peece of pains, (amongst his other eminent, singularly useful and assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labourings, for the edification of the Church, at home and abroad, the care of all which lay upon him) that thou mightest know how to finde ease, safetie and refreshment, when there seems nothing in thy life, but sorrow; and in thy cup, but gall and worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.
<pb facs="tcp:51835:16"/>
In a word, the Author hath written the first &amp; second part of the <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> that the Reader may write the third part in his practise, by making his life a transumpt of both, in a day when most are making ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of faith and a good conscience; and many<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who once professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Disciples, are now turning back: And, Alas, I am affraid, it shall be observed, and said of them, they walked no more with him; But, for their turnings aside unto these croaked courses, were led forth with the workers of iniquitie: So that this is a word in season seeing besides the native, and intrinsick beautie of truth, that commends what is said to thy peruseal<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the adventitious beautie of seasonablenesse endears it to thee; For he that writes it was a Preacher, who sought to finde out acceptable words, &amp; the tongue of the learned was given unto him; For, what he writs doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:51835:17"/>
that his eare vvas vvakened to hear as the learned, that so the might speak and vvrite as the learned.</p>
            <p>But, for a conclusion, I must tell thee, that the spiritually vvise, and zealous Author vvas not only dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to treat of this subject, because of the present pressurs of the poor rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, pressed out of measure, and beyond strength, (though he had this also in prospect) that so they might be quickened, quieted, encouraged and comforted, under these crushing calamities; and might be instructed, hovv to glorifie God, in this day of visitation; and endure the vvorlds hatred and the vvorst that either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Adversaries, or incensed friends can doe, as seeing him vvho is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and as believing, that all these shall vvork together for their good, and as assured that they shall turn to their salvation, through the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Mediator, and the supplie
<pb facs="tcp:51835:17"/>
of the Spirit of Jesus Christ: But, more particularly considering our vvay, and our proceeding from evil to vvorse; vvhat high affronts have been put upon our infinitly glorious Lord and Master; &amp; hovv these have not only not been resented and vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed against, vvith a zeal, a fervor of pure zeal proportioned to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fervidnesse, and unhallovved heat<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of that opposition to Christ, and hatred to the coming of his Kingdom in the World, vvitnessed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex of the adversaries course and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: But, Alas, to our shameful &amp; astonishing faint (vvhen called to have been valiant for the truth, and to have acquit ourselves as the good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Jesus Christ, ambitious to have been sacrificed upon the Interest of our Royal Master's glorious Crovvn, and Prerogative) hath been added, a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back; Courses have been taken, patronized and applauded, partly in

            <p>Believe it, my Brethren, all you have found is but the least part of
<pb facs="tcp:51835:20"/>
vvhat you have to fear, yea of what is inevitable: The fury of the Lord is ready to be poured forth as fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this generation; the day and hour approaches, wherein no man shall have any thing left him to allay his sorrovv, or comfort him in his anguish: But he vvho, being in Chist Jesus, is in case to oppose the Comforts of the Holy Ghost, and that everlasting Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in Christ, to present confounding and overwhelming cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; the oppressions, the horrid and bloody barbarities of enraged, cruel and blasphemous enemies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed into a madnesse against the followers of the Lamb, and thristing insatiably after the blood of the saints, who dare nor receive the mark of the beast; the tumult of incensed friends, the clashings, the contendings, the insurrections of brethren against bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will make our poor Land such a weary Land, as men shall be weary

of their lives, and wish to be gone from the evil day; yea, shall either seek for death, and not find it, or in agony and horrour, shall be found of death, and cannot flee from it. But Ã´ how in that day and hour will the sweet shadow, and the secure shelter of the rock of Ages revive, and refresh such as have accesse with boldnesse and confidence, to lay themselves down under it! they shall finde it that place indeed where the weary are at rest, they shall finde that this is the rest alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may cause their weary souls to rest, and that this is the refreshing too: such as believe in Christ Jesus, and dwell in him by faith, and delight in him by love, shall either not finde the evil of these dreadful dayes, which are coming; or what they sinde of it shall not much trouble them, because of what upmaking they finde in the fruition of him, who gives meat out

(For the Devil is come down, having great wrath, and the cry of our crimson ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities is gone up to Heaven.) O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the man, who by all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, is driven to seek, and make sure a dwelling, in the secret place of the most high, and to take up his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode under the shaddow of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; for, such may sit down and sing, because safe, and say of the Lord, <hi>He is my refuge, in him will I trust,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal. 91: vers.</hi> 1, 2.

Now, could a soul think of changing his dwelling place, could he ever by choice and upon deliberation come out, after he hath enterd into these chambers, and shut the doors about him, and hath tasted and seen how good God is?

the Afflictions, Trials, Tribulations and Sufferings of his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only is there a Decree and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination past, in the Court of heaven, about the Sufferings of the people of God, in the <hi>grosse</hi> (as it were) and in general: but also the special <hi>Kind</hi> of the Crosse, or Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they meet with, or the special <hi>manner,</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> thereof. God hath not only decreed, that this or that man, this or that follower of Christ, shall meet with some Crosse and some Affliction, or other; but he hath determined the <hi>species</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> thereof; <hi>to wit,</hi> whether it shall be a cross as to his Body, or as to his Estate, or as to his Spirit; or as to several or all of these together; whether he shall be put to suffer Fineings, or Confinments, or Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Exile, or Death; whether Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, Paines and Torments, or Harassings, Feares, Perils, or what ever it be. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that <hi>bonds</hi> did abide him.

He determined that Satan should cast some of the Church of <hi>Smirna</hi> in prison, and that they should have tribulation, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 2: 10.

3. As the Lord decreeth the <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> of the Trial; so likewise he passeth a Determination, concerning all the <hi>Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of the same. The trial possiblie is not one single Exercise, but one compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and compounded of many; a cup not of one pure liquor, but mixed of many ingredients; but of how many Ingredients so ever it be compounded, and of how many parts so ever it consist; yet all of them are particularly and determinatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and appointed of the Lord. Many bitter ingredients were in the cup, which Christ gote to drink; but all and every one of them fell under a plaine and peremptour determination of heaven. They were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together (saith <hi>Peter,</hi> in the fore cited place) <hi>to do whatsoever thy hand and thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel determined to be done:</hi> there was a whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever here: Nothing was or could be done, but what this Counsel of God had Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done; and all that was done, was Determined by this Counsel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Degree, and Measure of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that His people are to meet with, is as particularly determined, as any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance thereof else: we know what <hi>Ioseph's</hi> Brethren had intended against him, when thy said, <hi>come let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, Gen.</hi> 37: 20. But God had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51835:33"/>
not intended so much; and therefore they were made to change their minde, and to sell him to the <hi>Midianites, Vers.</hi> 28. And though thereby they thought they were quite of him for ever, and that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a slave to his dying day; yet we know it came otherwise to passe; they thought evil; but God meant it unto good <hi>Gen. 50. vers.</hi> 20. As the Lord had another end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, than they had; so he had determined, that they should not reach their end, nor do any more, than should contribute unto His end. The King of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria</hi> had it in his heart, to destroy and cut off Nations not a few. But God had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in raising him up to be a scourge: and therefore suffered him not to do all he would, <hi>Esai.</hi> 10: 6, 7, 12. Upon this ground it is, that he debateth with his people in measure, when he sendeth forth his rod; and stayeth his rough winde in the day of his east winde <hi>Esai</hi> 27. 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Season and time of the affliction and trial is likewise determined of the Lord, which is another Circumstance, sometime very considerable, and weighty. He hath determined the minute of time, when it shall beginne, and with what occasion it shall be trysted. He determined the precise time, when the Messiah should be cut off,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51835:33"/>
after threescore and two weeks, <hi>Dan. 9 vers.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Duration of the Trial is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the unchangable decree of God, to a day, yea, to an houre and a minute. He decreed the length and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the affliction, that was to come upon the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> four hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and thirtie Years <hi>Gen. 15: 13. Exod. 12. vers.</hi> 13. And at the end of these Years, even the self same day, it came to passe, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the Land of Egypt, where these Years of servitude were to end. So he determined seventy Years for the captivity of <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Babylon, Ier.</hi> 25: 12. and 29: 10. <hi>Dan. 9. vers.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He hath also determined who shall be the Instruments of the trouble, He said, he would <hi>hisse for the flie, that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt; and for the bee, that is in the Land of Assyria, Esai.</hi> 7: 18. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ruine of <hi>Iudah</hi> to be by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> or <hi>Caldeans.</hi> He determined to raise evil against David, out of his own house, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12: 11.</p>
               <p>These particulars might have been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlairged, and confirmed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I suppose the truth herein will not be denied, or questioned by the Lords people,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51835:34"/>
it will be much more useful to speak a few things, concerning the right use making of this Truth, That there is a Decree past in heaven from all Eternity, touching our Sufferings, and all the Ingredients and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances thereof, concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way of our troubles, the time when, and how long, the Instruments by whom, and all the other particulars considerable in the same: all are fixed by a peremptour and unalterable Determination.</p>
               <p>Now the faith and beleeving Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this would still, and calme the risings of our proud spirits, and the insolent stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of our corruptions, when the Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is bitter and unpleasant to the flesh, is lying on; and make us patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all, and sweetly submit to all, saying, <hi>the will of the Lord be done: Let him do what seemeth him good;</hi> as good old <hi>Eli</hi> said, when he heard the determination of the Lord concerning him, and his family, wherein were many sad and bitter ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as may beseen 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> and <hi>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51835:34"/>
and of his sones, that should issue from him, which he should beget, should they take away, and should be Eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon <hi>Esai.</hi> 39. <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. Whether.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Our thoughts be troubled at the kind of the Cross or Affliction, which is upon us; so as we are ready to say, had the Lord sent any other rod or affliction upon us, than this, wherewith we are exercised, we could better have born it, Had he visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me (will one say) with <hi>Poverty,</hi> and not with <hi>Disgrace,</hi> I could have born it: and another, had my affliction been any other, than just what it is, I could have comported with it; but the consideration of this, that God hath decreed, that <hi>that,</hi> even <hi>that same</hi> crosse, should be thy cross, and no other, will make the Soul sit down and say, seing the Lord hath from all eternity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and shapen-out this, even this, and none else for me, I must bear it, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his will, who is wiser, than I am, and seeth further than I do, and knoweth what is good and best for me, better than I my self do, His holy will be done. <hi>This is a grief, and</hi> I <hi>must bear it,</hi> saith <hi>Ieremiah Ch.</hi> 10: 19.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If our heart be troubled and vexed at the Consideration and thoughts of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51835:35"/>
particular Ingredients in and Parts of our mixed and compounded cup of affliction, whereof every one seemeth more bitter than another; and we be saying, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with evils on all hands<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> trouble of Body is upon us, and trouble of Mind also; we are wrestling with paines inward and outward, with poverty, with disgrace, with perils and hardships; and all at once: This will compose our spirits, if we call to mind, that God hath willed and decreed all this; He thought good to have it so; He hath ordered, as a wise Physician, all the Ingredients of our bitter cup: and what have we to say against him? <hi>Iob,</hi> we know, had many a bitter ingredient in his cup, and this compesceth the tumultuatings of his spirit <hi>Iob</hi> 23: 13, 14. <hi>But he is in one mind, &amp; who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doth. For he performeth the thing, that is appointed for me; and many such things are with him.</hi> As if he had said, what He will do, He will do; none can turne him, or make him change his mind; He perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth what He hath appointed and decreed for me; and He can do much more yet, and what know I but he shall do much more against me, than he hath done? This did so far put him from quarrelling at what was done; that he was troubled and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51835:35"/>
afraid at the thoughts of the Majesty and Soveraignity of this great King, who doth what he will; and so might adde yet moe ingredients in his cup, as long as he was left breathing, and thereby make his case worse.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If the thoughts of the exceeding great weight and measure of the Trouble vex us; this may counter-work that, and calme us: if we should suppose, that God doth not measure-out our calamitie by drachmes and unces, but by pounds and ston weights; and thereupon cry out, that our Trouble is greater, than we can bear, and give way to sinful murmurings and complainings: we should do well, in that case, to call this to mind, That all the doses are weighed and appointed for us from eternity, He hath measured every scruple or graine weight thereof; and what he hath appointed for us, we must have; He knoweth best, what dose or measure of such or such a simple, and what weight or quantity of all together will worke best on our humors: and this will helpe to calme our spirits; knowing that He hath determined all things according to infinite wisdom, according to the Counsel of his own will; and more than he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall no man be able to inflict. He lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51835:36"/>
not the measuring and weighing out of the ingredients of our calamitie, unto men or enemies: but himself doth it, by an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Decree, that all the rage of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can not change as to one ase, or in the hundereth part of one drachme. We hear what Christ said <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18: 11. <hi>The cup, which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</hi> It is true, when the dregs of this cup, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Curse, was presented to him, his holy humane Nature, in a sinless manner, scunnered at it <hi>Mat.</hi> 26: 39. <hi>If it be possible, let this cup passe from me:</hi> Yet, as sweetly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescing in the Lord's Determination, he addeth, <hi>Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And againe <hi>Vers.</hi> 42. <hi>O father, if this cup may not passe away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</hi> Bitter and sharpe was this cup, even to the highest degree; yet he viewed the will of God, appointing that he should drink it; and calmly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and said, <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) It is true, the Consideration of the season, in which we are exercised and trysted with such a trouble, may adde griefe to our sorrow; and we may say in our vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had this Trouble come upon us, at any other time, we could have better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51835:36"/>
or later, we had been more able to have born it; but as it is come precisely at such a nick of time, it becometh a double burden unto us: Yet it will help to calme us, and compesce our turbulent spirits, to remember, that He, who knoweth all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and all times, hath chosen this and no other, for the particular season, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we shall meet with such trials; and it could be no otherwise, than he hath willed; the trials behoved to come, at that very nick and minute, and no other: an ancient Determination passed thereupon, and no power under heaven could alter it, no not for one houre or minute.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) When our thoughts are busied about the Duration of the Trouble; this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a Divine determination, past also thereupon, will contribute to our setling. We are ready to cry out, when afflictions lye heavy upon our loines, oh will they ever come to an end: shall we never be redeemed herefrom? Shall we never see a good day again? And we are ready to conclude, that our hopes are perished, and we are cut off for our parts: as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> said when trouble lay upon him <hi>Esai.</hi> 38: 10, 11, 12, 13. I <hi>said in the cutting off of my daies, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of mine years. I said, I shall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51835:37"/>
not see the Lord, the Lord in the Land of the living,</hi> I <hi>shall behold man no more with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world; mine age is departed, and is removed from me, as a shepherds Tent. He will cut me off with pining sickness, from day even to night will thou make an end of me.</hi> I <hi>rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned till morning, that as a lion so will he break all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> bones: from day even to night, wilt thou make an end of me.</hi> The affliction, through the distemper of our spirits, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such a mist before our eyes, that we can not see thorow the dark face of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. How oft do we limite the holy one of Israel, and say, if he come not before such a moneth, or such an year, we may conclude, that he will not come at all, and so need waite for him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and the oftener, that our foolishly set &amp; prefixed Periods go over, &amp; the stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me continueth, or groweth, our fainting &amp; despondence groweth: especially when we consider, the evil disposition, rage and cruelty of Enemies: and see how their strength groweth, and providence see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to smile upon them. But now the faith of this, that He, who hath set bounds to the raging of the sea, saying, hithertil shalt thou come and no further, hath also bounded and limited the time, how long such a Calamity, or Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>l shall endure, will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51835:37"/>
sedate our mindes, and keep us calme, and free of that discomposure of Spirit, that the thoughts of the restless Malice, inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Rage, and cruel Hatred of the Enemies will and do usually cause; for do they what they can, God will observe the Periods prefixed by himself: his thoughts take place in all generations And when our hearts are disquieted at the thoughts of the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Affliction, the calling of this to remembrance, That the only wise God hath determined all the houres and minutes of its continuance, for his own holy ends, will prompt us to say, we cannot strive against the Almighty. Let us therefore waite His time, in patience; all our strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling will but perplex our selves the more; and all our endeavours to get free, will but contribute to our further entanglement: we shall not be able, do what we can, to Anticipate his day; and therefore it is best for us to minde the duty of the day, and lay aside all thoughts of using any unlawful meanes for our outgate, and waite in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, untill his good time come.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) As also the thoughts of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our trouble and calamity may sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect us, as we see it did <hi>David Psal. 55: vers. 12, 13, 14. It was not an Enemie, that reproached me, then I could have born it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51835:38"/>
was it he that hated me, that did magnifie himself against me, then</hi> I <hi>could have hid my self from him. But thou, a man, mine equal</hi> (or a man according to my rank) <hi>my guide, and mine acquaintance. We took sweet Counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and walked unto the house of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> See Ps. 41: 9. So many, upon this account, may say, If my trouble were brought unto me by any other hands, and instruments, I could comport the better with it; but when it is caused by such an one, my neer Relation, mine obliged friend, of whom I least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any such thing, and unto whom I could have yeelded up my self, and all I had, how heavy must it needs be unto me? But the Consideration of this, That so it hath seemed good unto the only wise God, and Supreame Soveraigne, may and should, and, when rightly beleeved and improven, will cause us lay our hand upon our mouth, and say, The good will of the Lord be done; Hath he determined, that such an one, and not another, shall occasione all my griefe and sorrow; shall be instrumentall in all my Calamities? good is the will of the Lord: though I would think, that if I were perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and troubled by others, it would be better, and I could bear it better; yet seing Infinite wisdome hath determined
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51835:38"/>
this circumstance of my calamity; why should not I acquiesce?</p>
               <p>Thus we see, how this Consideration, rightly improven and duely beleeved, will help such, as are under Affliction, Trouble, or Calamity, to a sweet, quiet, submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and patient life: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this meanes, the soul will be freed from sinful murmurings, grudgings, frettings and repineings, at this or that Particular, this or that Instrument, or this or that other Circumstance, of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Distress and Calamity; in that hereby it will be made to see, that its murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus is against the Lord, and against his Soveraignity, who determineth what he will, according to the good pleasure of his will, and is to give an account of his wayes and determinations to none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will help unto a Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under all, that God thinketh good to lay on; and to endure patiently without wearying untill his good time come: for they will easily see, that it is not for them to strive against the Almighty; or to think to cause Him alter his Purposes and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, seing He is of one mind, and none can turn him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This will teach Christians sweetly to comply with all the holy determinations of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51835:39"/>
God, concerning their sufferings, and to say heartily and cheerfully, <hi>The will o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the Lord be done;</hi> as those did, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading <hi>Paul</hi> not to go up unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and found that he would not be perswaded. <hi>Act.</hi> 21: 14. O what a sweet life is this, to be sailing with the stream of God's eternall Determinations; and to be embracing and kissing every Dispensation, we meet with, how sharp and bitter so ever it be, because it is Determined by the absolute Soveraigne and Lord of Heaven and Earth! How light and easie doth this make every load, that is lying upon our shoulders, when we bear it as bound upon us by an everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This will help unto a life of practical Praising of the Lord, as Absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: for when the event is submitted unto and sweetly embraced, because deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a fixed Decree of the Lord Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, the soul doth thereby declare, and acknowledge His Soveraignity; and upon the matter, by practice, in submission, even though silent, doth Celebrat the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of that Absolute Soveraigne, who is God over all, blessed for ever; while as such, upon the contrary, who fret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against the Lord's Determinations, by refusing to give that sweet hearty submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51835:39"/>
that is requisite, do give a practical declaration of their not beleeving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of Him to be the Soveraigne Lord of all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The thoughts of this will free the soul of many heart-perplexing soul-distracting, disquieting and renting thoughts; such as these; If this had not been, or if I had not been in such a place, or had not done such or such a thing. I had been free of all this; so that every thought of every thing, that had but a far-off and remote tendency unto the occasioning of the trouble, is enough to distract, disquiet and perplex the man (I do not mean here sins occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or bringing on of trouble; for these should be thought on and mourned for; which will not marre this sutable frame of Spirit; but other things, about which our thoughts are more readily conversant, in such a time:) and beside these thoughts of what hath been done, or not done, in times by past, there are other thoughts of what may yet further be, and how that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which may not a little unhinge and disquiet the soul: Now from all such is the soul freed, by the beleeving thoughts of God's eternal Decree concerning their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and all the way of its coming to passe, and the occasion, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51835:40"/>
how and by whom, it was brought on. Here the soul will finde such a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying subject of Meditation, that other disquieting thoughts will be quickly hush'd to the door, and the soul will finde no leasure for them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hereby will the soul be keeped from poreing upon, and too much eying of the motions of the under-wheels of Creatures, and instruments of the trouble and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, which will rather cause a reeling, and giddiness, and hence occasione a stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and falling, than any stayedness or establishment; because hereby the soul will be brought to fix its eye upon that<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> one wheel of the Lords, that moveth evenly fixedly, and invariably, in the midst of all the wheels of men, the motions whereof are so irregular, eccentrick, and so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and contrarious one to another.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hereby is the beleever helped to win to that life of tasting and feeling the sweet of that serenity of soul, that a filial dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition possesseth the man of, by an holy, humble, son-like submission and subjection of soul unto the good will of the Lord: When this submission is yeelded unto, the Supream will of God, upon Christian Grounds and Considerations, the soul is in a manner brought into the suburbs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51835:40"/>
and enjoyeth an heavenly serenity and peace of minde, whereby it is in case to sing under all its sorrowful pressures, and the confused noise of such as are the Agents and Instruments of all the calamity; and the beleeving thoughts of the Soveraigne will of God, ordering and appointing all, is a singular help hereunto.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The beleever is hereby put without the reach of many a Temptation, and is strengthened against them; whether to use unwarrantable means to be delivered from the Trouble and Distress incumbent; or to prevent, what may be further imminent, and is to be feared; or to vent his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against the Instruments of all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; or the like: for here will be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote at hand, The Lord ordereth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of all things, according to His own holy and wise will: and nothing can come to passe, but what He hath decreed; and what He hath decreed shall come to passe, and that when, and neither sooner nor later, and how, and by whom He hath decreed, and no otherwayes; what have I then more to do, but to minde my present duty, and welcome what the Lord's will determineth for me, will he say.</p>
               <p>There are these, Three particulars, which set home this Consideration, and promov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51835:41"/>
thereupon this work of Submission, and hearty acquiesceing unto the will and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of God; and which should be thought upon to this end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord is in all his Determinations and Decrees unalterable, as he is unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in himself, there being no variablness or shadow of turning with Him <hi>Iam. 1. vers.</hi> 17. And if it were otherwise, He could not be infinitly Wise in himself, or not Almighty, and Irresistible by others, for any alteration, that might be in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of his will, must either flow from new and second thoughts in himself: and so He were not Infinitly wise, or from ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to effectuat or through his former Determinations, and therefore must take new measures; and so He were not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Now the Soul should think with it self, Should I wish, or desire, that the Lord's will were not done, that He should not be able to do what soever he will <hi>Psal.</hi> 115: 3. and 135 6 or that any of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Purposes and Decrees should fail, and not take effect; or that He should alter his purposes and lay his conclusions of new? Then I should wish, He were not God; for the true God is a God that changeth not <hi>Mal.</hi> 3: 6. and a God, whose Purposes cannot fail; for they have a hand with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51835:41"/>
them to effectuatall <hi>Esai.</hi> 14: 26. as he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, so shall it stand <hi>Esa</hi> 14: 24. Who can disanull what He purposeth? <hi>Vers.</hi> 27. And what he purposeth, he will also do <hi>Esai. 46: v.</hi> 11. So that if I should once imagine, that His decrees could alter upon one account, or other, I should in so far deny the true &amp; living God. And if one of his purposes could alter, why not another? &amp; how then should I think, that his purpose according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should staud? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 11. &amp; 8: 28. <hi>Ephes. 1: v.</hi> 11. &amp; 3: 10, 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 9. And if there were the least ground of doubt here, where were all my Hop, Comfort &amp; Confidence? Therefore would the beleever say; Because it is my joy &amp; comfort, that His purposes fail not, and that He is a God that cannot change, but whom he loveth, he loveth to the end; therefore will I with joy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my self unto all his decreed Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards me, how hard so ever they may seem to flesh; because He is Unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Almighty, and thereupon hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all my Hope and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All his determinations and decrees are for his own glory. He worketh all things, according to the Counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his Glory <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 11, 12. He maketh all things for Himself <hi>Prov.</hi> 16: 4. Hence the beleeving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51835:42"/>
soul reasoneth with himself, Shall I stand in the way of God's getting his glory? He hath determined this to befall me, for his own glory; and should I wish it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes? Should I not comply with his holy designe of glorifying himself, by this his Dispensation towards me? Should I not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in all the meanes and methods, His infinit wisdom hath thought upon, and He, in infinite wisdom, hath determined to make use of, for glorifying of his own name? Should not I be satisfied with his being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted? Nay, should not this Consideration, that hereby God will be glorified, make mine heart sing under all my sorrow: &amp; cause me conclude all my meditations on His dispen fations towards me, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his Discourse <hi>Rom. 11. For of him, &amp; through him, &amp; to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen. v. last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3: As all that God hath decreed to do in the world, is for his own glory; so all that he hath determined to do with, or to bring upon His own people, who are called according to the election of grace, is for their good, according to that <hi>Rom. 8: 28. And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</hi> Hence the Godly Soul can reason, Shall I be against mine own good and advantage? Shall I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51835:42"/>
wish that things were otherwise, than they are, when the only Wise and Gracious God hath ordered and ordained them so, for my good? He hath made many noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, in his Purposes, that I see not: and seing He hath said, that all things work together for good to such as love Him, and are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, why should I not beleeve against sense and carnal reason? Am I able to search out the Almighty unto perfection? Can I finde out all the depths of his Counsel and Wisdom? Shall I think then that he can bring about my good and felicity, by no meanes, and dispensations, but such as I am satisfied with? Shall I measure the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches of his Wisdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel thus? Shall I rebell against his Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and fret and murmure against Him, who dealeth thus and thus with me. because I see not, how He can bring about my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting advantage hereby? No: Nay rather because his word is true, beleeving the same, I will embrace the sharpest of Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, He is pleased to tryst me with, and waire to see how infinit Wisdom shall make good, what Truth it self hath said:</p>
               <p>Thus we see, how the Consideration of the <hi>decreed will of God</hi> can preserve the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians life, in worst of times.</p>

               <p>CHristian souls have much Peace, and joy, when they are going about a commanded duty, and they know upon good grounds, that what they are going about is a commanded duty, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the many Hazards, Difficulties, Pinches and Distresses, they are put to, in the prosecution thereof: and when they are called to suffer, and to lye under outward Trouble and Affliction, are oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much sadness of heart, and disquietment of mind, upon this account, among others, That they know not, if their suffering be according to the will of God, and whether or not they have ground to expect God's approbation; which if they saw clear ground to beleeve and look for, they would be no more disquieted, than when going about other clear and necessary duties. It will be useful therefore and advantagious to such, as meet with a suffering life, to know some thing, whereby they may come to understand, how and what way they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51835:43"/>
may, or may not be called of God to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
               <p>I grant, that Suffering, as it is a meer <hi>passion,</hi> doth not properly fall under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: But the Choosing, Embracing, patient, cheerful, couragious and Christian Enduring of Sufferings and Affliction fall under a command; and this is all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our present enquirie, That we may know, when we are to judge our selves cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God to choose Affliction with the people of God, and to undergo it with courage and patience, knowing that in so doing, we are approven of God.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to the clearing up of this, we would know, That as there is a time, when God calleth to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient acting and appearing and hazarding lives and fortunes, and all for Him, and His interest, and to jeopard our lives, on the high places in the field, and to come forth to the help of the Lord against the mighty, as we would escape the Curse of <hi>Meroz Iudg.</hi> 5: 23. So there is a time, when He, who only can change seas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ns and times, calleth for Valiant Suffering, and to become a companion in Tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ. And this appeareth from these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

1. There is a particular gift of God for this Suffering, as wee see <hi>Phil. 1. vers. 29. Vnto you it is given not only to beleeve on him, but also to suffer for his sake.</hi> And when God giveth a gift for such a peculiar work, it saith, there is a time and season, when that gift is to be imployed and exercised, for he giveth not gifts to lye by us and rust, or to be hid in a napkin under ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are peculiar duties called-for at the hands of Christians, relative only or mainly unto a suffering time; as <hi>Taking up the Cross, Patience, Being faithful unto the death Revel. 2: 10.

                  </gap>he many motives and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given to bear up the hearts of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, say, that the people of God have such a lot to look for, and must lay their account to meet with Trials and Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for adhering to truth.</p>

for our Instruction, and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, say, there is such a season, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such, as would stand fast in the faith, can look for nothing but sharp trials for the Name of Jesus.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The forewarnings given to such, as will follow Christ, to <hi>take up</hi> withall <hi>their cross Mat.</hi> 16: 24.

That we should not <hi>think strange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try us, as though some strange thing hapned unto us 1 Pet. 4. vers.</hi> 12 These and the like confirme this matter.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Christ, the Captaine of our Salvation, was made perfect through sufferings <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 10. &amp; He himself hath told us <hi>Mat.</hi> 10: 24, 25 That <hi>the Disciple is not above his Master, nor the Servant above his Lord,</hi> &amp; that, <hi>it is enough for the Disciple that he be as his Master, &amp; the Servant as his Lord:</hi> &amp; that, <hi>if they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his houshold?</hi> And we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>look unto Iesus, the Author and finisher of faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the crosse, despising the shame:</hi> And to <hi>consider him, that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest we be wearied and

That <hi>even hereunto we are called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps.</hi> And againe <hi>Chap. 4: 1. For asmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, we should arme our selves likewise with the same mind.</hi> All which and the like say, that a Suffering lot is abiding the followers of Jesus; and that it is the will of God they should prepare for it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Some special works there are, which God hath upon the wheels to perfect, and these call for a suffering season; such as the trial and discovery of the sincerity of His grace in His own, as also the exercise and promoving thereof; for <hi>tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hop.

For this is as a small sieve So also the discovery of the Maliciousness and wickedness of Enemies, which lay hid and latent, before it gote a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable vent, when their hour and power of darkness cometh. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22: 53.</p>

8. This may be confirmed by express Testimonies of Scripture, such as 1 <hi>Pet. 2. vers. 19, 20, 21. For this is thank worthy</hi> (or grace) <hi>if a man for conscience toward God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure griefe, suffering wrongfully.â€”But if when ye do well &amp; suffer for it, ye take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, this is acceptable</hi> (or grace, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) <hi>with God. For even hereunto were ye called.</hi> It must then be a commanded duty, and obedience to a command, that render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man gracious and acceptable with God. So 1 <hi>Pet. 4: 19. Wherefore let them that suffer, according to the will of God.</hi> &amp;c. this is according to his will of command. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 39. The <hi>will of God,</hi> there mentioned, is, as we explained it, his will of command, which was done by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during patiently, for the Profession of the truth, a whole fight of afflictions; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient suffering being noble service to their Lord and Master. By all which we see, that there are some times and seasons, wherein the people of God are called to suffer.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired. When is that Time and Season, wherein the people of the Lord are called to suffer? The answere is easie: <hi>to wit,</hi> when the red horse (spoken of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 6: 4.) is sent forth, and power is given to him, that sitteth thereon, to take peace
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51835:46"/>
from the earth; and for that end, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him a great sword; that is, when Truth and the Profession thereof is perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; when Tribulation or Persecution ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth because of the Word; as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 13: 26. When men must be slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimonie, which they hold <hi>Revel.</hi> 6: 9. When the Truth and the open Profession thereof, is questioned and opposed, then are the followers of Christ called to suffer rather than to sin, and upon all hazards to hold fast the Profession of their faith without wavering, not forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the assembling of themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 23, 25. Then are they to make <hi>Moses's</hi> choise; that is, chuse rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 25. When any of the revealed Truthes of God are opposed, and such as owne the same are maligned, hated and persecuted, that is the Season, wherein the Lord calleth all His to embrace any suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, rather than deny His Truth, and the word of His Patience. It is spoken to the commendation of the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos Revel. 2. vers.</hi> 13. That though dwelling where Satans seat was, yet she held fast Christ's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ame, and did not deny His faith, even in these daies, wherein <hi>Antipas,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51835:46"/>
Christ's faithful Martyr, was slaine. So that it is Christ's will and command, that all his followers should abide stedfast, faithful and unmovable in owning of his Truth and Cause, his Word and Interest, on all hazards.</p>
               <p>But some will possibly enquire, How shall I know, whether or not, I in particular be called to suffer? <hi>Answer.</hi> We are not to expect any extraordinary Revelation, or Declaration of God's mind, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; though I grant, the Lord may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend, in love and pity to some weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to give some more than ordinary inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his will, whether by some secret and forcible impulse upon their Spirits; or by some influence of comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment, whereby they are enabled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the shame, and to endure the cross, as seeing the joy set before them; and are strengthened against the feares of men, even of the greatest and most terrible, as seeing Him, who is Invisible. But these outflowings of his Love and Tenderness, not being the Rule of our duty, we must not think, that we are never called to hazard on suffering, untill we meet with some such Dispensation of his free grace. Nor must we waite for some singular Intimation, made by some more than ordinary light, given
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51835:47"/>
to discover the Truth, and the Importance thereof, for owning of which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to suffering; The Revelation of the Truth, made by Jesus Christ, in his Word, is the only ground of our faith, &amp; our faith thereunto is called for, though we want such rare communications of Light, bearing home the soul-captivaring perswasion of the Truth &amp; its concernments, over all possibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doubting or hesitating in the least; for these are not our Ground or Rule of faith, but soveraigne and special helps to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, and to fix us more upon our ground. But the ground of our Suffering, and that which we should look upon as a call from God, to choose suffering, is the Lord's command, to owne and avow His Truth: so that when the Lord, in His Holy and Wise Providence, ordereth matters so, as that we must either suffer, or sin, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying His word, or any point of Truth, revealed in his word; and so either Suffer or forsake our Duty; then are we to look upon our selves, as called of God to choose suffering, rather than sin: When, as it were, Sin and Suffering are laid before us, that we may make our choise, and there is no third thing to demurre us, nor any faire and lawful way to escape the suffering, but by sinning; then with <hi>Moses</hi> in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51835:47"/>
place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>. We are to preferre Suffering before Sinning, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God. This deed of <hi>Moses,</hi> in chusing rather to suffer a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>tction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, was a rare Act of faith; and consequently an act of obedience; faith being no blind act, but walking upon the ground of a command. When then we can not evite suffering, but by sinning in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Truth, or in not adhering to it, or not Professing of it, according to the will of God, we suffer for well doing. This is it, that is acceptable unto God, and that to which we are called, <hi>to wit</hi> That we take it patiently, when we do well and suffer for it. This is to endure grief, suffering wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for conscience towards God, and which is thankworthie 1 <hi>Pet. 2. vers.</hi> 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Hence we see, that it must be Truth, and the Word of Christ, that must be suffered for; else we cannot be said to suffer for Conscience towards God, nor for well doing. If a Person be under the Power of an Erroneous Conscience, taking that for Truth, which is nothing but Errour, his suffering in defence thereof, and for adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, is not suffering for well doing, nor for conscience towards God, nor have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51835:48"/>
such any call from God to suffer upon that account; and yet if, for fear of suffering, any such should deny that, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be truth, they should virtually deny the truth of God, and sinne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should deny that, which they took to be the truth of God; and if it had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>eally the truth of God, they would have denied it, no less than now they have done, though they did mistakingly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be the truth of God, when it was not. In this case, there is no prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin, but by laving by the blinded and erroneous Conscience; that is, by laying aside the mistake and errour, and receiving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ight Information concerning the Truth. And therefore, when a time of trial cometh, and persecution ariseth upon the account of the Testimony of Jesus, and of his Word, all, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>o would be found faithful in that day of trial, should labour to have the Word dwelling in them richly, to be rooted and grounded in the Truth, tobe receiving and drinking-in the Truthes of God, and to have all grounded upon the infallible Word of Truth, that what they owne and hold may be the sure and undoubted Truth of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and so a part of his Testimony. And for this Cause, they would be living neer to Him, who is the <hi>Truth,</hi> that being taught
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51835:48"/>
of Him, and receiving the Truth, as it is in Jesus, they may be in case to assert and owne the same, upon all hazards, and so fitted for witnessing to the Truth, and for holding fast Christs Word; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
               <p>But some may say, Though we know and beleeve the Truth, that is opposed: Yet we are not able to maintaine it against learned Adversaries, nor to answere their contrary Arguments and Objections; How can we suffer upon the account of such a piece of truth, which we have not skill and understanding to defend against cunning Adversaries? I <hi>Answ.</hi> Though it is true, Men of great parts, and abilities to plead and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for truth, would seem to have a great advantage, in such a day of trial; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proveth, that such as are far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour unto them, as to parts and abilities, will be helped to faithful witness-bearing to the Truth, when they may shamfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that Duty. Suffering is a peculiar gift, &amp; doth not alwayes accompany the gift of learning. And I doubt, it be required of all Christians, to be able to disput for the truth, and to answere all the Sophismes of cunning Adversaries; yet it is required of all, that they contend earnestly for the faith, which was once delivered unto the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51835:49"/>
Saints <hi>Iud.</hi> 3. and that they stand fast in the faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16: 13. and in the Lord <hi>Phil.</hi> 4: v. 1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3: 8. and hold fast Christs Name and the Word of his Patience, and not deny his Faith and Name <hi>Revel.</hi> 2: 10, 13, and 3: v. 8, 10. and that they keep his Word <hi>Revel.</hi> 3: 8. It is the Duty of all to receive the Truth, and the Love of the Truth; and when the truth in its Love and Loveliness is received, then it sincketh into the heart; and such, though they cannot Disput for the Truth, yet can suffer for it; and not deny it, upon any termes. Though they have but a little strength, yet they will keep his Word, as is spoken to the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia Revel.</hi> 3: v, 8. Truth is Truth, though we be not able to defend it against Sophisters, and to stop the mouth of gaine-sayers, and the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and as it is a part of his Testimonie, who is the Truth, should be owned and maintained by suffering. The Primitive Christians, who suffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom for the Truth, were not all able to answere the Cavils and Sophismes of a <hi>Celsus</hi> and a <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and others, who imployed their learning and parts against the Truth; yet having received the love of the truth, and embraced the Gospel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, no sufferings nor torments could
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51835:49"/>
move them to a forsaking or denying of the same; They did keep Christs word, and would not deny his Name.</p>
               <p>But may some say, what if the point of Truth, upon which I am questioned and staged, be but small, and of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and many moe than I do so judge it; must I hazard on suffering, upon the account thereof, and think that God will accept of me therein? <hi>Answere.</hi> Let the point of truth be never so small and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, whether in thine own eyes, or in the eyes of others; yet it being a part of the Truth of God, and of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, it is a part of that Name of Christ's, which should not be denied; and of that Word, which should be kept. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may move Persecuters to urge but small things at the beginning, that thereby he may make way to greater; knowing that if once Professors cede in smaller matters, they are the fairer to be prevailed with in greater things; for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ving forsaken the Lord in lesser, they are out of the ordinary rode of meeting with promised help and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when they are questioned upon grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things. Who love Truth for Truth's sake, and upon the account that it is the Truth of Jesus, will love the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ast of divine truthes, and therefore will not deny it,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51835:50"/>
because it is a part of the Name of Christ, every part whereof is sweet and desirable unto the gracious soul. On the other hand, who forsake and deny Truth, because it is small, and inconsiderable, will hold no Truth, as the Name and Word of Christ, and so will be faire to deny the greatest; who suffer not for the Truth, as it is the Truth, and because it is the Truth of Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to suffer for conscience toward God, and as holding fast the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and the word of his patience. And such as are willing to suffer for the Truth, upon this account, will suffer upon all Truth, how small so ever it may seem to be, if it be a part of the word of His Testimony. The Testimonie to the Truth is not to be estimat, according to the greatness or weightiness of the Truth, upon which the Testimony is called for; but rather on the contrary, that may be accounted a great Testimony, which is for a small Truth (to speak comparatively, for indeed no part of Christ's truth should be accounted small) because it argueth great love to the Truth, and Zeal for it; it argueth much singleness, and honesty; and so is much to the glory of God: such as are thus faithful in a very little, may be much esteemed of by the Lord, and have rule over many cities. The
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51835:50"/>
denying of or not witnessing unto the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Truth, in a stated case of Confession, is a being ashamed of Christ and of his Truth; and who are ashamed of or deny Him before Men, He will deny them before His Father, which is in heaven. The least sin must not be committed to shun suffering; but the denying of, or not bearing witness unto any of the Truthes of Christ, in a day of trial, is no small iniquity: and therefore (as we said) we are to look upon our selves as called of God to suffer, when we can not avoid it but by finning.</p>
               <p>Yet some may say, when the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired is manifestly sinful and unrighteous, the call to suffering rather, in that case, seemeth very clear and unquestionable; and when it is so, the person may have much peace and calmness within, but when the question seemeth more disputable, the call must needs be less clear, that one hath to suffer upon that account; and an unclear call cannot but creat much perturbation of mind, and perplexity. <hi>Ans.</hi> A call may be Gods call, wherein or whereabout, there may be much unclearness: It is said of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Heb. 11: 8. That by faith, when he was called to go out into a place, which he should after receive for an Inheritance, he obeyed, and went out,</hi> though, as it is added, <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51835:51"/>
whither he went.</hi> It seemeth good in the Lord's eyes, not to make every ones call alike clear and unquestionable, that their faith and obedience may be the more tried. Some have their call to suffering written, as it were, with sun-beames, so clearly and distinctly, that he who runneth may read it: others have their duty and call written with smaller letters, which every one cannot read; and yet this be no less the call of God, than the other. The call which the three Children had to suffer, was clear and unquestionable; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> being such an act of manifest Idolatry which was enjoyned them; that none acquanted with the law of God, could have the least scruple, touching its horrid iniquity; The call againe which <hi>Moses</hi> had, rather to suffer, than to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, would seem not to have been so legible and clear to all; and yet it was the true call of God, for by faith he obeyed this call. So <hi>Daniel's</hi> call to hazard rather on the lions, than forbear prayer to the God of heaven, seemeth more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e <hi>Amalakite</hi> and yet this was found to be the true call of God. In the primitive times, the case
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51835:51"/>
seemed clear and unquestionable, when Christians were commanded to renounce Christianity, to give up their Bibles, as renunceing the same, or to burne incense to Idols, or to build a Temple to Idols, or suffer death; but when their life was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, on condition, they would but give any old paper or clout, in stead of the poors coats; or would give a small summe of money, wherewith to helo to build the temple to the Idol God, one would think their call to suffer was more dark: and yet these worthy witnesses would not redeem their life at such a rate: Yea, if the souldiers, weary in executing of them, should have violently plucked any such thing from them against their wills, as desireous of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest seeming Victory, they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but run after them declaring their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the truth; and <hi>Marcus Arethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> would not give one penny to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Idol Temple.</p>
               <p>If it be said, But what if by some Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Unnecessary act or other, I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the trial and trouble to my self; Can I in this case suppose, that I am called of God to suffer. I <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, that some unnecessary, or not every way commendable act or other, may give the first rise or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to our trouble; and yet when suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51835:52"/>
are not purely upon that account, nor for that cause: but stated upon another ground; we may notwithstanding of this imprudent or unnecessary occasioning of the trial to ourselves, look upon ourselves as called of God to suffer, rather than to deny Him, or any part of His Truth. It is observed by some of <hi>Paul,</hi> that the occasion of his last trouble, mentioned <hi>Act. 21. to wit</hi> his hearkening to the advice of <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was a thing which he might well have forborne, yea and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and therein have walked consonant unto both his former Doctrine, Practice and Writtings, by all which, before this time, he had declared, that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law was not obliging; Christ, the special end and substance of all these sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, being now come, and having esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Gospel way of worship: and others, though they will not blame <hi>Paul,</hi> nor think he dissembled in what he did, yet they think <hi>Iames</hi> and the rest should have forborne to have pressed him to do what they urged him to do. Yet we see, that notwithstanding of this, which gave the rise and occasion to these his last sufferings, this not being the ground, or cause, for which he was persecuted; but his maintainance of the Gospel, and opposing of the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51835:52"/>
observation of the Law of Moses, which was now abrogate, he is in all his sufferings, which followed hereupon, owned of God, and approven of him.</p>
               <p>If it be said, Though I dar not deny the Truth, upon which I am challenged and staged, nor dar I say, but I am suffering for Truth, and that I could not have shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this affliction, but by sinning; yet I am made to doubt of God's call and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, because He hideth his face from me, yea He hideth himself from me, more than ever. This causeth me suspect, that all is wong; and that I have run, in this matter, without his warrand and allowance. I <hi>Ans.</hi> This is no certaine ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to draw such a conclusion. These out-lettings of his free grace, and sensible significations of his favour, are dispensed according to the Soveraignity of his will and pleasure. A person therefore may have an unquestionable call and warrand to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard on suffering, when he cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes do, unless he would sinne, though he misse these soul-comforting, and heart-establishing blainks of His face. How oft do we finde the Saints of God, in Scripture, cry out of the hiding of God's face, when outward trouble was lying heavy upon them? As in <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> and why may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51835:53"/>
not the Lord dispense thus with others? I grant the Trial and the Exercise is, upon this account, the greater: but what do we know, but the Lord be ordering matters so, in his holy wisdom, for our further trial, and for the exercise of faith? It is easie to swime (we say) when the head is born up above the water. And if the Lord thinketh good to double our Trials, ought we not sweetly to submit? His word should satisfie us; and He hath promised enough to him, that overcometh: We ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our duty, that is, hold fast what we have, till he come, and He will come quickly, <hi>Revel. 2. vers.</hi> 25. and 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 11. If He will have us venturing upon faith, why should we not glorifie him thereby? He knoweth, when the fittest season is of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating his favour and acceptance. That holy martyr, that complained of this want, all the time he was in prison, yet while going to the staik was made to cry out, <hi>He is come, He is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Let us now speak a word unto the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of this Consideration, to the end, we may see, how it can contribute unto life, in an evil time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Consideration may calme and quiet the Sufferer, and may make him enjoy peace within, what ever trouble he meet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51835:53"/>
with from without; because, hereby he understandeth, that he is about his Master's work, he is following dutie, and walking in a commanded path, whatever trouble he meet with therein: So whatever other thing occurre, to cause disquietment, this may bear him thorow all, that he is in the way of duty, and obeying the command of the great Lord and Law-giver. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans use to pacifie their own spirits with this, when they meet with unexpected crosses and disappointments, That they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their duty: So this may quiet them under all their Tossings, Troubles, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and Vexations, that they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully occasioned none of these things, nor by their sin and foolly brought them on themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When on-lookers are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them of Foolly, Rashness, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratness, Pertinaciousness, and the like, this Consideration; That they are about a commanded duty, may counterballance all; for then they may know, that whoever condemne them, their Lord and Master will approve of them; and how ever men construe of their doings, He will account their Sufferings loyal and faithful service to Him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The consideration of this will helpe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51835:54"/>
the Beleever to a life of Patience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, without fretting at their lot: for sure the honest beleever hath engaged himself unto God, and hath promised ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience unto him in all things, and to take up his cross and yoke, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that God shall think good to appointe for him: and without all doubt, he is to have respect to all the commands of God, and is obliged to carry as a Son and as a Servant; and therefore must willingly and with sweet submission do any piece of service, that is laid upon him, &amp; go about any commanded duty with cheerfulness, because it is commanded, how unpleasant so ever it be to the flesh The honest belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will say, I have given up my self to His service, and count it my glory to be called, the Servant of God; and why should I not go willingly and cheerfully, and with heart and hand, without all repineing or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, about any piece of service He is pleased to put in my hand? I made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves nor exceptions, when I resigned and gave up my self unto Him; and why should I not now submit to all He commandeth? Sure, it is He who is Lord and Master, and so must command and give-out orders; I am but a servant, a sworn-servant, and am highly advanced, when I am called and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51835:54"/>
accounted a servant to him, and therefore must not carve-out my own work, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but be under Authority, and go and abide, or do this or that, or bear this or that burden, as commanded. It is not seemly for a childe, or for a servant, or for a souldier to quarrel with his Father, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or Commander, for putting him to any piece of service; but rather sweetly to acquiesce, and run cheerfully about what is commanded: And (should the beleever say) it is more unseemly for me to quarrel with God, who is my Father, Master, and Commander, upon a more noble and substantial an account, for any piece of service He putteth in my hands: I never covenanted with Him, upon condition, He should not call me to suffering, or put any piece of service in my hand, that was not easie and sweet to the flesh. So that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this would certainly move to submission, and shoot-out all contrary thoughts, which distract and disquiet the soul, and make his spirit bitter, and his life less lively and comfortable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereby would the beleever be helped to a life of Patience and Long suffering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Trial and Tribulation, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueing long, and like yet to continue longer, without fainting or wearying: for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51835:55"/>
the honest soul would think with it self, I should not weary of prayer, nor of hearing the word, nor of any other religious duty; and why should I weary of the cross, seing the bearing of it, christianly and handso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, is as much my duty, and an act of obedience to Him, when He calleth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as is Prayer, or the like, in their season. There is a time, when He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for valiant acting, there is also a time, when He calleth for Christian suffering; and every thing is beautiful in its season: and if the season be longer, than we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; yet the Supreme Lord of Times and Seasons, He knoweth better than I, how long such a season should endure; and so long as He thinketh fit to appointe the season, so long is the duty seasonable and pleasant, that is called for in that sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This would also help forward the inward Satisfaction of the Believer; for hereby he might see, that how unworthy and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable soever he thought his own suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; yet the Lord would get glory thereby; seing he might easily understand, that the Lord would set him about no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or service, but such as would be for his own glory: the husband man will not command his servants to plow-up some
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51835:55"/>
cumbersome piece of ground wherein they must meet with much labour and toyl, if he saw not how to reap some fruit thereby; nor will God set any of His servants about an irksome piece of work, if he saw not advantage to be had thereby to his Name, Interest and Glory: The faith of this, That God will get glory by their sufferings, that being a piece of work He hath put them about, who doth nothing in vaine, and whose glory is advanced by our obedience to His commands, will quiet the heart of the honest beleever, while he is sweating in tugging and toiling at that troublesome work. And when such thoughts as these prove troublesome unto the honest heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beleever, Alas I am out of case now, while thus shut up in prison, to go about my Christian duties, with my Christian Neighbours, wherein I was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and God was glorified; I cannot get Him now so served and glorified, and his praises solemnly sung, in the publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of his people. This may satisfie and comfort him. That now he is called unto this piece of service, and by his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian deportment herein, God will be as much glorified, as He was by his Christian exercises, while at liberty; That now he hath as good occasion, to advance in his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51835:56"/>
Principal work of glorifying God, though upon another account, as when he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the most solemne service, that Christians are called to.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This consideration will also promove their life of inward Contentmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap> and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, under their suffering lot, in that they will thereby be helped to see, that as God will thereby get his due rent of praise and glory (as we said:) so their own spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage and spiritual life will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thereby, if they foolishly hinder it not by their unchristian deportment under the crosse. All obedience hath a native tendency to promove the spiritual good of Christians, they walk and go from strength to strength, in the pathes of obedience, The doing of God's will is the exercise of the Christian life, and the Christian's life is made more and more lively by this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise: So that, all these Tribulations, or Afflictions, are so far from hindering their spiritual grouth and advancment in grace, that on the contrary they promove the same, when the Christian is helped, through grace, to yeeld obedience unto the good will of God, in undergoing that lot and dispensation, in a Christian manner, even because the Christian is then in the way of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51835:56"/>
God, and carrying as a submissive obedient Son and Servant ought to do.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hereby, (which will also prove ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to their spiritual life) they will see, How Satan is disappointed of the two great Ends, he aimeth at, in raising up Persecution against the people of God: <hi>to wit,</hi> the dishonour of God, and the hurt and undoing of the Child of God; neither of which he can at taine by this mean: for when Afflictions, Distresses, Tribulation and Persecution are borne, in way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the holy will of God, and the soul is sweetly complying therewith, as its present duty, both God is glorified, and the Christian soul is edified, as by all other Christian duties; and thus Satan is disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Sure, this can not but yeeld much peace and comfort unto the suffering beleever, under all his hardships and sore pressures.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Consideration, if rightly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, could not but make the suffering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever sing and rejoice, with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> while in prison <hi>Act. 16. vers.</hi> 25. and with the Apostles, when sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>mfully beaten <hi>Act. 5. vers.</hi> 40, 41. Because, they cannot but say, that their hearts are glade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice within them (if they be not under the power of some evil frame) when they are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51835:57"/>
about known duty; and that what they do, they do with a piece of joy and gladness, when they reflect upon it, as a commanded duty, and remember how therein they are doing the will of their Father, and running His errands: and why should they not be also glade and rejoice in their sufferings, when they may know, that therein they are also about the will of their Father, and actually evidencing their Loyalty, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Subjection, and Obedience to Him?</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Consideration may also quiet the honest-hearted Beleever, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with these or the like thoughts, That now he cannot get God so served as he was wont to do; He cannot get such a good work begun or perfected, which he had intended for the publik good; He cannot get the spiritual good of others, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Relations, so promoved, as he would desire. From this, I say, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever may draw grounds of peace to his own soul, &amp; hush these perturbing thoughts to the door; because the Lord is not now calling for these works at his hands; but is now calling for another duty, wherein if he carry himself aright, God will be no less glorified, than by all that work, which he Intended: nay, this being the present duty, and piece of work now put in his hand
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51835:57"/>
by God, the doing thereof aright wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>l more glorifie God: And therefore this should allay all their sorrow and griefe, which they finde upon their disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cause them sweetly comply with the present duty, and account that best, which He accounteth best.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Seing in choosing affliction rather than sin, they are about a commanded duty, and doing the will of God; they have the same ground of hope, that the Lord shall enable them thereunto, and by his grace carry them thorow, that they have, as to other duties; the same Covenant-Grounds, and Covenant-promises reatch all duties, and excepte none, so that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Consideration may raise the soul in hope, &amp; may encourage the man to goe to Christ by faith, and lean to him for seasonable strength and supplies of grace, for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing in the duty; and through Him, expect to be accepted of the Father, in the discharge of the duty.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION. X. Afflictions are all ruled and over-ruled by a good hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is alwayes in and about them.</head>
               <p>MAny a time the Beleever, when swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow a sea of trouble and afflic tion, and finding no sensible in-come of reliefe, or mitigation of the calamity, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out with the Church <hi>Esai. 49. vers. 14.â€”The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God bath forgotten me:</hi> And as it is <hi>Esai. 40. v 27. My way is hid from the Lord.</hi> He hath left me alone, in this sea of trouble, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that I am into this wrestling and fighting postoure: He hath turned his back upon me, and seemeth unconcerned with all that is come upon me, and yet is lying heavy on me. He considereth neither my weakness, nor the strength and violence of the Temptation, under which I am, and which is like to overwhelme me. Hence he crieth out with <hi>David Psal. 31. vers.</hi> 12. I <hi>am forgotten, as a dead man out of minde:</hi> And againe <hi>Psal. 42. vers. 9. Why hast thou forgotten me.</hi> It is certaine, such sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51835:58"/>
are not altogether justifiable, as they proceed from men, in whom is so much corruption and unbeleef (though in our blessed Lord, while on the cross, such a sentence, as, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> was free of all mud or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief) for though they express the ardencie of their desires to have the Lord smiling upon them; yet there is some admixture of dross in them; and they hint, at least, that they apprehend God is at a distance, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little notice of them, or of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, but withdrawing his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, or delaying to send reliefe, as not careing, how great their Affliction be, or how their Enemies trade them under foot. Hence we see, what corruptions are ready to stirre and work in the beleever, at such a time: And the faith of God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes present with them, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the trial, and ordering all things, in the dispensation, with a fatherly care and tenderness, would comfort them, and ease their mind, in the saddest of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. It may therefore be of use to speak a little unto this <hi>Consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order therefore to the clearing-up of this Consideration, for the end intended, we shall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Show, that the Lord indeed hath an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51835:59"/>
high and holy hand, in all such dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as prove sad and grievous afflictions unto the godly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We shall endeavoure to explaine and clear, how and what way the hand of the Lord is in and about these afflictions, only with an eye to our present designe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall briefly pointe-out the way how this Consideration should be improven, in the time of Affliction and Tribulation.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> That God hath an holy and high over ruling hand in and over the afflictions, and crosses, that his people meet with. This is past all doubt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, as to some of them; such as <hi>poverty,</hi> through God's immediat hand, blasting mens labours and endeavours, or taking away their goods by sea, or by fire, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying their cattel by death: and <hi>sickness</hi> upon their bodies, or <hi>death of friends and relations,</hi> and the like. In such, every one will grant, that God hath an hand, and every wise Christian will look upon them (as the Centurion, that great Beleever, did, <hi>Mat. 8. vers.</hi> 8, 9.) as God's Servants and Souldiers under his command and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to go and return, as He enjoineth. But as to other afflictions, brought about by the Instruments and Under-agents of Satan, maliciously set to persecute the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51835:59"/>
Godly, in their Name, Liberty, Goods, Life, or Conscience, though none of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are in their right mindes, &amp; at themselves, will deny the Soveraigne over ruling hand of Providence; yet while under Temptation, &amp; wrestling with the calamity, they will be found too ready to think and speak that, which is not very consistent with the lively faith and perswasion of this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Truth, we shall therefore in a few words confirme it, from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We finde that the Godly have looked on these sad afflictions, brought about by wicked hands, out of wicked purposes and designes, as coming from God principally; and have eyed God, as having a principal holy hand in the same. The affliction, that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> met with, was sad, when he was sold by his own Brethren; &amp; though it was they that had sold him, &amp; that out of wickedness and maice; yet he saith <hi>Gen.</hi> 45: 8. to them. <hi>It was not you, that sent me hither, but God.</hi> He saw the Lord to be the principal disposer of all; &amp; therefore saith: <hi>Gen. 45 5.â€”God sent me before you, to preserve life.</hi> And againe <hi>Gen. 50. vers. 26. But as for you, ye thought evil against me, God meant it unto God, to bring to passe, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</hi> It was likewise a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to <hi>David,</hi> to be scourged with the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torous
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51835:60"/>
tongue of <hi>Shimei,</hi> railing upon him, when he was flying from the face of his Son <hi>Absalom:</hi> and calling him a <hi>Man of blood, &amp; a Man of Belial;</hi> and saying to him, <hi>the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reignedâ€”And behold thou art taken to thy mischiefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou art a bloody man. 2. Sam.</hi> 16: 5, 6, 7, 8. Yet holy <hi>David</hi> observed an higher hand in all this, and therefore said <hi>Vers. 10. Solet him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, curse David. Who shall then say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hast thou done so?</hi> And <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. againe <hi>Let him alone, and let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi> He taketh up God's hand in the business as principally order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter. So <hi>Iob</hi> when the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> had robbed him of his goods; said nevertheless <hi>Iob 1. vers. 21. Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord:</hi> He looketh over Instruments, and seeth above them an higher hand over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and ordering all, according to His soveraigne will and pleasure. See also <hi>Ps. 44. v.</hi> 11, 12. and 89: 39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord himself by his Prophets signifieth so much: and, as it were, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the deed of these wicked Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51835:60"/>
as His own; because of His principal holy hand therein, ordering all to His own holy ends. Thus he saith by <hi>Amos 3: 6.â€”Shall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it.</hi> So <hi>Esai. 45. vers. 7.

Likwise <hi>Ier. 18: 11.â€”Thus saith the Lord, behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a devise against you.</hi> A remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able passage we have 2. <hi>Sam. 12: vers. 11, 12.

               <p n="3">3. We finde in the Scriptures, that the wicked Enemies, in following &amp; prosecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their malicious designes against the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51835:61"/>
People of God, are held forth, and spoken of, as God's Instruments, in that work: As <hi>Esai. 10. vers.</hi> 5. Where the <hi>Assyrian</hi> is called <hi>the rod of God's anger; and the staff in their hand,</hi> is said to be <hi>His indignation.</hi> So <hi>Vers.</hi> 15.

                  </hi> in the hand of him, that heweth therewith; and to a <hi>saw,</hi> to a <hi>rod</hi> and to a <hi>staff,</hi> all which (we know) can do nothing, but as moved and ordered by the principal Actor. To the same sense, are they compared to a <hi>rasour,</hi> wherewith God will shave the head and the haire of the feet, and the beard <hi>Esa. 7. vers.</hi> 20. Thus is <hi>Babylon</hi> called <hi>a golden cup</hi> in the hand of the Lord <hi>Ier. 51. vers.</hi> 7. Likewise the Enemies are compared to a <hi>net.</hi> which God will spread over his people <hi>Hos. 7. v.</hi> 12. and to a <hi>snare Ezek. 12. vers</hi> 13. They are likewise called <hi>God's sword Psal. 17. vers.</hi> 13. and His <hi>hand vers.</hi> 14. All which and the like expressions show, That God hath a principal hand, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which his people meet with at the hands of wicked Instruments; and that the wicked are but as so many Instruments and Lixes, imployed by him, for that effect, howbeit they minde no such thing, but drive on their own designes, to satisfie their own wicked lusts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture speaketh of the Lord,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51835:61"/>
as raising up these wicked Instruments, as leavying them, and sending them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his will. So <hi>Esai. 5. vers. 26. And He will lift up an Ensigne to the Nations from far, and will hisse unto them from the end of the earth, and behold they shall come with speed swiftl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it shall come to passe, in that day, that the Lord shall hisse for the flie, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Aegypt; and for the bee, that is in the Land of Assyria</hi> By which we understand, that as these Enemies cannot stir, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all their malice, rage and anger against the Lord's people, till God send for them, and hisse for them, and (as it were) subscribe and seal their commission; so they are wholly at his disposal; as the armie is at the disposal of the General, or of him, who leavyeth them, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. In like manner, we read 1 <hi>Chron. 5. vers.</hi> 26. that the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of <hi>Pul,</hi> King of Assyria, against the <hi>Reubenits,</hi> the <hi>Gadites,</hi> and the half tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> So it is said <hi>Psal. 105. vers.</hi> 25.

5. We finde the Lord said frequently to deliver up his people into the hands of these Enemies, and to sell them unto them, &amp; as it were to give them wholly up to their devotion and disposal; see <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3: 8. and 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and 6. <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and 10: 7. <hi>Dan. 1: 2. 2 King. 17. vers.</hi> 20. Thereby showing, that these Enemies could do nothing against the people of God, untill the Lord had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the same, and given way thereto, and had (as it were) withdrawn his protection, and taken away his hedge of defence, and so left them naked and exposed unto the rage and cruelty of their brutish Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is also manifest from the grand and noble Purposes and Designes, which the Lord bringeth about by those meanes, far diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So <hi>Esai. 10. vers.</hi> 7. The <hi>Assyrian</hi> meaneth not so, as God doth, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few: but the Lord hath another work upon mount <hi>Zion</hi> and on <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem Vers.</hi> 12. to wit, to punish them, only by his smiting with a rod, and lifting up his staff, after the manner of Egypt <hi>V.</hi> 24.

or (as it is <hi>Esai.</hi> 27: 9.) to purge away the iniquity of Jacob, and to take away sin. Wherefore seing the Lord hath such sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ends, as the chastisement and trial of his people, the exercise of their graces &amp;c. to bring about, He cannot but have a special hand in and about the meanes, which serve to bring about these ends. This being sufficient to cleare up what was <hi>first</hi> to be spoken to, we come</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> to speak a little of the manner and way, how the hand of the Lord is to be observed in and about the sharpe afflictions of his people, by the hand of wicked persons, who are active therein. And in speaking to this, we shall wave all subtile debates, concerning God's Decreeing the event of sin, His Predetermination, and His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with second causes, in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are sinful; and shall onely pitch upon some particulars, which are more plaine and undeniable, and also more useful to the point in hand. As</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is the Lord's holy <hi>permission,</hi> giving way to, and not restraining the furie, and rage of Enemies, when He hath a mind to make use of them for a scourge; He must loose, as it were, the chaine, with which they are bound and restrained; and take away the hedge of protection, wherewith
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51835:63"/>
he guardeth and protecteth his people, and all that belongs to them Satan could do nothing against <hi>Iob,</hi> nor stirre so much as one lambs tail, that belonged to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord, for holy and wise ends, gave way thereunto; therefore he said unto the Lord <hi>Iob 1. vers. 10. Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side?</hi> This is also imported, in the Lords giving up his people into the hands of Enemies, and selling them and delivering them, as a judge doth a Malefactor into the hand of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Yet we must not conceive of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as if it were in all things like unto the bare &amp; naked permissions of men; but as sutable to him, who is a most pure and simple Act</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is herein considerable the Lord's <hi>Commission,</hi> to speak so: not that He will warrand and approve of them, in their wickedness, or give them any moral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or Power thereunto: but that in his active providence, He hath such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne and supream hand, and all these wicked agents do so depend upon Him, as they cannot stirr, or move, till he give (as it were) the signe, and a Providential call and commission; as souldiers can not set upon a Citie, or the Enemie, or give an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51835:63"/>
assault, or charge untill the General give the word of command. Thus the Lord behoved to say to Satan, ere he could trouble <hi>Iob, Behold all that he hath is in thy power:</hi> and againe, <hi>Behold he is in thy hand, Iob 1. vers.</hi> 12. and 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. This is it which <hi>David's</hi> words, concerning <hi>Shimei,</hi> import, when he said, <hi>The Lord hath said unto him, curse David.</hi> The lying Spirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahab's</hi> false Prophets, could not go forth to deceive <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might fall at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead,</hi> till the Lord had said, <hi>Thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also: go forth and do so 1 King.</hi> 22: 22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the Lord's fitting (as it were) and qualifying them for the work, by so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering things, in his Holy and Soveraigne Providence, that they are enabled to carry on their purposes, and to do what they are imployed in, and to performe the work, they are set about: <hi>Absalom</hi> could not have been such a crosse and plague to his father, <hi>David:</hi> as to chase him from his Throne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, unless he had gote the power of the Countrey upon his side, and such a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army to back him: and whence was this, but from the Lord, in his holy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Soveraignity? <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> could not have been the hammer of the earth, if the Lord, in his holy Providence,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51835:64"/>
had not given him great power and might for that end. Hence Christ said to <hi>Pilat Ioh. 19. vers. 11. Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above. Pilat</hi> was boasting of his power and place, and supposed, that he could do what he pleased, and that he had full power over Christ, to crucifie him, or to set him at liberty, as he pleased; but he boasted of that, which he was not Master of; for Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The wicked are as so many rampant and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lions, longing earnestly for their prey, but God hath them so chained, and muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled, that they can neither bark nor bite, till He give way.

               <p n="5">5. There is the Lord's determining and specifying the nature and kinde of the Trouble, with which His people must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised; and herein His determining and ordering Providence appeareth. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie would be at death, and no less will satisfie them; but He will order it so, that they shall not get their will; &amp; therefore will suffer them to do no more than to cast the man in

prison, or confine him, or fine him, and spoile him of his goods. The Devil would have been at no less, than <hi>Iob's</hi> life, when he said <hi>Iob 2. vers. 4. Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="6">6. There is the Lord's careful Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial measuring-out the quantity of the Trouble, like a faithful and painful Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who will himself measure the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the physick, he is to prescribe unto his dear Son, or Daughter, and will not commit it unto the Apothecary, who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may more consult his own advantage, than the good of the patient. Our Lord weigheth the affliction in his own just bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances. Enemies may think to ruine and undo all; but our God, who setteth bounds to the sea<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> limiteth their rage; and will suffer them to do no more, than He think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good. The plowers plow, and make long their furrowes, upon the back of God's People, and many a time they afflict them; yet they prevail not against them; why? the Lord cuts asunder the cords of the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 129: 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Lord's hand of Providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,

               <p n="8">8. The hand of the Lord appeareth, in his suiting the Trouble or Calamity, unto their case and necessity.

So the hand of the Lord is manifest, in making the affliction answerable to their strength<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> A potion may be fit for and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the disease, yet may be too strong for the weak patient, and more readily kill, than cure: therefore a wise and tender Physician will take good notice of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients present strength. So the Lord, who is tender of His peoples welfare, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Physick of affliction unto their strength. Hence we hear it said, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. vers. 13.â€”But God is faithfal, who will not suffer you to be tempted, above that you are able.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Ieremiah</hi> prayeth <hi>Chap. 10. v. 24.

That he and his companions were <hi>pressed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and above strength:</hi> which would seem to contradict what is said; But this seeming contradiction will be taken away, by what we shall next adde.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When the affliction and distress is such, as would undo, and presse the poor Beleever out of measure, if he gote not some new supply of strength to stand under that burden; the Lord's hand appeareth, in fitting the Beleever for the stroke, and in enabling him to bear it, so that he is not killed thereby, nor overwhelmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; by giving cordials, he fortifieth the man against the violence of Temptations, which otherwise would prevail against him: <hi>Paul</hi> and his Company 2 <hi>Cor. 1. vers.</hi> 8, 9. were pressed with trouble in <hi>Asia,</hi> out of measure, above strength, so much that they despaired even of life, yea and had the sentence of death in themselves; such a storme was it, that they could not ride it out, if fresh supplies of strength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage had not been granted by God, who raiseth the dead, unto them: and if the Lord had not thus delivered them from so great a death, they had perished; but how
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51835:67"/>
was this done? See <hi>Vers. 4, 5. The God of all comfort comforted them, in all their tribulations;</hi> and as <hi>the sufferings of Christ abounded in them, so their consolation also abounded by Christ:</hi> And thus the Lord fitted them for the stroke, when the stroke was too sore for them. So this same Apostle, when assaulted with a messenger of Satan, that buffeted him 2 <hi>Cor. 12. vers.</hi> 7.

Thus the Lord keepeth the head of his poor people above water, by making his power to rest upon them, and by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect his strength in their weakness, <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. Thus also are they strong, when weak <hi>Vers.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Lord's good hand of Providence appeareth in this matter, in disappointing the Enemies of their malicious designes; They are busie plotting and contriving the ruine and destruction of His people; but the more they seek to destroy them, the more they grow and thrive, the more they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and the stronger they become. It is almost incredible, what multitudes of Christians, through the whole Empire, the bloody persecuting Emperours destroyed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51835:67"/>
and put to death, in the primitive times; but the more they were massacred, the more they grew; the bloud of the saints and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, was the seed of the Church. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel's</hi> adversaries thought to have gote him destroyed; but their enmity and rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him tended to his further exaltation and establishment. So was it with <hi>David,</hi> the more that <hi>Saul</hi> did persecute him, the more his bow abode in strength.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Lord's hand mightily appeareth in the afflictions of his people, in that He powerfully and Infallibly carrieth on, and bringeth to passe His own Purposes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, countermining and counter working the designes and wicked projects of the Enemies; yea, in effectuating His own ends, even by what the Enemies are doing purposely to carry on their Ends. When the Enemies are blowing with all their might, to make the furnace burn hot, that the mettal, as they suppose and intend, may be wholly consumed; the Lord by that same meanes is infallibly bringing about His Ends, and accomplishing His designes; <hi>to wit,</hi> to purge the mettal, and take away the drosse. By what the <hi>Assyrian</hi> was doing, in prosecution of his Ends, <hi>to wit,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and cut off nations not a few <hi>Esai. 10. vers.</hi> 7.

               <p n="13">13. Herein also appeareth the Lord's over-ruling hand, that while possibly the trouble is in its greatest strength, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are swelling in their pride, and thinking their contrivances cannot fail, their plots and designes are laid so deep and so sure, that they cannot misgive; even then the Lord will make a door of outgate appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, and give some foreruning tokens of the dawning of a fair day; even then, He will make a way for an escape, that they may be able to bear it 1 <hi>Cor. 10. vers.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Lastly, His hand appeareth herein, that in due time, He putteth a period to the trial and trouble, by delivering his people out of them all <hi>Psal. 34. vers.</hi> 7, 17, 19. He will <hi>not suffer the rod of the wicked to rest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the back of the righteous Psal. 125. vers. 3. He will not contend for ever, lest the spirits should fail before him, and the souls, which he hath made Esai. 57. vers.</hi> 16. He will keep His people no longer under Physick, than He seeth necessary; and therefore it is but for <hi>a season,</hi> that his people are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness.

1 <hi>Pet. 1. vers.</hi> 6. Enemies think to keep the people of God at under for ever; but the Lord's supream over-ruling hand appeareth here, that He hath limited the duration of the trial and trouble to <hi>Ten dayes Revel. 2. vers.</hi> 10. He hath limited the rage of Enemies to <hi>an hour, a day, a moneth and a year Revel. 9. vers</hi> 15. And the treading of the holy city under foot to 42, moneths <hi>Revel.</hi> 11: 2. And when the Lord's time cometh, all the power and malice of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies will not be able to hinder the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and how little so ever His own people look for it, yet He will work it: so that though there be scarce faith upon the Earth, yet He will come, and perfect what He hath intended.</p>
               <p>We come now to speak a little to the 3 particular, <hi>to wit,</hi> To shew how this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration may and ought to be improven to advantage, in a time of affliction, And</p>
               <p n="1">1. The faith and right thoughts of this. Truth, That the Lord ruleth and over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that the wicked are devising and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, according to their own lust and rage, to afflict, persecute and destroy His people, according to His own mind, would yeeld comfort and encouragment unto His people, be their trouble what it would. In a time of Trouble, there are several thoughts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51835:69"/>
that come in the minde of His people, which occasion Discouragment and Sorrow; all which this <hi>Consideration</hi> of <hi>God's over-ruling hand,</hi> if rightly improven, would either prevent, or keep them from the hurt of; so that notwithstanding of these, they were in case to rejoice, and to sing, as</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) When they think upon the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their calamitie, they are ready to pore too much on them, and to look upon them, as if there were none above them, to marshal and order them, to command and over-rule them; as people are terrified by souldiers, that are under no Command or Discipline, and expect no pity, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from them. But the faith of God's being above their heads, to over-see and over-awe them, would free the Child of God from this discouragment. He would not be so cast down and affrighted, if he beleeved, that God hath all these wicked Instruments, more under his command, than the best disciplin'd souldiers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the most strick and awfull General, that ever was. These In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments cannot move a finger without God. Souldiers, when out of the sight of their Commanders, may do much mischiefe; and their Commanders cannot hinder it, because they know not of it: But neither
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51835:69"/>
Devils, nor the most wicked of his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can move one haire of God's people, till the Lord give way, and permit it to be done, He must first loose the raignes, or they cannot move a foot. because they are chained hand &amp; foot, in the chaines of his Providence; yea their very tongue is chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they cannot so much, as curse or reproach any of His people, untill the Lord loose their tongues, and say, (as it were) go curse and raile upon such an one.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) When they observe the Confusion, Irregularity, Brutishness and Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of these Enemies, in their way and actions; they are ready to think, that God hath forsaken the earth, and is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with what these wretches were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and upon this they cannot but be much fainted and discouraged. But the faith of this, that God is working hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>Ioh. 5. vers.</hi> 17. and that these wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Instruments of their calamity were under his eye, would free them of this misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. Nay, they would beleeve, and by faith see, a divine Order and Regularity, in the midst of the greatest Confusions, &amp; bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sacres, that ever were; if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that God had a principal hand in all these Actions, Moving, Ruling, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51835:70"/>
and Over-ruling all, according to His own mind.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The consideration of the Activity, Diligence, Malice, Restlesness and Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wickedness of the Enemies, troubleth them, and maketh them fear, that ere ever they be aware, they shall be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. But this discouragment would eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, if they remembered and beleeved, that the timing of their affliction is not in the hand of their Enemies. They cannot stirre, till their commission be (as it were) subscribed; and the houre and minute ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed come, when they must beginne; He, who is Supreame, determineth the season, and the time; and over-ruleth all so, that were the hunger and desire of these ravenous wolves never so great, they cannot attempt any distruction, till the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute appointed come.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) When they consider the exceeding great Rage and Cruelty of their Enemies, they are ready to think, that sure, they will make havock of all, they will destroy, utterly, and make an end of all. But how terrible so ever this thought be, yet its terrour is weakened, when the beleever calleth this to minde, That it will not be as these enraged and merciless Beasts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; but as God will, who is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51835:70"/>
Disposer of all, and Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of work; they are but under-Agents, and the Instrument in His hand: They are no Master of themselves, in this matter; but as the ax and saw, in the hand of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that cannot cut, but as he ordereth it: The child will not be afraid of a sword, or of an ax, when he seeth it is in the hand of his father. Their threatnings are not much to be regairded; They have said, <hi>come and let us out them off from being a nation, that the Name of Israel may be no more in remembrance</hi> as it is <hi>Psal. 83. vers.</hi> 4. But they have not yet gotten it done. They intend Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore breath-forth nothing but cruelty; but God, who is above them, intendeth but Correction, and some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement, and will suffer them to do no more, than may contribute to that end.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The thoughts of the strength and liveliness of the Enemies create also terrour and fear; they see their power decayeth not, but groweth rather, and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber increaseth, and thence they art ready to inferre, There shall be no outgate: But a sight of God, as neer (as <hi>David</hi> prayeth, when he took such a look of his Enemies, <hi>Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And for as strong as they are, the Lord can raise up a scourge against them; as <hi>Esai.</hi> 10: 26. yea and make the light of Israel for a fire, and his holy one for a flame, and it shall burne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure their thornes, and their briers, in one day, and shall consume the glory of their forest, and fruitful field &amp;c. as <hi>Esai. 10. vers.</hi> 17, 18</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) But even this proveth sometimes fainting and discouraging unto his people, That it is not man, that they have to do with, but with God principally, whoever be the Instruments; and that upon several
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51835:71"/>
accounts; as because He is a God of Might, of Power, and of Terrour; and it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fall into the hands of a living God; and withall He is just, and they are conscious to themselves of much guilt. But yet, notwithstanding of this, the thoughts of Gods having a principal hand in all these afflictions, may keep from fainting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (1.) He is not intending their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Enemies do; but their Good, their Amendement, their Repentance, and Returning unto the Lord &amp;c. (2.) He measureth not out their a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lliction, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his strength and almighty Power, else He should soon crush them, and bring them to nothing. <hi>Will He plead against me</hi> (said <hi>Iob Chap. 23. vers. 6.) with his great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? No, but He will put strength in me.</hi> (3.) Nor according to strick Justice, and pure Wrath. <hi>In plenty of justice, He will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;</hi> as the words of <hi>Elihu Iob 37. vers.</hi> 23. may be read. <hi>He will not stir up all his wrath, Psal. 78. vers.</hi> 38. (4.) Nor according to their deservings; for that word of <hi>Zophar</hi> holdeth true. <hi>Iob 11. vers. 6. God exacteth of thee, less than thine iniquity deserveth.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 103. vers. 10. He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> (5.) Nor doth the Lord deal with them, as Enemies; the difference
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51835:72"/>
is great betwixt his dealing with the one and with the other <hi>Esai. 17, vers. 7. Hath He smitten him, as He smote those that smote him? is he slaine according to the slaughter of them, that are slain by him?</hi> But on the contrary, He dealeth with them, according to a rule of Mercy, and fatherly Compassion; for as a Father pitieth his Children, and only chasteneth them; so doth the Lord deal with them. He knoweth what they can bear, and layeth no more upon them, than they are able to bear. The wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tels us <hi>Prov. 12. vers</hi> 10. That <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man regairdcth the life of his beast,</hi> and therefore will not overcharge him with a load, heavier than he can bear: And will not the righteous Lord regaird the life of his own servants? Are they not of much more value, than many beasts? Sure then, He will not overcharge them. 1. <hi>Cor. 10. vers.</hi> 13</p>
               <p n="2">2. The beleeving and right considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Truth, That God over-ruleth and disposeth of, and ordereth afflictions, as He seeth good, would much help unto the life of <hi>Patience,</hi> which is so commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>Iam. 5. vers.</hi> 11. Being a piece of the honour and badge of Saints <hi>Revel.</hi> 13: 10. and 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. and so much taken notice of by God <hi>Revel. 2. vers.</hi> 2, 19. Yea and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51835:72"/>
profitable, having its perfect work <hi>Iam. 1. vers.</hi> 4. and bringing happiness with it <hi>Iam.</hi> 5: 11. This Consideration (I say) rightly Improven, may help hereunto; for it will fortifie the soul of the Beleever against those thoughts, which usually occasion impatience. as</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) When the man is poreing upon the uncouthness of the Affliction, wherewith he is exercised, and saying with the Church <hi>Lam. 1. vers. 12. Behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger,</hi> he is ready to give way unto impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But when he considereth, who hath prepared this potion for him; that it was no unskilful Apothecary, it was not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Enemie, that intended his death and destruction; but the only Wise and Supream God, who was seeking his good, his life and health, and who knew, that no other potion would suite his distemper, and purge out his peccant humores; this will help him to lye under the workings of that physick with patience; Though the potion of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick be bitter, and work something hard, yet a wise man will have patience, when he considereth, that the Physician, who did appoint it, was both well skilled, and his special friend; and therefore perswadeth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51835:73"/>
himself, that no less would do him good: So when the beleever considereth, that it is His God and Father, who hath prepared that potion for him, and that He saw his distemper called for it, and when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth that God with his own hands did make and prepare it, weighed all the doses, with great carefulness, and mixed in noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but what was most necessary, he will drink it, though bitter, with the better will: and albeit it work hard, and make him sick; yet he will not be impatient, and cry out, why am I so and so handled? doth every one get such paining &amp; sickning phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, as this? but rather say, because every one needeth not such strong physick, I must be dealt with in a special manner; I have other corruptions, than ordinary, and therefore must have patience, and be content to be otherwise dealt with, than others usually are.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The person in affliction, when he seeth, himself compassed about with evils, and that he is not visited with one or two rodes, but with many at once; and that innumerable evils compass him about (as said <hi>David Psal. 40. vers.</hi> 12. which in part occasioned his adding, <hi>therefore my heart faileth me,</hi> or forsaketh me.) then he is ready to say, how can I, while thus invironed with evils,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51835:73"/>
have patience? But if he would call to mind God's hand in the matter, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, he would, with him, bless the name of the Lord; for then he would see, that God himself had ordered all, and that not one of all these multifarious evils came, without the Lord's special and active Permission, and Providential Ordination, Appointment and Commission: and that God alone had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that mixture, and combination of troubles and trials.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The impatience of Gods people is oft occasioned by their imagining, that the trouble is greater, than they can bear: as we see in <hi>Iob Chap. 6. vers. 11, 12. What is my strength, that I should hope! And what is mine end, that I should prolong my dayes? Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brasse.</hi> And againe <hi>Chap. 7. vers. 11, 12. Therefore I will not refraine my mouth, I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in the bitterness of my soul. Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</hi> But would they consider and beleeve, that God knoweth what they are able to bear, and is proportioning the load to their strength, which He knoweth, better than they do: or when He seeth it fit to presse them above measure, that they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire in themselves, and not trust in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51835:74"/>
that then He under proppeth and supporteth the weak back, and conveyeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in secret strength, enabling them to stand, under the load; and thus never layeth more on, than they are able to bear: If (I say) they were calling this to mind, they would see no cause of Impatience; but rather cause of crying out, when we are weak, then are we strong, and therefore we will glory in our infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon us 2 <hi>Cor. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ers.</hi> 9, 10. And they would through faith, be in case to say, with <hi>Paul 2 Cor. 4. vers. 8. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Their Impatience is likewise occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by considering, that their Trouble and Affliction is still growing, when they supposed, that it should have decreased. But the right Improvement of this Truth would frame the Soul for patience, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hereof: because the beleever would see ground to say, grow as it will, the hand of the Lord is about it; it will grow to no greater height, than he seeth good: let Enemies blow at the fire, as fast and with as great earnestness, as they will, the furnace shall be no hoter, than the Supream Master and Over-ruler of all,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51835:74"/>
seeth fit, for the ends He intendeth: He knoweth the nature of the mettall, and how hote a fire will serve the turn to purge it.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) This also raiseth impatient thoughts in their heart, That they can see no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an outgate; all doores are so shut, that no hope appeareth: thus was it with <hi>Iob;</hi> &amp; therefore hath he many such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: as <hi>Chap. 7. vers. 6. My daies are swifter than a weavers shuttle, and are spent without hope. Vers. 7.â€”Mine eye shall no more see good. Vers. 8. The eye of him, that hath seen me, shall see me no more.</hi> But this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience would evanish, if this were beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Lord's hand were in and about the affliction, making a faire way to a saife escape, and at length, in his own due time, putting a period to the Trouble: when his work is finished, &amp; the end He designed attained: and if it were firmly beleeved, that, let Enemies make all as sure, as they can, and rage as they will, they shall not be able to keep them longer under their yron harrowes, than He seeth good, no not one day, nor an houre.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The right improvement of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration would help unto an holy and sweet Submission, and cause us say with <hi>David Psal. 39. vers 9. I was dumb, not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51835:75"/>
my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> When <hi>Aaron</hi> met with a sad dispensation, two of his prime sones, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> were taken away in the fiour of their age, and that in a very terrible manner, by fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for their rashness, and when <hi>Moses</hi> told him <hi>Levit. 10. vers. 3. That this was it, which the Lord spoke, saying, I will be sanctified of all them that come neer me,</hi> it is said of him, <hi>And Aaron held his peace.</hi> A sight of the hand of God, though in a terrible manner, in that dispensation, made him lay his hand upon his mouth, and sit silent in the dust; He had not one word to say. So that a sight of the hand of God, in the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ordering all things in it, would help them unto a Christian, yea unto a cheerful Submission: It would not be <hi>patience by force;</hi> but an hearty, willing, cheerful choosing, bearing and embracing of that lot, because bound on their back by the hand of God. Shall we not drink (would they say) this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with delight, that God hath prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and carefully made up for us? He knoweth what is best for us; Shall we not willingly lye under the crosse, that God hath tyed upon us, when He knoweth what He is doing, and what we must not want, and will not sufler us to be tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

there will be an end, and all the power of Enemies shall not obstruct our Delivery. The Church <hi>Micah. 7. vers.</hi> 9. could sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sit down, and <hi>bear the indignation of the Lord,</hi> when by faith she could say, <hi>Rejoice not against me, O mine Enemie; when I fall I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be alight unto me.

               <p n="4">4. The beleeving improvment of this would keep the beleever from fainting, and sincking through discouragment: many thoughts come into the minde, while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is lying on their loines, and Satan can suggest many things, at that time, to cause the poor man succumb, while under the load: but the faith of God's Soveraigne and Absolute O dering of all things, in and about the Trouble, according to his own mind, would keep up their head, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from a sinful and shamful faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They look too much to instruments, and pore too much upon their Nature, Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Activity, Power, Wisdom, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, Maliciousness, Rage, Cruelty, and Indefatigableness; and forget that they are but under agents, and can do nothing, but as the Supream God Willeth, Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t he, Disposeth, and Permitteth; and that He alone Over-ruleth all, Moderateth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51835:76"/>
and Ordereth all, according to His own mind, and for His own holy ends, So that they cannot do any thing, whether as to the Substance, or as to the Circumstances of the affliction, but as He, who is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Master of work, is pleased to suffer and give way unto.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The beleeving thoughts of this Truth would keep the Soul from that dreadful sin of Murmuring against the Lord, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of any Trouble or Distress, he meeteth with. It is the Lord, would the Soul say, and who am I, that I should quarrel with Him. He is ordering, disposing and moderating all, that under agents and lixes are doing, so that all things are done, as He will; and shall I yet be displeased and quarrelsome? Enemies cannot get their will, They are over-ruled, in all their Consultations, Projects, Contrivances, bloudy Resolutions, and cruel Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; matters go not, as they will, but as He will, who is over them; and why then should I murmure, and repine against Him?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This would also airth the Eyes of the soul towards the right object, in a day of Trouble. They would not with Heathens, look to chance or fortune, as ruling and ordering all; nor would they with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

multitude f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>x their eye upon the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and run with the dog to the stone, that is cast at him: but would see another more noble object of their sight, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Principal Agent, Mover, and Orderer of all, in whose hand the wicked are, as the ax and saw in the hand of the workman, and as the rod in the hand of the father; and this sight would help unto a Spiritual Christian frame of Godly fear &amp; Subjection of Soul, and would put the soul in case, to observe the Wisdom, Soveraignity, and absolute Dominion of God, doing what He will, frustrating the toakens of the liars, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing the craftie devices of wicked men; as also this sight would minde the man of Christian duties, of searching his wayes, repenting of his sinnes, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe to the Lord; for he would see, it was the Lord, with whom he had to do. He would look for his Outgate and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God alone; so that his Faith, his Hope and his Confidence would be in the Lord alone. His eye being fixed on this object, he would not see cause of troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ng himself much about-Enemies, or how he might procure their favour; and so would be keeped from Temptations to any sinful compliance or accommodation: So would he be preserved from temptations to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51835:77"/>
using of unlawful meanes for an outgate. Thus we see, how advantagious this eyeing of the Lord, in the day of Trouble, is unto the afflicted; and the faith and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Consideration cannot but airth the souls eye unto this object.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The right improving of this Truth would free the beleever from many carnal, disqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51835:77"/>
he might see the Lord fitting him by secret strength for it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Finally</hi> the faith of this, and the right improvement of it would preserve the soul from a dead and senseless stupidity, under the rod, or stoical frame, as unconcerned with what befalleth them, which hath no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with, but is utterly repugnant to, a Christian frame, and to Christian valour, and undaunted courage: This looketh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to the frame of an Atheist, than of a Child of God, who trembleth and feareth, when he seeth the rod in his Fathers hand, and dar not despise the chastening of the Lord. Now a sight of God's hand in all, Ordering, Timeing and Seasoning, Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Compounding, Limiting and Bounding, Qualifying and Restricking, Terminating and Ending, Directing and Over-ruling, would perserve the soul from a dead Temper, and cause him mark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the footsteps of Royal Soveraignity, Majesty, Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Care and Tenderness.</p>

               <p>WHen the Leaders and Commanders of an Army, are to bring the Infantrie thorow some deep water, they use to alight off their horses, and walk on foot, that they may take a share of the same lot with the souldiers, that thereby they may the more encourage them to wade with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness thorow the water: and it proveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed some matter of Encouragment to soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to follow their Leaders, be the way never so uneasie. Our Lord Jesus, in like manner, who is called the Captaine of our Salvation <hi>Hebr. 2. vers.</hi> 10. knowing that his followers had both fire and water to go thorow <hi>Esai 43. vers.</hi> 2. the more to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, to endure that hard lot, would come down off his Throne of Majestie and State, and take a share of the lot himself; yea and go before them to break the ice. Therefore it cannot but be most advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the souldiers of Christ. who have a mind to run the race, that is set before
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51835:78"/>
them, to be looking, in the time of their affliction, upon this Captain, according to the advice, which the Apostle giveth unto the afflicted and persecuted Hebrews <hi>Chap. 12. vers. 2. Looking unto Iesus, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of faith, who for the joy, that was set before Him, endured the cross, and despised the shame. 3. Consider Him, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured such contradiction of sinners against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; lest ye be wearied and fainte in your min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> For this same end and purpose do we finde the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> proposing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for the encouragment of a number of poor scattered and afflicted saints 1 <hi>Petr. 2. vers. 21. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.</hi> And againe, <hi>Chap. 3. vers. 17, 18. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for wel doing, than for evil doing: for Christ also hath once suffered, the just f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>It will then be of no small advantage, to afflicted persons, to have this Copie and Example laid before them, if He would help us to speak unto it, in any measure to edification. It will not be necessary, to speak of this subject of Christ's Sufferings, in the full latitude; but it will be sufficient to speak of them, only in reference to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51835:79"/>
end proposed; as an Encouraging Example; and in order to this, we shall only do these Two things. 1. We shall mention and propose some particulars, considerable in the sufferings of Christ, which may be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter for the thoughts of a Child of God, in affliction, to dwell upon: 2. Speak some things to the advantagious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same, in a day of Trouble.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> we shall onely mention these particulars considerable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Person, who was put to all these Sufferings, was no ordinary person: we think more of the sufferings of a Noble-man Prince, King or great Potentate, than of the Sufferings of a mean, poor man. What shall we then think of the Sufferings of Christ, who was higher than the Princes of the earth, who was King of Kings and Lord of Lords? He was <hi>in the form of God,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Essential Divine form with the Father, He <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> having the same Divine Nature and Properties. <hi>Phil. 2. vers.</hi> 6. And yet for all this, <hi>He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the forme of a servant.â€”And being found in the fashion of a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross vers.</hi> 7, 8. Even He, who was the <hi>Ancient of dayes, who was set up

from everlasting, from the beginning, ere ever the earth was Prov. 8. vers.</hi> 23. Even He was put to end his dayes in paine and sorrow, He, <hi>whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting Mica.</hi> 5: 2. Who wasthe <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ends of the earth,</hi> who <hi>was with God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made, that was mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>. Ioh. 1. vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Even He it was, who was put to all this suffering. What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is this, That the <hi>everlasting Father, the Prince of peace, the mighty God,</hi> as He is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Esai. 9. vers.</hi> 6. should become <hi>a man of sorrowes, and acquanted with griefe Esai.</hi> 53: 3. That the High and holy one, who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth eternity, and whose perfections and vertues are past finding out, should be found in the fashion of a suffering Man, That God should be thus manifest in the flesh 1 <hi>Tim 3. vers.</hi> 16? This is a subject worthy of our thoughts, That He, who was God equal with the Father in power and glory, having the fulness of the God head dwelling in him bodily, <hi>Col. 2. vers.</hi> 9. should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend so low, as to take on Him mans Nature, and suffer therein. It is true, the Divine Nature could not suffer: but his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature being personally united unto the Divine Nature, the Person was one, and so He, who was and is God over all,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51835:80"/>
blessed for ever, did suffer, while his humane Nature was put to suffer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider by whom He was put to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, even by all ranks of Persons, both high and low, by rich and poor, by noble and ignoble, by Church-men and States-men, and by souldiers, by judges higher and lower, and by lixes, by Jewes and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Some of whom were Malicious, Invective, Cruel, Merciless and Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Enemies; such as the Priests, the Scribes and the Pharisees, who were ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders; and did all out of pure malice and wickedness of heart, committing thereby that unpardonable sin, <hi>Mat. 12. v.</hi> 31, 32. These drove forward their cruel designe, and forced <hi>Pilat,</hi> in a manner, to condemne Him, though he found no fault in Him; and urged a late law of their own thereunto, saying <hi>Ioh. 19. vers. 7. We have a law, and by our law he must die, because he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Son of God;</hi> a strange law, by which they had bound themselves to condemne and pursue unto death the Messiah, whom they pretended to be waiting for, when ever he came; for the true Messiah was to be Immanuel: and when this was not like to work, their malice carrieth them further <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. saying <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesars friend; for whosoever maketh

Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> saith <hi>Act. 3: 17. And now, Brethren, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider the duration of his Troubles, they lasted not for a short time, for a few Dayes, or Moneths; but during this whole Life: For His whole Life was nothing but a Life of Suffering: no sooner came He into the world, but <hi>Herod</hi> sought his Life. He was forced to flee into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> being but a childe in the cradle. He was a Man of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and acquanted with griefe <hi>Esai. 53: vers.</hi> 3. from the Cradle to the Grave, His Life was interwoven with sufferings of one kind and another; and especially after He entered into the publick exercise of His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and was Baptized, He is not well out of one trouble, while He meeteth with another; How oft is He put to flee, and hide himself for his Life? How oft is He malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tempted, slandered, persecuted, called a Devil, hated and hunted, until He is at length condemned and killed?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider what it was that He suffered: It was not one kinde of Trouble and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51835:81"/>
that He was exercised with; but in a manner all sorts came upon Him, He was a <hi>Man of Sorrowes and acquanted with griefe,</hi> He was <hi>oppressed and afflicted Esai.</hi> 53 3, 7. He <hi>was despised and rejected of men Esai.</hi> 53: 3. He <hi>hid not his facefrom shame and spitting, but gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them, that plucked off the hair Esai. 50: v. 6. Matth.</hi> 26: 67. and 27: 26. He was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Poverty, and the like. He was apprehended as a Thiefe or a Robber, Imprisoned, false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Accused, Condemned, Scourged, and Crucified. He was mocked and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Words and Deeds, when they put a Crown of Thorns on His Head, clothed Him with a Rob, and put a Reed in His Hand, and bowed the knee before Him, saying, <hi>Hail, King of the Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Consider what, beside all this that He suffered in His Body and Name, He suffered in Soul, when He was in the Garden <hi>Matth.</hi> 26: 37, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>. Where He <hi>began to be sorrowful even unto Death:</hi> Yea so sad and heavy was He, that He cried out <hi>Vers. 39 O my Father, if it be possible, let this Cup passe from me:</hi> And this He cried thrice over, which showeth the vehemency of that pressure, under which He lay, at that time, when He was beginning to wrestle that bloudy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51835:81"/>
combat with the Wrath of God, and to drink that galled Cup, wherein was the Law<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> curse, because of Sin. And all this was from the Hand of His Father; for it was He, <hi>who bruised Him, and put Him to griefe Esai. 53: vers</hi> 10. And it was He, who hid His face from Him; so that He cried out, while on the Cross, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And that when He was presently to give up the Ghost <hi>Mat. 27: v.</hi> 46, 50.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Consider how little outward Comfort of Friends or Relations He found, all this time: While He was sweating drops of Bloud, through the vehemencie of the bitter agonie, He was into, while in the Garden, He could not prevail with His Disciples to watch with Him, but one houre. And when He was apprehended by the treacherie of His own Disciple, who ate of His Bread, by <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitour, all His other Disciples forsook Him; Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Peter</hi> denied Him thrice, not without Oaths and Execrations; His loving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Disciple <hi>Iohn</hi> stood a far off; bleeding and sorrowful-hearted, <hi>Mary,</hi> His Mother, durst not come neer to Him: When the Shepherd was smitten, the Flock was scattered.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Consider how innocent He was,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51835:82"/>
He had done no violence, neither was any deceit found in His mouth <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 9. Though He was just, yet was He put to suffer 1 <hi>Pet. 3: v</hi> 18, and 2: 22. We know what false accusations were brought-in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him; But by all their false witnesses, they could not get Him convict of sin: The Causes wherefore (as to men) He was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned were Glorious and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truthes, such as His affirming that He was the Son of God, and that He was a King, though His Kingdom was not of this World; and therefore was not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Caesars</hi> Kingdom <hi>Luk. 22: 70, 71. Ioh.</hi> 18 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yea not only had He done no wrong, but He was come about the most necessary and useful Business of the World, <hi>to wit,</hi> to save sinners. He was come to bear witness to the truth, and to lay down His Life for His People; He was come to save them from Sin and Destruction, by bearing the Wrath and Curse of God, that was due to sinners, in their stead, as being their Cautioner, and substitute by the Father, in their Room and Place. He was <hi>Iesus,</hi> the Saviour of His People: The Horn of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us, in the House of David, that we should be saved from our Enemies, and from the hand of all, that hate us, as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:51835:82"/>
sung <hi>Luk. 1: vers.</hi> 68, 69, 71, &amp;c. And yet notwithstanding that this was his errand, this was the welcome He gote. He came unto His own, but they received Him not: He came to save them, from all their Enemies; and they dealt with Him, as with the Worst of Enemies; and were never at peace, until they had gotten Him crucified and buried.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Consider what a Death He was put to: It was not a simple Death, but a multiplied one: For being Crucified, He had (1) a Painful Tormenting Death, a long lingering and painful Death, yea five Deaths at once, every nail bringing Death with it. (2.) He had a shameful Death, while thus Crucified, as a chiefe Malefactor, and hung-up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Theeves. (3.) He had a cursed Death; for the Law said, cursed is every one, that hangeth on a tree <hi>Gal. 3: vers. 13. Deut.</hi> 21: 23.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Consider for whose sakes all this suffering of His was: It was for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just 1 Pet. 3: vers.</hi> 18. He bare our griefs, and carried our sorrowes; He was wounded for our Transgressions, the chastisement of our Peace was upon Him; The Lord laid on Him the iniquity of us all, for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his People was He smitten <hi>Esai. 53: vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 8. It was for Enemies that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51835:83"/>
Christ, died for sinners, and for the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 6, 8, 10.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Consider likewise how patiently He endured all this, <hi>When He was reviled, He reviled not againe 1 Pet. 2: vers. 23. He was brought, as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, so He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not His mouth:</hi> Yea though <hi>He was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth Esai.</hi> 53: 7. When He was accused of the chiefe Priest and Elders, he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing <hi>Matth. 27: vers.</hi> 12. Yea, when <hi>Pilat</hi> said unto Him, hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? He answered him to never a word, in so much that the Governour marvelled greatly <hi>vers.</hi> 13. When one of the Officers stroke Him with the Palme of His Hand, He only answered thus; <hi>If</hi> I <hi>have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou Me? Ioh.</hi> 18: 22, 23. We have heard of the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> but withall also of much of his Impatience: But never was such Patience seen in any, as in Christ; never was there an Impatient Word heard out of His Mouth, even when the base Souldiers were reviling Him, spitting in His face, putting a Crown of Thornes on His Head, and a fools coat upon Him,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51835:83"/>
and when scourging Him, buffetting Him? Hoodwinking Him, and Mocking Him. Yea when they were doing the worst they could devise against Him; He said, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Consider how willingly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully He did undergo all, When He knew, that the Priests Emissaries were coming with the Traitour to apprehend Him, He would not go out of the way; nor suffer His Disciples to rescue Him; yea He would not pray to His Father for Angels help: <hi>Thinkest thou</hi> (said he to <hi>Peter Matth. 26: 53.) that I cannot now pray to My Father, and he shall presently give me more, than Twelve Legions of Angels. Vers. 54. But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be.</hi> Nay all the Roman Souldiery could not have taken His Life, if He had not been willing <hi>Ioh. 10: vers. 17, 18. Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love me, because I lay down my Life, that</hi> I <hi>might take it againe. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my self. I have power to lay it down, and</hi> I <hi>have power to take it againe: This Commandement have</hi> I <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my-Father.</hi> He had a Baptisme to be Baptized with, and how was He strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

or pained, till it was accomplished? <hi>Luk. 12: v.</hi> 50. How offended was He at <hi>Peter,</hi> when he would have disswaded Him from suffering, saying to Him, <hi>Get thee behinde me, Satan Matth. 16: v.</hi> 23. When He knew, the time was approaching, it is said, <hi>He steadfastly set His face to go toward Ierusalem Luk.</hi> 9: 51.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second</hi> thing here to be spoken to, the Advantagious Improvment of these Particulars, We shall only mentione some Conclusions, which the right thoughts of these things, will helpe the Beleever to draw, in order to his posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a life, in time of Afflictions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Afflicted Beleever may say, I need not think it strange, that I am exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with Afflictions, Temptations and Tribulations: It is no new or uncouth thing that is befallen me; the Captaine of my Salvation was thus, and worse handled; and who am I, that I should think to be exeemed from such a lot? Is it not enough, that the common Souldier be as his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? Nay, will not the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier be glade to share of the Captains lot of Hardship? And should not I rejoice, that I am honoured to weare my Captains
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51835:84"/>
Livery? His Life was a Life of lasting and growing trouble; and should not I be glade to follow Him, and drink of that Cup, whereof He drank? Affliction was no strange or uncouth thing to Him, and why should it be strange to me? Have I Him, even Him, set before me, for a Copie, and why should I not be most willing to write after this Copie?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the Afflicted Beleever may Inferre, I have so little cause to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of all that is befallen me, that, when I consider what Glorious Christ did meet with, I have great cause to Wonder, and Praise, that I am so gentlie dealt with: He hath been very tender towards me; when He might have made my lot much more sad: behold, how He hath pitied me, and considered my weakness. He hath not dealt with me, as He dealt with His own only begotten Son, Jesus Christ: His own dearly beloved Son was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exercised, than I have been: He had more sharpe Trials and Temptations, and sadder Exercises to rancountre with, beside the Wrath and fierie Indignation of God, that He had to wreastle with. How mercifully then hath God dealt with me,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51835:85"/>
that He hath not made my Torments and Grief inward much more insupportable? O! When I read, how the Holy and Just One, the Innocent Lamb of God, was handled by sinners, through the Holy Permission and Providence of God, and lay my petty troubles in the Ballance with these, how am I made to wonder, that the | Lord hath not dealt otherwise with me a sinner; and to cry out, who am I that I should have been stroaked with such a gentle Hand? Who am I, that God should have put so much sugger in my Cup; when the Prince of Life, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, who was Holy, Harmless, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and separate from Sinners, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise handled? So that right thoughts, of this would make them ashamed to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the most High; or to repine at his Dispensations with them. When they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how others are spared, and they so sharply exercised, their hearts are ready to say, why doth the Lord deal so with me? Why doth He single me out from others, &amp; deal worse with me, than with them? But if they would presente before their eyes, what Christ, the Son of His Love, did meet with, they durst not suffer a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling thought to lodge within their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51835:85"/>
heart; but all their frettings, and repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would be turned into wonderings and praises.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Afflicted Beleever would hence draw this Conclusion. Seing Christ was put to suffer such and such evils before me, I may inferre, that the sting, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and curse of these evils are taken away: Seing He hath passed thorow the straits of Affliction, He hath made the passage easier and wider for His followers: He hath sweatened the passage, and taken the sting away; so that now, it cannot hurt or harme so much, as otherwise it would. Christ hath gone thorow Sorrow, Shame, Paines, Wants, Temptations, Mockings, Spittings, Scourgings, Yea and Death it self; and thereby hath paved a Way for His Followers, and hath straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with flowres of fragant Love; His footsteps, all alongs the way, have dropped fatness. O how sweet hath He made an hard bed now? He became poor, that we might become rich, even while poor; and so might sanctifie Poverty to us. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man of Sorrowes, and acquanted with griefe, that He might sweeten that lot unto His Followers, and keep them from the evil of it, from the hurt and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51835:86"/>
of it. May not this Consideration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage His Followers, to embrace the Crosse with Love; Complacency, and Delight, when it is thus sweetened to them, and in a manner no Crosse? May not a Prison become an heartsome Palace unto His People, when they consider, how the Prince of Life, the Absolute Lord of all, the Chiefe or Standard-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer amongst Ten Thousand, was taken from Prison <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 8.? How welcome should an unjust Sentence from men be, when our blessed Lord was taken also from judgment, and was wickedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a Traitour? How sweet should the most shamful and painful Death be to us, that the wicked can devise, as the expression of their imbittered malice, and rage; when Noble Jesus was crucified; and so put the most shamful and cursed Death, that could be; seing hereby Death hath lost its sting, and the curse is taken away; for he was made a curse <hi>Gal. 3: vers.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Afflicted Beleever may hence Inferre, That seing Christ hath thus been exercised himself, He knoweth how to Pity and Sympathize with such, as are so handled. Was He Mocked, Vilified,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51835:86"/>
Maligned, Despised, falsly Accused, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a Traitour to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Buffetted, Spit upon, Scourged, and Hanged as a thiefe; He knoweth what it is to be so exercised, and what such a condition calleth for, and what they in such a condition have need of: He knoweth what word of consolation will be fittest for them. And this is no small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment unto the Beleever, as was shown above <hi>Consid.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The suffering Beleever may draw this Conclusion. Seing Christ was put to all these sharp and sad sufferings, I may well lay my hand on my mouth, I may put my mouth in the dust, &amp; be silent, let the Lord lay one me what He will: and by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he may quiet all the insurrections of his spirit against the Lord, and put a check unto all the insolent thoughts, that arise in his mind against the Lord's proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour with him, upon whatsoever occasion: as</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Doth this trouble and vex his spirit, that he is innocent, as to what is laid to his charge, and is persecuted without cause? And will he not be quieted, when he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth, how the Innocent lamb of God was handled; how He was mis-used and persecuted, who did never man hurt, <hi>who never did sinne, nor was guile found in His
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51835:87"/>
mouth 1 Pet. 2. vers.</hi> 22. They hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Him without a cause <hi>Ioh. 15. vers.</hi> 25. as they did <hi>David,</hi> who was a typ of Him <hi>Psal. 35. vers</hi> 19. and 69. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. See also <hi>Psal. 35. vers.</hi> 7. and 109. <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and 119. <hi>vers.</hi> 78, 161.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Doth it vex him to think, that he hath to do with unreasonable men, worse than Heathens or Turks? And will not this stop his mouth, That they can be no more rude, absurd, cruel and unreasonable, than those with whom Christ had to do? What faire law or justice could Christ get? They could not get so much as false witnesses to agree in any thing to accuse Him of; yet they would persecute Him to the death. <hi>Pilat</hi> was convinced of his Innocency, and yet did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Him to be crucified. What men more irrational, than the brutish, ignorant rabble, set on by judicially-blinded and enraged Ring-leaders, the Priests and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Doth it vex them to think, that their own familiar friends and acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces turn their back upon them, and refuse to comfort them? And had not Christ this to wrestle against, when all fled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook Him, and His own Disciple betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Him; Is it not said, that He came unto
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51835:87"/>
His own, and that His own received Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap> not? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 11.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Doth it trouble them to think, that they are exercised with many troubles at once, and which is worst of all, when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles are lying on, the Lord is hiding His face? And I pray, was not this also Christ's lot? was not He put to cry out, even while on the cross, and within a few minuts of expiring and of giving up the ghost, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And had He not a sadder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exercise, while in the garden, where He was made to sweat drops of bloud, than any that can befall them? He had the weight of Law-wrath to bear, that was due to all the Elect ones; but the hidings, which Beleevers can meet with, are only fatherly with-drawings.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) If the duration and continuance of the trouble and affliction come into their mindes, and vex them; let them think, that it cannot be worse with them, than it was with the Lord Christ, whose whole life was a life of suffering: we read of His weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but never of His laughing. How oft was He in hazard of His life, even from His Infancie? How was He maligned, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, called a Devil, a glutton and a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biber, a profane Person? How oft were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51835:88"/>
snares laid for Him? and how did Trouble follow Him to His grave?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The afflicted Beleever may hence In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, That it is his duty to study and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour patience: for in this did Christ leave us an example, that we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low His steps 1 <hi>Pet. 2. vers.</hi> 21. In this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Peter,</hi> we have some particulars, which were evidences, proofs or effects of Patience in Christ, in all which we should labour to follow our Example: as</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As He was free of sin, before He began to suffer, &amp; His Enemies could lay no sin to His charge; so, while He was under their hands, all the paine and trouble, they put Him to, caused Him not to sinne in thought, word, or deed: So should the Sufferer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour &amp; strive against sin: It is true, we cannot be sinless, and our corruptions will work; yet it is our duty to wrestle against corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to set a watch upon the door of our lips, and to guaird our hearts; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give heart and tongue and all unto Christ to keep; that we may be helped to suffer holily, to His glory.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>When He was reviled, He reviled not againe; when He suffered, He threatned not.</hi> When they were doing the worst they could do against Him, He did not in the least requite them, or wish harme
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51835:88"/>
unto them; but on the contrary, as we heard <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 34. He prayed the Father to forgive them. So in this should we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to follow our copie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give proof of our Christian Patience; to bless when they curse us, and pray for them, when they dispitfully use us, and persecute us; and to do them good, that hate us: thus shall we evidence that we are the Children of our Father, who is in heaven <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 44, 45.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>He committed Himself to Him, that judgeth righteously:</hi> He referred Himself and His Cause unto the righteous Judg of quick and dead. So should we do, we should not fret our selves because of evil doers, neither be envious against the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity; but commit our way unto the Lord, and trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to passe <hi>Psal, 37. vers.</hi> 1, 5. waite for His decision, who is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge.</p>
               <p>Further, the right Consideration of this Patience of Christ, in all His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, would help us unto a more Christian and Patient way of bearing the crosse; for we would see ground to say,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Was Christ, who did no sin, put to all this suffering; and did He bear it all with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51835:89"/>
wonderful patience; and should I take it ill, to be thus persecuted, seing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit men have no just quarrel against me; yet God hath just cause to pursue me? Was sinless and holy Jesus patient, and should I be impatient, who am punished of God, less than mine iniquities deserve?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Was Christ so patient under such an heavie cross, with which mine is not to be compared, or named in one day; and should I be impatient, and thereby offend God more? It were better for me, to be following my copie, and keeping mine hands clean of sin, let the crosse be what it will.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Could not all the wrongs, that Christ met with at the hands of cruel and ungrate wretches, move Him once to give them one evil word, or to wish them the least evil imaginable; But did He ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray for them? And is it fit for me to be wishing them evil in my heart? Should I not rather desire to imitate Christ, and to strive against mine own passion, and willingly forgive them all the wrongs, they do unto me?</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Did Christ commit His cause to God, and waite for His decision? And should not I possesse my soul in patience,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51835:89"/>
resting on God by faith, that He will judge all these wrongs and injuries, in due time? Is not God the judge? And doth not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belong unto Him? And should I think to dethrone Him, and take his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and work upon me? Oh! It is better, that I follow Christ, &amp; roll all over on God, and quiet my Soul in hope of a righteous Determination from God, the righteous judge of all the world.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The right consideration of Christ's sufferings upon such an account, as to men, I mean, His suffering because He affirmed Himself to be a King, would make the Beleever, called to suffer upon that same account, <hi>(to wit,</hi> for Asserting, Maintaining, Avowing, and by their actions and practice Declaring, that Christ is King, and only King and Head over His spiritual Kingdom and Church,) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in that honour, that is put upon him, to be called to witness unto such a Truth, that Christ Himself was a Martyr for, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Men. O! how should this fill the hearts of such with joy, &amp; make them sing, in the midst of the flames, and rejoice in that they are counted worthy to suffer for so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a cause, or for the least branch thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. From Christ suffering so willingly,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51835:90"/>
so cheerfully, so resolutly for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, for sinners, and for rebels, the Suffering beleever will draw this Conclusion: did Christ suffer such things, and that so cheerfully, heartily and willingly for my cause; and should not I be ready to suffer cheerfully, heartily and willingly for his Cause, Word, Truth, and Interest? So that this would hearten unto an hearty and couragious witnessing for the Lord, and for His Truth, and for the Word of His Patience, and shame the man from a discouraged, faint-hearted, dead and drouping manner of following Christ, and of bearing His cross; for he would see cause to say, did Christ suffer so much for unworthy, sinful, nothing Me, and that with so much Patience, Cheerfulness, Sted fastness and fixed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; and should I be ashamed of Him, who is the God of glory, the Prince of the Kings of the earth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, or of His Cause and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest? Should I carry, when suffering upon His account, and upon the account of His Truth, His Word, His Testimony, His work and Interest, as if I were an evil door? Should I carry, as if I repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of owning Him, and His Interest? No,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51835:90"/>
no, I should account it my glory, as it is indeed.</p>

            <div n="12" type="consideration">
               <head>CONSIDERATION. XII. Our Sufferings are nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to Christ's.</head>
               <p>WHen we spoke to the last Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we mentioned something of this: But because more is to be said of it, and it may be edifyingly Improven, for the ends designed; we shall speak alittle more to it here by it self, though it be but a branch of the former. And for this cause, we shall do these two things. 1. We shall mention some particulars, whereby the disproportion betwixt Christ's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Ours, will appear manifest. 2. We shall shew how thoughts of these my prove advantagious unto a Christians spiritual life, in a day of Affliction and Tribulation.</p>
               <p>In order to the understanding of the <hi>first,</hi> we would take notice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the disproportion is infinite, in respect of the Persons suffering: what are we, Yesterday-Nothings, base and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51835:91"/>
worthless wormes, whose life is in our nostrils, vaine empty shadowes? But He is the standart-bearer amongst Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Cant. 5. vers.</hi> 10. The wonderful Counsellour, the Mighty God; the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Father, and the Prince of peace <hi>Esai. 9. vers.</hi> 6. This maketh that all our Sufferings are not worthie to be compared with His. We know, that the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Nobility, Worth and Dignity of the Person, who is put to suffer, maketh the Sufferings more in the account of men, than otherwise they would be. That a poor, base, unworthy beggar is scourged, spit upon and buffeted, is nothing, or not much considerable; but to see a King, a Prince, or great Noble-man so used, that is a considerable matter, in the eyes of men. It is not much to see beggars sitting on dung-hils; but it is much to see such, as did feed delicatly, sit desolat in the streets; and to see such as were brought up in scarlet, embraceing dunghils; that is indeed matter of a lamentation. <hi>Lam. 4. vers.</hi> 5. To see base men contemned and slighted is not much; but to see Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hanged-up by their hand, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Elders not honoured, that is sad and lamentable <hi>Lam. 5. vers.</hi> 12. So it is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51835:91"/>
not much to see us, base, unworthy, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and nothing creatures, suffering, and put to hardships, disgrace, paine, shame, miserie and wants: But to see the Prince of the Kings of the earth in disgrace; to see the Lord of life killed, the Son of God despised, the King of Kings spit upon, and put to paine; to see the Heire of all things suffering want; that is an uncouth sight. This maketh Christ's sufferings incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably great, and all our Sufferings nothing in comparison with these, even when ours are at the greatest. What are the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a beast, of a worme, or the like, unto the sufferings of the greatest Prince that ever was, or unto the sufferings of an Angel? And yet the worme being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as the Prince or Angel, the difference is not so very great: but the difference is Infinitly more great, betwixt the sufferings of Christ, who is God, equal with the Father in power, and the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the greatest King or Emperour, or Angel that ever was, because there is no comparison betwixt Finite and Infinite, betwixt God and the Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We know it is much more for one to suffer Death, while in the flowr of his age, and in the prime of his Strength, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51835:92"/>
who in all probability, according to his natural Constitution, might live many years; than for one, who is half Dead already, and is carrying about with him the Sentence of Death, his Body being decayed, and his clay-cottage ruinous, and almost fallen to the ground: So in this respect Christs Sufferings are far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ours; for our Clay-bodies are so rotten with Corruption, so broken with sicknesses and diseases, that a few years should put an end to our dayes, and we should quickly return unto dust, though no hand were streatched out against us; yea, though all imaginable meanes were used, to keep us in vigour and life. But Christs Body, though a true Body, yet was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free of these Corruptions, that come because of sin, which our Bodies are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto: We never read of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And though his death was not wholly miraculous, yet we may not say, that He would have died naturally, as other men do, though no violent hands had been laid upon Him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We use to think much more of his sufferings, who suffereth wrongously and without Cause, than of his, who suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deservedly; We will not be much
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51835:92"/>
moved to see a bloody Murderer put to Death; but it will move us much to see a man put to death, against whom nothing worthie of Death can be alleiged. So, in this respect, our Sufferings are nothing in comparison of Christs; for however, as to men, we should suffer innocently; yet there is ground for God to plead His controversie against us, and to use these, as Instruments of His Justice, to execute His righteous Sentence against us. But it was otherwayes as to Christ, who, though as standing in the room of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and made their Cautioner, and so made sin for them, or had their sin imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Him, He was smitten of Justice; yet as to His own Person, He was the Innocent Lamb of God, and without sin, Holy, Harmless, Undefiled. And as to men, He suffered most wrongously, as was seen above.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The difference is great in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, That Mercy is Master of work, standing at the side of the fournace, and ordering the same, while His people are lying into it: But the Law-wrath and Justice of God was blowing at the coal of Christs Sufferings. We have to do but with men, whose Actions are over-ruled
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51835:93"/>
by the Omnipotent hand of a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God? But He had to do with God, executing Law-Justice, because He stood in the room of the Elect. The Lord laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our Iniquities, the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon Him. He bear the iniquity and sin of many <hi>Esai. 53. v.</hi> 5, 6, 11, 12. His own self bear our sins, in his own Body, on the tree 1 <hi>Pet. 2: v.</hi> 24. It is not so with the Lords People; He dealeth not with them, in pure Wrath, or in Justice; but in Mercy and in Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Cup, that Christ had to drink, was full of the purest Law-wrath, and so bitter, that His Holy Sinless Soul did scunner at it: But in the Cup of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there is not one drop of the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Justice of God, or of Law-wrath; but much of His Fatherly Mercy, and it smelleth strongly of Love; for He is bringing about their good hereby. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the disproportion betwixt Christ's Sufferings and ours is Infinite, upon this account.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Put the case (which yet will not be) that God should deal with any of His owne, according to strick Severity, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51835:93"/>
Law-Justice; yet could not their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be comparable unto Christs. Though they were pursued by pure Justice, and by Law-vengeance, and sent away to everlasting flames, they should not, for all that, endure what He endured; for they should but suffer, in that case, for their own particular and personal faults: But Christ bear the sins of many, even of all the Elect: And this would make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference great: How much greater then must the difference now be, when their Sufferings are of a far other Nature?</p>
               <p n="6">6. This will be further clear, if we Consider, how Christ did not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the Debt of the Elect, and wrestled with strickest Law-Justice; but by His Sufferings, He made full Satisfaction to Justice; which they all, for whom Christ died, had never been able in hell to have done; there had they lyen, for ever, and had never come out of prison; for they had never been able to have satisfied Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: But what Christ Suffered was full Satisfaction to Iustice, that it could crave no more; the Bond and Obligation was cancelled on the Crosse, and Christ cried out, <hi>It is finished;</hi> intimating that the last penny was payed. Thus Christ suffered

more, than all of them could have done, for all Eternity: and so certainly His suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were transcendently and surpassing great; and the hardest of our Sufferings ought not to be named in one day with His.</p>
               <p>In Order to the Improving of this, (which is the <hi>Second</hi> Particular) we shall mentione these few things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were this Consideration rightly thought on, and improven, His people would not be so much troubled and aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righted, in a time of Sufferings, as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are. We see how Christ went up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and set His face to go thitherward, resolving to go thither, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of all Impediments in the way; and albeit His Disciples were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from that journay, and would have disswaded Him from it; He went thither with a full Resolution, though He knew He was to grapple not only with the King of Terrours there, but with pure Law-Curse and Wrath, because of the Sinnes of His chosen ones: And what should make His people afraied, who have little or nothing to meet with, in comparison of what Christ did meet with; they have nothing of Law-wrath, and of pure Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51835:94"/>
Iustice to meet with, as Christ had to rancountre with, in full measure: Iustice is now satisfied in their behalfe; and it is their mistake to think, that in and by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, God is pursueing them in wrath: It is true, there may be fatherly anger and displeasure in the Cup, Which they get to drink; but Christ drank-out the Curse, and satisfied Vindictive Iustice, and there is no payment to Iustice, no not one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required of them, in all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. So that Beleevers have not so great cause to fear, as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were this rightly considered, the people of God would carry more like Saints under Afflictions, than they do: They are oftentimes, when sore afflicted, saying within themselves, why doth the Lord deal so with me? Are not many worse than I am more gentlie dealt with. Oh! They consider not what Holy and Harmless <hi>Iesus</hi> was made to suffer. Sure, if they considered this, they durst repine and fret in their mindes no more. What though they have been innocent, as to men; and vvhat though they be sincere and upright, as to God? Yet they are sinners, and Christ, vvho never sinned, vvas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51835:95"/>
handled both at the hands of God and Man, than they are, though their Afflictions and Sufferings vvere many vvayes multiplied.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Right thoughts of this would teach them to carry the yoke with very great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and submission of Soul: Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus had another sort of yoke upon His blessed neck; and yet he bore it with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Patience, yea with Holy Delight. Why then should they be so impatient under their light and easie Yoke? It is little they have to bear, yea nothing, in comparison of what Christ stood under.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seing Christ suffered so much, and bore the Curse, what have beleevers now to endure, or lye under? The height they can be reckoned to, is but small remnants of what fell on Christ in a full floud; and what they meet with is wholly free of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Wrath. They suffer but some little thing of that, which is behinde of the Sufferings of Christ <hi>Col. 1: vers.</hi> 24. Christ trode the Wine-press, He hath gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the sea, and all the mighty waves thereof: The shoure of Law-vengeance fell on His face, in its full force and might; and there is nothing of that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51835:95"/>
left, but small drops of the outward Affliction, freed of the Curse, left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde for His Followers. Have not His Followers then cause of Rejoiceing, upon this account, in the midst of all their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though trouble increase, yet they ought to be quiet, and possesse their Soul in Patience; for it will never increase to that height, that it will be equal to Christ's trouble: Though their Afflictions come to the heighest, that men can bring them to: Yet will they be infinitly below the Afflictions, that Christ suffered. Have any then cause to complaine, when they are so gentlie dealt vvith; and vvhen all their Afflictions are in a manner no Afflictions, in comparison of Christs?</p>
               <p n="6">6. We are oft ready to look upon our Sufferings thorovv a magnifying glasse, and take notice of all Considerations, that may serve to heighten them; and thus vve take a vvay to create much more trouble and vexation to ourselves, and to make our life more sad and bitter: But the right improvement of this Consideration vvould prevent all this; for vvould vve take a right vievv of the inconceivably great and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled Sufferings of Christ, ours in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51835:96"/>
of these, would soon evanish out of sight, and disappear as nothing: And thus would we be brought to bear our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with full Subjection of Soul, with silence, yea and with thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Gods Graciousness and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, who hath dealt so gently with us, when He might have made the yoke more, yea much more, heavy and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Who, taking a right View of what Christ suffered, will not think themselves called to suffer for His sake, with great wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness and cheerfulness? May not every Beleever say, did Christ undergo the heavy weight of the Wrath of God, for me? Did He lye under the Law-curse, and bear the blowes of Vindictive Justice, for me? Stood He betwixt me, and the pure Wrath of a sin-revenging God? Did He drink the bitter Cup, the Gall and the Worm-wood of Law-vengeance, that I might be freed therefrom? Did He bear that, under which I should have lyen to all eternity, that I might never come into that place of torment? And what Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Persecution, Tribulation, Distress, Sorrow, Paine and Suffering should I think too much for Him and His sake?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51835:96"/>
Seing He endured for me the brunt of the battel, and stood-out the sharpest of the storm and hail of Divine Wrath, and Law-Indignation; why should not I be content to bear a drop of mans Wrath, or of the storme of mans Indignation, which is free of the Curse and of pure Wrath, for Him and for His Interest? Hath He suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much for me, and shall I think much to suffer such a small matter for Him? Is there no proportion betwixt what He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endured, to save me from Hell and from the Wrath of a Sin-revenging God, and what I can be put to suffer for Him, and His Testimonie? And shall I notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be unwilling to undergo such a small inconsiderable bit of suffering for His Glory, and for the Word of His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? Drank he the Cup of pure Wrath for me, and shall I think much to drink a drop of cold Water for Him? O how will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cheerful would the right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Consideration, make the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, to undergo all that men could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, for His Lord and Master?</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION XIII. Suffering hath been the Lot of Christ's Church, in all Ages.</head>
               <p>ORdinarily when the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God meet with new trials and troubles, they cry out, as the Church did of old <hi>Lam. 1: v. 12. Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow:</hi> They presently conclude, that their case hath not a parallel, and that the Church in no age did meet with such a dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they are under: Hence proceedeth much sorrow. But if it were considered, that the Church in all Ages (very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) hath met with the like or sorer trouble, and hath drunk of that same cup, that is now at theit Head, they could not but see cause of laying their hand upon their mouth, and sitting silent in the dust, as being convinced, that there were no new thing under the Sun; Therefore, seing this Consideration may be of use, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a spiritual Life under Afflictions, we shall speak a little to it; and in order
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51835:97"/>
to the right improvement thereof, lay down these following Particulars to be pondered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The only Wise God hath thought good, for His own Holy ends, that His Church should be a Militant Church here, should taste of the Worm-wood &amp; the Gall of Affliction, and wade thorow Trouble and Persecution: He hath seen it fit, that she should be in a wilderness Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here: And so it hath been in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all ages, as might be evidenced, if necessary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only hath the Church of God met with Affliction; but the cup hath been long at her Head, without any intermission. The seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> were to be strangers, to serve and be afflicted foure hundereth yeers and more, even from <hi>Ismaels</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to mock, until they were delivered out of <hi>Aegypt Gen. 15: v. 13. Act.</hi> 7: 6, 7. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12: 41. Was not the Church keeped fourtie yeers wandering in the Wilderness, before she came to rest? And when settled in the promised Land, how many yeers together was she oppressed by Enemies? sometimes Eight <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3: 8. then Eighteen <hi>vers.</hi> 14. then Twenty <hi>Iudg. 4: v.</hi> 3. Then Senventie Years in captivity in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51835:98"/>
Babylon. And we know, how the Christian Church was in an afflicted and persecuted condition, in the primitive times, three hundereth Yeers, untill <hi>Constantine</hi> the great came to the Empire; and how long she hath groaned under Antichrist's ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord also thinketh good, to renew the daies of the Church her sorrow; after some warm blainks, and some short respite; as the primitive Church had, in the intervals betwixt the Ten vehement and fiery Persecutions, some whereof were of longer, some of shorter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: After a respite, He sendeth a new storme; so that her calamites are like waves of the sea, ere one be well away, another cometh. Hence the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith <hi>Ps. 129. vers. 1, 2. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea moreover, the Lord seeth good to afflict her, with billowes of waves of His displeasure, and to afflict her very sore: as <hi>Esai. 64. vers. 9, 10, 11, 12. Be not wroth very soreâ€”Thy holy cities are a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, Zion is a wilderness, Ierusalem a desolation. Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our pleasant things are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51835:98"/>
laid waste: wilt thou refraine thy self for these things? O Lord, wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</hi> This was a sore stroke, which destroyed both Church and State.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some times the Church hath to do with moe Enemies, than one, at once: See <hi>Psal. 83. ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. For they have consulted together with one consent, they are consederat against thee. The Tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagarens, Gebal and Ammon and Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek, the Philistines with the Inhabitants of Tyre. Assur also is joined with them; they have holpen the children of Lot.</hi> This was a dreadful conspiracy of all the Enemies round about, both far and neer; and their designe was, to cut off the people of God from being a Nation, that the Name of Israel might be no more in remembrance <hi>vers.</hi> 4. As <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> will agree, when they are to concurre to the cutting off of Christ; so these Enemies, though sometimes at variance among themselves, yet can agree in one to joine their forces together, to destroy and cut off, if they could, the Inheritance of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Withall the Lord may hide His face, in the midst of these outward calamities,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51835:99"/>
and refuse to give light, comfort, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel or direction. She may be afflicted and tossed with tempests, and withall not comforted. <hi>How hath the Lord</hi> (said the Church <hi>Lam. 2. v. 1, 3.) covered the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion with a cloud in his anger?â€”He burned against Iacob, like a flame of fire</hi> See also <hi>Chap.</hi> 3: 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other passages.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sometime the Lord so ordereth the affliction, as that the very timeing of it, maketh it much more heavy, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would be; as when His people are secure, and crying peace, peace. The Israelites thought all was well, when they were gote out of Egypt; but ere they were awar, how quickly were they inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with new Difficulties, pursued by Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, &amp; all his hosts; &amp; having the red sea before, and no way to escape upon either hand, doubtless the very season &amp; time of this new difficulty made it very grievous. It cannot be but sad, when it is with the Church, as <hi>Ieremie</hi> saith of the Church, in his time <hi>Ier. 8: v.</hi> 15. and 14: 19. <hi>We looked for peace, but no good came, for a time of healing, and behold trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Not only is the Church put to contend with open Enemies; but she is also much
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51835:99"/>
molested with false friends, who, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of friendship, seek to ruine her; These prove most dangerous Enemies, as traitours within a besieged place. While she is prospering, many offer their service to her, and seem to be cordial friends, and yet are but a mixed multitude, who, when the first occasion offers, will seek to returne to Egypt: for all their profession of kindness and friendship, when a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offereth, there are none more bitter Enemies, than they are. So that it oft fareth with her, as <hi>Paul</hi> said it would fare, after his death, with the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in respect of Hereticks and false Teachers <hi>Act. 20. vers. 29, 30 For I know this, that after my departing, shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock; also of your own selves shall men arise, spea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>ing perverse things &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Yea, so low may the Church some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be brought, under the feet of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. that little hope may remaine of her recovery; yea she may be looked on by one and other, as in a desperat and forlorne condition; so that even many of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may be shaken in their hops, and saying, will the Lord be favourable no more? Are His mercies clean gone? Doth His promise fail for ever more? Hath He forgotten
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51835:100"/>
to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Such may be her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that all humane probability of her recovery may be gone, and the faithful have nothing but a bare haire ofhop to hold by, or a small plank ofa promise, &amp; that also under the waters of contrary dispensations, to stand upon; and so far may the delivery be out of sight, that, when it beginneth to dawne, they may be as those that dream <hi>Ps. 126. vers.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet withall it is considerable, that notwithstanding of all the opposition, made by the Devil and his Instruments, against the Church, she hath been a burning bush, and yet not consumed: though she hath been many a time afflicted, and that from her youth, yet her adversaries have not prevailed against her: the plowers have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten plowed upon her back, and made long their furrowes; yet still the righteous Lord hath cut the cordes of the wicked <hi>Psa. 129. vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. Many an arrow have they shot at her; yet mount Zion stands, and she hath her Towers, Bulwarcks and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. She is founded upon the rock of ages, and the ports of hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against her <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. No Weapon, that is formed against Israel, shall prosper <hi>Esai.</hi> 54: 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:51835:100"/>
If these particulars were rightly thought upon and improven, we might be helped thereby to a life of Faith and Hope, both in reference to the sad condition of the Church in general, and also in reference to our own particular suffering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And first, In reference to the Church, we may from these particulars see ground of giving a check to our Inferences from the Lords's present Dispensations with His Church, savouring of Unbeleef, Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, Discouragment and Hoples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. We see, it is true, the Church over-whelmed with sorrow, fitting as a widow, and her teares upon her face: We see her looking pale, as if death were in her face, all beauty and liveliness gone, her Enemies multipliying and prospering daily, and the Church still sincking more and more in the sea of sorrow and distress. Many, it is true, are ready to say, can this be the true Church, and these the real people of God, whose life is thus constantly made bitter with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed stormes and tempests of adversity? Can this indeed be the work of God, which is thus cast down to the ground, and trampled under-foot? Would the Lord stand by and look on, when His spouse (if she were so indeed) is thus abused by the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51835:101"/>
vilest of men? Would He suffer His Name and Work to be thus blasphemed? True, all this and much more may be said, and be done against His Church, and she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine the true Church of Christ; and His work be His work. It hath been so before now; and there is no new thing under the Sun. And the right thoughts of what is said would prevent the trouble, that such Atheistical and perplexing thoughts neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily cause, if they be admitted and foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hath not the Church of Christ been a militant Church from the beginning? hath there not been a constant enmity betwixt the seed of the Serpent, and the seed of the woman? Is it any new thing to see the Church driven to the wilderness, and tossed in the sea of afflictions? Is it any un-heard-of thing, that the Church must be tossed betwixt winde and wave, and have stormes and tides and all against her? Is it any new thing to see the Church, even while within the sight of the haven of an happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reformation, driven back to sea againe? What? hath she not oftentimes seemed to on-lookers to be sunck? have not false friends many a time sought to drive her upon rocks, or cut her cables, that she might be left to the mercy of the seas; or to make lecks, that she might sinck to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51835:101"/>
ground? Is outward prosperity the mark of the true Church? No: let Antichrist make it a mark ofhis, seing so the Papists will. The Church of Christ must be the speckled bird; She must have many horns in her side: Her rest and triumphant state is above; though, it is true, she may have some breathing times, some lucide inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and a more glorious day, when the Vial is poured forth on the Seat of the Beast, <hi>Euphrates</hi> dried up, and the Kings of the East brought in, and when <hi>Babylon</hi> the great is fallen, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> destroyed, and the Beast and the false Prophet cast into the lake of brimstone; but then the end of her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare will be nigh.</p>
               <p>Againe would we call to mind, how often the Church hath been very low, and her Enemies singing a triumph, as if they had gotten an everlasting victory, and as if they were assured, that the Name of Israel should be no more mentioned; and yet the Lord hath hithertill saved, and hath brought that broken Vessel saife to land. Notwithstanding of all that the red Dragon the Hethenish Emperours did in persecuting, with their bloudy massacres, the Christian Church, the first three hundered Years; yet the Church of Christ, grew and multiplied and spread over all the Empire. And
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51835:102"/>
though the Antichristian abomination did prevail in the Church, and the woman was made to flee to the wilderness 42 moneths, or 1260 dayes, or Years, from the Year 660 or 666 (as some compute) untill the Reformation 1550. or 1560. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this long desolation and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, dureing which time the Gentiles posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the outter court, the Lord in his own good time, in the dayes of <hi>Luther</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, made light break up, and made the world see, that His Church was not yet destroyed. And though now Antichrist be thinking to possesse the outter Court againe, and to destroy the Reformation &amp; to make even the lands, that were by solemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant devouted unto Christ, as His pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Inheritance, become lands of graven images, and brought under his tyrannie: yet the Lord liveth, &amp; we are to waite in faith &amp; hop and to possess our souls in patience; for now is the faith &amp; patience of the Saints; &amp; to beleeve, that in due time, He, who hath begun to poure forth the vials of His wrath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that Antichristian cursed conspiracy, will also make an end: &amp; in His own good time shall poure forth the Vial on the Beast <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 16. vers.</hi> 10. And the judgment of the great whore shall come, that fitteth upon many waters, with whom the Kings of

And which is drunken with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyres of Jesus. Which is manifestly interpreted by the Spirit of God <hi>(Revel. 17. vers.</hi> 8. to the end,) to be the Papal Church and State, sitting at <hi>Rome</hi> and commanding all. Wherefore it becometh all, who love their lives, to take notice of that word <hi>Revel. 18. vers. 4, 5.â€”Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues, &amp;c.</hi> for the day is coming, when it shall be said (as it is <hi>vers. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c.)

Rejoice over her, thou Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</hi> And it shall be found true, that is said <hi>vers. 21. And a mighty Angel took up a stone, like a great milstone, and cast it into the Sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</hi> And that shall be verified, which is foretold <hi>Chap. 19. A great voice shall be heard of much people, saying Allelujah, Salvation and Glory, and Honour and Power unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are His judgments; for He hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the Earth with her fornications, and hath avenged the Blood of His Servants at her hand, vers. 1, 2.</hi>

                  <hi>Next,</hi> This Confideration may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven by particular Beleevers, in reference to their particular Exercises and Afflictions: For hence they might inferre,</p>

to exercise them, and what ever Affliction<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> He lay upon their loines; for this hath been the ordinary Lot of the Church; and seing the Lord thinketh good to exercise her with sore and sharpe trials, in all Ages: Why may He not also exercise them, in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have yet less cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleane or be dissatisfied, seing the Church, their Common Mother, hath met with sadder and sorer Crosses and Distresses, than they have met with, or can meet with: It is a sadder sight to see the Mother put to the door, and sitting in a Wilderness, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refusing to be comforted; than to see a Child whipped.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they have reason to rejoice, in their sad Lot, upon this account, that they are not in that solitary and lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alone; their Mother is suffering with them. Are they in a Wilderness, so is she: are they sitting in the dust, so is their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sitting with them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That by this they see, they are no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards, but Children of the House, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with the Mother, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes dealt with, than the Mother is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Crosses and a Course of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are no evidence of the Lords not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51835:104"/>
or looking upon them as His Children; as corruption and unbeleefe would prompt them to inferre and conclude: Afflictions can no more say, that they are not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; than Afflictions on the Church can say, that she is not the Church of Christ, nor His Spouse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they may comfort themselves, in their Troubles, with the Mother her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations; and as it were lye in her lap or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and partake of her cordials, and feed with her upon the same promises, until the night be over, and the day dawn, and the time of the singing of the birds come, and the voice of the turtle be heard in the land, and until the Beleever's God and the Church her Husband wipe all teares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the face both of Mother and Child.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION. XIV. Other precious Beleevers have been Afflicted so, if not worse.</head>
               <p>THough such, as are ease in Zion, think little of all the Trouble and Anguish,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51835:104"/>
that the Afflicted are put unto; and not a few prove like <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends <hi>Iob. 6: v.</hi> 15. &amp;c. though <hi>to him, that is afflicted Pity should be showne vers.</hi> 14. Yet such, as are under the Affliction, can subscribe to the truth of that, which the Wise Man hath <hi>Prov. 15: 15. All the dayes of the afflicted are evil:</hi> for, so long as the Affliction endureth, they are ready to think, that their Condition groweth worse and worse daily. Nay, ordinarily Affliction so seazeth upon them, that they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grounds of Comfort, though hard at hand, and can make little use of Cordials, though within their reach. A time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is such a thoughtful time, that they are as a Ship at Sea, tossed with Tempests and contrary Tides. Among other distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing thoughts, this is one, How is this (think they with themselves) that the Lord hath pitched upon me, and singled me out, from all the rest, or the most part of His Children, at least, whom I know, and set me up for His mark, at which He is shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Arrowes? My case is not like the ordinary case of others; there is something extraordinary in my case: I know, that His Followers have been in Affliction, but their Affliction was nothing comparable to mine: Were all things laid together, my Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be found to be of another kind:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51835:105"/>
Were my Affliction but such as others have had, I should be able to bear it; but there being something Odde and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth in mine, I cannot choose but be troubled.</p>
               <p>Though He only, who comforteth those, that are cast down, can comfort such, 2 <hi>Cor. 6: vers.</hi> 7. Yet he can do it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely meanes, and blesse a few words to this end. We shall therefore only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a few things, that may serve to make a Diversion, as to these perplexing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing thoughts; and reduce them to these few Heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We shall propose a few Generals, which such afflicted persons would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Shew how, possibly, their case is not so singular, as they conceive it to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We shall show, how little cause they would, possibly, befound to have, to speak thus, if all things were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We shall show, how that, seing they will take notice of others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their case with theirs, they may and should improve the example of others, better than thus.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> let these Particulars be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51835:105"/>
1. It is ordinary almost with every one to be accounting their own case and condition, in Affliction, singular; and to say, as much as those of whom we are now speaking. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one feeleth that best, which is neerest to himself: they are more sensible of their own paine, than of the pain of others; and paine felt is more touching, than what is understood by the report of others only. Hence every one is ready to conclude, that their own case is worst. And therefore this should be looked upon, as no strange thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every bodies Temper and Disposition not being alike, some may be obnoxious to distempers and diseases, that others are not much acquainted with; and some by their Folly and Intemperancy may bring pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diseases upon themselves; and when such must have peculiar Physick, adapted to their diseases, should they complean of the Physician; that he giveth them not such gentle and easie Medicines, as he doth to others? So the compleaner here may have brought upon himself some uncouth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual distemper, which calleth for some Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, more than ordinary, to cure the same: Should they then be anxious to finde out a precedent, or one that hath been so handled, as they are? Ought they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51835:106"/>
to reasone thus with themselves, doth the Lord purge and afflict me more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, then it is like my peccant humors, &amp; my corruptions, have been more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be it so, that thy case is in some res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects singular, what knoweth thou, if there shall be two found, in all particulars, or in all considerable circumstances, every way alike? May not the Lord hereby declare and preach forth his Infinite Wisdom, in guiding so many Sones and Daughters to glory, through so many several Kindes of Trials, Exercises, Afflictions and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? Will it not be much to His Glory, when every one of the Redeemed shall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side their wondering at the gracious Work of Redemption, common to them all, have each something peculiar to himself, raising his Admiration? As it commends the wonderful Workmanshipe of God, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many millions of faces of Men, two shall hardly be found, betwixt which no difference shall be discovered; so, may not this commend the Work of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</p>
               <p n="4">4. And what if, as to those Particulars, wherein they think their owne case singular, it be otherwayes indeed? Have they had through acquaintance with all the Saints of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51835:106"/>
God, in all ages? Why then do they speak so confidently?</p>
               <p n="5">5. But be it so, as they say; yet they should know, that they are in the hands of a well skilled Physician, and of a tender Father, who knoweth their Constitution, their Distemper, and their Strength; and will make the Physick no stronger, than He knoweth they can bear, and will work, and do them good. And this should cause them forget their complaints.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All that people say, while under a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, must not be taken for certaine. <hi>Iob</hi> had many expressions, while under the Affliction, that he would not owne or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, afterward.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second</hi> Head, that we may come neerer their case, what if it be found, that even as to these same Particulars, upon the account of which they account their case singular, others, of whom we read in Scripture, have been in the like case before? We shall therefore mentione some Particulars, which people in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction use to aggravat their case from, and because of, look upon their case as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some may think their case singular up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, That they never knew much in experience what prosperity meant;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51835:107"/>
their Life hath been nothing but a Life of Exercises, Temptations and Trouble. Such would know, that some therefore would possibly think, they might bear Afflictions the better, being so accustomed therewith, and inured thereunto, and trained up at that School. But however, they erre, if they think, that this case is singular, or that none but they have been so exercised; not to mention our Lord Jesus, whose Life was a Life of bitterness, as we saw above; see one Instance of <hi>Heman Psalm. 88: vers. 15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.</hi> His Trouble and Affliction was not of Yesterday; He was under it from his youth:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others, it may be, will complaine, and think their Affliction so much the sadder, that they have not been much enured with, nor trained up at the School of Affliction; &amp; that if they had been used with Trouble, they would have thought this, that now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them, the more light and easy to be born; but now, having been so long in prosperity, and at ease, the Affliction co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is more terrible, and seemeth more insupportable. Oh what is man, that will thus abuse and pervert all things; and can be satisfied with almost nothing! Others would look upon this Dispensation as gentle
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51835:107"/>
and easie, and as a great favour, and yet what some would account a mitigating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, others will look upon, as a great aggravation. Some would say, that such were not much to be pitied, who have had such a long Summer-day of prosperity: who would think much, if a Shipe, that hath for many dayes had a faire winde, should towards the end of her Voyage, meet with a contrary blast; But the truth is, so rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious are our hearts, that none of Gods Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations with us, can satisfie us; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body is better pleased with anothers Lot, than with his owne; and therefore we are so ready to choose any condition, but what God is pleased to carve out unto us; and we think every bodies Affliction is more easie, than our owne; and we could bear any Lot better, than what we are called to bear. May it not be thought, that such as compleane upon this account, would complaine much more, if it were with them, as it was with <hi>Asaph Psal. 73: v. 14. All the day long have I been plagued and chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edevery morning?</hi> However such as cry-out, because after a long time of prosperity, they meet with adversity, would know that their case, in this, is not singular; as <hi>Iobs</hi> instance can evince, who was not much acquainted with adversity and affliction, till Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51835:108"/>
to pursue him; but dwelt at ease, and in prosperity <hi>Iob. 16: 12. I was at ease, but He hath broken me asunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Some possibly will look upon their case as sad and singular, because the Crosse, under which they stand, seemeth so heavy, that they see not how they shall be able to stand under it. As if, forsooth, every one almost were not ready to say the same; How few are there, who look upon their own Affliction, as the lightest and easiest? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> told us, <hi>Psal. 6: vers.</hi> 3 that <hi>his Soul was sore vexed</hi> and <hi>Psal. 55: vers.</hi> 4. that <hi>his heart was sore pained within him.</hi> Was not the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites case in Egypt hard, when their <hi>lives were made bitter with hard bondage Exod</hi> 1: 14. and they were made <hi>to sigh by reason of the bondage Exod.</hi> 2: 21? Was it not sad with <hi>Paul</hi> and his Companions, when he saith, <hi>they were pressed out of measure, and above strength, in so much, that they despaired even of life 2 Cor. 1: v.</hi> 8. We hear of some, who have <hi>come out of great Tribulation, Revelation 7: v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some possiblie will account their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition singular, in that it is not with one or two rodes, that they are chastened, but with many, and with several sorts, their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is complicated, and many are twisted together; whence they are ready to say,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51835:108"/>
That none was ever so visited and afflicted, as they are. But the case of <hi>Iob</hi> is enough to confute this mistake. Hath God taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy goods, and made thee of a rich man, a poor man? So did He to <hi>Iob,</hi> whose riches were great; for he had Seven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Sheep, Thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So did He take away <hi>Iob's</hi> Seven Sons and Three Daughters, and that in one houre, and that by an unusual manner, he neither seeing them die, nor getting one word of them, before they died. Read his book, and see what a multitude of evils came upon him at once. See a short summe <hi>Chap. 19: vers. 8,â€”21. He hath fenced up my way, that</hi> I <hi>cannot passe, and He hath set darkness in my Paths, He hath stript me of my glory, and taken the Crown from my Head. He hath destroyed me on every side, and</hi> I <hi>am gone, and mine hope hath He removed, like a tree. He hath also kindled His wrath against me, and He counteth me unto Him, as one of His Enemies. His Troups come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my Tabernacle. He hath put my Brethren far from me, and mine acquaintaince are verily estranged from me. My Kinsfolk have failed,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51835:109"/>
and my familiar friends have forgotten me. They that dwell in mine house, and mine maidens account me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. I called my servant and he gave me no answere, I intreated him with my mouth. My breath is strange to my wife: though I intreated for the Childrens sake of mine own body.

Paul 2 Cor.</hi> 6: 4 5, 8, 9, 10. giveth us a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of calamities of various kindes, that he and others did meet with: such as, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Necessities, Distresses, Stripes, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Tumults, Labours, Watchings, Fastings, Dishonour, Evil reports, accounted Deceivers, Vnknown, Dying, Chastned, Sorrowful, Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51835:109"/>
in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false Brethren, in weariness, in painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness &amp;c.</hi> Who can say, that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion runneth parallel with this? And if not, have they any cause to complaine, and cry out, never man was so hardly dealt with, as they are? See also what hardships those did undergo, of whom we read <hi>Hebr. 11. vers. 36; 37, 38. They had trial of cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and scourgings, yea moreover of bonds and Imprisonments, they were sawne asunder, were tempted, were slaine with the sword, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, &amp;c.</hi> Can they say, that they are more hardly dealt with, than these were? If not, is not their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint very groundless?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some possibly will account their case singular, in that afflictions attend them, as the shadow doth the body; where ever they be, and whithersoever they go, Crosses, Troubles and Temptations are their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Companions. But do they verily think, that none before them, hath had as good cause to speak thus, as they? Sure, the Catalogue of calamities, that <hi>Paul</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth up, as we heard lately, saith, he had such a lot, before them, He met with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51835:110"/>
trouble both by sea and land, in cities, in wildernesses, by his own countrey-men, by strangers, and by false Brethren; in some places was he scourged, in some places beaten with rods, in some places stoned, in some places imprisoned &amp;c. so that a short view of his life will put this beyond question. And himself said <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 23. that <hi>in every citie bonds and afflictions did abide him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Some may possibly think, that their sufferings are so much the sadder, that they reach not their goods, but their good name, and credite, and that without all coloure of ground. Yet, for as heavy as this appeareth to be; it is no new or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth thing. It is true, it may prove sad to some, who are tender of their name and credite, and would glory thereof; but how sad so ever it be to them, they must not say, that their case, as to this, is singular. <hi>Wo to you</hi> (said Christ to his Disciples and followers <hi>Luk. 6. vers 26,) When all men speak well of you; for so did their Fathers unto the false Prophets.</hi> And againe, <hi>Mat. 5. vers. 11, 22. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you,â€”And shall say all manner of evil against you falsly, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glade; for great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven; for so persecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51835:110"/>
which were before you.</hi> So that this was the common lot of the Prophets, &amp; was to be the lot of the Apostles, &amp; accordingly <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. vers.</hi> 9, 11, 12, 13.â€”That <hi>they were made a spectacle unto the world, and to Angels, and to men;</hi> and he addeth, <hi>Even unto this present houre, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and are buffeted, and have no certaine dwelling place, and labour working with our own hands; being reviled, we blesse; being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat; we are made as the filth of the world, and the off-scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things, to this day.</hi> Was not here a suffering of an high degree, both in body and in name? So 2 <hi>Cor. 6. vers. 8. As decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and yet true.</hi> So were they accounted, the chiefe of Traitors, such as <hi>turned the world upside down Act. 17. vers.</hi> 6. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, the man, that taught all men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where against the People, and the Law, and the Temple <hi>Act. 21. vers. 28. Elijah</hi> was called the <hi>Troubler of Israel 1 King. 18. vers.</hi> 17. We heard above, how Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self suffered in His Name. So that this must be no rare or uncouth thing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It may be an heavy affliction to some, possibly, to be persecuted by their own Countrey-men, Neighbours, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But was not Christ so? was not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51835:111"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> so exercised 2 <hi>Cor. 11. vers.</hi> 26. Were not the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> so afflicted 1 <hi>Thes. 2: vers.</hi> 14? Knew not <hi>David</hi> this in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <hi>Psal 55. vers.</hi> 12, 13. And <hi>Iob</hi> also, when not only his Friends and domestick Servants &amp; neighbours carried so unfriendly and untenderly with him; but even his own wife, that lay in his bosome, had no other consolatory counsel to give him, but to take his leave or last good night (as we say) of God, and so be destroyed out of hand; for thus the sentence may be interpreted, which in the Original is, <hi>blesse God and die;</hi> as we use to blesse, or wish well to them, of whom we are taking our leave; and so this <hi>benedicere,</hi> is, as it were, <hi>valedicere:</hi> Her say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>blesse</hi> was as much, as if she had said, <hi>Bid Him fare well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Some may think their crosse heavy upon this consideration, that they have to do with men, who know no Justice, and walk not either by Law, or Equity; but do what they please. But neither is this any strange thing; for not to speak of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was thus dealt with; what Law or Justice did <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> meet with, when upon the desire of a light dancing Damsel, his head was cut off in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, without so much as a forme of process? What Law or equity acted the confused

By what Law was he and <hi>Silas</hi> beaten openly and uncondemned at <hi>Philippi Act. 16. vers.</hi> 22, 23, 37? By what colour of law, was he drawn out of the Temple, and almost killed by the Jewes <hi>Act</hi> 21?</p>
               <p n="9">9. If it adde to the griefe of any, when they consider, that such as persecute and oppose them, are not openly profane, and wicked Persons; but such as are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good and sober persons; and such as may be judged to have the grace of God in them: It would be remembered, that howbeit this indeed be a sad Ingredient in the cup of affliction, &amp; may make the trouble heavier, than otherwise it would be; yet it is no uncouth thing: <hi>Iob's</hi> friends were good, sober, understanding Persons, though in a great mistake as to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their discourse unto <hi>Iob's</hi> state. <hi>Paul</hi> did meet with some thing like this <hi>Act. 13. vers.</hi> 30. at <hi>Antioch,</hi> when the jewes stirred up devout and honourable women against him. The false Teachers, that on all oc casions opposed <hi>Paul,</hi> were not profane, wicked Persons; for they had transformed themselves into the Apostles of Christ 2 <hi>Cor. 11: v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51835:112"/>
unto Paul's bonds. <hi>Phil. 1. vers.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Some may possibly think much to be put to open shame, and made a gazing stock, and to be exposed to open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and ludibrie; and indeed, that may be a sad affliction to some noble and generous spirit, and heavier than death it self. But yet it is no strange thing; for we read of some <hi>Hebr. 10. vers.</hi> 33. who were theatrized, brought to open scaffolds, and put on pillories, and made publick spectacles, and exposed to open mockery. So <hi>Hebr. 11. vers.</hi> 36. some had <hi>trial of cruel mockings:</hi> Was not <hi>Iob</hi> made a by-word of the people, and their song <hi>Iob</hi> 17: 6. and 30. <hi>vers.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Several other things of this nature might be named, but I shall haste unto the <hi>third</hi> particular, and shew, how little ground there would be for such complaints and outcryes, if all were known and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered: and to this end I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione these particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When <hi>Peter</hi> is writting to a scattered company, living as strangers, in a strange land, he saith unto them 1 <hi>Pet. 4. vers. 12. Beloved, think it not strange, concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as though some strange thing hapned unto you.</hi> Though they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51835:112"/>
were scattered thorow many Countreyes' and were to meet with trials, yea and fierie trials; yet he would not have them troubled thereat, or look upon it, as any uncouth accident, befalling them: teaching us thereby to look otherwayes upon the sharpest of trials and exercises, that we meet with, than we readily do; and not to think, that we are worse dealt with, than others, or that God taketh some uncouth un-heard-of course with us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if it be found, after impartial trial, that there have been many, who have drunk deeper, by many degrees, of the cup, than they have done; and that their affliction, under which they groan and cry-out so much, is nothing comparable to what others of the Lord's worthies have been exercised with? Will not this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by an impartial view of the Instances adduced? And seing their crosse is light, in comparison of what some dear to the Lord have had, is there or can there be any ground for their so complaining?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Will it not be found, that such as complaine thus, dar not compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with others, who have been as sore afflicted, if not sorer, than they, as to Grace, Sanctification, Communion with
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51835:113"/>
God &amp;c? Will they arrogat to themselves that honourable Epithet, which the Lord gave <hi>David, a Man according to God's own heart;</hi> or <hi>Iob,</hi> a <hi>perfect man and upright, and one that feared God, and eshewed evil?</hi> And if not, is there ground for their complaint, when God is dealing no worse with them, than He did with those, yea is dealing with them in a far more gentle manner?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What if it be found, that such as have been visited with the same affliction, with which they are visited, and under which they groan so much, have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, so much as they have done? And will not their complainings then be found most unreasonable and groundless?</p>
               <p n="5">5. What if it be found also true &amp; unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that those who have met with the same calamities, have been more usefull in their generation, than they are, or ever were? If God spare not the green tree, shall the drye tree, that is sapless and barren, doing little more than cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the ground, complaine, that it is cut down? We should be content with the same lot, that both the Prophets and Apostles had. It needed not grieve the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51835:113"/>
                  <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they had the same conflict, which they saw in <hi>Paul,</hi> and heard to be in him. <hi>Phil. 1. last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>last</hi> particular, is to shew a better way of improving the example of others, who have been afflicted before us, than to take occasion therefrom to complaine of God's dealing, as if it were worse with us, than with them: <hi>to wit,</hi> to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their Christian carriage under their afflictions, that we may be ashamed of our deportment, and may be stirred up to follow their example, in what is truely commendable, and is for that end held forth to us in Scripture: many particulars of this kind might be mentioned, we shall name only a few.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We finde them patient under the crosse, and their instance proposed to us for imitation, in this respect: So saith the Apostle <hi>Iames Cap. 5. vers. 10, 11. Take, my Brethren, the Prophets, who have spoken in the Name of the Lord for an example of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering affliction, and of patience. Behold, we account them happy which endure; yee have heard of the patience of Iob, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</hi> If the carriage of the Prophets under the crosse, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51835:114"/>
of <hi>Iob,</hi> were narrowly searched, it would be found, that there was sometime too much Impatience, but the Spirit of the Lord would not have us poreing upon that, but to take special notice of their patience; and in this, to look upon them, as a copie, set before us; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there was much Impatience to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in <hi>Iob's</hi> carriage; yet his Patience is taken notice of by the Spirit of God, and we are bidden look to that, as if we had never heard of one of his impatient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We finde them looking especially to God's hand in the matter, and overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Instruments, adoring and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing the holy Providence and Disposal of God, laying their hand upon their mouth, and giving God the glory: and in this we should study to be followers of them. <hi>David</hi> said <hi>Psal. 39. vers.</hi> 9. I <hi>was dumb,</hi> I <hi>opened not my mouth, because thou didst it:</hi> And when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed upon him, and cursed, he said, <hi>let him curse, for the Lord hath said unto him, curse David,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> said, the Lord hath given and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, blessed be His name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We finde them following their duty, notwithstanding of all the trouble and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51835:114"/>
which they did meet with; <hi>Paul,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of all that befel him, went on, and minded his work; when he was persecuted in one place, he went to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there preached the Gospel: And in this we should follow them; for, for this end, are these things left on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We finde them so far from fretting and repineing at the Lord's Dispensations with them, in suffering wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to afflict them and persecute them, for righteousness; that they therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, as the Apostles did <hi>Act. 5. vers.</hi> 41. And <hi>Paul</hi> glorified in these his infirmities 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And it is commendable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them here.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We finde them likewise, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all their Sufferings, standing fast in the faith, adhereing to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, refusing deliverance upon any sinful or base termes. <hi>Heb. 11. vers. 35. Others were tortured, not accepting delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they might obtean a better resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> And it were good, if we were consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to this end, that in this we might follow their footsteps.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We finde them acting faith on God, in the mean time, <hi>Heman Psal.</hi> 88. was in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51835:115"/>
a very sad case, yet for all that was come upon him, he would not quite his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in God; but beginneth that sad <hi>Psalm</hi> thus, <hi>O Lord God of my salvation.</hi> So did <hi>Iob</hi> likewise act faith on God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We finde them exercising Hop, for as desperat-like as their case would seem to be; as <hi>David Psal.</hi> 38. the beginning whereof sheweth that his case was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sad; yet <hi>V.</hi> 15, he crieth out, <hi>In the Lord do I hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. We finde them taking with their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, whereby they provoked God, to deal so with them, or desireous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is the ground of God's contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: so the Church <hi>Mica. 7. vers. 9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</hi> See likewise <hi>Lam. 3. vers.</hi> 39, 42. And <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>Chap. 10. ver.</hi> 2. I <hi>will say unto God, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me; shew me, wherefore thou contendest with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we were thus taking notice of the commendable deportment of other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, when they were in Afflictions, to the provoking of our selves unto the like carriage, we would finde it a more profitable exercise, than to be, in our mindes, aggravating our lot, beyond the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51835:115"/>
lot of those before us, and imagining that God dealeth worse with us, than He hath done with others, before us.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION. XV. Suffering Christianly is a special gift of God.</head>
               <p>MAny look upon Suffering for the Name of Christ, with an evil eye, and with prejudice; and because of the misapprehensions they have of it, they cannot complye with it; whereas a right view of it would make it less terrible, yea more lovely and desireable. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, writting to the <hi>Philippians Chap. 1. vers.</hi> 29. giveth them ground to think well of the cross of Christ, when he said, <hi>for unto you it is given, in the behalfe of Christ, not only to beleeve on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.</hi> He had been exhorting them, in the foregoing <hi>Verses,</hi> that they would stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in nothing be terrified by their adversaries: and after he had told them,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51835:116"/>
that the opposition of the adversaries was an evident token to them of Perdition, &amp; that their own standing &amp; withstanding was an evident token to themselves of Salvation, and that of God; He subjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ground of encouragment; that it was granted unto them, as a special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and that in the behalfe of Christ, not only to beleeve on Him, but also to suffer for His sake. In which words, these <hi>Three</hi> Particulars are chiefly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, in order to our present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That suffering, for the sake of Christ, is a special gift of God, and not a thing that meer natural Strength and Courage can reach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is a gift purchased by Christ, and given on His behalfe, or for His sake; and not for any thing in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is a gift, in some respect, beyond that excellent gift of faith.</p>
               <p>But before I speak particularly to these points, I shall premit these <hi>three</hi> things considerable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though to bear any crosse, or cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing dispensation, outward or inward, in a christian acceptable manner, be beyond the power of nature, and natures strength,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51835:116"/>
and is the pure gift of God: yet here we are mainely to speak of that Trouble, Afflictions and Crosses, which the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Christ are put to suffer by wicked Men, and for avowing of His truth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, of what measure or degree so ever it be; for, this is that which is here understood, and whereof the Apostle is speaking, as the forgoing and following <hi>Verses</hi> cleare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor do we hereby understand eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trouble, that wicked persons create unto the Godly (though unto a Christian deportment, in such a case, the special grace and gift of God be required:) but of that, which is properly for the Name of Christ, for adhereing to His truth and cause: for of this doth the Apostle speak, when he mentioneth <hi>suffering for Christs sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor do we speak of Suffering here, simply considered; but of suffering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained with its Christian Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or of Suffering in a Christian, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; self denied, handsome and cleanly manner; this being the Suffering, which is to be called the gift of God; and not that, which may be undergone, upon a carnal account, and may flow from a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51835:117"/>
carnal Principle, and be intended fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap> some carnal end.</p>
               <p>Having premised these things, we come to speak to the <hi>first</hi> point, and shew, That suffering in a Christian manner, for the Name of Christ, is the meer gift of God, and beyond the reach of all natural Strength and Courage: Which will be sufficiently clear, if we but take a view of such particulars, as are requisite unto a Christian way of suffering for Christs sake, some only of which we shall content our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves here to name: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the end, that one suffer as a Christian, for the sake of Christ, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that he be a Christian indeed, a <hi>beleever in Christ</hi> indeed; for a man in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can act nothing, as a Christian, as wanting the divine principle of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Actions: This is imported in the Text, now before us, where the gift of faith in Christ is supposed as existent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gift of suffering. Now it is beyond all debate with the orthodox, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ, and to become a Christian indeed, is beyond the reach of nature; and the same Text here evinceth faith to be given of God; so also is it expresly said to be the gift of God, and not of ourselves
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51835:117"/>
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8. And therefore, this Christian suffering for the sake of Christ, must be the special gift of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unto suffering Christianly it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, not only that the sufferer be aBeleever; but also, that <hi>faith be acting</hi> on God, through Christ, and resting upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of outgate, and of an everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and of throw-bearing, and the other objects of faith, necessary to be eyed, in such a day; for if this be not, even the beleever may fainte and fall backward, as we see in <hi>Peter:</hi> Now this present acting of faith being the gift of God, through His grace and influences, it is manifest, that Christian suffering, unto which this is requisite, must be also His gift.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hope</hi> is also requisite unto a Christian suffering; for hereby must the sufferers head be born-up, when he is swimeing thorow the sea of Persecution; it is the Souls anchor, which must not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a storme; it is his helmet, and must not be a missing in the day of battel. Now this hope being the special gift of God, and his work 1 <hi>Pet. 1: 3. 2 Thes. 2. vers.</hi> 13. it is manifest, that Christian suffering, unto which this hope is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, must be His special gift.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:51835:118"/>
4. <hi>Patience</hi> is likewise hereunto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, for without it, there will be nothing but wearying, fainting, fretting, repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sinful longing to be from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Crosse; hence there is so great need of patience, <hi>Heb. 10. vers. 36. Luk. 21. vers. 19. Iam. 1. vers. 4. 2 Pet. 1. vers.</hi> 6. And it is so much pressed <hi>Iam. 5. v. 10, 11. 1 Tim.</hi> 6: 11. And commended 1 <hi>Thes. 1. vers. 3. 2 Thes. 1. vers. 4. Revel.</hi> 2: 2, 9. Now this patience is not the work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but His work, who is the <hi>God of all patience Rom. 15. vers.</hi> 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christian suffering must be His work and gift also.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Humble submission</hi> and <hi>calmness of spirit</hi> is also requisite unto a right way of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for a proud, haughty, unquiet and undaunted spirit, will never take a right lift of the crosse: and this must also be wrought by the free and powerful grace of God, and must be of Him, from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh down; even of the Father of lights <hi>Iam.</hi> 1: 17. And therefore, Christian suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, unto which this is so requisite, must be of Him also.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such, as will suffer Christianly for Christ, must have <hi>Courage, Boldness,</hi> and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51835:118"/>
                  <hi>Christian Resolution;</hi> as accounting it their glory and honour to suffer for His sake, and as remembering, that as, on the one hand, their cheerful, couragious and valiant suffering for the Interest of Jesus, is no small encouragment to others to adhere to Him, and to His cause; so, upon the other hand, to suffer discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and with a fainting heart, is no small disadvantage to the cause, Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby more hardened, and friends discouraged. And this Courage and fixed Resolution must only be had from God, Nature will not fournish this. They must <hi>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might Ephes. 6. vers.</hi> 10. And as this is from the Lord alone, so must the grace of Suffering Christianly be.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He, who would suffer as a Christian, must have his Conscience sprinkled, God must be pacified, all quarrels must be taken out of the way; for the sense and apprehension of an angrie God, and sin and guilt looking the man in the face, will much dash, discourage and fainte him, in his sufferings, Now it is unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that God's manifesting himself satisfied and well pleased with the man, is His own free gift; it is His proper work
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51835:119"/>
to sprinkle consciences from dead works; and so must this Christian suffering be from Him, which dependeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When one is questioned for the Cause of Christ, before learned and able Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes-men and Politicians, or before learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church-men, he will have need of something, wherewith to answere his Accusers; and so be in case to give a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Testimony to the Truth, and the cause of Christ, otherwise the adversaries will think, they have cause to triumph, when he is made speachless (though that Christian Martyr-woman, who said, <hi>she could not disput for Christ, but she could burn for Him,</hi> did sufficiently refell all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of her Adversaries, which were but meer Sophismes) especially if the maine crime be coloured-over with some alleiged personal fault; In this, or the like cases, it is necessary, that the accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have pertinent, clear and pungent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his actions, in readiness, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refell what is falsely alleiged; or to defend what is just and righteous. Now whence shall this be had, or from whom is it to be expected, but from Him, who hath promised that it shall be given them,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51835:119"/>
in that hour <hi>Mat. 10. vers. 19. But when they deliver you up, take no thought, how, or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you, in that same houre, what ye shall speak.</hi> And therefore Christian suffering, unto which this is so necessary, must be given of God also.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such as are suffering for Christ's sake, had need to be very fixed, stayed, and stedfast, in adhereing to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as unshaken with any winde of temptation; for cedeing and yeelding, in matters of a Testimony, dishonoureth the Lord, whose truth is questioned; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth and confirmeth Enemies, and stumbleth and marreth the confidence of others; therefore such as would suffer aright, must stand to the truth, and not yeeld in an hoofe, nor sell or give away the least point of truth. And this fixed, and stedfast adhereing to the truth, is of God alone. <hi>He who stablisheth us in Christ, is God 2 Cor. 1: vers.</hi> 21. And when <hi>Paul</hi> is pressing the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to stand fast 2 <hi>Thes. 2. vers.</hi> 15. He addeth <hi>Vers. 16, 17. Now our Lord Iesus Christ himself, and God even our fatherâ€”Comfort your hearts, and stablish you, in every good word and work.</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:51835:120"/>
And therefore so must the Christian suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be of Him alone.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A Christian sufferer for Christ must have a Christian love to Christ; for it is this that maketh the sufferers not count their life dear to the death for Christ, and maketh them hazard all for Him; they love him better, than they love Father, or Mother, or any thing else in a world, and therefore are content to lose all for Him, and His sake. Now, love is of God, who is love. 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. vers.</hi> 7, 8. And it is one of the fruites of the Spirit <hi>Gal. 5. vers.</hi> 22. And must be from the God of all grace; for we love Him, because He first loved us 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. vers.</hi> 19. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so must this right suffering be from Him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Before one can suffer aright for Christ, and His cause, he must be dead and mortified to this world, and to all the Riches, Honours and Pleasurs, to the lust of the eye, to the lust of the flesh, and to the pride of life, as <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 16. Yea he must be dead to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to his own life, otherwayes these will hang as weights upon him, and hinder his swimeing through the sea of affliction and persecution. Now this self
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51835:120"/>
denial being the singular gift of God, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, unto which it is so necessary, must be His peculiar gift also.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Unto Christian Suffering for the sake of Christ, it is necessarily requisite, that the Sufferer have fresh Influences from the Spirit of God, to stirre up the graces of God in him, and to carry him thorow; for if these be withheld, a very <hi>Peter</hi> will sinfully and shamefully deny his Master: now, it is unquestionable that these Influences must needs flow from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and be the effects of Gods grace and love; and therefore so must Christian suffering be, which cannot be without these.</p>
               <p>By these particulars the <hi>first</hi> point is clear: And as for the <hi>Second Viz.</hi> That this gift of suffering is purchased by Christ, is a fruit of His death, and is obtained for His sake, and bestowed in His behalfe. <hi>To you it is given in the behalf of Christ to suffer,</hi> we need not insist upon it, seing it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and undeniable, that every gift of this kind, and every spiritual grace, is purchased to us by the bloud and merites of Christ; He laid down His life to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase heaven to His own, and every thing else, that was needful for them, in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51835:121"/>
way to heaven. In Christ are we blessed with all spiritual blessings, in celestials <hi>Ephes. 1. vers.</hi> 3. Every spiritual blessing cometh to us, in and through the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and of this Covenant Christ is the Mediator; so that every blessing of the Covenant is purchased by Him. This is also manifest from what was said, in confirmation of the former Point; for all these favours, requisite unto a Christian suffering, as the grace of Faith, Hop, Courage, Stedfastness, Patience; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility &amp;c. are purchased to us by Christ; and consequently so must this gift of Christian suffering be purchased also.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> point followeth, <hi>to wit,</hi> That this gift of Suffering Christianly for the sake of Christ, is a gift, in some res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, beyond faith: for the Apostle saith. It was given to these <hi>Philippians, not onely to beleeve, but also to suffer,</hi> which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>not only, but also,</hi> importeth a sort of gradation, and giveth some eminency and excellency unto the last; as <hi>Ioh. 5: vers.</hi> 18. and 13. <hi>vers. 9. Act. 19. vers. 27.</hi> and 21. <hi>vers. 13. Rom. 5. vers.</hi> 3, 11. and 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. and 13: 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 7. and 8: 10. <hi>Ephes. 1. vers.</hi> 21. and else where. We
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51835:121"/>
shall clear this further, by mentioning some particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Christian-suffering for the cause of Christ, doth presuppose Faith, as we said above; and so must be a gift given, over and above faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many have the gift of faith, who never receive this gift of suffering; many precious beleevers go to their grave in peace, and know not what it is to die for witnessing to the Name of Jesus, on a scaffold, or to suffer at the hands of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters, upon that account. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of famous <hi>Luther,</hi> that he oft wished and praied for this; and yet God thought fit, he should die on his bed in peace. This gift then of suffering, not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, to whom faith is common, must have some peculiar excellency, as being more rare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea even all those beleevers, who are called to suffer for the cause of Christ, cannot alwayes win to this gift of Christian &amp; Valiant Suffering for the sake of Christ, but through temptation and carnal fear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powering them, may for a time shrink, cede and fainte, and thus wrong their own peace, harden the Adversaries, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Godly, wrong the Cause,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51835:122"/>
and dishonour the Lord; as we see in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he denied his Master, and that with Curses and Execrations, whose faith yet failed not, the Lord hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayed for that <hi>Luk.</hi> 22: 32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though it be a matter of no small, difficulty to beleeve; yet some may win over that difficulty, that cannot win over the difficulty of Suffering Christianly, in bearing Testimony to the truth of Jesus, as that instance of <hi>Peter</hi> cleareth. It being then a matter of greater difficulty to suffer aright, than to beleeve, this gift of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering must be a greater gift.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Unto Suffering for the sake of Christ, in a right manner, there is requisite (as we saw above) a greater concurrence of the graces of the Spirit of God; &amp; a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity also for a greater concurrence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences, to carry the soul tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This suffering for Christ's sake hath a special piece of honour attending it: Hence the Apostles rejoiced, that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name of Christ <hi>Act. 5. vers.</hi> 41. And <hi>Peter 1 Pet. 4. vers.</hi> 13. desireth those, he wrote unto, to rejoice, in that lot; and <hi>Paul Rom. 5. vers.</hi> 3. saith, <hi>we glory in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:51835:122"/>
yea he speaketh of this, as in some respect, a step above their <hi>rejoiceing in the hope of the glory of God, Vers.</hi> 2. for he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in, with a <hi>not only so, but also.</hi> Which manifestly cleareth the excellency of this gift of Suffering.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Christian Suffering for the Name of Christ, is a common and publick good, being edifying to the Body, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to many: A mans faith is mainly profitable to himself, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ordained; But Suffering in a right manner is profitable unto many; to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Persecutors it giveth a dash, and leaveth some ground of conviction; and Friends are much encouraged thereby; yea the whole Church receiveth advantage; for thereby a noble Testimony is given to the truth, and the bloud of the Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res becometh the seed of the Church.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Suffering for the cause of Christ, in a Christian manner, maketh the Sufferers to be like Christ and conforme to the Captaine of their Salvation; as one now graduat, or advanced to an higher class; Christ came to bear witness to the truth, and suffered upon the account of bearing Testimony to the truth; and those, who are honoured with this special gift, are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51835:123"/>
made in a special manner conforme unto Him, and thus are greatly honoured.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As Sufferers for the cause of Christ are thereby advanced to great honour and dignity, so are they usually admitted to great neerness and access to God; the Lord loveth to let out of himself unto them, in a special manner: that is a confirming expression, which we have 1 <hi>Pet. 4: 14. If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of God and of glory resteth upon you.</hi> Sufferers have, even here, an happiness, and an happiness upon the account of their suffering (were it but) reproach, for the Name of Christ; and who can tell how rich and great this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is, and wherein it consisteth? The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon them; this Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of glory, working in them all His glorious graces, whereby He prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them for glory, and comforteth their souls, as if they were in the suburbs of glory, resideth in them, and resteth upon them, as the sure earnest of glory: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Suffering for His Name must be a great matter.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This Christian suffering for the Name of Christ maketh way for a greater
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51835:123"/>
degree in Glory: <hi>If we suffer with Him, we shall also reigne with Him, 2 Tim. 2: vers. 12. If we suffer with Him, we shall be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Rom. 8: vers.</hi> 17. There is a noble word to this purpose 2 <hi>Cor. 4: vers. 17. For our light Affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> The Glory, that our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Affliction worketh for us, is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Weight of that Crown is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Weighty, that can never be fully weighed: <hi>Nay,</hi> It cannot be told by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolee's heaped upon Hyperbolee's; all these will come short of expressing the Weight thereof. We finde in the Book of the <hi>Revel. Chap. 7: ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. that there were some discernable from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and more remarkable, having on a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing rob, as a peculiar livery in Glory; They are said to have had <hi>White Robs,</hi> and who were these? Such as <hi>came out of great Tribulation.</hi> They were made to wear on earth a red livery of bloud; but now in glory they are shineing in white: And it is added <hi>Vers. 15, &amp;c. Therefore are they before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>he Throne of God, and serve Him day and night, in his Temple, and He that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the Sun light on them any more, for the Lamb,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51835:124"/>
which is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of Waters: And shall wipe away all teares from their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We shall now come to speak something, in order to the improvement of these Truthes, which we have confirmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The faith of these Truthes would give a check unto several evils, that we are too ready to comply with, in a day of trial, and discover unto us several things, for which we are to check and rebuke our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do not some finde an Antipathy at the cross working and striving in them, even when the Cross is yet far off? Do they not finde some aversness of soul therefrom? Now this evil would meet with a check, if these Truthes were beleeved? No beleever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any aversness from faith; but he is still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saring more and more of it, and praying, <hi>Lord increase our faith;</hi> for he knoweth how excellent and necessary it is. And now, seing the grace and gift of Suffering is, (as we have shown,) in several respects above and beyond faith, should they be unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, if God shall be pleased to honoure them with that? Might not the beleever hence say to himself, are there any of the Gifts of God to be refused, or rejected?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51835:124"/>
Are not all His Graces and Gifts excellent and lovely? Why doth my heart then so much stand out against this? How is it, that I am not more in love with the Glorious Cross of Christ? Especially seing it is an honour, that isnot conferred on every one, and an honourable Gift, purchased by the precious blood of Christ, that hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased nothing that will harme us, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is excellent and desirable? Why then am I so little in love with suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the sake of Christ? Ought I not to be ashamed of and displeased with my self, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account? Ought I not to check this aversness?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The faith of this would give a check unto our readiness to shift the Cross, when we are called to make ready for it, and when it seemeth to be at the door: For, would we say, what? Shall we devise meanes to shift suffering for the Cause of Christ, when He is calling us to it? What, shall we meditate a way of shifting and putting away such an honourable Divine Gift, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than faith, in several respects? What unsutable &amp; unworthy carriage must this be? Is it a gift of God, and such a gift of God, and a gift given in the behalfe of Christ, as purchased by His Merites and Death; and shall we thus sinfully, base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51835:125"/>
and unworthily shift it by our door; and rather sinne, than embrace it, and make it welcome? What a shame were this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The faith of these things would give a check unto our fool-hardiness and too rash adventuring on sufferings, without a due call; and as if our strength were able to carry us thorow. Too many are too confident, and promise too much upon their own Ability, Parts, Resolution and Strength, as if the stood in need of no more; and as if this Suffering for the sake of Christ were not a pure gift of Grace, that must come down from above from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights, through Jesus Christ. Now the faith of these Truthes, would check these thoughts. Any that know what true faith is would be dissatisfied with such, as would talk of it, as a thing in their power, and which they could put in Act, when they pleased, because they would know, that such boasted of what they had not; and that faith was not in their Power, but was the special and purchased gift of God. So would the right thoughts of this put us from ever thinking to venture on suffering, in our own strength, &amp; put us to look to Him, from whom every good gift and every perfect
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51835:125"/>
gift cometh, through Jesus Christ, and waite on Him for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The faith of this would likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke our readiness to fainte, when we aer called to suffer, or engaged in it; and put a check to our saying: Alas, we will never win thorow this Sea of Affliction, one day or other, we shall shamefully fall, and betray the cause, and so come off with disgrace; and would put us to look off ourselves, and to look up unto the giver, who giveth freely; and to the Purchaser, who will receive all that He hath purchased. Must we not thus carry, in order to faith, when we beginne to feare, that it shall fail us; Do we not comfort ourselves with this, That faith is the free gift of God, and is purchased by Christ, and is not of ourselves? And why should we not do so, in order to suffering, which is also the free gift of God, and is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christ? When we are like to be discouraged with the thoughts of our own weakness, and unfitness to contend with Horsemen, and with the swellings of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan; should we not look upon it, as the gift of God, whereby He can make us strong, even when we are weak, to the Glory of His free Grace? And when we are discouraged with the thoughts of our unworthiness, and thereupon inferre, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51835:126"/>
God will never honour us, with bearing faithful Testimony unto His Truth; should we not, in humility and in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our own Unworthiness, and Provocations, look to Him, as the great and free giver, who giveth nothing because of our merites: He gave us faith freely, notwithstanding of our former Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and great unworthiness; and may He not also give us this gift, when He calleth us to the duty, freely through Jesus, the great Purchaser?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The faith of this would give a check to that humore, whereby some are ready to sacrifice to their own net, and to burn incense to their own drag; that is, to be puffed up, and vainly proud of their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when they have been helped to carry honestly in a day of trial, as if they by their wit and courage had done it, or as if it had not been given them, in that houre: what would such have to be proud of, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that this grace was freely given to them, and that, in the behalfe of Christ? And who saw, that if it had not been so, they had never been able to have endured the storme; Would not they see cause to say, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto God be Glory;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From these Truthes, we may
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51835:126"/>
be informed of several things, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which may be useful, in an evil day: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence be convinced of the difficulty of Suffering Christianly, for the Cause of Christ: It is not Natural Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Stoutness, or Fear of Shame, or the like, that will be able to carry thorow: No, no, A Divine purchased, Grace and Gift must be had, or there will be no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Many, in a calme day, may think it no great matter to suffer upon Christ's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and may seem very resolute, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ready to suffer; but when the storme beginneth to blow to purpose, and they are put to it, they finde it some other thing. than they imagined: And what wonder? It is not a thing that Nature can command, nor Natural Strength and Courage can ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for: but Divine Help is required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. It must be given, and given in Christ: and this saith, there is no small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may hence see a fundamental Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why some are honoured with suffering for the Cause of Christ, and others not; It is the free gift of God, and purchased by Christ, and so is bestowed onely on those, for whom it is purchased, and on whom free grace will bestow it. As also, whence it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51835:127"/>
cometh to passe, that of two, who are both called to witness to the truth by suffering, one is honourably helped thorow, the other fainteth. The one hath gote the free gift, the other not: It is true, other provoking causes may come here into consideration, as bringing this on; but yet this is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be considered, our sins may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to withold this gift; and when it is not given, there will be no suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the sake of Christ, in a Christian manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may hence be informed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground of this honour being bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any: It is not for their eminency of parts, or worth, or any such thing in them; but purely of free grace, and on the behalfe of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon the ground of these Truthes, we may read several Duties, called for at our hands, in a day of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. In such a day, when stormes are at hand, we should not be troubled with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and anxiety of Spirit; nor disquiet or discourage ourselves with feares and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, that we shall fainte in the day of Adversity, and shall not be in case to stand stedfast in the storme: For our strength and standing is not in our own hands, It is in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51835:127"/>
Gods Hand; His gift must make us sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>, and nothing else.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We should be looking off ourselves and all that is within us, and not think, that any thing of that kind will be able to carry us thorow; But fix our eye upon the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Giver, and lay hold on Christ by faith, and expect the thorow-bearing Gift and Grace, in and through Him; In such a day, we would do well to renounce all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; that we may not lean to it, and so betake ourselves alone to the fountaine of free grace, and expect what is necessary in that day, from Him, who giveth freely and upbraideth not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And in order to this, seing this gift is bestowed only in and through Christ, we should study before hand, to get our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ made up, that so we may have ground to expect a grant of this gift for His sake; for none else can expect this, but such as are reconciled to God through Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We would also labour to be in good termes with God, and to be keeping our Conscience void of offence both before God and Man, lest He be provoked to with-hold this gift from us. When we have been walking neer God, and keeping carefully Communion with Him,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51835:128"/>
we may go to Him with the greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Boldness, and ask this gift, through Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may hence see, what Duties we are especially called to, in the day, when we are actually and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly called to bear witness to the Truth, and to suffer upon the account thereof. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. We should make the Cross of Christ welcome, because it is Gods send; all that God sendeth should be welcome; This is a special Gift, and a purchased Gift; and therefore it should be heartily embraced, both because of the Giver, and because of the Purchaser. It is true, flesh and bloud have no will of Suffering, nature is averse from it; yet Spiritual Reason and Grace should say, God will give me nothing on the behalfe of Christ, but what is good and necessary for me; and seing Suffering for Christs sake is of that nature; and is so excellent a Gift, beyond faith it self, in so many respects, why should I storme? Why should I quarrel upon that account? Why should I not rather embrace it with love, and give it an heartsome wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only upon this account should we accept of that favour heartily and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51835:128"/>
but also we should accept thereof with Joy and Gladness, rejoicing that free grace would put that singular honour upon us: As we had cause to rejoice, when He was pleased to single us out from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, no worse than we were, and bestow faith upon us; so have we cause to rejoice, in His pitching upon us, and going by many others, better than we are, in the matter of Suffering. Should we not count it all Joy, when, for Christs sake, we fall into manifold temptations, because the Lord is thereby honouring and enriching us with this rare and precious Gift? Should we not, upon this account, Glory in Tribulations, as in so many enriching gifts, freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us of God, and purchased by Christ?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby should we learne to beware of fretting or repineing at the trouble, that the Crosse and Testimony of Jesus bringeth with it; and choose rather to be thankful for such an honourable gift, as this Suffering for the sake of Christ is: Nay the more our trouble and harassing be, let us look upon ourselves as the more honoured of God; and therefore called to be thankful and to bless; seing we should blesse Him, for all His Benefites; and this is among the chiefe of His benefites.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:51835:129"/>
4. We should then be wholly dead to ourselves, and to any stock of strength or courage, that we may imagine to be in us; that we may not think of standing upon our own legs; for these will fail us: And should fix our eye on this Father of Lights, from whom every good gift must come; and by faith depend upon Him, and seek this from Him, in prayer through faith. We have encouragment now to go to God, through Jesus, to seek this gift, because it is a gift, and because it is a gift purchased by Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And especially should this be our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, when at any time, we finde our heart like to fainte, and our strength like to faill us, and we are like to sinck. Then should we double our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>uites, and renew our acts of Faith, upon the ground of Christs Purchase, and the Fathers Grace and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to bestow what we need, and cannot now want, of His own Free Grace, and good Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is here a sure ground of great Comfort laid down; and this is the plain scope of the words; for the Apostle is comforting these Christians of the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> against the Cross, with this, (among others) that to suffer for Christ's sake was a gift of God, and a gift bestowed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51835:129"/>
upon them through Jesus Christ: So that there is here comfort against many Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragments As</p>
               <p n="1">1. Against the thoughts of the greatness of the difficulty: we are ready to cry out; Oh we cannot wrestle thorow this Cross, wherein are so many difficulties, and each more insuperable than another: But this may comfort us. That there is a gift of God for it, which will make all difficulties superable: we of ourselves, as of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, cannot wreastle thorow; but this gift can enable; and that there is nothing called for at our hands, but what this gift will enable us to do: this gift will bear all our Charges, and keep our heads above, when swiming thorow the most dangerous Seas,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may comfort against the thoughts of Rageing, Strong and Cruel Adversaries; for this gift will enable; if it be given to Suffer, we shall be helped to Suffer all their Rage and Cruelty, and not fear, or fainte.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may comfort us against the thoughts of our own weakness: we are but like a reed shaken in the winde, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure much: Yet as when the gift of faith was given all our corruption and unbeleefe, and all the Power of Satan could not hinder
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51835:130"/>
our closeing with Christ; so, when this Gift of Suffering is bestowed, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, all our inward weakness and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness shall not hinder our through-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: We shall then go in the strength of that gift, without wearying or fainting; for we shall then be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of His Might.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may Comfort against the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our own sinfulness and great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, whereby we may fear, that He shall forsake us, because of our provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not helpe us thorow: For this being the gift of God, and given in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Christ, we cannot think, that it can be given for any worth in us: What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our sins be, we may look to Him, when we are called to bear witness to His Truth, who is a great and a free Giver, and have hope that He will make us Partakers of that free Gift, in and through Christ. Beggars look for a free almes, though they can plead nothing but poverty and want; and are far from pleading their own worth and merites: He gave us faith, at first, which we neither did, nor could merite; and why may He not also give us this gift, when He calleth us to the duty?</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may comfort against the faintings of others, whom we apprehend to have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51835:130"/>
been more able to ride thorow the storme, than we are: We are ready to say, How can such as I am stand, when the like of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> fainted so foulely? But this is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it is not any stock of Grace, or inward Strength, Resolution and natural Courage, or the like, that will carry tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but the gift of God; and without this gift of God, the strongest will not stand; and with it, the weakest will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to stand-out the trial: And when God denieth this for a time unto strong Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for His own Holy Ends, He may give it to the weak, and so carry them thorow; that all may see, it is His gift that doth the thing, and nothing else.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This may also comfort us, against the thoughts of our unpreparedness to meet with the trial; for the matter of our throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing dependeth not upon our fitness, and preparation for the Exercise; but upon the Gift of God; and this gift will be more glorious and excellent in their eyes, who knowing themselves to have been very far out of case, for such a trial, were yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by vertue of that gift to stand, and to suffer for the sake of Christ.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So it may comfort against the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts of their former Miscarriages, Faintings and sinful Shunnings of a faithful
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51835:131"/>
Testimony, which may readily cause such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the Lord will stand by them no more, but forsake them, as they did formerly forsake Him: This, I say, may comfort them, that it is a gift, and a gift of God, and a gift, purchased by the bloud of Jesus, by which they must be helped; and what is of that nature, may be given, notwithstanding of all that hath past; all Gods gifts being free, and the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy they be, on whom they are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the glory of free grace shineth forth the more, and the worth and value of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christ is more conspicuous.</p>

                  </gap>usions, in their own minde, touching the Church; and to think that the Church shall be utterly extirpated; little considering the wonderful Workings of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51835:131"/>
God, who, by that meane, which, to them, threatneth ruine, is bringing about the welfare and advantage of the Church, to the Glory of His Power and Wisdom. Whereas if it were beleeved, that even by persecution, raised against the Preachers and eminent Professours, the Church should be no loser, the thoughts of such a Dispensation could not cause much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation.</p>
               <p>In order to the speaking a few words unto this, we would take notice of a few Instances, which will confirme the truth thereof, <hi>Act. 8: vers.</hi> 1. It is said, <hi>that at that time, there was a great persecution against the Church, which was at Ierusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the Regions of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea and Samaria, except the Apostles;</hi> that is, all the Church-Officers were forced to flee, after <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned. But did this any harme to the Church? No; but did tend rather to the furtherance of the Gospel; for it is added <hi>vers. 4. Therefore they that were scattered went every where, preaching the word;</hi> so that by this meanes, the Gospel was spread throughout the Regions about, and that more quickly, than otherwayes, in all probability, it would have been. When <hi>Paul</hi> is speaking of his Sufferings <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 24. he saith, they were <hi>for them,</hi> and not so only,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51835:132"/>
but <hi>for the whole body, the Church. Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behinde of the afflictions of Christ, in my flesh for his bodies sake, which is the Church.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor. 1: 6. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your Consolation and Salvation, 2 Tim. 2: 10. Therefore I endure all things for the Elects sake.</hi> Another plaine Instance we have <hi>Phil. 1: 12. But I would, ye should understand, Brethren, that the things, which happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For further clearing up of this, we shall mentione some particular Advantages, which the Church reapeth by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ's Eminent Servants and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their sufferings, upon the account of Truth, serve much to Strengthen and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the rest of the people of God, in the faith; for the truth is thereby much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto them, and made to have some deeper Impression in their hearts, when they see, that the Truthes, which those Servants of Christ delivered unto them, were such, as the Preachers themselves were perswaded of, as truthes, and as weighty truthes; yea and such, as they are ready to seal with their bloud. It is for this cause, that <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51835:132"/>
of his sufferings, in that Epistle to the <hi>Colossians;</hi> for he is endeavouring to settle them in the faith, and to keep them stedfast in the day of Temptation. He would have them <hi>vers. 23. Continue in the faith, grounded and setled, and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel.</hi> And because they might have said, what can we do, when you are put to such sufferings, and are shut up in Prison? He obviateth this by saying, <hi>I rejoice in my sufferings for you.</hi> As if he had said, My Imprisonment and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are not to your disadvantage, but for your good; and upon that account I rejoice in them. So that this is a notable mean to keep others stedfast in the truth: As, upon the other hand, it is a potent and forcible mean to shake poor people out of their hopes, and to confirme many in Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme and Infidelity, when they see such, as have been preaching forth truthes unto them, refusing to stand to them, and avow them, in a day of Temptation: Hence is it, that Satan, seeing this so much for his advantage, doubleth the force of his Temptations and Assaults against such, knowing that the fall of one such may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger many, and occasione the staggering of multitudes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this meanes the Gospel is made to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51835:133"/>
spread more, and and that not only by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the banishment of Preachers; as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 8. but also, that by reason of their very Imprisonment or Persecution to the death many will be made to enquire after the cause, why such are put to so hard sufferings; and after enquirie, some may be made to see, that their Cause is just and righteous, howbeit they be condemned, &amp; thus may be brought to like their cause, &amp; befriend it, &amp; to hate the carriage of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters: So that the Gospel-truth is no loser, by all the loss that the Preachers suffer, upon the account thereof; for when strangers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that such men of Understanding, judgment and Conscience, are ready and willing to confirme the truth of what they assert with their bloud, and to suffer any thing rather than deny the same, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to search more seriously after the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to consider its consequences, and come at length to affect that way more in their heart; an Instance whereof we have <hi>Phil.</hi> 1: 12. 13. He told them <hi>vers.</hi> 12. that what hardships had befallen him; had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel, and in the next <hi>verse</hi> he sheweth, how this was, saying, <hi>so that my bonds in Christ are manifest, in all the Palace, and in all other places.</hi> The report of his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51835:133"/>
for the Name of Christ, went far and neer; so that even <hi>Caesars</hi> Court ringed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the noise of it, and they are talking of it among themselves; and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are converted to the truth thereby, and brought to embrace the Gospel; for he tels us <hi>Chap.</hi> 4: 22. That there were Saints in <hi>Caesar's</hi> houshold, <hi>all the saints salute you, cheefly they that are of Caesar's houshold.</hi>
               </p>

So that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Church suffereth no loss, but is a gainer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this meanes, many other faithful, zealous and honest-hearted Servants of God, are made (through the Lord's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful defeating of the Counsels of Satan) more bold &amp; forward, in owning &amp; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth: The devil thinks, by the sufferings of some eminent Servants, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and fainte many, as supposing that they will be affrighted from their duty; but the grace and power of God worketh-out the contrary event: As we see <hi>Phil.</hi> 1: 14. where another fruit of <hi>Paul's</hi> bonds and Imprisonment is added. <hi>And many of the Brethren in the Lord, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="5">5. There is hereby an encouraging e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xemple laid before others: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>is no small
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51835:134"/>
advantage unto particular Beleevers, in a time of Persecution, to know of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, of some that have gone thorow the foord before them: Therefore saith the Apostle <hi>Iames Chap. 5: 10. Take, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of Patience;</hi> so that such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are refreshing, and helpful unto their Constancy and Stedfastness; when they see others standing fast in the faith, in the midst of all persecutions, that they meet with, they are animated unto the like stedfastness, and to resolution, in adhering fixedly to the truth: such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will make even a timorous man wax bold; and the exemplary carriage of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is very encouraging and comfortable, wherefore the Apostle saith 2 <hi>Cor. 1: 6. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be afflicted, it is for your Consolation.</hi> Therefore these Sufferings are much for the advantage of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hereby is the Church awakened from security, and made to look out for a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lot; when thus it is done to the green tree, they are made to take Warning; Such a dispensation is as the sounding of the trumpet for an alarme; and this is no small advantage, when she is raised to her feet, and put in a postour, and made ready for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51835:135"/>
the battel; then she needeth not fear a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisal; but hath time to prepare, and make ready for the storme.</p>
               <p>In order to the Improvement of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, we would</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware to conclude that all is gone, when we hear or see Christs eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants put to sad sufferings: We are ready to wonder why the Lord should suffer such and such things to be done; why He should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such sad things to befall His eminent and useful Servants, who cannot well be missed, one whereof is worth an hundered, so that the Death or Imprisonment of one such threatneth more destruction to the Church, than the loss of many: But we know not the thoughts of the Lord; we know not what He is designing, and what He mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to effectuat thereby. And if we beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that even such a dispensation as this could do no harme to the Church; how little would we be troubled at it? If we saw, what an effectual way this were, in the steady, unerring Hand of God, to bring about the spiritual advantage of the Church, how would we lay our hands upon our mouth, and be silent? And though we can not see in particular, what advantage the Church is like to get, by the taking away of such, as were as Pillars of the Church:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51835:135"/>
Yet we should by faith rest assured, that the Head, and Husband of the Church, would not suffer such a Dispensation to come, if He knew not, how to bring good and advantage out of it; and that thereby good seed was sowen, which, though accompanied with teares and bloud, yet should yeeld full sheaves at length, which should be brought home with Joy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would do well to search our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, at such a time, to see if we, as particular members of the Church, be reaping any advantage by what we hear and see of the Sufferings of Christs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants; as for example, see if thereby the truth of the Gospel become more riveted in our souls, &amp; we becometh more rooted in the faith and assurance thereof, and more fixed in our Resolution to adhere thereunto; See if Truth becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lovely &amp; desireable to us upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; See if grace be growing more within, and if our hearts and affections be loosed more and more from the things of a world, and we be prepared more to quite all for Christ, and His Cause; See if by the example of others we be more animated, and encouraged to avow and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51835:136"/>
by the truth, cost what it will; See if these newes be raising us out of our bed, and making us prepare for the battel, and make ready for the approaching storme: &amp; if we finde any such advantage thereby, let us blesse Him, who is giving us meat out of the eater, and doing us good by the dear cost and charges of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This should comfort such, as are called forth to suffer for the Name of Jesus; they need not trouble themselves with thoughts, what shall become of the Church and Interest of Christ; but leave that upon the Lord; and beleeve, that He shall make it contribute to the furtherance of the Gospel, and to the enlairgment of His Kingdom; Ministers called to suffer may possibly think, Oh what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the poor people? we cannot get preached unto them, as formerly; but what if God make their stedfastness in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering more advantagious, than their preachings would have been? What if that edifie more, than many preachings did, or would do? Ought not they, upon this Consideration, rejoice in their Lot, and suffer cheerfully, that Christs Interest may prosper more thereby? What know they, what influence their Christian car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51835:136"/>
may have on all On-lookers, yea and on Enemies and Persecuters themselves, beside what confirmation friends may have thereby?</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION XVII. The Lord Reigneth in Zion.</head>
               <p>BEleevers are not like unto the Subjects of Kings, here on earth, who may be dethroned, and their Crowns may fall from their Heads, and the Scepters be taken out of their hands, and they may lose all the Ensignes of Royalty; and when it falleth out so (as is done many a time) Subjects have but cold Comfort, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Throne, when it hath forsaken him, that sat thereon. But Beleevers have a King, who liveth and reigneth for ever and ever, and whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom. It cannot then but be strange, that when Men, who have all their temporal happiness hanging upon the standing of Kings of Clay, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in adversity, when they have any
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51835:137"/>
hope of their King's recovering of his lost Throne and Kingdome, though the grounds of their Hop be most disputable and uncertaine; that the Children of God, in the day of their Adversity, can draw so little Comfort from the sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Grounds of Hope, which they have to look to. If Christs Crown and Throne were not surer, than the fading and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Regalia</hi> of Men, what would beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do? Whither could they go for conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in the day of their Distress and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish? But now, seing their King is not like the Kings of the Earth, why are they so heartless, in the day of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity? Sure, the Reason must be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they beleeve not, that He is such a King, as He is indeed; or they know not how to improve, to any spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, such a noble Ground of Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as this is. Wherefore it may be useful to speak a little unto this: And so we shall <hi>first</hi> lay down some <hi>Propositions,</hi> clearing up this Truth, and <hi>next</hi> some <hi>Conclusions,</hi> pointing out the improvement, that may be made thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As for the <hi>Propositions,</hi> take these following,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord standeth under the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51835:137"/>
of a King to His Church and People; He hath taken to himself that Name and Title: and accordingly we finde them eyeing this, in the day of their Distress; So <hi>David Psal. 5: vers.</hi> 2. and 84: <hi>v.</hi> 2. em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth Him, crying, <hi>My King and my God:</hi> and he comforteth himself with this <hi>Ps. 10. v. 16. The Lord is King for ever and ever.</hi> And the Church crieth out <hi>Psal. 74: v. 2. God is my King of old:</hi> and comforteth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with this <hi>Esai. 33: v. 22. The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, He will save us.</hi> So doth the Lord make a sweet promise of this, for the Comfort of His people, <hi>Hos. 13: v. 10. I will be thy King.</hi> Whereby we see, that there is such a relation betwixt God and His People, that will yeeld Comfort, in an evil day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is not a King that is far off; but is neer at hand, in the midst of His Kingdome and People: And this is also comfortable: Kingdomes may have a King, and yet be little the better of Him; he may be far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and unable to help them, in the day of their greatest necessity; But it is not so with Zions King, He is alwayes at hand, in the middest of His People: He is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished King in Zion. <hi>Psal. 2: v. 6. Yet</hi> I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51835:138"/>
                  <hi>have set my King</hi> (saith the Father of His Son, the Mediator) <hi>upon my holy hill Zion.</hi> His whole Kingdome is, as it were, his Throne, and there He sitteth, as King on his Throne; and He is placed and fixed there by a sure and unchangable Decree. That question of <hi>Ieremiah Chap. 8: v.</hi> 19. putteth the matter out of question, <hi>Is not the Lord in Zion? Is not her King in her?</hi> So <hi>Ps. 99: 2. The Lord is great in Zion.</hi> Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons King then is a great King, in the midst of her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Zions King is a King actually reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon His Throne, and exercising His Kingly Office; not like a King, imprisoned, or put out of a capacity of helping, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving his distressed Subjects; for He reigneth <hi>Psal. 93: v.</hi> 1. and 97: 1. and 99: <hi>v.</hi> 1. It is the bringing of good tidings, the publishing of Peace, the bringing of good tidings of good, the publishing of Salvation, to say unto Zion, <hi>Thy God reigneth Esai. 52: v.</hi> 7. Zions King is not a King outted and dethroned; but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reigning and sweying His Scepter, exerceing His Kingly Office and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Zions King is an everlasting King, He shall reigne for ever and ever: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51835:138"/>
be dethroned, He <hi>must reigne until all His Enemies be made His footstool 1 Cor. 15: v.</hi> 25. for He is settled on His throne by an everlasting and unchangable decree <hi>Ps. 2: v.</hi> 6, 7. And therefore He is called the <hi>King eternal 1 Tim.</hi> 1: 17. That is a sweet and comfortable Word of Promise <hi>Ps. 146: v. 10. The Lord shall reigne for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah 4: 7. And the Lord shall reigne over them, in mount Zion, from hence forth, even for ever. Psal. 10: v. 6. The Lord is King for ever and ever.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 45: 6. Thy Throne, Ã´ God, is for ever &amp; ever. Ier. 10: 10. The Lordâ€”is an everlasting King;</hi> and so His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is an everlasting Kingdom; for it is said <hi>Luk. 1: 33. He shall reigne over the House of Iacob for ever, and of His Kingdome there shall be no end.</hi> So <hi>Revel. 11: 15.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From these Comfortable <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> let us draw some comfortable <hi>Conclusions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church and People of God are not an headless, helpless Company, as many take them to be. They have an Head, and a living head, though Strangers and On-lookers do not observe it, nor beleeve it. The world, and the men of the world, look upon them, as a contemptible Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yet they have a King reigneing over them, and a King that shall reigne for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever. They themselves are oft times perplexed and distressed in minde, when they see not one great Person own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and their Interest, and offering himself to be an head unto them; but if they knew, what anone they had for their Head, Husband and King, they would not be much troubled, though not one great Person in all the earth should owne them and theirCause: So that when all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly Powers forsake them, and withdraw their helping hand, this may comfort them,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51835:142"/>
That there is a standing relation betwixt Christ and them, as is betwixt a King and his Subjects, and this relation neither is, nor can be broken off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let devils &amp; men do what they can, they shall not be able to destroy and root out the People of God. They may intend to destroy, &amp; to cut them off from being a Nation, that the name of Israel may be no more made mention of; and may make a strong combination for this end, as <hi>Psal. 84: vers</hi> 4. But this their Interprise is vaine, they will never be able to effectuate what they designe. Seing He is a King, that reigneth on his Throne, He must have a Kingdom and a People, whom He must governe, and over whom He must swey His scepter. So that whoever would resolve to destroy His Kingdom, must first think of making Him no King; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way His Kingdom, and take away His Scepter too; Himself must be dethroned, ere He have no Kingdome. Enemies then may attempt great things, and promise to themselves great success; but in end, they will prove themselves to be fooles; for He must reigne for ever and ever, and His Kingdom must be to all Generations. He shall reigne for ever, and of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51835:142"/>
there shall be no end. <hi>Luk. 1: vers</hi> 33. His people then may be at peace, though they know what great things their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies designe against them, and that their cruelty and rage is such, as nothing but their utter overthrow and destruction will satisfie; seing it is all one, as if they should presume to pull God from His throne. Let the Devil, and his trustee Livetenant, Antichrist, conspire, and use what Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and bloody Devices they will, to destroy the whole Interest of Christ; He must not want Subjects, He shall not want a Kingdom, so long as Sun and Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: Howbeit the people of God may be several times brought very low; yea and almost out of sight, as a Woman fled to the wilderness; yet this exalted King, who is set upon His throne, by an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Decree, must have a Kingdom, &amp; shall have a Kingdom, over which to swey His Scepter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea Christ's Kingdom must be a coming and a growing Kingdom <hi>Luk. 1: vers</hi> 32. He must be great, and have the throne of His Father David: Many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promises have we of this: <hi>Micah. 4: 1, 2, 3. But in the last daies, it shall come to passe, that the mountaine of the house of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51835:143"/>
Lord, shall be established on the tope of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hils, and people shall flow unto it, and many Nations shall comeâ€”and He shall judge among the people.</hi> So <hi>Esai. 2: 2, 3, 4. Rev. 11. vers 15. And the seventh Angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the Kingdomes of this world, are become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of His Christ; and He shall reigne for ever &amp; ever.</hi> We are taught to pray daily, <hi>Let thy Kingdom come.</hi> Our Lord shall be great to the ends of the earth <hi>Micah.</hi> 5: 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, Let Enemies do what they can, His Church shall not get much hurt: For so long as He is in the midst of her, she cannot be moved, though the earth be removed, and though the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar, and be troubled, though Mountains shake with the swellings thereof. <hi>Psal.</hi> 46: 5. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Mic.</hi> 4: 7. That the Lord shall rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne over them, in mount Zion; and what followeth? <hi>And thou, Ã´ Toure of the Flock (vers. 8.) the strong hold of the Daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the first Dominion, the Kingdome shall come to the Daughter of Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Though it frequently come to passe,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51835:143"/>
that God's people are brought low, and Enemies get the upper hand; yet Zion's King liveth; and therefore He will As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble her, that halteth, and will gather her, that is driven out, and her that have been afflicted; and make her that halteth a remnant, &amp; her that was cast off a strong Nation <hi>Mica.</hi> 4: 6, 7. Because He liveth, His members must live also. Seing the Churches Head is above the water, she cannot drown. Wherefore, upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground, that Zions King liveth and reigneth, His Church and People, even while low and under the feet of Enemies, may lift up their head in hop, and be sure that their day of redemption draweth neer; and they may conclude with the Church <hi>Esai. 33: 22. The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our King: He will save us.</hi> Seing He is King, He can <hi>command deliverance Psal.</hi> 44. 4. and <hi>work Salvation Psal.</hi> 74: 12. Upon this ground, <hi>David</hi> inferreth a Delivery and a Victory <hi>Psal. 10: v. 16. The Lord is King for ever and ever, the heathen are perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his land.</hi> Enemies will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to stand long in <hi>Immanuel's</hi> Land. It is His work, as King, to deliver and defend His Subjects; and they may be sure, He

will not deny Himself, He will answere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="6">6. When His people see, that all their Strength is gone, and that there is none shut up or left, they are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all is gone: But what, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not this King in Zion soon leavy an Army? How easie is it for Him, to speak to dry bones, and make them armed men <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. When mention was made of this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Israel, whose goings forth were from of old, and who should stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of the Name of the Lord His God <hi>Micah. 5: 4. It is added, This man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our Land, and when he shall trade in our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces; then shall we raise against him Seven shepherds and eight Principal men, and they shall waste the Land of Assyria with the sword, and the Land of Nimrod, in the entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Thus shall He deliver us, from the Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when he cometh into our Land, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within our borders. And the remnant of Iacob shall be among the Gentils, in the midst of many people, as a Lion among the beasts of the forest, as the young Lion among the Flocks of sheepâ€”Thine hand shall be lift up upon thine Adversaries, and all thine enemies shall

be cut off vers.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. When His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are brought very low, so that, in all probability, they shall not be able to raise up themselves; then this King can help the business, He can raise up an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble army, out of lame sick souldiers. He can <hi>make Ierusalem a cup of trembling, and a burdensome stone; for all people Zech.</hi> 12: 2, 3. He can make the <hi>Governours of Iudah like on hearth of fire among the wood, and like a toarch of fire in a sheaf, and they shall devoure all the people round about, on the right hand &amp; on the left ver.</hi> 5. He can make <hi>Him, that is feeble among them, like David, and the house of David, as God, as an Angel of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them v. 8. Out of Him cometh the corner, out of Him cometh the nail, out of him the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel bowâ€”and He can make them to be as mighty men, which tread down, as the mire of the street, in the battel; and</hi> He <hi>can streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the house of Iudah.

7. This Consideration speaketh dread and terrour unto Enemies; for He is a King, that is terrible to the Kings of the earth. He maketh the Earth, and the heavens to tremble, the hils melt and quake before him; &amp; what then can weak man do? What will they be, in the hands of the Almighty, who shaketh Nations? <hi>The Lord reigneth, Let the earth tremble, He sitteth between the Cherubims, Let the earth be moved Psal.</hi> 99: 1. At the wrath of this everlasting King, the earth shall tremble; and the Nations shall not be able to abide his Indignation <hi>Ier.</hi> 10: 10. Where then shall His Enemies stand, in the day of His Indignation? We are oft afraid of the terrour of Enemies, but saw we Him, who is our King, we would see, that our Enemies had more cause to be afraid of Him, who is clothed with Majestie: <hi>there goeth a smoak out of his nostrils, and fire out of His mouth devoureth and coals are kindled by it Psal. 18: vers.</hi> 8. Read what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When we are thinking on the Wit, Skil and Activity, of the Adversaries, let us call to mind, that our King is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly beyond them, He searcheth the heart and tryeth the reines; He knoweth

the thoughts afar off: He is privie to all the motions of Adversaries; He knoweth when they march, and when and where they halt <hi>Esai.</hi> 10: 28, 29.

The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of Wisdom &amp; Understanding, the Spirit of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord; and shall make him of quick understanding, in the fear of the Lord.</hi> Though the Adversaries should soon out-wit us; yet they will not be able to out-wit Him, who is our King; for the treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge are in Him: So that it is an easie business for Him, to countermine all their Plots and Machinations. He hath formed all their hearts, and so He knoweth what is in their hearts. Nothing can be hid from Him, His very eye-lids try the Children of Men <hi>Psal.</hi> 11: 4. Wherefore, when we are at a <hi>non-plus,</hi> and know not what to do, this may comfort us, and compose our Spirits, our King knoweth very well, how to carry on his own Contrivances, &amp; glorious Projects: So that when we are blinde, we are to look to Him, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what to do, when we know not what to do; and let Him alone with His own work.</p>

9. It is sad, when the Children of God are wronged, and cannot get faire Justice: wickedness is to be seen in the place of judgment, and iniquity in the place of righteousness <hi>Eccles. 3: v.</hi> 16. judgment is turned away backward, and Justice stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afar off, for truth is fallen in the streat, and equity cannot enter; yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey <hi>Esai. 59: v.</hi> 14, 15. But here is comfort against this, that Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons King reigneth, who is just, and a King that <hi>reigneth in righteousness. He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove after the hearing of his eares, but with righteousness shall He judge the poor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove with equity, for the meek of the earthâ€”and righteousness shall be the girdle of His loines, and faithfulness the girdle of His reines Esai.</hi> 11: 3, 4, 5. His people then need not fear, seing there is Justice to be had at His bar.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Children of God are much fainted and discouraged, when second meanes are out of sight, they see not hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor horsmen, to appear in the fields for them; but a right sight of this Truth would prove helpful and encouraging in this case: Did they but by faith see, that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51835:146"/>
Zions King were reigning on His Throne, and actually sweying His Scepter, they would easily conclude, that all would be well; for this King would either work without meanes (as sometime He doth) or creat meanes for His own use: A wight man (we say) never wanted weapons; and shall our King be straitned for want of meanes? Could <hi>Sampson,</hi> without either Sword or Spear, only with what came next to his hand, the Jaw-bone of an asse, slay so many? And need we fear, that our King shall want Instruments, when He mindeth to work by Instruments? Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency cannot want hands: Any of all the Creatures is sufficient in His hand; with vermine He made an end of proud <hi>Herod.</hi> If He but speak the word, He will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with command deliverance: So that we need not fear, though the fig tree should not blossome, and though we should see nothing but dry bones, and dry bones scattered about the graves mouth, so long as this King liveth and reigneth, unto whom belong the shields of the Earth, <hi>Ps. 47: v. last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The Lords reigning in Zion may assure us, that there are great and rich off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallings to be had. Courtiers fear not want,

so long as the King possesseth His Throne, yea they dar adventure to take on Luck's head (as we say) and why may not the Lords people also rejoice on Lucks head, seing their King shall never be dethroned?

How long, how long, will this Cup be holden to my head? When shall the day dawn, when God shall loose this Yoke from off my neck? <hi>The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest is past, and the Summer is ended, and we are not saved, Ier. 8: vers.</hi> 20. Will not this year put an end to our trouble? How long shall the rod of the wicked rest upon the lot of the righteous?
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51835:148"/>
How long will God lengthen-out this sad trial? These speaches, and the like, are but too frequent in their mouth; and their thoughts are too oft upon this Subject: and thus eternizing their sad lot, in their mindes, or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly imagining, it will not have an end, in hast, they multiply their own Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; whereas did they calculat by the Scripture-account, they would see the time shorter, than they now imagine it to be. Now to help them, as to his, We shall 1. Shew what is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture account of the time of Affliction. 2. Answere what can be objected to the contrary. 3. Show how this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may and should be improven to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> The Scriptures give us this account of the matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it will <hi>not be for ever 1 King. 11. v. 39. And</hi> I <hi>will for this afflict the Seed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, but not for ever.</hi> Though for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities He resolved to punish and afflict the Seed of <hi>David;</hi> yet it will not be for ever: And what is here spoken of <hi>David's</hi> Seed, will, in some respect, agree to the Church and People of God, in all ages. Ay, and there may be here a <hi>Meiosis,</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:51835:148"/>
a Figure, whereby much more is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the words signifie; and this <hi>not for ever,</hi> is as much as, <hi>for a short time.</hi> It must then be the language of unbeleef to say, that God will cast off for ever, and that He will be favourable no more; for His strokes upon the Godly are not of that nature: He may afflict for a time, but not for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture telleth us, that <hi>these dayes will be shortened, Matth. 20: 22. And except those dayes should be shortened, no flesh should be saved; but for the Elects sake, those dayes shall be shortened.</hi> Christ is speaking there of sore and sharp Tribulation, that was to come upon the Land; and for the comfort of the Elect, He saith, that those dayes of Affliction and Tribulation should not long continue, but should be shortened for their sake: And this will hold good, in all Ages, the Lord being as careful of His Elect now, as then, and His Elect being as ready to fainte, through long Affliction now, as formerly: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground of this promise continue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we must not say, that the promise it self is out of date: To say then, that Affliction shall never have an end, is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51835:149"/>
upon the matter, to annul this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We finde the Scripture saying, That Affliction, or <hi>the rod of the wicked, should not rest upon the Lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity, Psal. 125: v.</hi> 3. This promise containeth likewise, in the bosome of it, a ground of assurance, that it is not expired; for as long, as the righteous are in hazard of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth their hands unto iniquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the continuance of the trouble; we may eye this promise, that the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon their lot; &amp; this ground will alwayes endure; and so the promise, bearing this Ground and Reason in its bosome, will continue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in force. We must not then say, that Afflictions on the Godly shall never have an end, unless we would withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy this promise. Therefore we may conclude, that the People of the Lord shall not be the rest of the burden of the Word of the Lord; as it is said of <hi>Damascus Zech.</hi> 9: 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are also told in Scripture, That the Heaviness of Affliction is but <hi>for a Season, 1 Pet. 1: 6. wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a Season (if need be) ye are in heaviness,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51835:149"/>
through manifold temptations.</hi> The word rendered <hi>for a Season,</hi> in the original, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a <hi>little present now;</hi> to show that this Season is but short; a present now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any considerable duration. If this were beleeved, we could not be crying-out, as we are too ready to do, Oh, will those dayes never be at an end? we would see that the little inconsiderable present now, or point of time, would quickly be over. See <hi>Revel.</hi> 6: 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scripture tels us of a <hi>little while, Heb. 10: 37. for yet a little while, and He that shall come will come</hi> &amp;c. The expression is mostemphatick in the Original, &amp; cannot well be rendered to the full; as if he had said, <hi>yet a little, how little, how little?</hi> As if it could not be expressed, how little the time was to be. This little while, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time (as it is called <hi>Habb.</hi> 2: .3 will soon be over.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Scripture pointeth it out to be a <hi>very little while Esai. 10: 25. for yet a very little while, and the Indignation shall cease</hi> &amp;c. In the Original there are two words, both of them signifying a little time, or a very little time; and so it is as much as if he had said. a <hi>very little little time.</hi> Sure that time cannot be long, which is so short, that the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51835:150"/>
of it cannot be expressed. Is it not then strange, that when the Spirit of the Lord cannot (to speak so) get words to express the shortness of the duration of their trouble, they on the contrary cannot get words sufficiently to express their sense of the length of the time?</p>
               <p n="7">7. We finde it called by a definite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Ten dayes, Revel. 2: 10.â€”And ye shall have tribulation ten dayes;</hi> Whereby the shortness of the duration of that tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is expressed; not that the trouble was to continue just ten dayes; but to signifie that it was not to continue long, but a short inconsiderable time, which the Lord had determined and limited punctually to a day. Tribulation will not last alwayes, Ten dayes will put a period to it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If this be too long, we have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed as yet much shorter; even <hi>a night,</hi> which is no long time <hi>Psal. 30: 5.â€”Weeping may endure for a night,</hi> &amp;c. The dark disconsolat weeping time will not endure long, the few houres of a night will put an end to it: It is but a night, and a night, that hath the dawning of a day following it. We should be ashamed then, to think, or say, that our Trouble and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction will alwayes last; we never saw a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51835:150"/>
night yet, but it had a morning of a new day following it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If this should yet seem too long, we have it denominated from a shorter time, as an <hi>hour Revel.</hi> 3: 10. there is mention made of <hi>an hour of temptation, that was to come on all the earth.</hi> Our Lord; sure, would hereby confute our errour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strueing the time to be too long, when He doth of purpose mention such short measures of time. An hour will soon be at an end, the few minuts thereof will swiftly post away.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nay, if this should seem too long, we have it expressed by a shorter duration <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>a moment, Ps. 30: 5. for his anger endureth but a moment.</hi> And what can be shorter, than a moment? Is there any measure of time shorter, than a moment? And yet by this is the duration of the Anger of God against His Children, in afflicting of them, expressed. Why then should we account that an age, which the Lord call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but a moment? So <hi>Esai. 54: 8. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The word rendered <hi>moment</hi> signifieth cutting or dividing, and so importeth the shortest cutting or division of time. The Apostle speaketh thus of it also
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51835:151"/>
2 <hi>Cor. 4: 17. Our light Affliction, which is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>t for a moment.</hi> The Apostles expression is singular, there is a lightness of Affliction, and that lightness is but a momentany light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Now weightiness or lightness is not measured by time; yet the Apostle, in a most emphatick manner doth so here, to shew us, that all the weight of the Affliction (in comparison of the glory, that is coming) is meer lightness; or is so light, that it cannot be measured with the least of weights; and therefore he saith, it is but a momentany thing, like a feather falling on a mans hand and immediatly blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way againe. It can be nothing then, but shameless unbeleef, that saith the time is long.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nay, which is yet more; as if this duration were yet too long, it is expressed by <hi>a little moment Esai. 26: vers.</hi> 20. As if it were a little part of the least division of time, if there be any moment less then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is the right name of the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Troubles and Afflictions of His People. So <hi>Esai. 54 vers.</hi> 7. It is called a <hi>small moment.</hi> And can we imagine how it can be less? If the People of God had the measuring of the time of their trouble, in their own hand, could they give it any shorter duration, than this? Could they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51835:151"/>
imagine a shorter? When the Spirit of the Lord expresseth it thus, We should be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to think it too long.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected (and this is the <hi>Second</hi> thing I am to speak to) That the Lords ordinary dispensation with His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all ages seemeth to contradict this, for ordinarily, if not alwayes, we see, that the Afflictions of His People are of long continuance: did not Israel wander Fourty Yeers in the Wilderness? After they came into Canaan, did they not serve the King of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> Eight yeers <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3: 8. and the King of <hi>Moab</hi> Eighteen <hi>vers.</hi> 14. and the King of <hi>Canaan</hi> Twenty Yeers <hi>Iudg.</hi> 4: 3. &amp; the King of <hi>Midian</hi> Seven Yeers <hi>Iudg. 6: vers.</hi> 1? Were they not captives in <hi>Babylon</hi> Seventy Yeers? not to mention their being now Non-churched above sixteen hundreth Yeers? How then can this time be called and accounted so short?</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, we shall propose these few things following to Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The time of the Affliction of His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be accounted short, in regaird of the great and manifold effects, which God is to bring about by the same, a through Consideration of which would make us say, (if we judged according to our usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51835:152"/>
that the Afflictions must of necessity continue a long time, to the end those great and noble effects may be produced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Would we consider, how much Dross and Corruption in His own people remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be purged away, as Pride, Carnality, Inordinat Self-love, and Love of Pleasures, Riches, Honours, Ease &amp;c. Carnal-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, Passion, Self-conceite, Formality, Hypocrisie &amp;c. we would see a necessity for the Crosses lying-on for a long time, in order to the purging of these away; As also would we consider how much Hypocrisie, Hollow-heartedness there is to discover; how many false Friends to Christ and His Interest, there are to be made known, we could not but think, that of necessity, in order to the effectuating of this discovery, a long time of trouble and trials were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site. As likewise, if we called to minde, how many things His people are to learne thereby. Considering I say, those and such like noble Effects, which the great Master of Work is to effectuate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce by the Affliction; And how they would seem to call for the continuance of the same for a considerable time, And withall how notwithstanding the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the thoughts of many, and maketh a short work; and doth that in a few
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51835:152"/>
Moneths or Dayes, which we could have thought should have called for many Yeers. When then the Lord maketh such a quick dispatch of such a great Business, we may well say, that the time is short, and that many Years are but a very short time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The time of Afflictions may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted short, considering what our Sins and Provocations call for at His hand. When in righteousness the Lord might keep us under the rod all our dayes, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Afflictions upon us, to our very dying day, Ten or Twenty Years Captivity should seem a very short time, a few Years Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment would seem nothing to a man, who had been condemned to perpetual Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment: To another possibly, who got no such Sentence, a few Moneths Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment would seem longer, than many Years to him, because he expected no less, than perpetual Imprisonment. So, were we considering, that in regaird of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings, the time of Afflictions might justly be continued to the end of our dayes, a few Years or Moneths would appear to be no considerable time. Wherefore in respect of our deservings, a long time of Affliction is but a short time; because the longest is nothing to what we have deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:51835:153"/>
3. They may be accounted short, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the dayes of Prosperity, which they have had sometimes in the world The Lord doth not alwayes chide, He will not cast off for ever, but though he cause griefe, yet will He have compassion, according to the multitude of His tender Mercies <hi>Lam. 3: vers.</hi> 32. and so He sendeth Prosperity, which lasteth longer, than their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie did; as we see <hi>Iudg. 3: vers.</hi> 11. after Eight Years bondage, they had rest Fourtie Years: And <hi>vers.</hi> 30. after Eighteen Years trouble, they had rest Fourscore Years So <hi>Chap. 5: vers. last.</hi> after twenty Years bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they had rest Fourty Years. Thus the Lord sometimes sendeth such a length of Prosperity, that the dayes of Adversity are forgotten, as if they had been few and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The time of Affliction may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted short, considering how that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for as long as the delivery seemeth to be a coming, yet, when it cometh, His People are surprized therewith, their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation is prevented; they imagined, in their own apprehensions, a longer duration of the trouble, so that mercy preventeth them, when it cometh; and this maketh the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past time of their Affliction seem short. Though the People of God had been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51835:153"/>
time in bondage, and under the feet of Adversaries; yet it appeared unto them, but (as it were) as the time betwixt seed time and harvest <hi>Psal. 126: vers.</hi> 5, 6. after God had wonderfully delivered them out of Captivity and Bondage, they draw this Conclusion from this rare Act of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about them. <hi>They that sow in tears shall reap in Ioy, and he that goeth forth and weepeth having precious seed, shall doubtless come againe with rejoiceing, bringing His sheaves with him.</hi> Whereby is imported that Gods People, abiding by the Lord, though they should meet with Affliction, in their Duty, and be made to weep sore, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof; yet the time of delivery should come, like an Harvest with fruit, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing all their toile and tears: and so, they summed up all their Seventy Years into less than Seven Moneths. And how came it to passe, that the time seemed so short? That <hi>Psalm</hi> pointeth this forth, as one Reason hereof, <hi>Vers. 1: When the Lord turned againe the Captivity of Zion, we were like men that dream.</hi> They were surprized with the mercy, for they did not look for it; but thought their exiled Condition should have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed longer, because they saw no appearance or probability of a returne. So that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaird of what the People of God themselves
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51835:154"/>
may imagine, the time of the Affliction may be short.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may likewise be accounted short and inconsiderable, in regaird of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and extraordinary goodness of God, that appeareth in the delivery; when it cometh, it may be attended with such sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and notable Mercies, which so fill their souls with amazement and satisfaction, that the length of the time of their Affliction disappeareth and evanisheth; and, as if it had been nothing, it is presently forgotten. So in that forecited <hi>Psal. 126: vers.</hi> 2. The delivery is accounted signal and wonderfully remarkable, such as <hi>filled their mouth with laughter, and their tongue with singing.</hi> It was such a notable delivery, accompanied with so many rare Passages, and carrying in the bosome of it so many rare demonstrations of Gods Power, Tenderness, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Constancy and loving Kindness, that they could not but be filled with admiration thereat, and have their tongues loosed to sing his praises: Yea they took notice of this circumstance, which increased the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirablness of the delivery, that even Strangers and Heathens were made to say, that God had done great things or the poor Jewes; and they themselves, being no less convinced hereof, could not but subscribe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:51835:154"/>
to the truth thereof, and (as it were) take the word out of their mouth, and say <hi>v. 3. The Lord had done great things for us, whereof we are glade.</hi> Now this being so remarkable a delivery, the first sight and apprehension of it did so fill their soul with Joy and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that the long Seventy Years Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage seemed to them, but as the paines and labour of a few Moneths, in expectation of a good harvest, after the seed was sowen: as the long paines of a women travelling in Child-birth are forgotten, when she hath brought forth a Man-Child. In respect therefore of the delivery, so signal as to its Ingredients, Attendants and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the time of Affliction may appear as nothing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This time of Affliction may appear to be short, in respect of the Comfort and Support, which the Lord may bestow upon them in the Affliction: His Presence and Company may so sweeten the Lot, that the time may (as it were) steal away, and scarce be observed: what is a whole Years Affliction, when God is pleased to shine in love upon the soul dureing that time? Good Company will make the Journay seem short, and the way good, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes would be tedious. Now the Lord is pleased sometimes so to manifest Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51835:155"/>
as to fill His People with Joy, and this so sweetneth the trouble, and cutteth the time short, that many Years seem but a few dayes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The time may be accounted short, in respect of the rich recompence of reward, that is coming. If we should lay this in the ballance with an hundred Years Bondage and Affliction, what would all these Years of trouble seem to be, but as the trouble of a moment, when it is past? Therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> taketh a view of the exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, which was coming, all the Afflictions in this earth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as nothing in his eyes; the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glory &amp; incomprehensible Excellency of the one, eateth away the duration of the other to a thing of nothing 2 <hi>Cor. 4: ver.</hi> 17. It is with the Beleever, in this case, as it was with <hi>Iaeob,</hi> when he was serving for <hi>Rachel,</hi> Seven Years enduring of the cold frost by night, and the heat by day, seemed unto him but as a few dayes, <hi>For the love he had to her Gen. 29: vers.</hi> 20. The thoughts of the rich and upmaking reward, that faithful Sufferers have to look-for, will cause a long time of sad Affliction seem short.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The time of Affliction is so short, that it is as nothing, in comparison of Eternity:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51835:155"/>
the exceeding and eternal weight of Glory will make the Afflictions light &amp; momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. What is the whole of time unto Eternity? Is there any comparison betwixt what is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, &amp; what is Infinite? Seing then the whole of time is not as a moment of time to all eternity; what can the longest duration of Affliction be, but as an inconsiderable part of that inconsiderable whole? VVhat do those, who are up before the Throne, think of the many Years of their Trouble and Persecution here below? Are they, think we, calculating it by Years or by Dayes, or by Houres? Oh no, all of it is, with them, comprized within the Circle of a small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable point.</p>
               <p>These and the like particulars being duely pondered and considered, it will appear, how the longest time of Affliction, that we can have here, is but short &amp; inconsiderable: And it is our not weighing and laying of these things to heart, which maketh our trouble seem so long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> VVe come now to speak of the Christian and Edifying Improvement of this Consideration: which is by fixing it in our heart, as a sure truth, that the time of Affliction is indeed but short. And had we the faith hereof rooted in our souls, we would be in case to carry Christianly under
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51835:156"/>
Afflictions: For the faith hereof would produce several sweet and useful Effects, in our hearts, seasonable and profitable for such a time: Such as these following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fixed apprehension of this, that the time of trouble is but short, would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Soul of a Beleever against the false suggestions of the Devil, which he maketh much use of at that time, to disquiet their hearts, and make their lives bitter. He will laboure to perswade them, that God looketh on them as Enemies, otherwise He would not continue their heavy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so long; and thus tempt them to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion their Interest in God. But the faith of this truth would enable the Beleever to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere this Objection, and to repel this Temptation, by saying, <hi>His anger is but for a moment,</hi> His face will not alwayes be hid; this blast will go over; and therefore I have no cause to call my Interest in question, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fixed faith of this would keep the Beleever from questioning the promises, upon the account, that the Lords Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did seem to threaten a long lasting trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a sad life of Affliction for a long time. Temptation, it is true, will then say, God hath forgotten to be gracious, He will be favourable no more, His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51835:156"/>
faileth for ever. But the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving this Conclusion, will say, what a poor insignificant ground is that for me, whereupon to call the faithfulness of God in question? If the trouble were lengthened out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>et longer, all the time is but short, it will soon have an end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The faith of this will contribute much to hold up <hi>Hop's</hi> Head. When the afflicted Person, through the Power of Temptation, is made to cry-out, O! This Trouble will never have an end, this perplexity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise is but growing; and what shall I do? Then hope beginneth to fail, and when hop faileth, the soul sincketh: But now, when this Consideration is seriously thought upon, and the soul is made to say, all the time of Affliction, which his Children meet with here, is but short, it will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes last, it is but for a moment, yea and for a very short moment; then hop is made to lift up its head; for the man will be ashamed to quite his hop, and despond, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the storme will quickly be over, and be but like a may-shoure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Faith of this will help unto the exercise of <hi>Patience:</hi> when we look upon the trouble, as that which will not end, or must be of long continuance, our courage departeth, our spirits fail, and we storme and

grow Impatient. But when we by faith look thorow the thick and black side of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, and see the end of the calamity nigh at hand, the moment posting away, how sweetly will we lay our necks under the yoke, and set our faces against the storme, and hold on our Journay? How patiently will we bear the Indignation of the Lord, when we know, that it will be over within a moment? We will be ashamed to quarrel, or complaine, when we know, that a period shall quickly be put thereunto. The Apostle told the <hi>Hebrewes Heb.</hi> 10: 36. that they <hi>had need of patience:</hi> And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them unto Patience, he tels them, that within a little while, yea a very little while. He that should come, would come, and would not tarry <hi>vers.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The faith of this will help unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> and <hi>Stedfastness.</hi> When we once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and apprehend, that our trouble shall be of long endurance, we grow weak, and unable to stand out against temptations; and are ready to say, because this storme will not soon blow over, it is best to row to a lee shore, and comply with the sinful courses of the time: Whereas did we see and beleeve, that the storme would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long, but be quickly gone, we would be encouraged to ride it out, and enabled
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51835:157"/>
to withstand temptations unto a sideing with the workers of Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would help also unto Christian <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> under the Crosse; when we know that it will be but a blast, soon over and gone, our Countenance will not fall, nor our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage fail: but when we represent the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ourselves, as of long continuance, and we beginne to doubt if ever it shall have an end, then we become discouraged, and our countenances are cast down, and we appear no more couragious and cheerful: How do our hearts faint, and our hands fail us? The Consideration of the short and momentany Affliction keeped-up <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, and made him say, <hi>For this cause we fainte not 2 Cor.</hi> 4: 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The faith of this would free us from many feares, that ordinarily attend such a Condition; we are, while under Affliction, saying, what if this or that fall out? But the faith of this would hush these troublesome feares and questions to the door. The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation being but to continue ten dayes, we would fear none of these things <hi>Revelat. 2: v.</hi> 10.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION. XIX. Remember <hi>Peter's</hi> fall <hi>Mat. 26. vers</hi> 33, 34, 35.</head>
               <p>IN a time of trials and temptations, as it is of advantage to be calling to minde, and presenting to ourselves the Christian, and commendable Carriage of such, as have been helped of the Lord, to witness a good Confession for Him, and for His Cause and Interest, before men; to the end we may thereby be encouraged to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and to adventure on the Promises with them, and not to fear the faces of men, in Christ's Cause; so it may be of use for us also, to present before our eyes, and to take notice of the faintings of others, in the day of Trial, that thereby we may learn, to walk in fear, and not to trust to ourselves, or to any thing within us; and to watch, lest we enter into temptation, when we are not in case to wrestle against it.</p>
               <p>We have here before us a sad and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming Instance <hi>viz.</hi> the foule fall of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent man, in the houre of Temptation,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51835:158"/>
which may be Improven to advantage.</p>
               <p>After Christ and His Disciples had been supping together, at that Instituted Feast, He tels them some sad and wakening newes <hi>vers.</hi> 31, 32. to Teach us (1.) That we are never more ready to grow secure, and to think that our mountain stands so strong, that it shall never be moved, than when we have had greatest Enjoyments of and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from the Lord, and nighest Access unto him. (2.) That there is never less cause of security, than at that time; for the higher we have come in our attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Devil is the nigher with his storme. (3) That we should never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; but even, when we win neerest God, we should resolve upon and prepare for new assaults, and temptations. But withal it is remarkable, that the Lord delayed the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the sad things, that were to fall out, until the feast was ended, and they had sung a hymne; knowing that they would then be best in case to bear the sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and not loving to marre their mirth, at that feast of Love.</p>
               <p>Though Christ had told them, that they should all be offended because of Him, that night; yet <hi>Peter,</hi> out of a piece of manly courage (as would appear) promising too much upon his own head, would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51835:159"/>
but would rather make his Master a false Prophet, than suspect his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Therefore Christ tels him, that he should be more offended, than any of the rest; and that he should deny Him thrice, ere the next morning came <hi>vers.</hi> 34 But all this would not lay the high conceite, that <hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi> had of himself; for he resolved rather to die, than do that; and this he avowed openly, little knowing this own strength.</p>
               <p>In this carriage, and in these Answers of <hi>Peter,</hi> there are some things good, and some things bad; and the noticeing of both may be of use to us. As for such things, as are good here, and may yeeld us some Instruction, we shall mention these three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It was good, that <hi>Peter</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, &amp; did acknowledge, that it was his duty, and the duty of all Christ's Disciples, to avow their Master, and not to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Him, whatever came. And this is an undeniable truth, That upon all hazards, Christ should be owned and avowed by all, that would not have Him to be ashamed of them one day? And yet how little is this beleeved &amp; beleevingly practised?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It was good, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and that he confessed, that it was his duty, though all the rest should have
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51835:159"/>
left alone, yet notwithstanding to owne and avow his Master, and not deny him: For Christ and His truth and cause is worthy to be owned and avowed, how small so ever our encouragment from others be: And as we should not follow a multitude to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; so neither will the defection of many justifie our defection, and lessen our fault, if we depart from the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was good, that he saw, and acknowledged, that he was obliged to owne his Master, and stand at his back, be the hazard never so great; and that the very fear of death, should not cause him deny his Master. <hi>Thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi> (saith he) <hi>I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi> And indeed all, that would be faithful Disciples to Christ, must not think their life dear to the death for Him; but must be dead to life and all that is dear to them.</p>
               <p>But that which we would chiefly here take notice of is, that which was amisse in him; and which will ground some sad Truths for our use; As</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He had too great a conceite of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and thought too much of what he had, &amp; of what he was Hence <hi>obs.</hi> That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are too ready to be puft up with thoughts of themselves; and are in hazard
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51835:160"/>
to be carryed away with this evil of self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, and vaine thoughts of their owne worth and excellency. And this ariseth from these evils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unmortified Corruption, This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes working against God, one way or other; and is as ready to work this way, as any other way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Little self searching, and self exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereby we become strangers to the evil of our hearts, and know not what enemies are lurking there, and what wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness aboundeth; and when we know not what is within, it is little wonder we be readily puft up with swelling thoughts of vanity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Little real acquaintance with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, deceitfulness and double dealing of our false hearts: If we saw that, and saw its activity for evil, we would see more cause of humiliation, than of pride and self conceite.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Little mindeing &amp; considering aright the failings and falls of others, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be as fast at the root, as we: If we thought upon this, we might have cause to feare, that we should also not be able to ride out a storme.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Trusting too much unto our own
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51835:160"/>
present good disposition and frame, as if this would alwayes continue with us, and we needed to feare no change.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Trusting too much to our Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Purposes and earnest Engagments, considering little the treachery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of the heart, nor remembering our own Changeableness and Unconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that our good fits may be soon off us.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Little considering how we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Lord &amp; His Influencing grace, for through-bearing in all our duties; and how we can do nothing without Him, and His supplies of grace and strength.</p>
               <p>This should be a warning to us to guaird a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this evil of pride and self conceite: and to study more humility of minde; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better what we are, and where our strength lyeth, that we may promise less u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our own head, and undertake noth ing in our own strength. And it should teach us to mourne over this body of death, and to guaird against its riseings &amp; motions, and to strive against it, in all its appearances and actings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The foretold defection and fainting of all the rest of the Disciples mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not him the more afrayed; but for all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51835:161"/>
that he keepeth fast his high and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of himself. Which tels us, that there is such an evil among good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as not to suspect themselves, and fear their fall, notwithstanding of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and foreseen fals and failings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this floweth from the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil root of pride, and self confidence. We remember not that the same evil heart of Unbeliefe, Unconstancy, Treachery and Backsliding, that is in others, remaineth in us.</p>
               <p>Whence we should learne to bewar of this evil, and to know our hearts better, and suspect the evil of them more. Let us not <hi>think of ourselves more highly than we ought Rom</hi> 12: 3 but <hi>Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall 1 Cor.</hi> 10: 12. And let the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others put us to watchfulness &amp; fear, lest we fall after the same example of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. <hi>Heb</hi> 4: 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He would not fear, though Christ told him, and that with a doubled asseveration, <hi>verily, Verily</hi> that himself in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as well as the rest, should deny him. Whence we see, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>ard it is to lie open to Convictions of our own weakness, &amp; readiness to decline in an evil day. And this floweth from the same evils of Pride,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51835:161"/>
Self-confidence, &amp; Ignorance of our hearts and wayes.</p>
               <p>This should teach us to observe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the strength and activity of this piece of Corruption, which yet remaineth in the best: And to hate and strive against this evil and proud humore: As also to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of ourselves, and to lye open to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions from the Word, and be ready to take warnings, and to tremble before the Lord, and at his Word.</p>
               <p>Beside these things that were good, and that were bad in <hi>Peter.</hi> We may consider this Prediction of Christ's, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment that <hi>Peter</hi> gave it, whereof we have heard, with the event, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances here recorded, and thence finde some matter of Instruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, we may <hi>observe.</hi> That a Person may be convinced of his duty to stand by Christ and his Cause and Interest, in a day of trial, and yet deny Him, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the point of tryal. <hi>Peter's</hi> Conviction of his duty to owne Christ, come what could come, did not keep him from a foule fall, in the hour of temptation: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is manifest, for (1.) Convictions may evanish, or lose their force &amp; edge: Light may grow dark, truths become question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51835:162"/>
or (2.) suppose Convictions should remaine in their force; yet it is only fresh supplies of Influences of grace, &amp; strength, that will cause the man stand, without which he may be carried over the belly of Light, Conscience and all Convinctions, in a day of temptation.</p>
               <p>Hence we see Light and Convictions are not enough to keep us sted fast, in a day of tryal; we must look-out for something more, and not lean to that which will not carry us thorow, more than it did <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Person may be throughly convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he should stand by Christ and his Cause and Interest, though the defection were never so great, yea though he should be left in that quarrel alone; and yet deny Christ and his Truth, in a day of tryal: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was convinced, that he should not deny Christ, though all others should do it; and yet fell foully. And the grounds of this are the same, with the grounds of the former truth: Deep Convictions are one gift, and stability in a day of tryal is a distinct gift. Light is one thing, but grace to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that light, is another thing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the deeper our Convictions be, we ought the rather to feare the more,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51835:162"/>
and depend the more by faith on Christ for actual Assistance, Influence and Grace to follow Convictions, and abide by Duty, in the day of tryal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Clear, Plaine, Peremptour and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Warnings, will not be enough to keep us sted fast in an evil day: <hi>Peter</hi> had such here, and yet he fell in the day of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And the reason is because (1.) These warnings may weare away, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, And (2.) Pride and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may so puff up, that all these shall not once pick upon the man: And so he may forget himself, and take little notice of them</p>
               <p>The consideration of which should teach us to be Jealous of our heart, to keep hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and feare alwayes; and to improve warnings, to a stirring of ourselves up to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Watchfulness, Acting of faith upon Christ, and Living nigh to Him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A present good frame and disposition, or a fit of warmness and affection to Christ, will not be enough to secure us from a fall, in the day of tryal. As we see here in <hi>Peter;</hi> He seemed to be in a very good frame, at present, and full of affection, when he would rather die than deny his Master; &amp; yet when the temptation came, he yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed The reasons are (1.) Such frames and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51835:163"/>
fits do not usually stay, nor leave any deep impression on the heart. (2.) Grace actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, &amp; blown upon one way, will not be sufficient to make grace lively another way, or for other work; but the habite must have new Influences for every new work: For (3.) without Christ we can do nothing: All our strength is in Him; in Him we must move, as well as live; and He must work in us both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.</p>
               <p>This should learne us, not to think much of any present fit of tenderness, or flash of affection; for that may soon wear off; nor think that that will be sufficient to carry us thorow new straits and difficulties. It were better to be learning &amp; practiseing the way of faith, and of dependance upon Christ, that we may be strong in Him, and in the power of His might <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6: 10. That we may live in Him, and bring forth fruit in Him. Diffidence of our selves, and of any thing we have, even when we are at the best, would be more suitable and useful for us, than building too much upon such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and slippery grounds: And the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of our own Unconstancy, and Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility should make us live closer to Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Strong Purposes and Resolutions to stand fast, in a day of tryal, will not keep
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51835:163"/>
us from reeling and staggering in a stormy day: <hi>Peter</hi> had brave Purposes and stout Resolutions; yet he fell notwithstanding, in the hour of temptation. And the reason is because: (1.) These Purposes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions are oft ill founded with us; we ground them too oft upon something with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ourselves, on our Partes and Abilities, our Light and Knowledge, and upon our Grace and Receivings from God, or upon former thorow-bearings, and the like; which may prove but a sandy foundation. (2.) The heart is deceitful above all things, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly wicked; and so may faile us, in a day of strait and difficulty. (3) These purposes may soon be forgotten and laid by.</p>
               <p>Which should learne us, not to deceive ourselves with those specious and promise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flourishes of Purposes and Resolutions, even when they are real, and without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachings of our heart; for these are not strong enough to carry us thorow a sad storme, that may come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Person may resolve on death, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing Christ, and yet not stand out against a smaller temptation: <hi>Peter</hi> resolved to die, rather than deny his Master, and yet the word of a Damsel made him deny Christ. And that because (1.) Presupposed hazard
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51835:164"/>
is not so terrible to nature, as what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, a small trouble present is more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to nature, than a greater trouble afar off, (2.) We oft make our Resolutions without Christ, and resolve not in Him, but in ourselves. (3.) Oftentimes these Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions are not deliberat, but done in a fit of a good mood and warm frame; and when that is off, the Resolutions animated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wax cold and faint.</p>
               <p>The Consideration of which should make us feare alwayes, and not to trust the highest and strongest of Resolutions. Happy such as abide in Christ, and depend upon Him, for their daily Food, Strength, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Activity; and undertake nothing without Him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All these fast and firm-like Purposes, Vowes and Resolutions will be so far from keeping a person from a fall, in a day of temptation, that they will not, some time, keep him even for a few houres. So was it here with <hi>Peter;</hi> for that very night he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Master. And that because (1.) A Christian, when left to himself is not able to stand-out a storme, even a very little time. (2.) Their adversary the Devil is active, subtile, and vigilant. (3.) After Vowes and fast Purposes they become se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, as thinking their hazard less, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51835:164"/>
trusting to their owne strength; and so the Devil gets most advantage, when they are gone from their watch-towr, and are fallen asleep in their security. (4.) The Lord may see it good to suffer this, to punish them for their Pride and Self-Confidence, and to let all see, that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>This may let us see, What an Unconstant Creature a beleever is, when he is left to himself, and how inconsistent he is with himself. And should teach us to fear most, and be most upon our guard, when we think ourselves best and saifest. And to know, that our Strength and standing is in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When Persons think themselves most sure, they may be nearest to a fearful fall: <hi>Peter</hi> thought now his mountaine stood so strong, that he should never be moved, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. And all the warnings he gote did not make him once fear a fall: And yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap> know, what a fearful fall follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this. And the reason is, because (1.) They oft judge by sense and carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and so think because they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in a good mood at present, that all is well, and they need to fear nothing. (2.) They grow then most secure, and self confident, and therefore neglect their
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51835:165"/>
watchful, and circumspect walking, and are not in the fear of the Lord all the day long. (3.) Satan observing this watcheth his time, and finding them secure setteth on, &amp; cannot but prevaile. (4.) Self-confidence blindeth the eyes, that they see not their owne weakness, and where Satan may have advantage against them. (5.) The only Wise God ordereth it thus, to let us see, that all Flesh is grasse.</p>
               <p>Therefore we should never resolve to quite our Watch-towr, but alwayes minde watchfulness and circumspection, and guard against Security. Let us fear most, when we think we are saifest, and beware of promising saifty and immunity to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in whatsoever condition or frame we be into. Let him that standeth take heed, lest he fall.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such as have an higher conceite of themselves, than of others, may come to fall fouler than any. <hi>Peter</hi> thought more of himself, than of all the rest; and that he should stand by his Master, though all the rest should shamefully turn their back upon Him; and yet none among them all did, as he did. And the Lord wisely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth matters thus, that (1) All Flesh may lye low in the dust, be humble, tremble
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51835:165"/>
and feare. (2.) That the best may be jealous of themselves, and fear a fall. (3.) That He may chastise the pride of some, who thought there were none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to them.</p>
               <p>Which is a warning to all, to have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and low thoughts of themselves, and to beware of proud imaginations and loftie thoughts.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A Person may have true Grace, and yet sinfully and shamfully shun suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Christ. As we see in <hi>Peter,</hi> who had the root of the matter in him: For to beleeve is one gift, and to suffer is another distinct gift, and they go not alwayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. See <hi>Phil. 1: v.</hi> 29. of which we spoke above.</p>
               <p>To teach us to depend upon Him for the one, as well as for the other; and not to think, that if we have grace, we need no more to carrie us honestly thorow a day of temptation. We would remember, that it must be given us in that very houre, to suffer stedfastly, and to stand to the truth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A Child of God may fall into this grievous sin of denying his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in all His Interests, in His Person, Offices, Attributes and Works. This
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51835:166"/>
was no small sin, in which <hi>Peter</hi> fell, at this time: It had a long tail of direful and sad Consequences. There is no sin, which Beleevers are exempted from, but the unpardonable sin unto death, final impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, and final and total Apostasie. And Satan, in all his temptations, driveth at this, to have them denying, quiting and renouncing Christ.</p>
               <p>Which should teach us (1.) To have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to some, that fall in a day of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; seing some, in whom is the root of the matter, may, being left of the Lord, fall very foulely. (2.) To be humble and watchful all our dayes, not knowing what may befal us ere we die: We may ride thorow one, or two, or moe stormes, and yet fall shamfully, ere we go off the stage. (3) To remember what a strong and violent Body of Death we have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; lest we turn secure and careless. (4.) To be thankful to God, if we be keeped stedfast at any time; for that is not of ourselves; the Grace and Power of God have done it. Therefore let God have the Glory, and not we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When once a Beleever, in a day of temptation, beginneth to fall, and loseth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51835:166"/>
a foot, he may fall very foulely, ere he recover himself. <hi>Peter</hi> lost his foot, and spoke an untruth at first, simply denying his Master; but it came to fearful Oaths, Cursings and Execrations, ere all was done. For (1.) The way down-ward is very easie (2.) Satan is at hand, to drive forward; and who can stand, when the Devil driveth down ward? (3.) Conscience being once wounded will be easily made worse: If once a little hole be made in the Conscience, it is easily made wider; for tenderness and watchfulness go away.</p>
               <p>Which should serve as a loud warning, to beware of the very beginning of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to guard against the very first breaking-in of waters, It is not saife to say, such a length I will go, and so far I will yeeld, to save a staik, and to keep my peace; but I will go no further. It were more wisdom, to hold further off the brinke and precipice, lest, if our foot slip, we recover not ourselves so easily againe: And we know not, what a providential Commission the Lord may give Satan, to drive us, by his temptations, forward to that, which we never dreamed of, because of our rash and sinful ventureing, and bold
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51835:167"/>
hazarding upon sin and known dangers. It is Wisdom to resist the beginnings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; then are we strongest, and best able to withstand; whileas, the more we cede and yeeld, the weaker we become, and the weaker we are, we are the more easily driven downward, and carried away of the winde of temptation.</p>

               <p>We finde in Scripture frequent mention made of God's hiding himself, 1. His Saints are oft complaining of it <hi>Iob.</hi> 13:

               <p>But this is not the hiding, whereof the Prophet in this place <hi>Esai.</hi> 45: 15. is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For the <hi>hiding</hi> here mentioned is of a far other nature, giving us properly to understand, That the Lord hath an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, Unusual, Hid, Mysterious, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, Excellent, transcendently and incomprehensibly Glorious way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on His Work, of bringing about His holy Purposes, and of making good His
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51835:168"/>
faithful Promises: The circumstances of the Text do fully make out this to be the true and genuine meaning of the words; for the whole contexture of what preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and of what followeth, is a masse of gracious Promises of great things, which the Lord was about to do, in the behalfe of His Church and interest; and the very particular Instrument, King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by whom the Lord would begin the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Estate of his Church, is designed; and his prosperous success, in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, against what stood in his way, foretold; Objections, that might arise in his peoples mindes removed; and they shamed from their Unbeleeving, Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, proud and arrogant Contending humore: Together with remarkable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, and concomitants of this great change of the Church to the better, in their Neighbours, <hi>Aegyptians, Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>eans;</hi> as also ruine and destruction foretold, to come upon all the Enemies. Now in the midst of these thoughts, the holy Prophet breaketh out into a rapture of Admiration, having in these words, an holy Ejaculation and <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with the thoughts of these great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible-like and wonderful matters, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51835:169"/>
the rare and wonderful manner of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this Change &amp; Outgate, which humane understanding could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: For as one transported with joy &amp; wondering, he cryeth out, in the midest of these Prophecies. <hi>Verily thou art a God, that hidest thy self O God of Israel, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Wherein we may take notice of these foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The frame of the Prophet, and the holy disposition of his soul, held forth by this abrupt Ejaculation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter or occasion of this Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Transport, which is twofold; for (1.) He seeth <hi>God hiding himself;</hi> and (2.) in that dark and unseen way, he saw him, the <hi>God of Israel, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Manner of Expressing this his admiration, with a <hi>Verily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. His venting himself thus in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of God. <hi>Verily, thou art a God &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> the frame of soul, which was in the Prophet, at this time, we may take notice of these Particulars, which may withal point-out our duty, in a sad day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We see the Prophet fixed in the faith and perswasion of the truth of what the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51835:169"/>
Lord was here promiseing, concerning his Church and People: He was confident and fully perswaded, that the deliverance of the people of God out of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, in which they were to be, full Seventy yeers, would come; though at this present, while he is getting this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and manifestation, there was no appearance of their being brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, &amp; led away captive out of their own land by the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> far less of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery out of that Captivity; the people being now dwelling in their owne Land, &amp; living in peace and quiet, far from any molestation from the <hi>Caldeans:</hi> His faith and perswasion of the truth of what the Lord said to Him, and by Him, was the ground of this his Admiration and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment: For what we do not beleeve to be true, how rare and uncouth so ever it be, it will not ravish us, nor cause in us a rapture of Admiration.</p>
               <p>Hence we see all the sayings of God, how improbable and unlikely so ever they may be, should be embraced with fulness of faith; we should with <hi>Abraham Rom. 4: 18. Against hope beleeve in hope;</hi> He did not <hi>consider his own body now dead, nor the deadness of Sarahs womb, nor did he stagger at
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:51835:170"/>
the promise of God, through unbeleef; but was strong in the faith, giving glory to God, and was fully perswaded, that what God had promised, he was able also to performe vers.</hi> 19, 20, 21. So no more should we take any notice of the humane improbability, and of the many unlikelyhoods, and of such things, as might, to humane reason, walking upon humane grounds, make the thing promised seem altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not impossible: But, having the firme Word of God, who cannot lie, nor change, there to rest, as anchored up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that immovable Rock, and ride-out all stormes of carnal Reasonings, and corrupt Suggestions and Temptations of Satan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We see in the Prophet, that all the consideration, that he might have had, at this time, of the Improbabilities, small Appearances, Difficulties, yea and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibilities to humane judgment, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as mountaines in the way of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of God's Faithfulness &amp; Truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing With Salvation to his people, did but contribute to his more firme and fixed gripping of, and cleaving to, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Predictions; and raise in his soul an holy Ravishment and Rapture of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51835:170"/>
wondering, at this rare and wonderful Work of God, which he saw by faith. And this should teach us to take notice of the Difficulties, and Improbabilities, that seem to us to lye in the way of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the great Promises, for no other end than this, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fixed in the faith thereby, and be raised up to see more of the Glorious Power, Truth, Goodness and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, and helped to get a fuller look of God, as Incomprehensible in all His wayes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may observe here, in the frame of the Prophet, That he discovered in God something Rare, Admirable, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Glorious, that ravished him, and transported his soul: He saw a Divine, Holy Mysterie, in God's way: When the way of the Lord was, to humane eyes, Unclear, Dark and Cloudy, he saw the Glory of God shining forth, with greater brightness and splendour. He saw the Lord, while covered, as to his way of working, with a thick cloud, by the eye of faith; he pierced the clouds, and saw the Invisible. <hi>Thou art a God:</hi> Nay he, saw, that such a way, whatever the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low &amp; dim-sighted Reason of Man might
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:51835:171"/>
apprehend, concerning it, was God's way; and had the manifest lineaments of God engraven upon it: he saw that that hid way was God-like; and these thick clouds, that to humane reason would dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the beauty and lustre of God's Glory, did the more set off to him, the Divine Glory and Majesty of God. O what an excellent frame is this; and how useful and necessary for his people, in a day of clouds and darkness? And what a sharp eagles-eye must faith have, that can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Glory in obscurity; and see a rare and singular sight of God, even when He is hiding himself; and can observe a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Glory, and splendour of Excellency, in the clouds and darkness, that are about His throne. How great must the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be betwixt that sight of God, which a Natural eye, measuring things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of Carnal Reason, can get of the most refulgent and self-manifesting Operations of God; and that discovery of God, which faith getteth, in those dispensations of God, which have no Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Majesty in them, unto a Carnal eye? How averse and unwilling should the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this make us, to judge of God and of his Wayes and Doings, by Carnal
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51835:171"/>
Reason? And how blinde a judge must that be of Gods Wayes and Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may here take notice, in the Prophets frame, That he discovereth, in the wayes of God, about which now his thoughts are occupied, an unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Depth, a Mystery, and Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibleness: For he is like a man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the sea, and findeth it the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the deeper, and at length is like to drown, and there standeth, and cryeth out, this ocean hath no bottom; I shall lose my selfe if I go further: He hath been, as it were, wading in his contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mystery of God's wayes with and about his Church and People; and as one loseing ground, he cryeth out <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thou art a God, that hidest thy self:</hi> Thy wayes are Incomprehensible, Unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Unsearchable. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> in a case not unlike <hi>Rom. 11: 33.â€”how unsearchable are his judgments, and his wayes past finding out? David</hi> hath an expression not unlike, in his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of God <hi>Psal. 145: 3. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is observable in the Prophets
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51835:172"/>
frame, That as he discovereth in the wayes of God, which were now the matter of his Spiritual Meditation, a singular &amp; rare Beauty, and Divine Excellency, a transcendent Glory; so he saw this, while all these wayes of God were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with clouds, and darkness. Even when He was hiding himself, and clouds and darkness were round about Him, he saw, that Righteousness and Judgment were the habitation of his throne; as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 97: 2. Faith can see God in the dark, and discover a God hiding himself: Faith can go-in thorow clouds and coverings and dark dispensations, and see the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God acting in Majesty, and carrying on His work in Faithfulness and Truth, according to His everlasting Purposes, and Faithful Promises. This should be our study, in the day of God's hiding of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to His visible dispensations, and oÃ¹tward work, in the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may here also mark, in the holy Prophets frame, a sutable Submission of spirit, &amp; holy Acquiescence of soul, in this singular and rare way of the Lords bringing-about His Intended Designes; There is no footstep here of the holy mans Murmuring, Repining, Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51835:172"/>
or Quarrelling, at this dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen way of the Lord's ordering His mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but on the contrary we may observe, the Prophet stouping, &amp; putting his mouth in the dust, sweetly acquescing in, and submitting to the way, howbeit dark, unusual, and compassed with dark clouds, that infinite wisdom thinketh good to take and follow, in carrying on His Purposes, and Designes of love and mercy, to His people. <hi>Verily thou art a God, that hidest thy self</hi> &amp;c. I see that now, would he say, that I did not observe before; and I am satisfied: I have nothing to say against it; I close with it, and am fully content it be so. Such a frame would suite us well, let the Lord take what way He will, &amp; follow what method He thinketh good: How uncouth and dark so ever it seemeth to us; yet so far should we be from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, or from a quarrelling discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness of minde; that we should hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, cheerfully, and with full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of soul comply therewith, in heart, mind and affection.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is observable also in the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets frame, that notwithstanding of all these interveening clouds of Improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; Unlikelihoods, and dark Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51835:173"/>
that would seem to cover and hide the comfortable relation, that God standeth in unto his Church and People; as their Covenanted God and Saviour; yet against hope, as to humane appearances, and carnal reasoning, he beleeveth in hope; and holdeth this fast, that be His dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations what they will, and be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and visible appearances of His own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of and appearing for His people, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so small and inconsiderable; yet He was, &amp; would be, <hi>the God of Israel, and the Saviour.</hi> Howbeit the reasonings of flesh and bloud would say, God hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be gracious, and his Promises fail, and he will be favourable no more, as <hi>Psal. 77: v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. Yet he saw, that His way was in the Sanctuary, and in the sea, and His path in the great waters; and that though His footsteps could not be seen, yet He was leading his people like a flock. <hi>v.</hi> 13: 19, 20. Such actings of faith, in a dark day, would be of great use, &amp; would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to our Establishment; &amp; keep us from staggering, in the day of temptation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We may take notice here, in this manner of expression, of the burning of the holy mans Affections towards God; These thoughts of the Lord's Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51835:173"/>
whereby He appeared a God like himself, did not alienate his heart from God, nor drive him further from Him; but on the contrary, they did warm his Affections more, and draw him nigher unto God; for he is uttering these his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of God, and of His way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto God himself, saying, <hi>Verily, thou art a God &amp;c.</hi> It is good when our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of God, &amp; of His wayes, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, strange, &amp; unusual so ever they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or seem to be, work thus upon us, &amp; are accompanied with a powerful attractive vertue, drawing &amp; powerfully inclineing the heart &amp; soul, to approach nigher unto God: And when the Lord is rightly seen, in any of his wayes, how dark soever, this will follow upon it; the heart will be more engadged unto God, &amp; the soul will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove these meditations, to a noble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and have thereby many sweet occasions of heavenly Ejaculations, and of Postings of soul toward God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is considerable also in the Prophets carriage, while he thus uttereth the whole matter of his thoughts, even in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and poureth forth his soul into the very bosome of God, that he was real, and single hearted, in all this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51835:174"/>
it was not a meer rational discur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Contemplation, but a real exercise of soul; his heart was really &amp; in very deed affected with the mater, <hi>Verily</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou art a God that hidest thy self &amp;.</hi> His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of the thoughts of his heart unto God, saith, that he was not formal, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, or for a fashion exercised in this case; but was really exercised therewith at the heart; his soul was in the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he looked upon it, as momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and weighty, and as a matter of high concernment. A Formal, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, Indifferent, and Cursory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the works and wayes of the Lord, should be hateful to us; and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness, Sincerity and Reality should appear in all our wayes, and especially while musing &amp; meditating upon the rare Passages of God's Providence: Our heart and soul should be in every thought, for the subject is grave and weighty, and of great concernment.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is obvious enough, that the Prophet here is in a transport of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: he getteth so broad a sight of this Majestick and God-like way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on His work, that he is astonished thereat, and ravished with wondering;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51835:174"/>
and therefore breaketh out, in this holy <hi>Apostrophe</hi> and Ejaculation, <hi>verily, thou art a God, that hidest thy self &amp;c.</hi> Never do we get a right look of God, and of his wayes but when the sight thereof raiseth in us an high admiration and wondering; for it is no common and ordinary thing, that is to be seen in them, when they are seen in the right colours: Our not wondering declareth our sight here to be but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and superficial. It was no ordinary thing in the eyes of the Jewes, when they saw the man leaping and standing &amp; walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who had been lame from his Mothers womb <hi>Act.</hi> 3: 8, 9. and therefore <hi>they were filled with wonder &amp; amazement v.</hi> 10. When <hi>David</hi> was musing upon the Lords alseeing knowledge, he cryeth out <hi>Psal. 139: v. 6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> Let us consider the matter and occasion of this Transport of the holy Prophet: what is the thing, which he seeth; and what are his thoughts busied about, causing this Ejaculation? <hi>First.</hi> He seeth God hideing Himself, <hi>Next</hi> He seeth Him hiding Himself, even while He is the God of Israel and the Saviour; or he seeth Him abiding the God Israel, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51835:175"/>
Saviour, even while His way is hid, and He will not be seen.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first</hi> of these, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Lord's hiding himself, that is, bringing about the promised deliverance, and salvation to his people, in a way not discernable &amp; obvious to the eyes and observation of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> every one; in a way removed from the sight of ordinary beholders; and as to them hid, dark, under ground, and out of the reach of their perception; in which is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, Majestick, Kingly and Stately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedour to be seen by Spiritual eyes; and only by such, as can see God, while co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with clouds, and thick darkness. And this saith, That howbeit in all the wayes and works of the Lord, there is a singular, rare and divine piece of State Majesty and Glory to be seen by Spiritual observers; yet there is sometimes, in the Lords bringing about the deliverance and outgate of his People, so much hid My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriousness, and Majestick Impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that saith to a gracious observer, that the Lord is hiding Himself, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on his Purposes, and perfecting his Work, according to such grounds and rules of Divine Policy, that every one cannot penetrate thereinto, nor discover
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51835:175"/>
his Footstpes, nor see distinctly the hand of God, at work. As sometimes wise and great Politicians, Statsmen, and Leaders of Armies carry on their designes, in such a way, as ordinary onlookers shall not understand what the matter meaneth, nor what is intended, by what they see done with their eyes; And the more they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their work with success in the dark, and hid from the observation of ordinary spectators, the more do they discover their great wit, and give proof of their dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in the managment of affairs of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est consequence; and such under-ground workings, and stratagems, carry on them a special piece of Beauty and Glory. Thus our Lord thinketh good sometimes to work, and while working, not let every one see, what he is doing; but carry on his business, much out of sight, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, and by Holy and Majestick Stratagems; so as not only enemies shall be ignorant of what He is doing, or about to do; but many even of his owne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and friends shall be in the dark. So that the observation of <hi>Iob. Chap.</hi> 23: 8, 9. is oft times found to be true, <hi>Behold I go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is not there; and backward but I cannot perceive him, on the left hand, where
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51835:176"/>
he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot perceive him.</hi> As also of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 77: vers. 19. Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the great waters; and thy footsteps are not known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As all the wayes, and footsteps of the Lord, are full of Majesty, and of hid and unseen Glory; and therefore must be sought out of all that take pleasure therein <hi>Psal. III: vers.</hi> 2. so that in all of them, the Lord is like Himself, &amp; acteth like Himself; and every piece of them discover to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual observer the Finger of God. So there are some special pieces of work, which are more signal, and remarkable, and wherein the Lords gloriously-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand is less obvious; and even these works, upon that very account, are in a special manner Glorious and Majestick; and of such is the truth in hand to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, wherein the Lords footsteps are not seen, nor known, nor observable by every one: for further clearing of which point of truth, concerning the Lord's thinking good to work; and yet to hide Himself, so as it shall not be observed by every one, that He is indeed working; we shall mentione some few of these speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:51835:176"/>
Works of God, that are thus covered with a cloud of Majesty, that every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand the Reasons of State, why such and such things are done, or suffered to be done; nor see the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these Actings, and the intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. When there is not only a seen and palpable disproportion, betwixt the meanes taken and followed, and the end projected or intended; and an obvious unsutableness of the meanes used unto the designe to be carried on by them: But the Work of the Lord seemeth to On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookers to Crosse and Counter-work the intended end. How oft is it seen, that the Works of Gods Providence seem not to run in a subserviency to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually about of the Promises; but rather to turn head upon them, and to threaten the utter annulling of them, and rendering of them void, and of no credite? When the present Dispensations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are considered, and compared with the great things concerning the Kingdom of Christ promised; who can see what rational correspondence they keep, &amp; can observe them smiling one upon another, as fit meanes and the end would do? Nay,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51835:177"/>
who would not say, that these Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do rather drive on a direct designe to defeate the Promises, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with humane Reason? Is not this then a special piece of the Lord's Work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He hideth himself, and thinketh good to cloath himself with State and Majesty, that every one may not be able to prye into the Depths of his Insinite Wisdom; nor see how all things are laid, and joynted together, with firme bands and ligaments, that cannot be broken or dissolved; and so have a certaine connexion, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and promised good? When <hi>Moses</hi> was sent to deliver the People of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to tell them good newes, that the Lord had visited them, and looked upon their Affliction, and would now res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue and deliver them from their bondage and slavery <hi>Exod. 4: v.</hi> 30, 31. the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that immediatly followed upon the neck of that, seemed to keep no good correspondence therewith, when their yoke was made heavier, and their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage more grievous, and their slavery and hard work doubled, by the People of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> their being constrained to seek straw for themselves, without diminishing the tale of their bricks; and they hereupon,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51835:177"/>
who formerly believed the Word of God by <hi>Moses,</hi> and bowed down and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they heard the same, now made to say unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron Exod. 5: v. 21. The Lord look upon you and judge, because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his Servants, to put a Sword in their hand to slay us.</hi> Yet herein was a piece of that Stately Working of God, which is full of Majesty, which the People could not see; and which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> himself could not well take up, as his words to God <hi>Vers.</hi> 22, 23. evidence, where he saith<hi>â€”Lord! Wherefore hast thou so evil intreated this People? Why is it that thou hast sent me? For since I came to Pharaoh, to speak in thy Name, he hath done evil to this People; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Dispensations of God are such, as even those, whom they most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, &amp; who have greatest interest in them, and are most called therefore to understand them, do not know what to say of them; nor what construction to put upon them; nor what to gather out of them, not only in particular, but even as to a more general matter; <hi>that is,</hi> they shall not know, whether they speak-out Mercy, or Anger in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51835:178"/>
God towards them. This must be a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular piece of God's hiding himself, and covering himself with a cloud, that no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct judgment can be made of what He is doing: Such was that Dispensation, which <hi>Sampsons</hi> Father met with: He and his Wife could not agree in their judgment, as to what they saw <hi>Iudg. 13. Manaoh</hi> said <hi>Vers. 22. We shall surly die, because we have seen God.</hi> But his Wife, on the contrary, said <hi>Vers. 23. If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a Burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Meat-offering, at our hands; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have shewed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told ut such things, as these.</hi> So as to that strange and unusual Dispensation, which holy <hi>Iob</hi> did meet with, he did not know, what the mind of the Lord was, nor what he was intending and driving-at thereby: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he resolveth <hi>Chap. 10: Vers.</hi> 2. to say unto God<hi>â€”Shew me wherefore thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest with me;</hi> which sheweth, that he was utterly ignorant hereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Lord surprizeth His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a Mercy and a Deliverance, and cometh upon them with an unexpected Out-gate; whether (1.) As to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Frame and Fitness for the mercy and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51835:178"/>
delivery; Or (2.) As to their Present Hopes and Expectation. When <hi>First,</hi> I say, the Lord cometh with a sweet and merciful delivery unto a People, that seem to be in no present capacity for it, as being out of all good Frame or Fitness, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving such a mercy with advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause lying in their sin and impenitency; When the Lord cometh with Salvation unto such a people, sure, his way must be covered with darkness, and hid from the eyes of Beholders, with a clothing of Soveraignity; for who could think, that deliverance were upon its march towards such a people, who are not seeking it, nor turning from their sinful wayes, that the Lord may have mercy upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his usual Method and Order? Such steps of Soveraignity are hid steps of Majesty, and full of Glory; and therein the Lord is hiding Himself, and His way, coming with Salvation in an unusual path: As when he saith <hi>Esai. 57: 17, 18. For the iniquity of his Covetousness,</hi> I <hi>was wroth, and smote him,</hi> I <hi>hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart,</hi> I <hi>have seen his wayes, and will heal him:</hi> I <hi>will lead him also, and restore Comforts unto him, and to his mourners. Next,</hi> When
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51835:179"/>
the Lord surprizeth a people with a mercy, that they are not in Expectation of, nor Waiting for, then he acteth, like a stately King, and His Way is Glorious and hid; as it was, when the Captivity was brought back from <hi>Babylon,</hi> concerning which they say <hi>Psal. 126: vers. 2. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them, that dream.</hi> It is true, they had good ground to be now looking for their delivery, because of the Prophecy of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> foretelling that after Seventy Years, they should return back to their owne land; and <hi>Daniel</hi> understood so much, and thereupon, when the time was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching, set himself to pray <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. But as to the generality, they were, in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, little looking for this outgate; but rather fearing more trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by <hi>Babylons</hi> warrs with the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Persians,</hi> who were coming against them; though the name of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of what was foretold by <hi>Esai. Ch.</hi> 44. and 45. might have caused them lift up their heads in hope. But notwithstanding of all this, we see, they were, (at least as to the generality and bulk of the people) little looking for an outgate, at this time; &amp; therefore at the first report of freedom,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51835:179"/>
granted to them to returne, they were like men that dream; scarce beleeving their owne eyes and eares: At which time, while they were in this dreaming posture, how were they surprized with this mercy? And how was the way of the Lord, in His stately Marchings, hid from their eyes? In reference to this same Dispensation of deliverance to his People by <hi>Crus,</hi> is the Prophet here crying out thus; <hi>Verily thou art a God, that hidest thy self;</hi> as the former part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> from the beginning, cleareth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When Dispensations, upon the one hand, and the other, say, that in humane probability, there is no appearance, or ground of hope of an outgate, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; yet delivery cometh, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected way; how hid must the way of the Lord then be? Thus He loveth to hide Himself, in His advancing with Salvation, when there is no appearance to humane Consideration, whether mens eye be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemies, or upon the People of God themselves: As to Enemies they may (1.) Be Strong, Mighty, and Invincible, the Consideration of which might alone be sufficient to dash all hopes; as who could have thought, that the People of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:51835:180"/>
Israel, being so under the feet of that mighty Monarch <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> could get out of his Territories, and be freed of his mighty Yoke? (2.) They may not only be strong, but prevalent, and prospering in their evil way, all things succeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their mind, the Lord, as it were, shining upon their Counsels, and granting to them their hearts desire, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in none of their wicked inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, and designes; but even suffering them to devise mischiefe upon their bed, and to put it the next day in execution. Was it not so with <hi>Saul,</hi> in his wicked persecution of <hi>David,</hi> oftentimes? Had he him not sometimes in a net, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed him about, on all hands, that there was no apparent escaping? and yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance came. (3.) They may be also Crafty and Politick, and lay their traines so sure, that they may think they cannot misgive; and have all things prepared to their minde, that in a moment, they may blow up His People, that there should not so much, as a memorial of them be left; and yet be disappointed. The Lord, in an unseen way, may bring about His Peoples deliverance; so was it with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Mordecay,</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:51835:180"/>
when <hi>Haman</hi> had gote a Commission sealed by the Kings ring, and a Decree passed, that might not be ranversed, or recalled, the day appointed, and designed, and that by a lot, as having something like a divine approbation, Orders dispatched to put all in execution; and thus the mine was ready for the springing; what hop could the poor <hi>Iewes</hi> then have of a delivery? And yet, behold, the <hi>Lord was then a God, that hid himself:</hi> He was counter-working this myne, and laying a back traine, that might cause it spring back upon the Authors; and so it did, as the Storie cleareth. When the Enemies thought themselves sure of their designes, and thought it impossible, that their purposes could fail; behold, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Saviour, was hiding himself, and laying an unseen ambush, that cutt them off, who thought to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the <hi>Iewes.</hi> So upon the other hand, this God will bring about deliverance to his People: When upon their part, there is not one toaken for good, not one thing apparent, that can be a probable ground of hope: As (1.) When their strength is gone, and there are none shut up or left; not a man, that might be an hopful Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the fore; all their valiant Men,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51835:181"/>
and Men of Courage, and such, of whom any thing could be expected, destroyed and taken away; Yet He, who is a God that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himself, can come in an unseen way, and loveth to come so; according to that gracious Word <hi>Deut. 32 vers. 36. For the Lord shall judge his People, and repent Himself for His Servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left.</hi> Was it not thus also, in the dayes of <hi>Deborah,</hi> when there was not a spear or sheild seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Fourty Thousand in Israel? <hi>Iudg. 5: vers</hi> 8. (2.) When their heart and courage is gone, they are desponding and despar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and looking on their own case as hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and helpless; as it is said of the People of <hi>Iudah,</hi> while in <hi>Babylon,</hi> who said <hi>Ezek. 37<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> v. 11.â€”Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> Then, even then<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> when People can see no hope, He, who hideth himself, can say, <hi>Prophesie upon these Bones, and cause breath enter into them, and bring flesh upon them, and cover them with skin, and put breath in them,</hi> that they may live <hi>Vers.</hi> 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. and make them a strong Army. This is among his hid Acts, whereof he hath a rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the meanes, which He putteth His peoples upon, in order to their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51835:181"/>
and outgate, are such as promise little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>or nothing, being considered abstractly; and in themselves, being very unlikely, in humane probability, to effectuate the end designed, then and therein the Lord is a God, that hideth himself: as when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Iosua</hi> and the People to compasse <hi>Iericho,</hi> and to blow with Rams Horns, who could have thought, that that should have proven an adapted mean, for bringing to the ground the strong Wals of the City? And when <hi>Esther</hi> was imployed to effectuate the ranversing of the decree, given out to destroy all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who could think, that thereby <hi>Haman</hi> should have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and all the Enemies of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> Who would have thought, that the stirpling, <hi>David,</hi> should have killed the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> &amp; thereby brought about the defeate of the mighty Army of the <hi>Philistines?</hi> Thus often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord maketh use of most unlikely and improbable meanes, that the excellency of the Power, and the Glory, may be His: And He cometh thus in a dark cloud, with Salvation, without observation, that His hand may more eminently appear and be observed, and His Salvation be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When some very hopful beginning of a good Work of Reformation meeteth with
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51835:182"/>
an unexpected stop, and impediment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard it; this is one of the wayes, wherein the Lord chooseth, to hide Himself and His work; then is His way covered with a cloud, and His footsteps cannot be seen. Thus it was, when contrary Orders came to stop the building of the Temple, after the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples return from captivity; as we read in the Book of <hi>Ezra;</hi> whereby that necessary work, so much desired, prayed for, hoped for, and with such earnestness begun, was for a considerable time retarded. Thus was it also, when <hi>David</hi> was about the bringing up of the Ark, out of <hi>Kirjath Iearim</hi> to set it in its place, in the midst of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, that was pitched for it; and had for this end assembled the Body of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and all the chosen Men of <hi>Israel,</hi> Thirtie Thousand; and was now rejoiceing before the Lord, playing before Him, on all manner of Instruments; then, even then, is there an unexpected stop put to the work; for when they were advanced to <hi>Nachons</hi> threshing floor, <hi>Vzzah,</hi> one of the Sones of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> put forth, in his simplicity, his hand to the Ark of God, and took hold of it, for the Oxen shook it; and upon this, the Anger of the Lord was kindled against <hi>Vzzah,</hi> and God smote him there, for his errour, and there he died by the Ark of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51835:182"/>
God 2 <hi>Sam. 6: vers.</hi> 5, 6. And upon this, the work is stayed; for <hi>David</hi> was afrayed of the Lord, that day; and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Ark unto him, unto the City of <hi>David;</hi> but carried it aside unto the House of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> the <hi>Gittite,</hi> where it stayed full three Moneths, <hi>Vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. See 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When even the Godly are left of God, to take such courses, as do provoke God to anger, prove stumbling blocks to the Godly, and a strengthening of the wicked, in their evil wayes; and to bring wrath upon the Land; then doth the Lord hide Himself, and hath His way in the Sea; for who can consider this Dispensation<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonied? Are the Reasons hereof obvious to all? Is there not something singular, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and rare, in this Dispensation? Thus was it, when the Lord left <hi>Gideon</hi> to make that <hi>Ephod,</hi> which proved a snare to him and to his House, and an occasion of sin to the Land; for it is said<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <hi>All Israel went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a whoreing after it Iudg. 8: vers.</hi> 27. And this was, when the Lord had wrought a great deliverance by him, and had subdued <hi>Midian;</hi> so that they lifted up their heads, no more. Thus also was it, when the Lord left <hi>Aaron</hi> to make that Calfe, in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, that brought so much Sin and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51835:183"/>
Wrath upon the People, as we see <hi>Exod.</hi> 32, and 33. <hi>Deut. 9: vers.</hi> 8,â€”21. Thus was it also, when the Lord suffered <hi>David</hi> to number the People, &amp; moved him, as it is said 2 <hi>Sam. 24: vers.</hi> 1. or suffered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to stand up to provoke him thereunto, as it is said 1 <hi>Chron. 21: vers,</hi> 1. A deed that cost <hi>Israel</hi> dear; for therefore the Lord sent a Pestilence, that destroyed, in three dayes, Seventy Thousand Men 1 <hi>Chron. 21: v. 14. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Sam.</hi> 24. 15.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So we may conceive the Lord to be a God that hideth himself, when we see wicked enemies imployed, and actively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirring themselves, in carrying forward the Lords Work: It is true, when these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are most active, in carrying on their wicked Designes, and malicious Purposes; the Lord, who overruleth all, as the great Master of Work, turneth their desperat wickedness to good, and in his Holy Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and by his Irresistible Power, maketh that contribute to His ends; and to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-on of his Holy Designes; for He hath a wheel in the midst of all their wheels: and in this, the Lords way is indeed in the deep waters, so that Enemies cannot perceive this; and his own People are oft in the mist; and through unbeleefe, and faithless fear, have oftentimes unsutable thoughts of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51835:183"/>
God, and of His Way. But the thing that we are now speaking of, is a passage of the Lords Providence, that is more rare and observable; when, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Lord will force and necessitate Enemies to do that, which is a manifest and plaine setting forward of His work, contrare to their owne wills and inclinations; as when the <hi>Philistines</hi> were constrained to send home the Ark to <hi>Israel</hi> againe 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6: This was a Majestick piece of Providence: And that, which made the way of the Lord more hid here, was this, that the Lord would rather bring home the Ark thus, than employ the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselves, and send them forth to recover the Ark by a glorious Victory over the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines.</hi> We would readily think, that He should rather have done this; but He is a God that hideth himself; and chooseth what way He thinketh meet.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Lord manifesteth himself to be a God that hideth himself, in His workings; when in His holy Providence He delayeth, procrastinateth, and suffereth His intended and promised work to meet with retarding hinderances and impediments: we would think, that when the Lord did so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and with such an outstretched arme bring the People of Israel out of the furnace of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to the end he might make good
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:51835:184"/>
His promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and put his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to His faithful word, in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of that promised land; he should incontinent, after He had brought them thorow the red sea, and brought them to the very border of <hi>Canaan,</hi> have entered them into <hi>Canaan:</hi> Yet we see, He caused them to wander in a waste houling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Fourtie Years. Againe, when He brought them over Jordan, we would think He should in all haste, with great expedition have destroyed the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that in a short time <hi>Israel</hi> might have had peacable posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the whole Land: Yet we see, the Lord thought good to do other wayes. And how many a time, doth He think good to exercise the Patience and Faith of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and for this end delay the carrying on and perfecting of the work He intendeth? And this He doth, not for want of strength to go over all Opposition; nor for want of Wisdom, as if he were put to new Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to a stand, in carrying-on his old Purposes: But that he may give proof of His Majestick Soveraignity; and shew how Stately and Glorious He is in His Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, performing all, according to the Counsel of His own will; cutting short His Work, when we might think, it could not be finished, in haste; and againe drawing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:51835:184"/>
it forth to a longer period of time, when we would think, that all things cry for His hastning of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Lord hideth Himself, in His workings, when He suffereth Enemies at once to destroy and overthrow a work, that hath been long in building, and hath been carried-on with much trouble, toile, work and care, by prayers, fastings, and blood. We understand not, what that meaneth, which the Lord saith by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> unto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch Ier. 45: 4.â€”Behold, that which I have built, will I break down; and that which</hi> I <hi>have planted, I will pluck up, even this whole land.</hi> But this is a piece of His working, who loveth sometimes to be a God that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself. It is a sad complaint, which the Church hath <hi>Psal. 74: vers. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Thine Enemies roar in the midst of thy Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they set up their ensignes for signes. A man was famous, according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees: But now they break down the carved work thereof at once, with axes and hammers. They have cast fire into thy san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.â€”They said in their hearts, let us destroy them together. They have burnt up all the Synagogues of God in the Land.</hi> Thus was there more destroyed in one Year, than was built-up in many. Is not our Lord, in such a case, a God, that hideth Himself? Who
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51835:185"/>
can see thorow such a Dispensation, as this?</p>
               <p n="11">11. There is a time also, in which we may say, the Lord is a God, that hideth himself; and that is, when his Dispensations are so mixed and composed, to speak so, of mercy and judgment, that People shall not know, which to regaird most; or what to judge of the complex Business. As it was when the Ark came to the <hi>Bethshemites,</hi> there was great joy, and offering of brunt Offerings, and Sacrificeing of Sacrifices, 1 <hi>Sam. 6: vers.</hi> 13, 15. But behold, ere the day was ended, their mourning was as great as their joy; for the Lord slew Fifty Thousand and Threescore and Ten Men, because they had looked into the Ark of the Lord <hi>v.</hi> 19 Whereupon the people lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the Lord had smitten them, with a great slaughter; and they said <hi>vers. 20. Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God; and to whom shall he go up from us?</hi> A wonderful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, wherein the Lord shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a God, that hideth Himself.</p>
               <p n="12">12. We may adde to these another case, in which, the Lord may be looked upon, as one that hideth himself; and that is, when He is unwilling to make use of holy and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Instruments, of whom much might be expected, and who would willingly spend themselves, and be spent in the service of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51835:185"/>
Lord. As the Lord thinketh good to make use of Instruments, in his work; so it is an hopeful business, when the Lord raiseth up, fitteth and animateth Instruments, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of his work; and the Lord is then appearing in His power, on the head of His work: But when He saith, by His dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that He will not make use of hopful, and steadable Instruments, for beginning or carrying on of His work, then He is, as it were, hid, and his footsteps cannot be seen. Whether (1.) He expresly declareth, that he will not make use of such or such a worthy Instrument, that would gladly be Imployed in the work; as when <hi>David</hi> did so earnestly desire to be imployed in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods House; yet the Lord said, he should not build Him an House: He would not have that service from him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. but would employ one out of his loines for that end; and <hi>David</hi> must be content to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare money and materials for the work. Or (2.) When the Lord taketh away Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, before their work be ended; as He did <hi>Moses,</hi> who would faine have passed over <hi>Iordan,</hi> to have seen that good Land, and have perfected his work of leading the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereinto Or (3.) When He suffereth worthy and eminent Instruments to be snatcht away basely and unworthily; as we
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51835:186"/>
see in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> a man that had not a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that day upon the face of the earth; the only forerunner of Christ; greater then any Prophet, that was before him; and a man that had done much good; yet see how unworthily he is taken away; he is cast in prison, and at the desire of a light dancing damesel, prompted thereto by a base and unworthy harlot; and taken away in a most unworthy manner, murthered in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and his head given as a propine and satisfying gift to that girle. What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful dispensation was this, that the Lord should suffer them to do to this non-such and eminent man, even what they would, and listed? But in these and the like work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord, He is a God that hideth himself.</p>
               <p>We have thus declared how the Lord is a God, that hideth himself, even when He is about to do good to, and to deliver his People; and have, for further clearing and explaining of the mater, given some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of cases, wherein the Lord may be said to be a God hiding himself. If we should now enquire, Why and for what Reasons doth the Lord choose to work so, and bring about deliverance to His people, in such an hid and unobservable manner? It should satisfie us for an <hi>answere.</hi> That thus
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:51835:186"/>
it pleaseth Him to do, for his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends, which we may not too curiously prye into: Yet seing all that God doth, is done in great wisdom, both for matter, and method; and for holy ends, which His word mentioneth; we may so far, with soberness and humility, enquire into these; to the end, we may be able to observe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the wise &amp; holy workings of God, and so be in better case, with knowledge &amp; understanding, to carry ourselves as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, with a sutable frame and disposition. To the <hi>Question</hi> then, Why the Lord think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to follow this way? We <hi>answer,</hi> He doth it for great and weighty reasons, partly (1.) concerning Himself; partly (2.) concerning Enemies: and partly (3.) concerning His own People.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> the reasons concerning Himself, we may take notice of these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord thinketh good, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout His purposes of delivering His people, in an hid, unseen, and unobservable way, that He may shew forth the glory of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity,</hi> who chooseth Wayes and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, as He pleaseth; and doth, as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, so after what manner he will, in heaven and in earth; and is not obliged to follow ordinary methods, or to walk in beaten and troden paths; but to do what
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:51835:187"/>
beseemeth a great King and a Royal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, who giveth not an account of any of his matters; whose will is a law to us, and a rule (to speak so) to himself. Hence, in this same Chapter <hi>Esai.</hi> 45. is this so oft repeated, <hi>I am the Lord, and none else. vers.</hi> 5, 6, 18, 21. Hereby laying down the ground of His so acting; and quieting his peoples mindes, and stilling their thoughts, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord thinketh good to trade in such an unseen way, that spiritual e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>es may the more see, that <hi>it is He,</hi> even He, who is God, and there is none else; that it is He, <hi>who formeth the light and crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>eth darkness, who maketh peace and createth evil;</hi> and is <hi>the Lord, who doth all these things vers.</hi> 7. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in should it appear, that He were Jehovah, if, in all things, he should work accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thoughts and imaginations of men? Is not this a manifest proof of His being God, when his wayes and Actings transcend our Comprehensions? Though in all his wayes and workings, He is God, and worketh and doth like himself, even in such as are most ordinary and obvious; and a Spiritual eye can discerne and espve some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truely divine, &amp; the marks of a divine hand; there yet when His way is in the deep waters, and his foot-steps cannot be seen, He
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:51835:187"/>
acteth in a manner more like Himself, like one, who is indeed God, and whose wayes are beyond and above the reach of Men, the wisest, and holiest of Men; and then may all have ground to say, This is the fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, as the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> said, when the Lord did somethings, which they with all their inchantments could not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Exod.</hi> 8: 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord chooseth this way, to give some signal proof of His <hi>Wisdom;</hi> if Stats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should mannage and carry-on their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, alwayes in such an open and plaine manner, that every plaine and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man, that knoweth nothing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of state, should be able to discerne their motions, designes and all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, they would not give great proof of their State wisdom and Policy. And if a Commander and Leader of an army should so manage all his affairs, in that conduct, that the meanest souldier should be able to discover and understand all his designes, and stratagems; he should give but a sory proof of his singular dexterity in conduct. But when the Statsman, and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chiefe so carry on their projects, that few or none can well understand what their Designe and Intention is, then a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given of their Ability, Wisdom and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:51835:188"/>
Accomplishment, for such places of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and trust. So when the Lord hideth His holy Purposes and Projects, and acteth so, as ordinary on-lookers will suppose &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he is going East, when He mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to march west ward; and even many of his own will think, that He is about to destroy his work and people, when He is upon His way to raise them up, and set them on high, and to destroy the Adversarieship and thigh, then His deep and unsearchable Wisdom appeareth. Then it appeareth, that He also is wise <hi>Esai. 31: 2. Iob</hi> gote a sight of this, in the Lords rare works of providence <hi>Iob.</hi> 12: 12, 13. to the end; and therefore saith, <hi>with the ancient is wisdom, and in length of dayes understanding, with Him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and un derstanding.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> gote such a sight of this, that made him cry out <hi>Rom. 11: 33. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God? how unsearchable are his judgments, and his wayes past finding out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereby also the Lord giveth a clear demonstration of his <hi>Faithfulness</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> If He were carrying-on the accomplishment of his Promises and Purposes of good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, in a visible, discernable and obvious manner, folks would have but an ordinary and cursory observation of His
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:51835:188"/>
Faithfulness; and their hearts accordingly would be but in an ordinary manner affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they moved but to praise and blesse Him therefore, of course; for, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing singular, their hearts would not be raised-up, above what is usual and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, to admire &amp; extol Him, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But when he followeth another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, &amp; taketh an unusual course, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his grand designes, and such a course, as whereby Enemies might think, He did not see, nor regard, He would never come to helpe His people, the day was theirs, they should prosper, and never be moved; for there is no appearance, or probability, might they think, that ever the case shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; our affairs be overturned; &amp; upon the other hand, whereby his owne People might s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>e no visible or probable ground of hope, that the promises should be accomplished, &amp; the word of the Lord should take effect; then His appearance with salvation, after he had wrought so long under ground, &amp; out of sight, &amp; all hop was gone from them, &amp; fear from the enemie, is much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; &amp; his Faithfulness shineth forth with a more then ordinary Glance and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre: It cometh forth then with a witness: Then they see and say, that his <hi>faithfulness is unto the clouds Psal.</hi> 36: 5. that his <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51835:189"/>
is like the great mountains, and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great depth vers.</hi> 6. and that his <hi>faithfulness is unto all generations Psal.</hi> 119: 90. So that no vicissitudes, or changes here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, can alter Him; no delay of time or procrastination, or the like, can make any alteration in Him; for his faithfulness is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all generations. Then will they praise his <hi>Truth Psal.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>1: 22.</p>
               <p>But <hi>next</hi> as to such grounds, and reasons hereof, as concerne Enemies, we may take notice of these</p>
               <p n="1">1. He cometh with deliverance unto His people, in a way not obvious nor observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that enemies may appear in their own colours; and give a plaine and open disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the latent malice and wickedness of their heart against the People of God: If the Lord did alwayes appear openly and manifestly, in the behalfe of His owne; &amp; let all the world see, that He owned them for His people; and would suffer none to do them harme; the malice and wickedness of many latent enemies, who can speak with their mouth smooth words, smoother than butter, and softer than oile, when war is in their heart, &amp; drawn swords <hi>Psal.</hi> 55: 21. would not appear: But when the Lord hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself, and goeth out of sight, then they say, as it is <hi>Psal. 71: 11. God hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:51835:189"/>
him, persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver.</hi> Because they say <hi>in their heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see;</hi> therefore their <hi>mouth is full of curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deceit and fraud; under their tongue is mischiefe and vanity; they sit in the lurking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the villages, in the secret places do they murder the innocent; their eyes are privily set against the poor &amp;c. Psalm 10: vers</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord maketh choise of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way of appearing, and working for His people, that Enemies may be judicially hardened, in their wicked course of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to His Interest and People; &amp; so fitted for the fatal blow of God's Justice. As it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when the plagues were taken off, and God's terrour removed out of sight, he became alwayes thereupon more hardened in his wickedness against God and His people; and thereafter when he saw, that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared betwixt mountains and the sea, and so judged, that God had left them, or could not helpe them, then his heart was hardened unto a peremptory resolution, to pursue and take them, even through the red sea, and there the wrath of God fell upon him, and all his army.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord carrieth on His work thus,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51835:190"/>
that the ruine of the enemies may be the more signal and remarkable, and the hand of God manifestly seen therein, when they are puft up with pride, and think no hand can reach them, they are beyond all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; no appearance is there of any thing, that can put the least demurre unto their wicked proceedings: The blow becometh the more remarkable, them ore surprizing, and unexpected that it is: Such was that fatal blow, that came on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his hoste; and on <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> when ravelling with his Nobles, Wives and Concubines, and profaning the holy vessels of the house of the Lord <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord thinketh good to follow this way: That He may, the more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, fill the faces of his Enemies with shame and confusion: therefore he he will suffer them to carry on their designes, to lay their mines close, to prepare all, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may seem to remaine, but putting fire to the traine, that they may blow up the Interest and People of God, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when they think all is ready, give them a fearful disappointment; and withal let them see, that He, who is the watchman of Israel, hath seen what they have been doing, all that time, in secret, and hath been counter-working their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51835:190"/>
and undermineing their mines, when he shall cause their mine spring back upon themselves; and thus cover their faces with shame and confusion; when they shall see, that it is the hand of God, that hath done it, defeating their plots and devices, which were laid and carried-on with such secrecy, and with such providential foresight, and rational security; that nothing but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat hand of God could frustrat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate them. Was it not so with <hi>Hamans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and bloody plot, to cut off all the <hi>Iewes?</hi> And how shamfully came he off? Thus the Lord destroyeth the wisdom of the wise <hi>Esai.</hi> 29: 14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord taketh this way, to the end, He may shame (if it can be) those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies from their wicked atheistical thoughts concerning Him; that they may know, that there is a God, that ruleth in the earth; a God that careth for His people, &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over his Inheritance; or else, they may be rendered the more inexcusable, in the day of their appearance before God. Thus the Lord will consume such, as belch out with their mouth, have swords in their lips, and say, who doth hear? That they may know, that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of Earth <hi>Psal.</hi> 59: 7, 13. An eminent place for this we have <hi>Esai.</hi> 49. The Lord
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51835:191"/>
hid Himself, so that his people became a prey, and were captives; yet saith the Lord <hi>vers. 24, 25, 26. Shall the prey be taken from the mighty; or the lawful captive delivered? But thus saith the Lord, even the Captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered &amp;c.</hi> And what then? <hi>And all flesh shall know, that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Iacoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Lord thinketh fit to follow this way, that hypocrites, and such as are not heart friends to Him &amp; His cause, may be discovered, may fall off, and so appear to be what indeed they are. If the Lord were alwayes appearing for His people, when ever they began to be in a straite, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly making bare His arme, in their behalfe, many hollow hearted &amp; false friends would take part with them, and stay among them, and seem to love and favoure them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they may be made manifest, the Lord hideth himself, and appeareth not so openly for his friends; but suffereth them to fall under the feet of enemies, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them, and all that take their part; which occasioneth their stepping aside, &amp; turning away from the Truth, as not being reconciled with the crosse, nor loving Christ, and his People so, as to take a share
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51835:191"/>
with them in the Affliction and Bondage. How many, who appeared zealous, in a faire day, will turn about, and side with wicked and evil doers, to be free of the crosse; and when they see no foot-steps more of the Lords appearing for his Work and Interest?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, in the <hi>third</hi> place, the Lord thinks good, to follow this way, for some good ends, in reference to His own people: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord doth thus, that he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the hid Corruption, that lurketh in His own people, which in a fair day, when He is upon their head, marching through the host of the Enemie, and tradeing them under foot, who oppressed His people, and keept them at under, will lye at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and not appear. As (1.) <hi>Vnbeleefe,</hi> when the arme of the Lord is revealed, they cannot then but beleeve, That He is the Lord, and the God of his people; they cannot then have the least doubt about this: But many Doubts, Questions, Scruples and Hesitations, will arise in their soul, when the Lord's face is hid, and He appeareth not in behalfe of His Afflicted People and Interest: The Disciples did openly enough professe their faith in Christ, as the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, &amp; the Son of the living God, while
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51835:192"/>
was with them, He working miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes; but when once he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead and buried, <hi>Thomas</hi> would not beleeve, no not though the other Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had told him, that they had seen the Lord; nor would he beleeve, as he said expresly himself, unless he should see, in his hand, the print of the nails, and put his finger in the print of the nails, and thrust his hand, in his side <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20: 25. And what unbeleefe these Disciples vented, who were going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> unto the Lord himself, whom they knew not, we may see <hi>Luk.</hi> 24: 21. and may gather from Christ's sharpe rebuke <hi>vers. 25, 26. O fools and slow of heart to beleeve all, that the Prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to have entered into his Glory? (2.) Fainting of heart.</hi> So long as the shipe saileth faire before the winde, a raw sea-man will have courage enough: Men at Christ's back, who have not yet had a storme blowing in their face, will be as stout as <hi>Peter,</hi> who nothing doubted, but he would lay down his life for his Master; who yet, when the Lord is out of sight; and his cause seemeth to be upon the declineing hand, will shrink and turn back, at a very small temptation: As <hi>Peter</hi> did deny his Master, and that with cursing and swearing, at the very word of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51835:192"/>
a Damsel. (3) <hi>Self love</hi> is another evil, that such a day as this will discover: Many will appear very self denied, and willing to hazard all for Christ and His Cause, in a faire day, who, when a storme cometh, will be unwilling enough to cast their goods over board to save the shipe: In a day, when the Lord is hiding himself, many will seek to save skin and life, by such indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as sometime they would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of. (4.) <hi>Impatience:</hi> How doth the heart of many too often say little less, than that graceless King said, <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why should I waite any longer for the Lord? 2 King. 6: vers. 33.</hi> Such expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that good man had, in that dark day, do evince this sufficiently <hi>Psal. 77: v. 7, 8, 9. Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will He be favourable no more? Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Doth His promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up His tender mercies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord followeth this way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, that he may put his people to the trial and exercise of the graces of His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; such as these (1.) Their <hi>Faith</hi> in Him, and in His Word and Promise: It is no great art or difficulty to beleeve, that God will make good His promise, when he is, in the sight of all beholders, most manifestly
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51835:193"/>
accomplishing whatever he said and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: But for <hi>Abraham</hi> to beleeve, that in his seed all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed, and that his Seed should be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as the Stars of the Heaven, for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, when he had not one Child, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was stricken in years, his body now as good as dead, he being about an hundered Yeers old, and when <hi>Sarahs</hi> Womb was also dead; that was faith; then his faith appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while he against hope beleeved in hope, when he staggered not at the promise of God, through unbeleefe, but was strong in the faith giving Glory to God; for he was fully perswaded, that what God had promised, He was able also to perform <hi>Rom 4: vers.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. Againe, It was no great matter for <hi>Abraham</hi> to beleeve, that it would be, as the Lord had said, when <hi>Sarah</hi> was with Childe, &amp; had brought forth her Son, and he was healthy and thriving; but to beleeve the accomplishment of the promise, when God said unto Him, <hi>Go offer up thy Son, thy only Son Isaac,</hi> there was faith, accounting that God was able to raise him up from the dead, <hi>Heb. 11: vers.</hi> 19. Thus faith is both tried and exercised. (2.) <hi>Patience</hi> is also tried and exercised, when the Lord is out of sight, &amp; seemeth to say, He will not yet come, the time is not yet come:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51835:193"/>
We oft cry out, How long will the Lord hide his face; not so much out of an earnest love and desire to see his face againe, as out of impatience <hi>Psal 6 vers.</hi> 2. and 13: <hi>v.</hi> 1. and 35: 17. and 90: 13. <hi>Iob. 7: v. 19. Hab. 1. v.</hi> 2. The Lord will thus teach his people to stand upon their watch, and upon the watch towr, till the Vision, that is yet for an appointed time, and tarrieth, shall speak <hi>Hab. 2: vers.</hi> 1, 3. (3.) To try and exercise their <hi>hope:</hi> for that is the fit time for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of this grace, when humane appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and probability faileth, and when the Lord hideth himself, and delayeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rom. 8: v.</hi> 24, 25. for usually then peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ready to say, there is <hi>no hope Esa.</hi> 57: 10. &amp; <hi>our hope is lost Ezek. 37: 11.

The Lord is my portion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will</hi> I <hi>hope in Him.</hi> (4.) To try and exercise their <hi>Submission</hi> to and <hi>Dependance</hi> upon Him.

                     </gap>y. neither do I exercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely, I have behaved and quieted myself, as a Childe, that is weaned of his Mother, my soul is as a weaned Childe:</hi> And so hope in the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51835:194"/>
Lord, not arrogantly set limites unto the holy One of Israel, nor prescribe a way, that he must follow; but leave him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low His own way and method, with due Submission and Dependance, laying the hand upon the mouth, when He is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hide himself, and to take another way, then we would possibly wish, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. (5.) To try &amp; exercise their <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness.</hi> As when the Master delayeth his coming; so when he hideth himself, as if he were not coming, or would not come, many are ready to fall from duty, and fall a beating their fellow servants, and to eating and drinking &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24: 48, 94. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord will have all His People set a watching, as not knowing what houre, or after what manner He will come; and to exercise them in this duty of Watchfulness and Diligence; he will come, and not let them know of His coming, nor tell them when, or after what manner He will come.</p>
               <p>The Consideration of this should, in general, teach all His people, as upon the one hand to guard against, and bewar of these evils mentioned, which Satan and Corruption, upon occasion of the Lords hiding of His Way, and keeping Himself
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:51835:194"/>
under clouds, after the manner mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth provoke &amp; stirre up the soul unto; so, upon the other hand, to minde &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully set about the Duties mentioned, which are especially called for, at such a time. But more particularly we may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione some duties, and recommend them to the practice of His People, in such a day, as this: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Dispensation calleth upon all Gods People, to be observing the Lord in all His wayes and actions, and to mark His footsteps, even when they can not be seen; to observe His stately goings, in Majestie, like a Prince, that will not walk in the view of every common Subject, nor suffer every mean person to be privie to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of State. These rare and unusual works of the Lord call for more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary observation. It is a mark of grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less persons, and a sin bringing-on sad and ruineing strokes, to consider none of Gods wayes <hi>Iob. 34: vers.</hi> 26, 27. That is a divine precept <hi>Prov. 23: 26. My Son give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe my wayes</hi> shewing that this is the Duty of all the Children of God, as to observe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, so also his Wayes and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that it can be performed a right
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:51835:195"/>
only by such, whose hearts are given away to God; and that it argueth an heart fixed upon, and united to God, as being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and kindly consequent thereof. At the end of a large Historical narration of many remarkeable passages of the Lord's Providence, the holy <hi>Psalmist</hi> thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth <hi>Psal. 107. vers. last. Who so is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.</hi> Showing what the spiritually wise will do, and what advantage they will have by thus considering the singular wayes of the Lord. This Considering of the wayes, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord, comprehendeth these things, (1.) A beleeving that God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit unseen, yet is working; though clouds hide Him out of their sight; yet they do not hinder Him from working; He is working, though we perceive Him not. (2.) A musing and pondering and dwelling on the thoughts of God and His wayes. As when the Lord saith <hi>Psal, 50. Consider this, ye that forget God,</hi> He presseth them to a serious meditation and pondering of what was said. (3) A seeing and observing of a stately Majesty, in the Lords carrying on his work, after such an hid manner. (4.) A passing of a sutable and wise judgment
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:51835:195"/>
on what He is doing, construeing all to the best. This is to consider wisely of his doing, as <hi>Psal. 64: vers.</hi> 9. (5.) A seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observing of every discovery or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or speaking effect of the Lord's working, to the end they may speak thereof to others, and declare the Work of the Lord, and be confirmed in their faith and hope, and encouraged to waite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In such an hiding time, when the Lord is pleased to hold Secret Councel, and to act and carry on his Stratagems, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it becometh all His People, to act <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> Faith, to beleeve in hope against hope; and Fear, to stoup and stand in awe; knowing that He is God, and will act like himself: How happy is it to get a sight of an Absolute, Invisible Soveraigne, when He is hiding himself, as a stately Prince?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As in a time of darkness, when his people sit in darkness, and have no light, they are called to <hi>stay themselves upon God, Esai.</hi> 50. So in a time, wherein the Lord is walking out of sight, and no man seeth what He is doing, His people are called to live by faith. <hi>Now the just shall live by Faith Heb.</hi> 10. When was this? When he,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:51835:196"/>
who should come, was not yet come: and there was little appearance of his coming When the Vision was not yet speaking <hi>Hab. 2: vers.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Waiting,</hi> Is especially called for, at His peoples hand, in such a day; which includeth the exercise of <hi>Faith, Hop</hi> and <hi>Patience; Faith,</hi> to realize the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and give an objective being (as it were) to that which is not visible, in it self, nor apparent; <hi>Hope,</hi> to embrace, and to stretch forth the armes to lay hold on what is promised; and <hi>Patience,</hi> to keep the Beleever in the Possession of his soul, in the meane time. This was the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Prophet <hi>Esaias Chap. 8: vers. 17. And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the House of Iacob: And I will look for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is the Duty of His People in such a day, wherein the Lord is hiding Himself, and is walking and working under clouds; to be <hi>stooping</hi> and <hi>adoreing;</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth these duties following, (1.) Not to quarrel with, nor to grudge, fret, nor repine at the Lords taking of this course, for the glory of his own name. (2.) To look upon and consider Him, as one, whose wayes are unsearchable, and past
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:51835:196"/>
finding-out: As perceiving Depths that are unsearchable, in all His wayes. (3.) Upon this account, to look and consider upon His Wayes with Fear, Dread and Reverence. (4.) To beware to set limites to the holy One of Israel; or to conclude that He will not come to save His People and Inheritance, because he cometh not in the way, which we imagine He must come; as if infinite Wisdom could not finde out wayes, beyond what ever we can imagine. (5.) To have high and sublime thoughts of Him, and to speak of Him, as such an high and exalted Prince, whose wayes are out of our reach, and beyond all our Apprehensions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His Children would, in such a day, labour to <hi>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                     </gap>e nigh God</hi> by faith: that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (1.) They may be keeped from fainting, while compassed with darkness, assaulted with Satans Temptations, who then will be busie tempting Gods People, to say, there is no hope now, God hath forsaken the Earth; He will returne no more. (2.) They may be keeped from siding with the Workers of Iniquity, and from turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side to evil courses, because there is no manifest appearance of the Lord's return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rid His People out of thraldom, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:51835:197"/>
to break the Power of the Adversary. (3.) They may get some discoveries, now and then, as the Lord seeth good to grant them, of God, even while hideing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which may endear Him unto their soul, and warm their heart towards Him: Such as live thus by faith nigh to God, in such a day, are faire to see that, which others, living at a distance, shall not partake of. (4) They may be led of God, by an unseen hand, in such a dark day; for <hi>the meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way, Psal. 25: v.</hi> 9. And <hi>the Secret of the Lord is with them, that fear him vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>We come next to speak to the <hi>Second</hi> Particular, which the Prophet discovered through this thick cloud: He saw this hid God to be the God of Israel, &amp; the Saviour; and he owned him, as such; and spoke and prayed to him, as such: from whence we may observe these <hi>Three</hi> Things,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That all the darks and hidden passages of the Dispensations of the Lord about His People, do not alter or change his Relation to and Covenant-Interest in His People. A forsaking God can and will be a Beleevers God, notwithstanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Psal. 22: v. 1. My God, my God, why hast
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:51835:197"/>
thou forsaken me?</hi> This holdeth true of a Church, ay and while He give her a bill of divorce, and excommunicate her, after she hath proven obstinate and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her wickedness: Hence we finde the Lord so often owning a wicked and sinful People, as His, as <hi>Psal. 50: vers. 7. Hear, O my People, and I will speak, O Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and I will testifie against thee, I am God, thy God:</hi> And yet the following Verses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how unlike to His People they were, And it holdeth alwayes true of Beleevers, who have closed a Covenant with him by faith: And that upon these Grounds,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The unchangablness of His purposes, which alter not, according as outward Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations change; but are stable as mountains, and as rocks in the Sea, that are not moved for all the motion of the sea about them, and all changes of tides, and tempests: Hence, <hi>whom he loveth, he loveth to the end Ioh. 13: vers.</hi> 1. He is no changling in his love, it is like himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable. Hence also His <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> are said to be <hi>without repentance Rom. 11: vers.</hi> 29. And, which is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; this is spoken concerning the Lords purpose of calling home the People of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who have been lying under the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:51835:198"/>
weight of their own doom and imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are yet as unlike to be delivered, as ever, of whom the Apostle saith, that though as concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for our sakes, yet as touching the Election, they are beloved for the Fathers <hi>Vers.</hi> 28. and as a Confirmation of which, he addeth, <hi>for the gifts and callings of God,</hi> (or the gift of the calling of God) <hi>are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</hi> So that the purposed gifts, or intended callings of God will, and must be; the Lord not being as man, that he should repent. A <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he took up his parable, could say, <hi>Numb. 23: 19. God is not a man, that he should lie, neither the Son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said and shall he not do? Or, hath he not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and shall he not make it good?</hi> So said the Prophet <hi>Samuel 1 Sam. 15: vers. 29. And also the strength</hi> (or the Eternity and Victory) <hi>of Israel will not lie, nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.</hi> And this abideth firme, notwithstanding that sometimes we read of Gods repentings, which is only to import the change of his outward Dispensations, sometimes to the better <hi>Deut. 32: vers. 36. Iudg. 2: vers. 18. Exod. 32: 14. 2 Sam. 24: 16. 1 Chron. 21: 51. Ier. 26. v. 19. Psal. 106: 45. Amos.</hi> 7: 3, 6.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:51835:198"/>
                  <hi>Ion. 3: vers.</hi> 10. Sometimes to the worse <hi>Gen 6: vers. 6. 1 Sam. 15: vers.</hi> 35. And so is spoken of God after the manner of men, who evidence the change of their minde, by the change of their outward carriage, way and work. Man is a chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature; but with God <hi>there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableness, nor shadow of turning Iam.</hi> 1: 17. Hence the Lord saith of Himself, I <hi>am God, and change not. Mal.</hi> 3: 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant, in which this Relation and Interest is offered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, is an unchangable Covenant. Hence we finde it called an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ordered in all things, and sure 2 <hi>Sam. 23: vers.</hi> 5. So <hi>Esai.</hi> 55: 3. and 61: <hi>vers. 8. Ier. 32: v. 40. Ezech. 37. vers. 26. Heb.</hi> 13: 20. It is an everlasting Covenant, and all things, promised and held-forth in this Covenant, are the <hi>sure mercies of David Esai. 55: 3. Act.</hi> 13: 34. And therefore, seing all the Dispensations of God, in and about His Church and People, turn upon this wheel, and run into this channel of mercy, being parts or appendices of the <hi>sure mercies of David,</hi> they can make no change or alteration in the fountaine, out of which they all spring; Water, coming out of one &amp; the same fountaine, may run in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:51835:199"/>
diverse channels, some greater, and some lesse, &amp; these channels may at length run to a great distance from other, and the water in them may not be alike clear and free of mud; and yet all this diversity, and difference, can make no difference or alteration in the spring, and wels head.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, all those various and discrepant dispensations are but pieces and parts of that one grand designe, which the Lord is prosecuting; <hi>to wit,</hi> the glorifying of his great Name and Free grace, in the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Church and People through Jesus Christ: And therefore, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or alteration, that is apparent in &amp; among them, is so far from giving ground, to inferre any mutation of the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in, and relation to His people; that to a Spiritual, seeing and beleeving eye, they do the rather and the more confirme the same; because such an eye will see the connexion betwixt all these as meanes, and the great end designed; and will see, that they are all subordinat unto, and are concurring effectually, in their subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat place, to the securing of the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in which they are all meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as lines in a center drawn from the circumference.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:51835:199"/>
4. Fountaine love runneth along, in all these various dispensations, &amp; so Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difieth, Tempereth, Qualifieth, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth them, that they can make no breach upon that firme and everlasting Relation; nor work any substantial change in the State and Condition of His people: Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Chastisments are not a casting out of the house, and a disinheriting; but flow from, and are qualified by fatherly love and care, whatever the witless child suppose, or imagine: <hi>Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son, whom he receiveth, Heb. 12. 6. Prov.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So is it contracted, in the Covenant of Redemption, betwixt Jehovah and the Mediator <hi>Psal. 89: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, If his children forsake my Law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments. Then will</hi> I <hi>visite their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes: Nevertheless my loving kindness will</hi> I <hi>not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will</hi> I <hi>not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> The accomplishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this. Article of that Covenant, is rather a proof and confirmation of its sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and inviolableness; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51835:200"/>
of the permanency of the Relation and State, than of any change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the same; and all the changes of the dispensations of the Lord towards his People, should rather confirm them, in the faith of this, than raise doubts or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies in their minds.</p>
               <p>From whence, by way of Use, we may see, how reprovable many even of the Children of God are, who measure Gods love, by these outward dispensations; &amp; accordingly are up or down, in their hops and joyes, as these alter to the better, or to the worse. We do not hereby meane, that they should not be sutably affected with the various dispensations of the Lord, in and about them; we do not presse a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical insensibility, which is but a stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for on the contrarie we say, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them well to weep, when the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome is away, as to rejoice while he is present. When the Lion roareth they should fear and tremble <hi>Amos.</hi> 3: 8. When the Lord is angry, they should bear his indignation, because they have sinned <hi>Micah.</hi> 7: 9. But the thing here reproved is their construeing of Gods Minde, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Covenant-Relation towards them, according to these outward dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:51835:200"/>
and the hideings of himself, like a foolish childe, that would think the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had forsaken him and cast him off, each time that she were out of sight, or set him out of her armes: So that the thing here reprovable, is their drawing wrong Conclusions from these outward changes; such as these. (1.) God hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himself, therefore His heart is changed, and He is no more their Father; His love is altered. His Grace, Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises fail. (2.) God hideth Himself, and they see Him not; therefore all are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, there is no more hope, we are cut off for our parts; as <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 37. (3.) God hideth Himself; therefore we are cast out of the Covenant, our state is changed, we have no more any place in his favour, or room in his love; we are in the state of the dead. (4) The Lord hideth Himself, &amp; is out of sight; therefore all that He hath done formerly, and we looked upon, as His work of grace &amp; love, have been but delusions, and not his work in very deed. (5.) The Lord hideth Himself; therefore His cause shall be destroyed, His work shall never be perfected; His enemies shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be overthrown. (6.) The Lord hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth His face, and appeareth not; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51835:201"/>
our Salvation is desperat, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. These wrong Conclusions &amp; the like are justly reprovable, &amp; argue a wrong &amp; perverse consideration of the Dispensations of the Lord, quite contradictory to the Truth here asserted; &amp; therefore should be seriously guarded against, &amp; such thoughts, when they enter the soul, &amp; occupy the mind, should be rejected &amp; dismissed with abhorrence, as temptations, and irrational and antievangelick suggestions of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> We may hence learne, how to answer, and with grounded reason repel the forementioned sinful Suggestions, &amp; false Insinuations, when the Devil assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us therewith, to trouble our Peace, marre our Joy, brangle our Hope, and weaken our Confidence; &amp; thereby bring us, into a Fainting, Misbeleeving, Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding and Heartless Disposition of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: For whatever the outward dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lord be, His Covenant stands fast, and His Covenant-relation abideth the same, and His heart and love abideth fixed and unchangable, His purposes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not, His thoughts take place in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, how great so ever the difference be, betwixt the one and the other, as to His dispensations in them. And the fixed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:51835:201"/>
faith of this would prove a notable preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative against fainting and faithless fears, and would Strengthen, Support, and Uphold the heart, in the midst of all these contrary waves; this would be good &amp; fast ground, whereon the soul may ride at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor saifly, in the midst of all these stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and horrible tempests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence we see the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the people of God, who have cut a covenant with the Lord (as the Scripture phrase is) and are become His, and have an interest in Him, as theirs; Let the Lord's dispensations outwardly be never so dark, and sad, and such as those, who are utter strangers to the Scriptures, and to the Lord's way of dealing with His people, would interprete to be manifest evidences, and demonstrations of God's off casting; yet they may fing with the sweet <hi>Psalmist</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and say, <hi>Although mine house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure; for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 5. O how great is this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they may by faith read love in His heart, when anger seemeth to flow out of His hands? And that his Interest
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51835:202"/>
in, and relation to His people, &amp; theirs to Him againe, abideth firme and unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, notwithstanding of all the outward sore and sharpe passages of his providence. What Joy, Peace and Comfort may the thoughts of this yeeld unto His sad hearted people, when troubled, at the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of His sharpe dispensations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here is likewise great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment, and a strong motive to enduce and perswade unto a closeing of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God: And Oh, that all, who are as yet strangers hereunto, would at length be moved to lay hold on Him, while his armes are stretched out to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come &amp; embrace all, who will come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may hence observe, That there is a discovery to be had of the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation betwixt God and His people, even when the Lord hideth Himself: For the Lord was now hiding Himself, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as such unto the Prophet; and yet the Prophet saw him withall, to be the God of Israel, and the Saviour. In the former point, we saw, That the relation betwixt God and His people doth stand, notwithstanding of the Lords hideing of His face; and not appearing openly by acts, sutable to such a relation. But
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51835:202"/>
though this be so; yet His people may want the heart-confirming sight thereof. And now in this point, we hear, That His people may be helped unto this sight and discovery, even in such a day, wherein the Lord hideth Himself. And that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Lord leadeth them in by Faith, to see His unchangeable Nature, Purposes and Decrees; as also his Truth, and unchangable Word; together with the other Particular grounds of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changablness in Gods Relations towards His people, formerly mentioned; the hand of God must lead them in to this secret chamber, where, discovering the Lord, and His way with His people, they see his heart abiding the same, however His face may frown, &amp; rodes may be in His hands. Now when faith getteth right apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and winneth to a right disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Him, they see this connexion, that otherwise would be dark and questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and they see a reality and subsistence in the promises.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord helpeth them to see tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the dark cloud, and the black dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and to read, what is written on the backside thereof; or what standeth
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51835:203"/>
behinde the courtine of the present sad dispensation: And then they discover Faithfulness and Unchangablness in God, &amp; Love, Truth &amp; Mercy in all his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord blunteth the edge of the temptations of Satan; and lets His Child see the unreasonablness of what is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; the absurdity of the Inference, that Satan and corrupt Reason would make, &amp; draw from the Lords way of procedoure: Yea, he helpeth them to draw the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conclusions, and that upon certaine &amp; approven grounds, confirmed by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord discovereth unto them the firm connexion betwixt these saddest and blakest Dispensations, and the faire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and the noble Outgate, that is coming to His people: And then they cannot but see him to be Israel's God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when He hideth Himself.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord thinketh good sometime to give, in the darkest day, and in the darkest houre of the night, some glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of His glory, in behalfe of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to shew, that He is not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of them; that He is not far away; and that He is about His work, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51835:203"/>
it on to His glory, &amp; to their good: And this confirmeth their faith in His abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, whatever His dispensations be.</p>
               <p>This should let us see, as upon the one hand, the great goodness and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of God, who will lout down and help his weak people, who are desirous to fear him, and to walk honestly before him, in a dark day; and will set a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their eye, whereby they may see, as <hi>Moses</hi> did from the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> the promised land, and that great ground of Joy and rejoiceing, that the Lord hath not forsaken His people; so upon the other hand, it should point-out our duty, to wit, to be living nigh God, even while He is hiding Himself; and pursuing after an hid God; to the end, He may lead us, while we are in the dark, and hold us by our right hand, that we stagger not through unbeleef and fall; but may be helped, through his grace, to a sight of Him, as the God of His people, even when He hideth himself; whereby we should have many advantages. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. This sight of God, in such a day, as it would set us with earnestness to pray; so it would encourage us to continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51835:204"/>
in prayer, knowing that the return would come in due time; seing the Lords mind were not altered, His affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the same, &amp; His relation to &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in His people was not changed; &amp; therefore He would hear and helpe in due time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This sight would strengthen the child of God unto all Patience in waiting, when he saw, that the Lord would come, and that the coming of the Lord drew nigh, he would waite, and stablish his heart in waiting, as the husband man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth <hi>Iam.</hi> 5: 7, 8. And by this patience, as he would establish his heart, as this place of <hi>Iames</hi> sheweth, so he would possesse his soul <hi>Luk. 21: vers</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would also strengthen, fortifie &amp; confirme their hope: for faith, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this sight, would make the soul stretch its hands thorow the dark cloud, to grip the glorious promises, lying hid in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and embrace them. Those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. though they did not receive the promises, yet having seen them a far off, &amp; being perswaded of them, they are said to have embraced them <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:51835:204"/>
4. This would keep up their head, and cause them sing in hope, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the midst of their Affliction; and notwithstanding of all the present and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent impossibilities, in the way of the Lords return, &amp; of recovering his work, they yet would rejoice with joy unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; full of Glory; because they would see, the Lord would come, <hi>and subdue Nations, and loose the loins of Kings, and open the two leaved gates, and break in pieces the gates of brasse; and cut asunder the bars of yron Esai.</hi> 45: 1, 2.</p>
               <p>But if it be said, When the Lord is not pleased to lead poor beleevers, into these secrets, in a dark night; nor grant them the use of such a lanterne, whereby they may see their way; nor such a discovery of the grounds of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this Relation; what can poor beleevers do in that case? The answere ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that, which we may</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Observe from these words of the Prophet, as pointing forth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people of God, in such a case, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prophets example; seing for this end this is here set down, <hi>to wit,</hi> That in a day, wherein the Lord is hiding Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to the way of bringing about the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51835:205"/>
promised salvation, and out-gate of His Church and People, it is the duty of all beleevers, to be asserting this Relation of the Lord's to, and interest in His Church and People, as their God and Redeemer; and to be closeing with Him and griping to Him, as such, let dispensations seem never so manifestly to speak out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, &amp; be never so discouraging to them, in that adventure: For we see the Prophet (and doubtless this was left on record, for our instruction, in the like case, and while under the same circumstances) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while he is beholding and considering God, as hiding Himself; laying hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, as Israels God, and as the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and asserting this as a Truth; to which he would stand, &amp; which he would owne, let matters go as they would. This doth include these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in such a day, as this, which was mentioned, the People of the Lord, should look upon it, as their duty, to Professe, Declare, and Avow, that the Lord is Israels God, keeping fast His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and Close with Him, Grip to to Him, Accept of Him, and Adhere to Him, as such.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thatin such a day specified, they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:51835:205"/>
should certainly expect, that he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that Relation, and be indeed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: And Salvation should be looked for from Him alone, &amp; none else; &amp; from no other airth. <hi>Thou art the Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these is manifest from these Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no dispensation we meet with will warrand His people to have mistaking thoughts of Him; or to stand aback from laying hold on Him: For they are not sent for that end; but rather to drive them ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher to him, and to urge them to a more firme and fixed adhering to Him. Windy blasts will not cause us hold a more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less grip of our cloaks, but rather cause us hold them faster.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The darker the dispensation be, our need of holding Him fast is the greater; and so our call the more loud;</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is the way, to get the sanctified use of such Dispensations; and to win to the right improvement of them: And without this, we cannot carry aright un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these and the like dispensations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the proper season for Faith to bud and appear in, and to bring forth Fruit: And this is the native and kindly exercise of Faith, in such a day.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:51835:206"/>
5. This is the only way to get a right frame of Spirit, under such a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to carry as beleevers ought to do.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the only way to be keeped stedfast, faithful, and unmovable, in that day of darkness; and without this, the soul is exposed to all the tempestuous on - sets &amp; blasts of the Enemie. Hereby noly is the beleever keeped fast anchored on the rock, that will not fail.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Note is likewise clear upon these grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because in such a dark day, Faith should be exercised, and that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per season, wherein faith should appear, and should grow; that is, as it were, the soil, wherein faith should bring forth fruit. When the knife was at the throat of <hi>Isaak,</hi> the Son of the promise, and the first and only sprout and appearance of that seed, in whom all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed; yet <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithful, beleeved, that God was Faithful and True, and would be his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus the Lord is glorified, when, blow stormes as they will, and temptations to a despareing &amp; desponding of heart, be never so multiplied, &amp; motives to seek salvation
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:51835:206"/>
&amp; an outgate by sinful and, unlawful wayes and meanes, doubled; yet the soul is fixed, on Him, and on Him alone, and will say, <hi>Asshur shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses,</hi>â€”but <hi>in God alone, the fatherless findeth merey Hos.</hi> 14: 3.</p>
               <p>All which may discover our sinful and unsutable frame, in such a dark day, when the Lord is, in Glory and Majesty, suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Himself, carrying on His work, out of our sight, and is hiding Himself, that we cannot see him, nor know what he is doing; so may it point forth our duty, and teach us, what to think, and what to do, in such a day. And to this end, we may hence learn in particular, to minde those duties following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In such a day, wherein the Lord hideth Himself, we should beware of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any jealous thoughts of Him: Satan will then be busie, to muster up all the Arguments and Grounds he can, to cause Beleevers, at least, turn jealous of God; and to doubt, if He will appear any more for Zion, to the end they may faint, and give over Faith and Hope; and then he hath gained his point; and Beleevers in such a day, may expect this, and feare their own hearts, that will be too ready
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51835:207"/>
to comply with all Satans Motions and Suggestions: This therefore would be carefully guarded against.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In such a day, the unchangable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of God, His faithful Word and Promises should be the subject of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; on these should we dwell, and ruminate; to the end, our heads may be keeped-up in hope, and we may not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We should beware to make the day darker, by sinful departing from God, and by giving way to Satans Temptations: When folks in a dark night are walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong snares and pits, they will set down their feet with great warriness and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection: so should we do, in such a day, lest we make our Condition worse.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We should observe narrowly, what we can mark, in the Dispensations of the Lord, that will say and evince to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grounds of spiritual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, that God is about His work; and that, though we see Him not, yet. He in working under ground, and carrying on His projects; to the end, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in our hope, and strengthened to waite, with patience and faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We should minde our duty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:51835:207"/>
He do; for that is it we are called to, and so much the rather, that the Lord hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himself, should we be diligent in unquestionable duties; for <hi>He meeteth him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness Esai. 64: v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We should beware to limite the holy One of Israel; let us rather stoup and adore, and acknowledge Him to be Jehovah, who doth what He will.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing considerable in these words of truth, is, what is imported by that word <hi>Verily:</hi> And it wouldseem, to pointe out to us these particulars following, which I shall but mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it is no light, or easie mater, to win to the faith, and to the sight of this by saith, That God is the Lord, and the God of Israel, and the Saviour, when He hideth Himself: For this eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation seemeth to have been, or is so here expressed, as if it had been the issue and result of some great inward wrestling, out of which, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet getteth up his head, he cryeth out, <hi>Verily thou art a God, that hidest thyself,</hi> &amp;c. And considering, the frame of our heart by Nature, and the subtilty
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:51835:208"/>
of Satan, and his skill and diligence to muster up all Considerations, in such a day, to our disadvantage, this difficulty cannot but be great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this truth is of great moment, being here confirmed by such an asseveration: It is a truth, useful, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be beleeved and fixed in the heart: For it is attended with great advantages, and the want of the faith of it, is not only sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but most hurtful and dangerous; being accompanied with many sad evils, and being the cause of dreadful effects and consequences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Truth should be fixed, in our hearts, as a great and fundamental point, and put beyond all doubt, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put with us, that <hi>He is a God, that hideth Himself, the God of Israel, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Last</hi> Particular here considerable, is the Prophets uttering this Mater to God, and speaking thus to Him, <hi>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself &amp;c.</hi> Which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth to us these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The sincerity and uprightness of heart, in the Prophet, who could thus speak unto God, and lay the matter before Him, as it was: Which should teach us to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51835:208"/>
be honest, sincere, and upright in all our carriage, free of deceit and hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The reality of this his Exercise, and outgate; for it was no made and supposed thing, but real: To teach us so to carry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Prophets heart was more warmed unto God, and that this was the result of his excercise, in his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that his heart was drawn nigher unto God; for now he uttereth the matter, in the very bosome of the Father. It is well, when our exercises have this issue and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His open Profession of this matter, was to exalt and glorify God; for herein is a piece of solemne worship per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto God; which pointeth forth our duty, in the like case.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION XXI. No man can make straight what God hath made crooked.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ECCLES. VII: V.</hi> 13.</bibl>
                  <q>
                     <p>Consider the Work of God; for who can make that straight, which He hath made crooked?</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN a day, wherein the People of God are persecuted and afflicted for His sake and cause, it were a great help and advantage unto a christian and sutable carriage under that dispensation, to have right and sutable thoughts of God, and of His divine works. In such a day, we fancie and imagine many things amiss, in the Providential Workings of God, many things we think we see, that might be helped, and if we had the disposal of matters, in our hand, should be quickly redressed; and thus being led away with our own proud hearts, and insensibly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down the strame, we fall a censureing of the holy Way of the Lord, and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with Him, because He doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51835:209"/>
matters, according to our mind, and doth not governe the world, or, at least, the Church, according to our wishings and wouldings. Now because this frame of spirit is so repugnant unto the Holy Will of God, so unsutable unto the Children of God, so hurtful unto the Soul, and such an Enemie unto the right deportment of Souls, in the day of Crosses and Affliction, it will be of use to to speak some thing (if the Lord will help) to rectifie our mistakes, and to cure us of these Distempers.</p>
               <p>We think we see many crooked Passages, in God's Way and Dispensations with the Church, and with ourselves in particular; and we imagine also, we know wayes how to set all these crooks even; But this is really a clear demonstration of our follie: For the Wise man telleth us here, that no man can help any thing, that they suppose God hath made amisse; or make any thing straight, which God hath made crooked, <hi>who can</hi> (saith he) <hi>make that straight, which He hath made crooked?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among several other wholsome Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which <hi>Salomon</hi> giveth us, in this penetential discourse of his, this is one, That we would Consider the Work of God, that is, Take notice of what He is doing and working, ponder upon His works, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:51835:210"/>
upon them, and dwell on the thoughts thereof, and lay to heart His Providential disposal of all Things, Actions and Events; and His ordering and mannaging of them all to His own Glory, and according to His own mind and absolute will and pleasure: And that so, as to acquiesce in what He doth, to rest satisfied with it, and to comply heartily and cheerfully therewith, in all points, without Murmureing, Fretting, Repineing or Quarrelling. And He addeth a Reason; (which is that we are here maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to speak to;) <hi>for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</hi> This question is an emphatick negation of the thing; and is as much, as if he had said, it is absolutly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that any Creature, Man or Angel, can make straight, what God hath made crooked. They cannot Counter - work the Lord; they cannot undo what He hath done; they cannot amend what they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is made or done amisse.</p>
               <p>This He had said before <hi>Chap 1: vers. 15. that which is crooked cannot be made straight.</hi> And here He maketh this Improvement of it, and as it were draweth this use from it; That we should consider the Works of the Lord; as if He had said, The Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, that no man can make any thing straight, that they suppose God
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:51835:210"/>
hath made crooked, should move us to complye with, and contentedly acquiesce in whatsoever God doth under the Sun, by His mighty Power, and according to His unchangable Purpose and Counsel, and to the everlasting determinations of His holy will.</p>
               <p>These words give ground to enquire</p>
               <p n="1">1. What are those crooked things, which God hath made?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How and why it is, that these crooked things cannot be made straight by one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Creatures?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What way we should, upon this account, Consider the Works of God? or what Improvement we should make of this Impossibility of helping, what we suppose is amisse, in the Lord's Works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> VVe may not suppose, that, to speak properly, any thing, that God doth, is crooked; but our corrupt unsatisfied mindes look upon many passages of God's All-ruling and All-disposing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as crooked, and as such as we would faine have altered, if we had our wills. Some of which we can onely mention, and these we may reduce to two Heads,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Touching some things, that are more controverted.</item>

2. Touching some things, that are less controverted.</item>

2. So in the matter of the Lord's dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the meanes of grace, and the Gospel, we wonder at the Lords Way, and cannot understand how it is, that He should hide this Mysterie from Ages and Generations <hi>Col. 1. vers. 26. Ephes 3: v.</hi> 9. should send the Gospel to one place, and not unto another; and why He should forbid the Apostles to goe preach the good newes of Salvation in <hi>Asia</hi> and in <hi>Bithinia Act. 16: vers.</hi> 6, 7, Why He should continue the Gospel long with one people, and remove it quickly from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and Non-church them: And why one Nation and People should enjoy the meanes of grace for many ages; and others, for many ages, never once have a report of Salvation through Christ, but be left, from one generation to another, in blackness of darkness, in woful Idolatry and Ignorance. This piece of the Lord's work seemeth so crooked, and so unlike to, and incorres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent with, or repugnant to the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, as to His Mercy, Loving Kindness and Goodness, unto some, that they, to make up this supposed gap, and set right this crook in the Lords way, feigne and imagine an Universal Objective Grace; or an Universal Gospel; that is, that God hath given to all Nations, how barbarous so ever, those meanes of Grace and Salvation,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:51835:212"/>
which, if they would improve aright, would prove saving; and so must imagine, that the Sun, Moon and Stars, Raines and fruitful Seasons, and other works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence, do preach out that Mysterie of Salvation through a crucified Christ, contrare to Scripture, and to all Sense and Reason; or that there is another way to Salvation, than by saith in a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christ; which is also contrare to the Scripture <hi>Act. 4: vers,</hi> 12. Thus the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Semi - Arminians</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> think to make this crooked work of God straight; but in vaine. We should rather minde that, which <hi>Paul</hi> hath <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 33. after he had spoken of the rejection of the Jewes, and the Lords taking-in the Gentiles, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his wayes past finding out! Vers. 34. For who hath known the minde of the Lord, or who hath been his Counsellour? Vers. 35. Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him againe? Vers. 36. For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> And minde the purpose of God here, <hi>Ephes. 1: v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. and 3: 9, 10, 11.</p>

And yet we see the Wise Mans Observation was, that no man knoweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love or hatred by all that is before them. <hi>All things</hi> (saith he) <hi>come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: As the good, so the sinner; he that sweareth as he that feareth an Oath. This is an evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all things, that are done under the Sun, that there is one event unto all.</hi> Our carnal Reason would think, that God should so rule and governe the world, as that all might be in case to observe a palpable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Godly, and the Wicked, even in external things: But we will not get made straight, what God hath thus made crooked.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So it seemeth crooked to some, that it is oft times with men, as was observed by <hi>Salomon, Eccles. 9: v. 11. The race is not to the swift, nor the battel to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth them all:</hi> But things fall out quite otherwise, than men would
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51835:218"/>
have expected, or hoped: And though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeareth a beautiful over ruling hand of Providence, controlling mens Projects, Designes and Forecastings, and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their hopes, and of what they promised themselves, and made account to be sure of; because of their wise contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and managment of their work unto that end, yet our carnal Reason would think, it should be otherwayes, and that our paines labour and wise Contrivances should not be in vaine; that <hi>David,</hi> when he had made such preparation; for building of the House of God, should not misse of his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and wish. But our seeing of crooks in this straight All-ruling and All-dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing providence, doth but proclame our blindness.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our carnal heart would oft times think, that it is a wonderful crook in the Providence of God, that he should suffer sin to be in the world, which doth so much di honoure him, and causeth so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and evil, unto all, when he may and can well hinder it. We oft wonder, why the Lord should have suffered <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and bring himself and all his posterity into such a sea of misery, yea and the whole creation almost; seing he might have keeped him, as he did the confirmed Angels: And we
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:51835:218"/>
are ready to think, that it had been better, if sin had not entered into the world; and thus account this passage of the Lords Providence to be a crooked thing. And we are ready to wonder that the Lord suffers wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to live so long to dishonoure Him, and commit more wickedness, and that He doth not presently cut them off, or at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them, as He might do, a thousand wayes. As also that he should judicially harden their hearts; as he did the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that so they may commit more sin, and beleeve a lye, as 2 <hi>Thes 2: vers.</hi> 11, 12. and not obey the voice of the Lord, as <hi>Esai 6: v. 9, 10. Rom. 11. v. 8 Act. 28: 26. Mat. 13: v. 14. Mark. 4: v. 12: Luk. 8: 10. Ioh. 12: v</hi> 40. But if our eyes were opened, and if we were spiritual, we would see a beautiful straightness, where now we think there is a crook.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Dispensations of the Lord, in and about His Church, do oft times seem crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, when we consult with carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. As</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It seemeth not straight to us, that His Dispensations should so contradict (1.) His Promises, (2.) The Hopes and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of His People. And (3.) Their Prayers, Desires and Wrestlings. We oft think it should be otherwayes; and so
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51835:219"/>
allaige that there is a crook and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable unevenness in the Way of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It seemeth crooked to us, that His Church should be so keeped under, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by wicked men; and persecuted for His sake, and for the truths sake, and should be still, as a bush all in fire: For we would think, that God should keep His own peculiar Kingdom, and his own Flock free from the Oppression &amp; Tyranny of Oppressing Enemies: Hence we finde, that His People have put up many times a complaint concerning this. See <hi>Psal. 44: vers.</hi> 12. and 60: <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and 94: <hi>v. 5 Dan. 9. vers.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) And that this trouble should not be for a short time, like a Summer showr, that soon bloweth over; but almost her constant lot from her youth <hi>Psal. 129: vers.</hi> 1, 2. so that her lucide intervals, and sun-blainks are but short, and she is hardly well out of one tryal, while she is in the midst of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) So it seemeth crooked, that this trouble should not be light, but very sad and sharpe; the Enemies should make long their furrowes <hi>Psal. 129: v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) That she should not have one enemy to deal with, but many, both together and successively. The Tabernacles of <hi>Edom</hi> and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:51835:219"/>
the <hi>Ismaelites, of Moab</hi> and the <hi>Hagarens, Gebal</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> with the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Assure Psal</hi> 83: 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) That the Lord should not hear or regard the Prayers &amp; Cryes of His people; but should rather be angry at their Prayer. <hi>Psal.</hi> 80: 4.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) That the Lord should seem so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable, that he would not grant the suits of his special favourites, and such as have prevailed with Him at other occasions, interceeding in their behalfe, such as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ier.</hi> 15: 1. and <hi>Noah, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> and <hi>Iob Ezech.</hi> 14: 14, 20.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) That the Lord should suffer these wicked enemies to overturne all His own work; break downe the carved work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As <hi>Psal.</hi> 80: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. to burne up all the Synagogues of God in the Land; cast fire into the sanctuary &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 74: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Yea and blaspheme His own name <hi>vers.</hi> 10. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There are also several things, in the Lord's Dispensations with His own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in particular, that seem to us many times crooked: As</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:51835:220"/>
(1.) We think that He should never hide his face from his owne faithful ones; and that they should never be made to cry out with <hi>Iob Chap 13: 24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</hi> and as <hi>David Psalm 10. vers</hi> 1. and 30. <hi>vers</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Or if He contend against them, He should shew them wherefore, and not put them to complaine of this, as <hi>Iob</hi> was, who said <hi>Iob 10: 2.â€”Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) We think it strange and uncouth, that the Lord should shew himself terrible unto them, as to <hi>Heman Psal.</hi> 88. who was distracted with the terrour of God, and to <hi>Iob. Chap. 7: vers</hi> 13, 14, 15. &amp; 9: 34. &amp; 6: 4.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) We are ready to think, that such should never be under Cloudes, Fears, Darkness, sad Apprehensions, &amp; Doubts concerning their state and condition, <hi>Esai.</hi> 50: 10. But that alwayes they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy light, and see their happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) We think that the work of grace in His people should never meet with a stop, far less with any decay; but that they should be still flourishing like the palme
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:51835:220"/>
tree, and growing like a Cedar in Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) So we think, that they should be free, all their dayes, of the trouble or at least of the prevailing power of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we think, that enemy should never assault us any more, or molest our quarters: We think it strange, that these servants should ever come to ride upon horses, in our souls; and that His people should be made to cry out with <hi>Paul Rom. 7: 24. Woe is me miserable man, who shall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7.) We think it also strange, that they should have so little rest from Satan, and from his inward hellish Injections, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Atheisme. Infidelity, Blasphemy and all Profanity: Seemeth not that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation somewhat crooked, that <hi>Paul</hi> met with, after he was taken up to the third heaven 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 7?</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) It seemeth many times uncouth to us, that His people have so many sad and bitter houres; &amp; that they are so far from enjoying Comfort, Joy and Delight, &amp; from that life of rejoyceing in the Lord continually, which is allowed to them, and they are called to; that their life is nothing almost but a continual complaint;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:51835:221"/>
sometimes compleaining of the Hardness of their heart, Blindness, Weakness, Impotency, Treachery, &amp;c. sometimes of the weight of Duties, and of their Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Shortcomings; sometimes of the prevailing of Corruption and of the power of Temptation &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These and the like dispensations of the Lord, in and about his Saints, seem to themselves &amp; to others sometimes crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and very unstraight: and as they wish it were otherwayes; so they suppose it would be more glorious and honourable to the Lord, if it were otherwise.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth, how many things God hath made crooked, to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions: But now, who shall, who can make these crooked things straight? This is the <hi>Second</hi> Particular, in the words, That what God hath made crooked no man can make straight, with all his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or Power, or by all the meanes he can use or devise; for <hi>that which is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot be made straight Eccles. 1: 15. I know</hi> (said the wise man <hi>Eccles. 3: 14.) that whatsoever God doth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it.</hi> When He giveth quietness (said <hi>Elihu Iob 34: 29.) who then can make trouble; &amp;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:51835:221"/>
when He hideth his face, who then can behold him? Whether against a Nation, or a Man only?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason is manifest, because</p>

to make up this compleat perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are Depths and unseen Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the work and wayes of the Lord, that we cannot search, and ignorance of which causeth the sinstruous Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we have of them: And how shall we think to amende that, which we do not understand? <hi>His works are great, sought out of all them, that have pleasure therein His works are honourable, glorious, &amp; wonderful Psal. 111: 2, 3, 4. Then</hi> I <hi>beheld</hi> (said the wise man, <hi>Eccles. 8: ver. 17.) all the work of God, that a man cannot finde out the work that is done under the sun: Because though a man labour to seek it out; yea further, though a wise man seek to know it, yet shall he not be able to finde it.</hi> And againe <hi>Chap. 11: v. 5.

               <p>The consideration of which should <hi>first</hi> cause us sorrow, and mourne before the Lord, for our seeking to amend God's work, as if we could make straight, what God hath made crooked, and set all things in a righter posture, than God hath done. Concerning which, we would 1. Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:51835:223"/>
of some of these wayes, whereby we are attempting this vaine work. And 2. Take notice of the evil of this sin.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>First.</hi> We are seeking to make straight what God hath made crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are in a quarrelling humore Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with God, and Condemning him in our minds, for what he is doing; and Justifying ourselves in our Anger and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against the Dispensations, and Wayes of the Lord, as did <hi>Ionah;</hi> who was displeased exceedingly &amp; very angry, that the Lord spared <hi>Ninive Chap. 3: v.</hi> 10. with 4: <hi>v.</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When our vaine Ratiocinations are engaged against the wayes of the Lord, in one particular or other; and we have this or that, to object against that course, which the Lord taketh; as if we would

impute iniquity unto our Maker; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Him of unrighteous dealing: As those whom <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth-in reasoning against the truth of God, and saying <hi>Rom 9: 19.â€”Why doth he yet finde fault?

May not God dispose of His Clay, which he made Himself, as well as the Potter may do of the Clay, which he made not, and is not the Creator of, but was created to his hand, by the same God, that created himself? Why then dost thou quarrel with Him, or disputest against Him? Canst thou help the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Canst thou make that straighter, than it is?</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we corrupt the truthes of God, and abuse them, perverting them to our corrupt and licentious Ends, like that saying <hi>Rom. 6: vers. 1.

Whereby they clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, how displeased they are at the holy Truths and Wayes of God, and how ready to thraw and pervert them, that they may become more straight, then they seem to them at present to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we Fret, Repine, Grumble and Grudge in our minde, against any of the Lords Dispensations in and about us, or our concernments. This was the great sin of <hi>Israel,</hi> they murmured against the Lord, and against <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 15: and 16, and 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14, and 16, and 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 10. They were dissatisfied in their mindes, and repined and murmured against the Lord; and hereby they said, they would have the wayes and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lord altered towards them: they were crooked, and they would have them made more straight.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When our hearts do not sweetly
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:51835:224"/>
comply with the Wayes and Dispensations of the Lord, or we learne not, nor study Christian Submission. We should <hi>submit ourselves unto the Lord,</hi> I <hi>am. 4: vers.</hi> 7. and <hi>humble ourselves under his mighty hand 1 Pet. 5: v. 6. We should be in subjection unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits.

               <p n="6">6. When we are Impatient, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not waite God's leasure, but take sinful courses to deliver ourselves; or sit down discontented, and sinfully longe for an outgate; then we declare our dissatisfaction with God's way, and would have his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations altered, and matters running in another channel: As when the labouring man would have the day of harvest the next week after the seed is cast into the ground, he is displeased with Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Appointment of some Moneths interveening: Whileas we should have Patience, and waite Gods time with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,

When we are discontented with our own lot, and grudge at others, as having a better lot, than we have: an evil, which <hi>Iames</hi> condemneth <hi>Iam. 5: vers.</hi> 9. and which plainly sayeth, we would amend Gods work, and set straight what He hath made crooked.

or Measure, or Season, or Duration and Continuance, or the Instrument of our crosse; but say, we would choose any other crosse but this: we would be satisfied, if it were not so Bitter, and so Heavy and so Insupportable: we would have taken it well, had it come upon us at any other time, than now: we would most chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have borne it, if it had been of shorter Continuance: and had any other person been the Instrument thereof, we would have laid our hand upon our mouth: all which and the like, though they seem to insinuate some sort of Submission; yet are plaine Declarations, that we think the way of the Lord crooked, and that we would have matters better ordered, and all things made more straight and even, than they are.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When in our prayers, there is not that submission unto the holy and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Will of the Lord, that ought to be; but rather a limiteing of the holy One of <hi>Israel:</hi> and a sinful unwarrantable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, as to things not necessary, in themselves, nor for us, without submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of soul unto the holy Will of the Lord, as to the Manner, Time and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Lords granting of our suites:
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:51835:226"/>
When our Prayers are not commensurate unto the Promises, as to their Substance; nor put up with Submission to God's Will and Soveraignity, as to the Manner, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Season, Way, and the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which the great God hath keeped in His own hand.</p>
               <p>By these and the like wayes, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our dissatisfaction with the wayes and works of God, and account them crooked, and think and endeavoure (though in vaine) to make straight, what God hath made crooked: An evil at which God is highly displeased. <hi>Wo unto him</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Esai. 45: vers 9, 10.) that striveth with his maker: Let the Potsheards strive with the Potsheards of the Earth: shall the Clay say to him, that fashioneth it, what makest thou? Or thy work, he hath no hands? Wo unto him that saith to his Father, what begettest thou?

               <p n="1">1.

Where the the same verbe is used <hi>Why dost thou strive against him?</hi> (Or why dost thou call Him before thy tribunal, summond Him to compear before thee, or contend with Him in judgment, or plead against Him) He answereth not, <hi>he giveth no account of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. It is a manifest calling his <hi>Wisdom</hi> in question; and a saying, that He is not wise enough, to order and dispose matters, aright.

As if he had not that Power over His Creatures, to whom he hath given being and all they have, that the Potter hath over the lump of Clay; or we have over our beasts, which are our fellow-creatures, and hold not their being of us.

                  <hi>Next,</hi> The Consideration of this should cause us watch against this evil, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for another frame of heart, that will be more complying with the Wayes and Works of the Lord. And for this cause, we should take another look of the Works. of the Lord, and consider them in another manner, than we usually do: and this bringeth me to the <hi>Third</hi> thing in the Text, which will also lead us to a further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provment of this impossibility of helping what we suppose is amisse, in the Works and Dispensations of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore let us see, what way we should consider the Works of the Lord, to the end, we may have a suteable frame of spirit, complying sweetly with all the crooks that are, or we suppose to be, in
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:51835:228"/>
Gods Way and Works, for in reference to this only, shall we speak of <hi>considering the Works of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We should then consider the Works of the Lord, whether of Creation, or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. So as that thereby we may become rooted and more setled in the Faith of this, that <hi>He alone is Iehovah</hi> above all Gods; and this would do much to quiet and calme our spirits: For our murmuring at, or displeasure with what He doth, floweth from the want of the clear sight and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the hand of the only Supream and Soveraigne God therein; Hence, to the end, that people may set Him above all imagined, false and supposed God's, he readeth a lecture to them of His great works <hi>Esai.</hi> 40. from <hi>vers</hi> 12. and forward; and inferreth once and againe <hi>vers 18, 25. to whom then will ye liken God? Or what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will ye compare with him?</hi> So he setteth forth several remarkable works, that He would do for his Church, <hi>that they may see, and know, and consider and understand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and that the holy One of Israel hath created this, Esai. 41: vers</hi> 20. And when we consider His Works so, as to see Him alone
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:51835:229"/>
to be Jehovah, the Absolute and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King, Creator, Conservator and Disposer of all Things, according to His own will and pleasure, then our hearts will bow more, and submit unto His holy Determination, and we will learne to say, with good old <hi>Eli, 1 Sam. 3: 18.â€”It is the Lord</hi> Jehovah, <hi>let him do what seemeth him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We should consider the works of the Lord, till we finde thereby, that He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the wise Governour of the World, and that there is a beauty of Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be seen and observed on all, even on that, which we account most crooked, in our blinde and byassed judgments. Thus did holy <hi>Iob Chap.</hi> 12. contemplate the most crooked like works of the Lord, such as, His breaking down, shutting up of a man, sending-out waters to overturne the earth, leading Counsellours away spoiled, making the judges fools, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the speach of the trusty, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the understanding of the aged, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt upon Princes, weakening the strength of the mighty, destroying and straitning the nations; taking away the heart of the chiefe of the People of the earth, causing them to wander in a Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erness,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:51835:229"/>
wherein is no way, to grope in the dark without light, and making them to stagger as a drunken man: and he saw in the midst of all this <hi>vers.</hi> 12, 13, 16. that <hi>with the ancient is wisdom,</hi> even wisdom and strength; and that he had counsel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Such a sight, as this, of the great and wonderful works of God, would cause us put our mouth in the dust, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Depths of the Counsel of God; and be far from quarrelling with Him, for any thing he doth: and when any thing appeareth crooked to us, to suspect our own folly and ignorance, as not seeing in to the profound Projects, wise and unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archable Contrivances of the only wise God; rather than impute folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the only wise God. It were best that we saw, that we ourselves were beasts <hi>Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. It were our wisdom to consider the works of the Lord, so as to finde out, see and observe his Loving Kindness.

saith, <hi>VVho so is wise and will observe those things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.</hi> There is a loving kindness ingraven upon all the works and wayes of the Lord, a sight of which would teach us to acquiesce more heartily in all He doth, and submit more sweetly unto the most sowr and rugged of His Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations: The faith and the sight of this would make all the works of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most straight and lovely to us: and therefore, that our hearts may comply mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="4">4. We should also consider and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the works of the Lord for this end, and until we did remark, in some measure, the Purity, Unspotted Holiness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Integrity of this great Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Hos. 14: 9. Who is wise, and he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51835:230"/>
these things? Prudent and he shall know them? For the wayes of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressours shall fall therein.</hi> There is, in all the wayes of the Lord, whether we see it, or not, a divine and singular Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and it is the want of the sight of this, that makes us quarrel. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> knew that God was righteous, yet he did not see it so clearly, as was necessary, in the Dispensations of the Lord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sayeth <hi>Chap.</hi> 12: 1, 2. as desireous to reason the case with God, <hi>VVherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?

the Lord, as to be confirmed in the faith of this, that the Lord is Just and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all He doth; and so as to finde new and fresh demonstrations thereof; and then our hearts will be more calme under all, &amp; more ready to submit to &amp; acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in all that the Lord doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We would study, dwell upon the thoughts of, and consider the works of the Lord, till we see and observe in them something of the Stateliness, Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Majesty of God; for in His works, which are honourable and glorious, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and powerful <hi>Psal.</hi> 111: 2, 3, 4, 6. there are discoveries to be had of His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majesty: yea a Spiritual eye can discerne this, in the most common, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and ordinary of his works: <hi>Elihu</hi> saw this, in the bright light which is in the clouds, in windes cleansing of them, in faire weather coming out of the North, for after this, he addeth <hi>Iob. 37: 21.â€”With God is terrible Majesty.</hi> God is indeed <hi>terrible in his doing to the Children of men.

works. But would rather fear; as it is <hi>Ps. 64: 9.

The fear of the Lord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wisdom.</hi> The fear of the Lord, taught and learned by the works of the Lord, would prove our wisdom.

               <p n="7">7. We would so contemplate the works of the Lord, as to see and observe, how wisely, steadily, &amp; irresistibly He Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; Carrieth on His works, for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing about His designed Ends.

When <hi>Elihu</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering <hi>Iob</hi> 37. the Lords thunder and the great &amp; small raine, the whirle wind &amp; the frost, and observed how the Lord did wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the thick cloud, and turne it about hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither; he did not satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with that, till he also gote a look of the special ends, wherefore the Lord did so; that so he might see the beauty, and splendour, that was therein: therefore he addeth <hi>ver. 12, 13. And it is turned round about by his Counsels, that they may do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he commandeth them, upon the face of the

If we saw Him, in these His works, acting as a wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, carrying on His noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Designes and Purposes, we would see a necessity for all that He doth; and that no Circumstance might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; otherwise His work should not be perfect, as it must be. And the faith of His being a God of wisdom, doing all for wise and holy ends, should quiet us, even though we should not see the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end, which the Lord Intendeth in this or that Particular work.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We would consider also the work of the Lord, and see how thereby He exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth many a time His judgments on the wicked, and how He is pouring out His red wine, that is full of mixture, and causing the wicked of the earth drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the very dregs; as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 75: 8. And

               <p>IN a time, when, because of publick and abounding sins, the Lord bringeth on Publick and General Calamities; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such, as sweep away the Righteous with the Wicked, and that could not be prevented or held off by all the Prayers and Supplications of His people, how earnest so ever they have been therein; it may seem no small piece of difficulty, how a beleever shall win to any life; or to know what a life may be had, in a such a dismal day: It may therefore be of use to speak
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51835:234"/>
a little hereunto, especially seing this is very like to be the case of this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>These words, and the like Passages, show us, that indeed there is a time, when God is so provoked by the sinnes of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that after much abused patience and long-suffering, He will not be intreated to hold off the stroke, that He is about to send, or hath threatned because of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: Nor shall the eminentest of His favourites, &amp; wrestlers, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time have prevailed as Princes with Him, be in case to stand in His way, and avert the blow, by all their Intreaties &amp; earnest Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. God was about to bring on this people of Judah, the long threatned desolation, and did denounce the same by His Servant <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> saying <hi>Chap.</hi> 7: 14, 15. That He would do unto His house at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was called by His name, and wherein they did trust, as He had done unto <hi>Shilo;</hi> and that He would cast them out of His sight, as He had cast out their Brethren, the whole seed of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> And that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> might understand the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:51835:235"/>
not grant his Petitions, put up for them.</p>
               <p>The like we have said foure times over <hi>Ezek. 14: 14, 16, 18 20. Though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Iob, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Though those three men were in it, as I live saith the Lord God, they shall deliver nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sons nor daughters, they only shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but the land shall be desolate.</hi> The matter then, which we are to notice is manifest, <hi>to wit,</hi> That there is a time, when the sins of a people come to that height, that God will not spare, upon any humane Intercession: He will hear no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty. That was an unalterable and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable sentence against the house of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Eli. 1 Sam. 3: 14. And therefore I have sworne unto the house of Eli, that the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Elies house shall not be purged with sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor offering for ever.</hi> When the Lord would beginne, He would also make an end, as it is said <hi>v.</hi> 12. So <hi>Esai. 22: v. 14. And it was revealed in mine eares by the Lord of hostes; surely this iniquitie shall not be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you till ye die.</hi> There is a time, when the end is come, and the Lord will judge a people, according to their wayes, and recompense upon them all their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and His eye shall not spare, neither
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:51835:235"/>
will He have pity: As <hi>Ezek. 7: 2. to</hi> 10. And the Lord will not againe passe by them any more <hi>Amos 7: vers</hi> 8. and 8. <hi>vers</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Such a time and dispensation, as this, cannot but be afflicting and grievous to all, that are concerned in such matters: And the Consideration of these particulars may manifest how sad it is, when the Lord is so provoked against a People, as no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions of His most highly honoured Favourites, upon whose Intreaties, sometime He hath manifested wonderful condescensions of grace, will prevail to keep off the stroke; no not <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> both together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Lord hath done much at the Prayer and Intercession of these two in particular, here mentioned, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel:</hi> For <hi>Moses,</hi> see <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. where the Lord was so wroth and displeased at the Peoples turning aside so quickly out of the way, and making the golden Calf, that He said unto <hi>Moses vers</hi> 9, 10. I <hi>have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked People. Now therefore, let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that</hi> I <hi>may consume them:</hi> And yet upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of <hi>Moses,</hi> saying <hi>Vers</hi> 11, 12, 13.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:51835:236"/>
                  <hi>Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hote against thy People, which thou hast brought forth out of the Land of Aegypt, with great power and with mighty hand</hi> &amp;c. It is said <hi>Vers</hi> 14. That <hi>the Lord repented of the evil, which he thought to do unto his People.</hi> So againe <hi>Numb 14: v.</hi> 19, 20. See <hi>Psal. 99: vers</hi> 5. and 106: <hi>v.</hi> 23. In like manner, as to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> we see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. that when the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Israel were in great fear of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> they said to <hi>Samuel Vers 8. Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God, for us, that He will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</hi> And upon this <hi>Samuel</hi> cried unto the Lord, for Israel, <hi>and the Lord heard him.</hi> See also <hi>Psalm 99: v.</hi> 6. Is it not sad, that the Lord, who sometime did so much upon the Intreaty of these Persons, is now so offended, that He would not regard their Intercessions, nor spare upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Lord hath frequently spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and keeped a stroke off His People upon the interposing of others, as of <hi>Amos. Chap. 7: v.</hi> 2, 3, 5, 6. When he had prayed for the People, and had said, <hi>O Lord God, forgive,</hi> I <hi>beseech thee: by whom shall Iacob arise, for he is small?</hi> The Lord repented and said, <hi>It should not be.</hi> And againe the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:51835:236"/>
second time he prayed, and had the same return. So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9. and <hi>Daniel Ch.</hi> 9. and <hi>Asa 2 Chron. 14: v.</hi> 11. and <hi>Iehosaphat 2 Chron.</hi> 20. and others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Lord hath sometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne to strick, when even graceless Persons, and such, as had no interest in the special favour of God, have prayed and humbled themselves: as when He spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ninivee,</hi> after that natural People had humbled themselves: And when that wicked man <hi>Ahab,</hi> that did evil in the sight of the Lord, above all that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him 1 <hi>Kings 16: vers.</hi> 30, 33. rent his cloths, and put sack-cloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sack-cloth, and went softly, the Lord delayed the stroke, and would not bring the evil upon his house, in his dayes 1 <hi>Kings 21: v.</hi> 27, 29. How sad must it then be, that He, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hath turned from the fierceness of His anger, and held off the evil threatned upon the crying of graceless Persons, will not hear the earnest Intreaties of His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>st Favourites?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This dispensation will also appear more sad and afflicting, if we confider what an high esteem the Lord hath for the Prayers and Intercessions of His worthies. Such
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:51835:237"/>
an account hath He of them, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions thereof are indeed rare and very remarkable. <hi>Let me alone,</hi> saith He unto <hi>Moses Exod. 32: v.</hi> 11. as if <hi>Moses</hi> had been stronger than He, and had bound up His hands; or as if God could do nothing without <hi>Moses's</hi> consent or permission. So said He to <hi>Iacob Gen. 32: v.</hi> 26. when He was wrestling with Him by prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication <hi>Hos. 12: v. 4. Let me go:</hi> as if He could not have gone without <hi>Iacobs</hi> good leave and permission: And <hi>Iacob</hi> is said to have prevailed with God, as a Prince; and hath therefore his name changed into <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde to this end, the frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made of the Lords hearing of such, in the behalf of others <hi>Gen.</hi> 20: 7. the Lord said to <hi>Abimelech, Restore the man his wife, for he is a Prophet, and be shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.</hi> So <hi>Iob. 42: v.</hi> 8. The Lord directed <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends to set him a work to pray for them, with a promise of success. <hi>Go to my servant Iob, and offer up for yourselves a Burnt-offering; and my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Iob shall pray for you; for him will</hi> I <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> How sad then must it be, when the Lord will not hear such. See also <hi>Iam. 5: v.</hi> 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:51835:237"/>
6. Yea sometimes we read, that the Lord hath delivered, when there was no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour <hi>Esai. 59: vers 16, 17. And He saw, that there was no Intercessour. Therefore his arme brought salvation unto Him, and His righteousness it sustained Him.</hi> Must not His anger then be great, when He will not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor spare, even though His worthies, whom He highly honoureth, were stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Him, and putting up Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, in the behalfe of a sinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
               <p n="7">7. He hath said <hi>Psal. 50: vers 15.â€”Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</hi> Is it not then sad, when ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is come to such an height, that the Lord will not onely not hear the People themselves, when they cry; but also He will not hear the beseechings and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of such, as have most prevailed with Him, at other times?</p>
               <p n="8">8. As also if we consider, how unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable this appeareth to be unto the Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and Stile, which He hath gote, and the Consideration of which hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged His servants to call upon Him: As <hi>Psal. 65: vers 2. O thou that hearest Prayer, unto thee shall all Flesh come,</hi> such a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as this, cannot but be sad and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:51835:238"/>
If it be enquired, when we may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the time to be such, as wherein the Lord will hear no Intercessions, no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor Intreaties of His greatest Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, in the behalf of a sinf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
                  </gap>l People, against whom the Lord is coming in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I <hi>answere,</hi> Though we may not be peremptour herein, knowing that the Lord sometimes taketh pleasure to Act, according to a Soveraignity of mercy; for the glory of His rich Grace and Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and therefore must leave a latitude unto the Soveraignity of free Grace: Yet if we consider the condition of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of whom this is said; and see what iniquities they were guilty of, at this time, we apprehend such a thing may be feared, where the Lord is in the same, or in the like manner, provoked; and when He is coming in judgment against a people chargable with the same evils, it may be feared, that no prayer, no intercession of one or other, shall availe to hold off the judgment. Of these sins, whereof this People, for whom the Lord would hear no intercession, we shall mention some few, to the end we may be helped to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand better the language of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dispensations; and to search and see,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:51835:238"/>
whether there be cause or no, to fear, that judgment inevitable is to be the lo of this generation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When sins, and rebellion against the Lord, come to an exceeding great height, and gross and palpable defection is begun and carried on by Court and Countrey; then the Lord is engaged to vindicat His Name and Justice, before the World; that all may see, He is no Patronizer of Wickedness, even in a People called by His Name. Thus it was in the dayes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,</hi> who, with his Court, committed such hainous wickedness, as was never there before perpetrated, as may be seen 2 <hi>Kings 21: v. 1, to 10. 2 Chron. 33: 1, to</hi> 11. and wherein the whole land was involved: Wherefore the Lord threatned 2 <hi>Kings 21: v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, &amp;c. to stretch over <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the line of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the plummet of the House of <hi>Ahab;</hi> that is, that He would do with Jerusalem, as He hath done with <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the House of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and no more spare those, than He did these. And (which is very remarkable) this iniquity the Lord would not Pardon, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Manasseh</hi> himself gote mercy, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed several things before his death; and notwithstanding of a more universal
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:51835:239"/>
and general Reformation, that was in the dayes of his Grand-child <hi>Josiah,</hi> that none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such King: For it is said 2. <hi>Kings 23: v. 25, 26, 27. And like unto him</hi> (i. e. <hi>Josiah) was there no King before him, that turned to the Lord withall his heart, and with all his soul, and withall his might, according to the Law of Moses; neither after him, arose there any like him. Notwithstanding</hi> (as it is added) <hi>the Lord turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the Provocations that Manasseh had provoked Him with all. And the Lord said,</hi> I <hi>will remove Judah also out of my sight,</hi> &amp;c. And in this same place <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. after the Lord had said <hi>Vers</hi> 1. that <hi>though Moses and Samuel stood before Him, his mind could not be towards them;</hi> but that He would cast them out of His sight, to the <hi>death,</hi> to the <hi>sword,</hi> to the <hi>Famine,</hi> and to the <hi>Captivity, Vers</hi> 2. to the <hi>Sword,</hi> to <hi>Dogs,</hi> to <hi>Fowls,</hi> and to <hi>Beasts Vers</hi> 3. He saith <hi>Vers 4. And</hi> I <hi>will cause them to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into all Kingdomes of the Earth, because of Manasseh, the Son of Hezeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. When hainous iniquities, and sins become common and epidemick, in a land, infecting all ranks of Persons, young and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:51835:239"/>
old, rich and poor, Magistrat, Minister and common People; then an inevitable blow is to be feared: for so was it with this people, as we see <hi>Jer. 5: vers.</hi> 1. &amp;c. hardly could there a man be found in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> to execute judgment, and to seek the truth: Neither was this scarcety to befound only among the poor and foolish people; but even among the great men; for they had altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds <hi>Vers</hi> 5. therefore followeth <hi>Vers 7. How shall I pardon thee for this?</hi> And againe <hi>Vers 9. Shall</hi> I <hi>not visite for these things? saith the Lord; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</hi> So in the two last <hi>Verses</hi> of that <hi>Chapt.</hi> it is said, <hi>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land.

And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath the same charge against this people <hi>Chap.</hi> 5: 5, 6. They changed Gods judgments into wickedness, more than the Nations, and his statutes more than the Countreys: And therefore the Lord threatned <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. to execute judgment in the midst of them, and to do that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which He had not done before, and the like whereof He would not do any more: He would bring on them an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified stroke, and a stroke, that should not have a parallel. And againe <hi>Chap. 9: 9, 10. The iniquity of the house of Israel and of Judah is exceeding great, and the Land is full of blood, and the city full of perversness.</hi> And therefore it is added, <hi>mine eye shall not spare,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:51835:243"/>
neither will</hi> I <hi>have pity, but</hi> I <hi>will recompense their way upon their head.</hi> Therefore was it, that commission was given to the Lord's executioners to go thorow and slay Old and young, maids and little children and women; yea all, except the marked ones <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. Se also <hi>Chap. 16: 46, 47, 48. Iudah</hi> corrupted her self more than <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> yea more than Sodom <hi>v.</hi> 49: 50, 41. And <hi>Chap</hi> 22: we have a large Catalogue of their sins, see <hi>v.</hi> 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And that as the provoking cause, drawing forth the sword, wherewith the Lord would cut off both the righteous and the wicked, mentioned <hi>Chap. 21: ver.</hi> 3.â€”14. And bringing-on the desolation and scattering, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 22: 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22. Thus the Lord dealt also with Israel, because of their manifold iniquities, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Hos.</hi> 4: 1, 2, 3. there was no truth, nor mercy, in the land, nor knowledge of God; but there was swearing, lying, killing, stealing, adultery and blood touching blood.

               <p n="6">6. When this defection, and course of sinning is long continued-in, and there is no wearying of this way, but rather a growing in this Apostasie; then such may

fear, that at length the Lord will come, and will not spare, nor pity, nor passe by any more; for thus was it with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iudah Ier.</hi> 16. there are sad judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced against them, from the beginning to <hi>V.</hi> 10.

And ye have done worse than your fathers; for behold ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me.</hi> And therefore destruction is threatned of new <hi>v. 13.

hand, and with a stretched-out arme, and with fury poured-out, will</hi> I <hi>rule over you</hi> And Israel was charged with this same guilt, <hi>Hos. 10: ver. 9. O Israel, thou hast sinned from the dayes of Gibeah.</hi> See also <hi>Esa.</hi> 65: 7.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When People become bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent in their sinful courses, then there is ground to fear a sad and inevitable stroke of Justice: For thus was it with this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iudah Ier. 3: 3.â€”Thou hadst a whores fore-head, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</hi> And againe <hi>Ier. 6: 15.

When People provoke the Lord to anger continually, to his face, as it is <hi>Esai</hi> 65: 3. then they become a smoak in Gods nose, and a fire that burneth all the day, and they must expect a recompence from God, as <hi>Vers.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

When People stand chargable with the abuse of many favours, received at the hands of God; which they have perverted, and mis-improven to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of themselves in their wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; then it is to be feared, that God will come at length, and be avenged on such a Generation of Perverters: This iniquity was also charged upon this People of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> by <hi>Jeremiah Chap. 2: 5, to</hi> 9. Their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the old kindnesses of God, and abusing His favours, defiling His land, and making His heritage an abomination, is charged home <hi>Vers 7. Wherefore</hi> (saith the Lord <hi>Vers</hi> 9.) I <hi>will yet plead with you, and with your Childrens Children will I plead.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. after the Lord had said to <hi>Jeremie, Pray not for this People Vers</hi> 14. he addeth, as a provoking cause hereunto <hi>Vers 15, 16, 17. What hath my beloved to do, in mine house, she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee, when thou dost evil, then thou rejoicest. The Lord called thy name a green Olive tree, faire and of goodly fruit.</hi> But there was no sutable walking; and therefore it followeth, <hi>with the noise of a great tumult, he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken: For the Lord of Hosts, that planted thee, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:51835:245"/>
evil against thee,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. the Lord by a similitude of a girdle, show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how he had caused the whole House of <hi>Israel</hi> to cleave unto Him, and the whole House of <hi>Iudah;</hi> that they might be unto Him, for a People, and for a Name, and for a Praise, and for a Glory: but they would not hear; and therefore he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make them like unto the marred girdle; and so mar the pride of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the great pride of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and make them good for nothing. See <hi>Vers</hi> 9, 10, 11. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 16: 18. he saith, <hi>And first, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense their iniquity, and their sin double, because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance, with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.</hi> Thus did they requite the kindness of God, in bestowing that land upon them, by defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with their sins; and therefore He threatneth to recompense their iniquity double. So doth the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel Chap.</hi> 16. make a large deduction of the favours and kindneses shown to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and give us also a large summe of their abusings and pervertings of these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: And therefore is wrath denounced from <hi>Vers</hi> 36. and forward.

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:51835:246"/>
                  <hi>Hosea Chap. 7: 13, 15.â€”they have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed against me, though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against meâ€”though</hi> I <hi>have bound and strengthened their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; yet they do imagine mischief against me.</hi> So <hi>Hos. 11: vers 1, 2, 3, 4.

               <p n="9">9. When People become hardened in their sins, loving and delighting to wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of the way, and glory in their wickedness, as resolving never to amend, and are therefore tushing at all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and contemning them; then is there great ground to fear an overturning blow, that no meanes shall avert: It was also laid to the charge of this people <hi>Ier.</hi> 14, 10. that <hi>they loved to wander, and did not refraine their feet:</hi> And what followeth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this? <hi>Therefore the Lord doth not accept them; He will now remember their iniquity, and visite their sins.</hi> And then <hi>Vers 11. The Lord said unto him, pray not for this People for their good. Vers 12. When they fast,</hi> I <hi>will not hear their cryâ€”but</hi> I <hi>will consume them by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Pestilence.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel Ch.</hi> 24. seeth <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the likeness of a pot full of pieces; and she is called <hi>Vers</hi> 6. the pot, whose scum is therein, and is not

gone out of it; she would cast away none of her abominations: and therefore the Lord said <hi>Vers 9. Wo to the bloudy City,</hi> I <hi>will even make the pile for fire great. Vers 10. Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burnt. Vers 11. Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot, and may burn: and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, and that the soumme of it may be consumed.</hi> She would not put away her scum in time, and therefore the Lord will put an end to it in her destruction; and He will not be hindered; for it is added <hi>Vers 13, 14. In thy filthiness is leudness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> I <hi>have purged thee, and thou mast not purged; thou shalt not be purged from thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness any more, till</hi> I <hi>have caused my fury to rest upon thee,</hi> I <hi>the Lord have spoken it, it shall come to passe, and</hi> I <hi>will do it,</hi> I <hi>will not go back, neither will</hi> I <hi>spare, neither will</hi> I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> &amp;c. The same was the sin of <hi>Israel,</hi> for saith <hi>Hosea Ch. 7: 10. And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek Him for all this.</hi> So <hi>Chap. 11: 7. And my People are bent to back sliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt Him.</hi> They hardened their necks, that they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:51835:247"/>
might not hear God's Words: Therefore the Lord said <hi>Ier.</hi> 19: 15. that He would bring upon <hi>Ierusalem.,</hi> and upon the rest of the Towns, all the evil that He had pronounced against it. It was this same People, of which <hi>Zephaniah</hi> spaketh <hi>Chap. 1: 12. That were setled on their lees, and said in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will</hi> He <hi>do evil.</hi> Upon which, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and desolating strokes are denounced, to the end of that <hi>Chapter.</hi>

And in that day, did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth, and behold joy and gladness, slaying Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Flesh, and drinking Wine: Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. And it was revealed in mine eares by the Lord of Hosts; surely, this iniquity shall not be purged from you, till ye die, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</hi> The like we have

               <p n="11">11. When People are so far from taking conviction, and making challenges wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and from humbling themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, in the sense of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; that they will justifie their owne wayes, and plead themselves innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; Then, there being no more hop of their recovery, their case seemeth desperat, and they may expect a final blow: For this was also the sin of this People of <hi>Iudah;</hi> as we see <hi>Ier. 2: v. 23 How canst thou say,</hi> I <hi>am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim?</hi> Therefore <hi>Vers</hi> 24. their moneth must come, wherein they

shall be found and taken: So <hi>Vers 35. Yet thou sayest, because I am innocent, surely, his anger shall turn from me.</hi> What followeth? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> I <hi>will plead with thee, because thou sayest,</hi> I <hi>have not sinned.</hi> So that the Lord is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged so much the more, to plead His controversie against them; and make them and the world both see, by sad effects, how guilty they have been. Also we see how the Lord justifieth His procedour with this same People by <hi>Ezekiel Chap.</hi> 11. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: they would say, that all these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which they did meet with, and were yet to meet with, came not on them for their own sins, but for their Fathers sins; their Fathers (said they) had eaten sowre grapes, and their teeth was set on edge; and therefore they concluded, that the way of the Lord was not equal: but the Lord, in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> is vindicating Himself, and evinceing that they were as guilty, as their Fathers, &amp; did tread in their Fathers footsteps, approving all that their Fathers did; and therefore could not plead innocent. See likewise <hi>Ezek. 33: 11, to</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="12">12. When People will go on in their wickedness, and shelter themselves under an outward Profession of Religion and Piety; then it is to be feared, that God

They should stoup, and adore this God, who is just and righteous in all His wayes; they should be silent before Him, and put their mouth in the dust: no quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some thoughts should have place or room, in their hearts. <hi>Hold thy Peace</hi> saith <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah Ch. 1: 7.) at the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. They should observe the glory of the Lord, shineing forth, in that remarkable Act of Holy Justice; see His Majestie, Awfulness, Terrour, and just Severity, to the engaging of their hearts more unto Him, and to a glorying in Him. The black and dreadful day, that was to come upon <hi>Iudah,</hi> was mentioned, and several things held forth, to make it have a deeper impression <hi>Ier.</hi> 9: and <hi>v.</hi> 22. it was said, that <hi>even the carcases of men shall fall, as dung upon the open field:</hi> And then it is added <hi>v. 23. Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Vers 24. But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exercise loving kindness, judgment and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.</hi> To tell us, that in such a day es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the Lords People should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:51835:256"/>
a right view of God, that they may understand and know Him to be Jehovah &amp; one that exerciseth judgment and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in the earth; and withall one, that even then, exerciseth loving kindness to His own; and a God that delighteth in these exercises; and that they should glory in Him, even in such a day, and delight in that wherein He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They would do well to refuge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in time, in their chambers, and shut their doors about them, and hide themselves for a Little moment, until the indignation be over past: As it is <hi>Esai.</hi> 26: 20. This is the Counsel of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His people, in a time, when <hi>the Lord cometh out of His place, to punish the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, for their iniquity. v.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They should rest satisfied, though their prayers, in behalfe of the land, have not that success and fruite, that they could have wished; &amp; that upon these grounds and considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Out of that Dispensation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit both black and terrible; yet God will get glory, both of his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Veracity,</hi> in his threatnings, at which the wicked tushed, &amp; would give no credite to them;
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:51835:256"/>
which carriage could not but Afflict His people; it could not but grieve themto see those wicked ones carry so atheistical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as contemning all the Denounciations of wrath; but now when the day of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is come, the Lord is seen to be a God of truth, and His people see then, whose word standeth, whether God's Word, or the word of those wicked sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>Ier.</hi> 44: 28. And of His <hi>justice</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing evil doers, who said, by their doings, that He had forsaken the earth, or that He was not a God, that judgeth in the earth. So also of His <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Purity:</hi> For then it's made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that He is not, as they imagined, altogether such an one, as themselves; but that He hateth all the Workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) God will have a care of them, even then, and be a little sanctuary unto them <hi>Ezek. 11: v.</hi> 16. and cause all things work together for good to them <hi>Rom. 8: v.</hi> 28. He will set a mark upon such, as sigh and cry for all the abominations, that are done, that the men with the slaughter weapon may not come nigh unto them <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) He will return their prayers

into their own bosome againe; so that they shall not fall to the ground <hi>Psalm 35. vers</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) He will accept their prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, as good service, off their Hand even though He think not good to grant the Particular, that they ask: And if they be accepted of Him, in that piece of service, it may suffice and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They would do well to be sighing and crying for all the abominations, that are committed in the land; to be keeping themselves free of that guilt, mourning over the same, protesting against it, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the same; that they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and protected in the day of God's contending, according to what we read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9: 4, 6.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the midst of all these desolations, and the effects of the Lords indignation, burning against a sinful generation, they are called to act faith, on God, as the true and faithful God, keeping mercy and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for ever, and to waite upon him, in faith, hoping and expecting with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that He will carry on His work, and make His Kingdom come, and make all this contribute unto that end. We see
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:51835:257"/>
what desolation <hi>Zephaniah</hi> is threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the rest of the Cities of <hi>Iudah</hi> for their great sins <hi>Cbap. 3. 1, to</hi> 7. And thereafter <hi>Vers</hi> 8. he inferreth and presseth on them, that would minde the duty of the day, a waiting in Faith and Hop upon the Lord, saying, <hi>Therefore waite ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day, that</hi> I <hi>rise up to the prey,</hi> &amp;c. And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth Vers. 9, 10. <hi>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may call upon the Name of the Lord, to serve Him with one consent, from beyond the Rivers of Ethiopia, my suppliants, the Daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</hi> They should wait in faith for the accomplishment of all the great and precious promises made to the Church, notwithstanding of all these sad interveening Dispensations. This was the resolution of the Prophet <hi>Esai Chap.</hi> 8. 17. in an evil day, when many should stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared and taken <hi>Vers 15. And</hi> I <hi>will</hi> (said he) <hi>wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the House of Iacob, and</hi> I <hi>will look for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be said, what shall the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous do, in the day, when God is so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie at the whole Land, that He will cut off the righteous with the wicked, and to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:51835:258"/>
this end shall draw His Sword forth out of His Sheath against all Flesh, from the South to the North, as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21: 3, 4, 5? For <hi>Answer,</hi> I grant such a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation may be expected, when all Flesh have corrupted their wayes, and even the righteous, who have not gone the length of others, in Defection and Apostasie, yet have not been valiant for the Lord, and for His oppressed truth, nor so faithful and zealous for the Lord of Hosts, in their Generation, as became them: It is then to be feared, that even many of them shall be sweeped away with the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as they have been in part tainted with the common sin, procuring it. And in that case, it is their part to minde these duties following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be preparing to meet the Lord, with ropes about their necks, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their sin, giving glory unto the Lord, as just and righteous, in proceeding thus against them with the rest: They should prepare to meet their God, thus coming in His holy displeasure, to glorifie His ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as the Prophet adviseth Israel to do <hi>Amos</hi> 4: 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They should be busie to get their peace made with God in time, through
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:51835:258"/>
Jesus Christ, that when God shall get glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their carcases, in the sight of others, they may get their souls for a prey: They should be mourning as doves in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, every one for his iniquity, that their sin may be blotted out, and their souls washen in the bloud of Iesus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They should be amending, through the help of the Lord, what hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and seeking to Him, and seeking righteousness, &amp; meekness, upon a may be of being hid, in the day of the Lords anger, this is the exhortation of <hi>Zephani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Chap.</hi> 2: 3. Even to the Godly, <hi>Seek ye the Lord all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment, seek righteousness, seek meekness, it may be ye shall be hid, in the day of the Lords anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If they should not be hid, but the judgment should overtake them, as well as others, then let them sweetly submit, and lye under the rod, and humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the mighty Hand of God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4: 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5: 6. and say, with good old <hi>Eli,</hi> when sad things were denounced against his house; and it was told him, that <hi>God would judge his house forever,</hi> and that the <hi>Lord had sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity thereof should not be purged with
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:51835:259"/>
Sacrifice, nor offering for ever. It is the Lord, let Him do what seemeth Him good, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 18. He saw it was Jehovah, who could do no wrong; and therefore he was quiet, and acquiesced to all, that He would do, how sad so ever it was: He saw Him the righteous Governour and Iudge, and said, His holy Will be done.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They should accept of this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity <hi>Levit. 26: ver.</hi> 41. giving Glory to Gods Iustice, and have a complacency (for so the word will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) in that stroke, as being a stroke of Iustice, and a stroke, whereby God will be glorified in His Iustice, Righteousness and holy Severity: Thus should they kisse the rod, and contentedly welcome the Sword of Justice, and kisse its point, when pierceing their heart, because of their sins.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thus should they say with good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when sad things were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against his Family, <hi>Esai 39: vers 6, 7. Good is the Word of the Lord. Vers</hi> 8. It is <hi>Iehovah's</hi> Word, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say against it; holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is He, and his Judgments are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:51835:259"/>
His Threatnings are good: And thus should they with the Church, <hi>Micah 7: vers 9. Bear the Indignation of the Lord, because they have finned against Him.</hi>
