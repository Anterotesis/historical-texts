            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that live in the ſhade of Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, tart in ſtile, looſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not forgetful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would be no ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowchers; this teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to men of note, ſuch as have ſtood at the helm of State, and been acquainted with the depth and tydes of Civil affairs: In all Antiquity the rule of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath been very rare, in that rule the Felicity rarer, and the continuance of that Felicity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all; yet this Lady raigned full four and fourty years, and overlived not her Felicity; of which happineſs I purpoſe to ſpeak a little without running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to praiſes, for praiſes are given by men, but happineſs is the gift of God.</p>
                  <p>I ſay the firſt ſtept of her Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112282:14"/>
in that ſhe was raiſed to the top of all from a private fortune, for cuſtomarily ſo run the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, to eſteem that moſt happy, which happeneth moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond hope and expectation. But this is not all I mean, my aim reacheth further, that Princes brought up in Regal houſes, to hope of ſucceſſion not uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are often depraved with ſoft and licentious breeding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come immoderate in their raign. From hence we finde the beſt and moſt excellent Kings were taught in Schooles of either fortune, ſuch as with us was <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the French, both of which about the ſame time (as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory yet remaineth) obtained a Kingdom, not from privacy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112282:15"/>
but onely from adverſity, whereof the latter flouriſhed in juſtice, and the former in wiſdom. Like to theirs was the condition of this Prince, whoſe hopes and beginnings Fortune brauled, but was thence forward conſtant to her till her ending.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, By birth ſhe had her turn by ſucceſſion, then ſhe was diſinherited, and at laſt laid aſide, and forgotten; in the raign of her brother her fortune was propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fair, which in her Siſters grew dark and dangerous: But yet ſhe was not ſuddenly taken from priſon to the Crown, leaſt that fret of remembrance might perhaps make her ſwell, but being firſt reſtored to liberty, ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtained her claim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtir or competition, of whom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112282:15"/>
God intending to make ſo rare a Prince, it ſeemeth he prepared her mind, and made her aſcend by the ſteps of her diſcipline to the Crown of her own inheritance: neither ought the calamity of her mother blaſt the dignity of her birth, eſpecially it being certain, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eight was rather led with love towards another, then indignation againſt her: The nature of which King, light in his loves, apt to ſuſpition, and in them haſty to blood, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the note of poſterity. As for the accuſations made againſt her perſon in themſelves improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and leaning upon ſlight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, they were not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the ſilent murmurers of thoſe times, but by Queen <hi>Anne</hi> her ſelf in that memorable and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112282:16"/>
ſpeech which ſhe uſed at the inſtant of her death; whereas preparing her ſelf to leave this world, and having gotten as ſhe thought a loving and truſty meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, ſhe bids him deliver this meſſage to the King, that well ſhe ſaw his Majeſty would not give over his old wont in heaping new honours upon her: Firſt, from a Gentlewoman he had made her a Marqueſs, from thence his conſort and a Queen, and now finding no higher pitch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the earth, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to advance her in her innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Crown of Martyrdom; which though that meſſenger durſt not relate to the King bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in new deſires, yet Fame (preſerver of truth) hath kept it ſafe for after ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:112282:16"/>
Moreover, I put no ſmall part of her Felicity in the meaſure and compaſs of her raign, not ſo much for being long, as beeauſe it took up that ſpace of age, which is moſt fit to hold the raynes of publick government, for at five and twenty yeers (when tuition beginneth to ceaſe) ſhe began and raigned till threeſcore, and whereby ſhe neither felt the wrongs of a pupil under anothers arbitration, nor yet the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of an old decrepit age, private men feel miſeries enough in old age; but uſually it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Princes (beſides thoſe common griefs) ends void of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and diminution of eſtate, few attaining an old and unwealdy age without ſome loſs of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtate. Take one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112282:17"/>
in <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of Spain, a moſt puiſſant Prince, and coming in ſwaying a Kingdom, who in his latter daies feeling the burthen and feebleneſs of age, helped weakneſs with wiſedom, ſubmitting himſelf to the courſe of mortal things; thereupon he reſtored ſuch places as had been won in, there he eſtabliſhed a Peace, and attempted the ſame elſewhere; that his affairs being all compounded he might leavethem intire and illetigious to his heirs. The contrary in all things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was ſo firm, that ſhe never ſuffered in flouriſhing or declining yeers any declination. And to ſeal up her rare Felicity, ſhe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not this world till the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in <hi>Ireland</hi> were decided by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112282:17"/>
ſtroke of an happy battail, that there might be no blemiſh nor imperfection in her glory.</p>
                  <p>That is not alſo to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what kinde of People ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; had ſhe raigned in <hi>Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grevis,</hi> or over the milk ſops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it would have been no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that a female Prince ſhould command effeminate Nations: But that in <hi>England,</hi> ſo Warlike and ſtout a People ſhould ſtir and ſtop at the beck of a woman, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet, for all this inclination of her people longing for war, &amp; of their reſt impatient, ſhe was never hindred from loving and keeping of peace, which will of hers was ſeconded with ſucceſs, I reckon among her chiefeſt praiſes, for it not onely became
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112282:18"/>
her ſex, and eaſed her age, but was certainly a great comfort to her conſcience; indeed about the tenth of her raign ſome tumults were attempted in the North, but they were quickly quenched, and ſhe enjoyed ever after deep peace and ſecurity: which inward peace of her times, I judge was moſt glorious for two reſpects; the one that it ſhone the better by the flames and combuſtions of her neighbours; the other that notwithſtanding the eaſineſs of Peace, Armes wanted not their honour; whereby the proweſs of the Engliſh Name was not onely kept up, but increaſed; hence many ſupplies were ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> divers expeditions by Sea into the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112282:18"/>
wherof gave the world a girdle, Fleets were rigged to infeſt the Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> were often tamed and ſuppreſſed, ſo that ſhe took a ſpecial care, that neither the courage of the people ſhould reſt, nor their fame ſuffer any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.</p>
                  <p>To this glory the weight of deſert was added; for by her reaſonable reliefs neighbouring Princes were preſerved in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and afflicted people (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by their Lords, badly counſelled to the cruelty of their Miniſters, and devoted to the Shambles) received petition in their miſeries, whereof they feel the benefit at this day.</p>
                  <p>In her councels ſhe was no leſs kinde and helpful then in her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112282:19"/>
whereby ſhe perſwaded the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to aſſwage his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards his ſubjects of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> &amp; reduce them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon tollerable terms, and often ſolicited the Kings of <hi>France</hi> to keep their faith, by not infringing the edicts granted to publick peace; in the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhe had regard to the ſtate of <hi>Europe</hi> in general, leſt the boundleſs ambition of <hi>Spain</hi> once broken out ſhould fuſe it ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Chriſtian world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the common liberty. In the ſecond ſhe had compaſſion of ſo many innocents that ſuffered fire and ſword with their wives and children; among whom the ſcum of the people armed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with publick power, were let looſe like wild beaſts to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:112282:19"/>
devour them, whoſe blood called for vengeance, and expiation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Kingdom which had made a league to commit inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane murders and ſavage Lania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in both which ſhe omitted not do the office of a kinde, wiſe, and conſiderate Prince.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another cauſe which maketh the piece of her raign more admirable, namely, that it proceeded from her own wiſedom and contriving againſt the diſpoſition of the times; for if we conſider her kingdom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut into factions at home by difference of religion, or abroad ſtanding as the ſtrength and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of Chriſtendom againſt the monſtrous deſigns and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhall finde that there was no fuel wanting for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:112282:20"/>
a war, but ſhe had provided for all, and gotten the reach both in Force and Councel; as that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable event well declared, which for the happineſs thereof ſurpaſſed all the actions of our age; for when that Navy called Invincible, whoſe ſailes ſwelled with pride, and ſecure of victory, had entered the narrow Seas, to the fear and aſtoniſhment of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> it neither took a cock-boat at Sea, nor burnt a Cottage at Land, nor once touched upon the Coaſts; but was miſerably ſcattered and put to flight, and at laſt daſhed upon againſt the Rocks, whiſt peace remained in her confines, and no commotion was ſeen in the Land.</p>
                  <p>No leſs happy was ſhe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping the plot of Traytors, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112282:20"/>
defeating the power of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for though divers conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were hatched againſt her life, yet all were either diſcovered or failed, neither did they work any jealouſies or diſtruſt in her mind, for ſhe kept not the more within, nor went the leſs abroad, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of her guard, but ſecure and confident, and mindful more of her deliverance from danger, then of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it ſelf, ſhe changed nothing from the wonted courſe of her life.</p>
                  <p>It is not alſo unworthy to be marked the quality of thoſe times wherein ſhe flouriſhed, for ſome ages fall out to be ſo barbarous and ſilly, that it were no harder matter to rule a Nation of men, then to lead a flock of ſheep, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112282:21"/>
ſhe was eminent in learned and refined times, wherein it was not eaſie to excel without ſingular parts of Nature, habituation of Vertue, and extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Wit and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the raign of Women uſe to be obſcured with marriage, whoſe worth and actions are commonly ſmothered up under the names and covert of their husbands: Thoſe onely that live unmarried have no partner in their glory, ſuch was ſhe, and this praiſe ſhe deſerved the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was ſupported by no props but her own; no half bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor uncle, nor Prince of the blood was remaining to whom ſhe might impart her cares, and receive aſſiſtance in her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:112282:21"/>
yea, thoſe who ſhe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to higheſt honours, ſhe kept in ſuch a ballance and reſtraint, that every one laboured moſt to pleaſe her will, whilſt ſhe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miſtris of her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Barren indeed ſhe was, left no child behind her, which alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to many fortunate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Trojaen</hi> the Emperor; but this may be a diverſe conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and be diſputed on either part, ſome call it diminiſhment of happineſs, as if thoſe men were bleſſed above the conditions of men, who prove aſwel happy in their propagation as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Others make it the pitch of happineſs, which, ſay they, is then onely compleat, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112282:22"/>
from the wheel of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and out of danger to be blemiſhed by a degenerating iſſue.</p>
                  <p>She wanted not alſo thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adjuncts of happineſs, ſhe was tall of ſtature, of comely limbs and excellent feature in her countenance, Majeſty ſate under the vail of ſweetneſs, her health was ſound and proſperous, and ſo drawing to her laſt without ſenſe of age or misfortune, ſhe had that which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſo much deſired, a gentle and happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. The which is likewiſe recorded of <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> that good Emperor, whoſe death was like a dream or ſome ſweet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: In all her ſickneſs was nothing ominous, nor lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nor uncouth to her kind, no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112282:22"/>
Symptom was ſeen ſtrange or noiſome, but all of ſuch a frame, as rather ſhewed the frailty of the corruption of humane nature; for ſome few daies before her death finding her body (ſeldom moiſtened with wine, or a larger diet) to ſhrink up with drineſs and cares which attend a crown, ſhe ſuffered ſome convulſion in her nerves, ſtill keeping (though in a ſlow and weaker meaſure) her ſpeech, motion and underſtanding, which is not ordinary in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: But this eſtate not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, ſeeming rather the firſt ſteps to death, then laſt act of life; for when the powers of life are waſted, it is a wretched thing to remain in life; but by the ſlumber of ſenſe to haſte inſenſibly to death, is a clement and eaſie cloſe of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:112282:23"/>
Add this to the hap of her felicity, that ſhe was not onely happy in her own, but alſo in the abilities of her ſervants; for ſhe had ſuch gifted men about her as perhaps this Iſland had rarely brought forth before.</p>
                  <p>But God when he favoureth Kings enlargeth the hearts of their miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Two felicities yet remain that may be called <hi>Poſt humus,</hi> which are indeed higher and happier then all theſe that adorned her life: One of her ſucceſſor, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her memory; ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor ſhe had, who albeit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his maſculine vertue and fair progeny, and acceſs of a new Kingdom, might ſomwhat ſhadow or exceed her glory, yet he alwayes honoured her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112282:23"/>
name, and gave a kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity to her deeds, for he made ſo ſmall alteration in the orders he found eſtabliſhed, or perſons ſhe had choſen, that ſo the ſon could ſucceed his father with greater ſilence, or leſs danger or diſturbance of eſtate.</p>
                  <p>And concerning the fame and happineſs of her memory, that is yet ſo freſh in the mindes and mouths of men, as taking life from her aſhes wherein all envy is raked up; it ſeemeth to contend with the happineſs of her life, for if any factious humor raiſed from diſſent in Religion be yet buzzing abroad (though it ſeems by this time conjured down by conſent of truth) as it is moſt foul and falſe; ſo it cannot be long lived, and truly I have gathered theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112282:24"/>
notes of Gods favour and her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity for this ſpecial end; that malicious men ſhould be afraid to mingle their curſings (amongſt ſo many bleſſings of God.)</p>
                  <p>After all this, if any ſhould ſay as one did of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> We hear of things whereat we wonder, but look for things which we might commend; I verily think that true admiration is certain exceſs of praiſe, and verily theſe felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here deſcribed, cannot befal to any who are not viſibly ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with divine favours, and in ſome ſort have not ſet their lives in aim of glory; nevertheleſs, I will recount ſome few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her manners, and of thoſe onely which might ſeem to lend occaſion unto baſe ſpeeches of contumelious men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:112282:24"/>
In her religion ſhe was pious, conſtant, moderate, and could not away with innovations, her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety chiefly appeared in her works and actions, but it was alſo ſeen in the ordinary courſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of her life; ſhe was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom abſent from prayers in her cloſet, or at ſermons and ſolemn ſervice abroad; diligent in reading the Scriptures, well verſed in the Fathers, and above all in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> upon divers occaſions ſhe compoſed ſundry prayers: when ſhe mentioned God (though in common talk) added for the moſt part of Creator, caſting, as I have often obſerved, her face &amp; eies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reverend form of humility: and whereat ſome have publiſhed, that ſhe put off the thought of mortality, nor could abide to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112282:25"/>
hear of old age or death. It is moſt untrue, for many years before her end ſhe was not nice, often, and with much grace to call her ſelf old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and uſed to diſcourſe of her Tomb, and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription would moſt pleaſe her, ſaying, She delighted not in long Titles, or ſhadows of glory, a line or two would be enough for her memory, which in few words ſhould only expreſs her name in her virginity, the time of her raign, the reſtoring of religion, &amp; eſtabliſhment of Peace: True it is, that being once importuned to declare her ſucceſſor whilſt ſhe was yet in her full ſtrength, not unfit to bear children, ſhe would not endure her winding ſheet to be ſpread before her eies, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112282:25"/>
yet not long before her death, ſitting penſive, and, as it were, muſing of mortality, as one came and told her, that divers places ſtood too long vacant in the State; ſhe roſe up ſomwhat offended, and ſaid, <hi>She knew well enough that her place would not ſtand an inſtant empty.</hi> Her moderation may perchance be doubted in matter of Religion, conſidering the ſeverity of thoſe Lawes ſhe made againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: But herein we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch onely things whereof we have certain knowledge, and made diligent ſearch; out of all queſtion, the meaning of this Princeſs minde, was this, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offer violence to the conſciences of men, nor to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her State to be diſquieted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112282:26"/>
pretext of conſcience; out of which foundation ſhe judged, firſt of all, that the toleration of two Religions in one hot heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning people, who from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc in mind) might break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blows, might be of pernitious conſequence to the State; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at her entrance upon the Crown, when all things were ful of ſuſpition, ſhe uſed the power of the Law, and committed ſom of the buſieſt, and moſt facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prelates for the reſt of their Coat: ſo far was ſhe from vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſevere inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſhe winked at their faults, and took them into her protection; This was the firſt ſtate of things: and although the interdiction of <hi>Pius</hi> the fift might have ſtirred up her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112282:26"/>
and made her reſolve of a ſharper courſe, yet ſhe departed not from her nature, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged little from her mildneſs; for, like a moſt wiſe and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lady, ſecure of her peoples love, and that the Popiſh Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not ſtir at home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out far aſſiſtance, ſhe paſſed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for the claps of the Popes thunder: But about the three and twentieth of her raign things received an alteration, which change of time, was not complotted by deſign, but recorded in publick Acts, and cut as it were, in braſs for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity; Till that year, no great or heavy puniſhment was laid upon her Popiſh Subjects by the Lawes precedent; but now the vaſt projects and ambitions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112282:27"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> for ſubduing of this Kingdom, began to be detected, whereof a principal part was, that a new fangled Faction ſhould be raiſed in the bowels of this State; which ſhould not onely be ready to receive a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign invader, but alſo, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and power of the Popes Bull,) ſhould abſolve her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Faith and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and prepare their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for dangerous innovaſions. About that time <hi>Ireland</hi> was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with open Armes, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libels were caſt out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fame, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Queen; and all things ſeemed to ſwell up in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of greater motions. I would rather think, that many
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112282:27"/>
of the Preiſts were made wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruments of other mens malice, then that all were privy to their Councel; yet this is true, and verified by ſundry confeſſions, That almoſt all the Prieſts that were ſent over into this Kingdom, from the three and twentieth to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of this Queens raign (in which year that Popiſh and Spaniſh deſign was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) had private inſtructions to divulge abroad, that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate could ſtand thus no longer; that within a while they ſhould ſee a new face of things, and notable alterations; That the good of <hi>England</hi> was cared for by the Pope, and popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they would not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves; yea, ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112282:28"/>
of the Prieſts were manifeſtly found guilty of thoſe Plots and Machinations, which tended to the ſubverſion of the State. And that which moved moſt the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their ſecret Councels, was diſcloſed by letters inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, importing, that all the watchfulneſs of the Queen and Councel over the Papiſts, would be utterly deluded; for, albeit they laboured much, that no man of note or nobility ſhould be head of the Faction; yet, a courſe was taken to effect the work by men of meaner and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour rancks, whoſe mindes (though they knew not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhould be linked together by ſecret confeſſions, without need of Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>Such arts were then uſed,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112282:28"/>
and, of late in a caſe (not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) reſumed; which (it ſeems) are familiar with thoſe men: Thus clangor approaching, like a ſtorme, put a Law of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Queen.</p>
                  <p>It being now high time, that ſuch part of her ſubjects as were eſtranged from her love, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſoned without hope of cure, and yet grew rich withall in a private life, which freed them from publick charge, ſhould be kept under and reſtrained with Lawes of a more heavy nature: The courſe of all this miſery ſtill increaſing, was imputed to the Prieſts, who carried into forraign Countries, and fed by the crums of ſtranger Princes (profeſſed enemies to this State) were brought up onely in ſuch

places where the name of the Queen their Soveraign was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, but as an heretick and excommunicate perſon, torn with curſes and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; If theſe men were not inticed with treacherous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, they were ſurely known to be familiar with ſuch as were; who with the venom of their arts, had pernitiouſly depraved the minds of many Papiſts, and ſowred their whole Lump with a new malignant livery, which was ſweeter and leſs timerous before.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, no ſafer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedy could be found, then to debar theſe unnatural men from all entrance into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which was likewiſe decreed under penalty of their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112282:29"/>
lives, in the ſeven and twentieth of her raign.</p>
                  <p>Not long after when the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt roſe and fell upon this land; the event well declared what love remained in theſe mens breſts towards their deareſt Country; for, ſo were they blinded with hate and envy, that they reſted neither night nor day, binding themſelves with Vowes and Sacraments, to bring it into bondage of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, albeit the clouds of <hi>Spain</hi> (which cauſed this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity) were blown over, and vaniſhed; yet, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of danger paſſed, ſtruck deep in the mindes of men; and, becauſe it would have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted levity to have repealed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112282:30"/>
thoſe Lawes, and unfaithfulneſs to neglect them once eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The Queen was ſo drawn with weight of affairs, that it was no more in her power to ſet them in that former eſtate wherein they were before, in the twenty third of her raign.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be added, that although there was not wanting the induſtry of divers Miniſters to increaſe her exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; and juſtice of others to urge exemption of the Lawes, wherein they onely ſaw the publike ſafety to conſiſt; yet, conſtant to her natural clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhe debated the keenneſs of their edge, that the Prieſts who ſuffered death were very few in regard of their exceeding number.</p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:112282:30"/>
Theſe things I rehearſe, not, as points of her defence, this cauſe needeth no juſtification; whereas both the ſafety of this Kingdom required no leſs, and the whole courſe of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, fell far ſhort of the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy examples amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; which rather flowed from pride and malice, then any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: But I am not forgetful of my firſt affection, having by this time ſufficiently ſhown that this Prince was moderate in cauſe of Religion, and if any ſharpneſs happened therein, that it proceeded not from her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from the iniquity of the times.</p>
                  <p>Of her great care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in true religion, this may be a certain Argument, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112282:31"/>
popery had been eſtabliſhed by much power and ſtudy in her ſiſters raign, and had taken deep root by time, and was ſtill confirmed by the writ and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all in Authority; yet, ſince that it neither agreed with the word of God, nor the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive pureneſs, nor her own conſcience, ſhe pluck'd it up, with little help, and aboliſhed it with great courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; which was not done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a raſh impetuous fancy, but with maturity and advice; whereof (among many other things) we may take a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture by an anſwer ſo made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a by-occaſion.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of her raign, when Priſoners (as the manner is) were releaſed, for a boon of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112282:31"/>
her new inauguration; A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Courtier, who by cuſtome had taken up a boldneſs of ſpeech, and jeſtingly waited for her as ſhe went to Chappel, when, either of himſelf, or ſet on by wiſer men, he put an humble petition, crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud withall, <hi>That yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained four or five honeſt Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were unjuſtly detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; beſeeching he Majeſty to ſet them at Liberty; and they were the four Evangeliſts, and Saint</hi> Paul <hi>the Apoſtle, who had been long ſhut up in a ſtrange language, as in a Priſon, and kept from converſing among the people;</hi> to whom ſhe wiſely anſwered, <hi>That full inquiry ſhould be made of themſelves, whether they would be releaſed, yea, or no:</hi> whereby
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112282:32"/>
ſhe put off a ſudden queſtion, with a ſuſpended anſwer; and ſtil reſerved the intereſt of things in her own freedom and deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>In which buſineſs, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not by peeces, or with trepidation, but in a grave and ſetled order: Firſt, calling the Synods to conference, and the States to Parliament; and then within compaſs of one year, ſo reformed Eccleſiaſtical affairs, that till her dying day ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not a whit from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution then determined; yea, ever after her cuſtome was to warn almoſt every Parliament when it ſate, that nothing ſhould be changed in the right, and diſcipline of the Church; and thus far concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:112282:32"/>
Now to leave theſe ſadder things; if any man ſhould think it a lightneſs that ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be courted and woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and refuſed not to be ſeen upon the ſcene of Love, even beyond the condition of her Age; this, if it be gently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued, wanted not alſo a ſhare in admiration; for it ſoundeth unlike thoſe old Stories of a Maiden Queen living in <hi>Elizian</hi> Iſlands, from whoſe Court none was debarred that uſed fair ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtment, and no laſciviouſneſs in love; But if it be ſeverely ſcanned, then greater is the wonder; for, albeit that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee, that a State is looſened by the looſeneſs of the Prince; yet, theſe delights ſhe uſed with ſuch a curb, that they little dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:112282:33"/>
her fame, leſs her Majeſty, and ſoftned the vigour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of her State nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>But to ſhut up my diſcourſe; the Prince was certainly good and vertuous, and ſo ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſeem, ſhe hated vices, and took the way to fame, by that of honour: Whilſt I am upon her vertues, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get one paſſage, when letters were written to her Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in <hi>France,</hi> to deliver ſome private meſſage to the Queen-Mother then of <hi>Valois;</hi> wherein her Secretary, as it were, to curry favour, had inſerted this clauſe, that the Ambaſſador ſhould ſay, <hi>They two were two ſuch Queens, ſo verſed in Soveraign Arts, and ſeen in politick affairs,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:112282:33"/>
                     <hi>as no Kings nor men in the world went beyond them;</hi> She miſliked the aſſotiation, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be blotted out, ſaying, <hi>The Arts ſhe had learned were of a better ſtamp, and the principles of a far higher nature, whereby ſhe ruled her people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was not puffed up with the length of her raign, although ſhe was long a Queen; for, if any had told her fitly in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>That the world would have taken notice of her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, though ſhe had lived in ſome mean eſtate;</hi> ſhe would have been well pleaſed with ſuch inſinuations; ſo much ſhe deſired that her vertue ſhould ſtand alone unbeholding to her fortune for praiſe.</p>
                  <p>But if I ſhould enter into her
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112282:34"/>
moral or regal commendations, or recite the Roll of her vertue, and rank them in their proper place and light, befitting ſo rare a Prince, which ſhould ſlide into the ſtory of her life, it would require greater leaſure and a larger vein. I have onely ſummoned up theſe two parcels briefly, and ſincerely, as I could; for, it muſt be confeſſed, That no Commender can be found ſufficient for this Prince, but onely time, which, from the firſt beginning, never produced in all her ſex any one like to her for Civil Government and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may pleaſe your good Lordſhip: I cannot be ignorant, and ought to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the wrong which I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain in common ſpeech, as if I had been falſe, or unthankful to that noble, but unfortunate Earl the Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and for ſatisfying the vulgar ſort, I do not ſo much regard it; though I love a good name, but yet as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:112282:36"/>
an handmaid and attendant of honeſty and vertue. For I am of his opinion that ſaid pleaſantly, <hi>That it was a ſhame to him that was a ſuter to the miſtriſs, to make love to the waiting woman;</hi> and therfore to woo or court co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fame otherwiſe then it followeth on honeſt courſes, I for my part, find not my ſelf fit nor diſpoſed. But on the other ſide, there is no worldly thing that concerneth my ſelf, which I hold more dear, then the good opinion of certain perſons; amongſt which there is none I would more willingly give ſatisfaction unto, then to your Lordſhip. Firſt, becauſe you loved my L. of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not be partial towards me; which is part of that I deſire, next, becauſe it hath ever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:112282:36"/>
you to ſhew your ſelf to me an honorable friend; and ſo no baſeneſs in me to ſeek to ſatisfie you: and laſtly, becauſe I know your Lordſhip is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently grounded in the true rules and habits of duties &amp; morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which muſt be they which ſhall decide this matter: wherein (my L.) my defence needeth to be but ſimple and brief: namely, that whatſoever I did concering that action and proceeding, was done in my duty and ſervice to the Queen and the State; in which I would not ſhew my ſelf falſe hearted, nor faint hearted for any mans ſake living. For every honeſt man that hath his heart wel planted, wil forſake his King rather then forſake God, &amp; forſake his friend rather then
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:112282:37"/>
forſake his King; and yet will forſake any earthly commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, and his own life in ſome caſes, rather then forſake his friend. I hope the world hath not forgotten theſe degrees, elſe the heathen, ſaying; <hi>Amicus uſque ad aras,</hi> ſhall judge them.</p>
                  <p>And if any man ſhall ſay, I did officiouſly intrude my ſelf into that buſineſs, becauſe I had no ordinary place; the like may be ſaid of all the buſineſs in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that paſſed the hands of the learned Councel, either of State or Revenues theſe many years, wherein I was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed. For, as your Lordſhip may remember, the Queen knew her ſtrength ſo well as ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her word ſhould be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and after the manner of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:112282:37"/>
the choiſeſt Princes before her, did not alwayes tye her truſt to place, but did ſomtime divide private favor from office. And I for my part, though I was not ſo unſeen in the world, but I knew the condition was ſubject to envy and peril; yet becauſe I knew again ſhe was conſtant in her favours, and made an end where ſhe began, and eſpecially, becauſe ſhe upheld me with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acceſs, and other demonſtrations of confidence and grace, I reſolved to indure it, in expectation of better. But my ſcope and deſire is, that your Lordſhip would be pleaſed to have the honorable patience, to know the truth, in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity, of all that paſſed in this cauſe, wherein I had any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:112282:38"/>
part, that you may perceive how honeſt a heart I ever bear to my Soveraign and to my Country, and to that Noble man, who had ſo well deſerved of me, and ſo well accepted of my deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; whoſe fortune I cannot remember without much grief. But for any action of mine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, there is nothing that paſſed me in my life time, that cometh to my remembrance with more clearneſs, and leſs check of conſcience: for it will appear to your Lordſhip, that I was not onely not oppoſite to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but that I did occupy the utmoſt of my wits, and adventure my fortune with the Queen to have reinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated his, and ſo continued faithfully and induſtriouſly till
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:112282:38"/>
his laſt fatal impatience (for ſo I wil call it) after which day there was not time to work for him, though the ſame, my affection, when it could not work on the ſubject proper, went to the next, with no ill effect towards ſom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who I think do rather not know it, then not acknowledge it. And this I will aſſure your Lordſh. I wil leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that is truth for any enemy that I hav to add; &amp; on the other ſide, I muſt reſerve much which makes for me, in many reſpects of duty, which I eſteem above my credit: and what I have here ſet down to your Lordſh. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, as I hope to have any part in <hi>God's</hi> favour, is true.</p>
                  <p>It is well known, how <hi>I</hi> did many years ſince dedicate my
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112282:39"/>
travels and ſtudies to the uſe and (as I may tearm it) ſervice of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God, I did not, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king election of him as the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt mean of mine own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, but out of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of a man, that ever, from the time I had any uſe of reaſon (whether it were reading upon good books, or upon the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a good father, or by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) I loved my Country more then was anſwerable to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and I held at that time, my L. to be the fitter inſtrument to do good to the State: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I applied my ſelf to him, in a manner which I think hapneth rarely among men: for I did not onely labour carefully and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly in that he ſet me about,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:112282:39"/>
whether it were matter of advice or otherwiſe, but neglecting the Queens ſervice, mine own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and in a ſort my vocation, I did nothing but adviſe and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate with my ſelf to the beſt of my underſtanding, propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and memorials, of any thing that might concern his Lordſhips honor, fortune, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And when not long after I entred into this courſe, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Anthony Bacon</hi> came from beyond the Seas, being a Gentleman whoſe ability the world taketh knowledge of for matters of State, ſpecially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; I did likewiſe knit his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to be at my L<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> diſpoſing. And on the otherſide, I muſt and will ever acknowledge my Lords love, truſt, and favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:112282:40"/>
me, laſt of all his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, having infeofed me of land which I ſold for eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds to Maſter <hi>Reynold Nicholas,</hi> and I think was more worth, and that at ſuch a time, and with ſo kinde and noble cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as the manner was as much as the matter: which though it be but an idle digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet becauſe I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſhort in commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his benefits, I will preſume to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the relating to you the manner of it. After the Queen had denied me the Solicitors place, for the which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had been a long and earneſt ſutor on my behalf, it pleaſed him to come to me from <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> to <hi>Twicknam</hi> Park, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112282:40"/>
brake with me, and ſaid: Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> the Queen hath denied me the place for you, and hath placed another; I know you are the leaſt part of your own mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but, you fare ill becauſe you have choſen me for your mean and dependance: you have ſpent your time and thoughts in my matters; I die (theſe were his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words) if I do not ſomewhat towards your fortune, you ſhall not deny to accept a peece of Land, which I will beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. My anſwer I remember was, that for my fortune it was no great matter: but that his Lordſhips offer made me call to minde what was wont to be ſaid when I was in <hi>France</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that he was the greateſt uſurer in <hi>France</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:112282:41"/>
becauſe he had turned all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate into obligations; meaning that he had left himſelf nothing, but onely had bound numbers of perſons to him. Now my Lo. (ſaid I) I would not hav you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate his courſe, nor turn your ſtate thus by great gifts into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, for you wil find many bad debtors. He bad me take no care for that, &amp; preſſed it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſaid my Lor. I ſee I muſt be your homager, and hold land of your gift: but do you know the manner of doing homage in law? Alwaies it is with a ſaving of his faith to the King and his other Lords, and therefore my L. (ſaid I) I can be no more yours then I was, and it may be with the ancient ſavings: and if I grow to be a rich man, you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:112282:41"/>
will give me leave to give it back to ſome of your unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed followers. But to return, ſure <hi>I</hi> am (though <hi>I</hi> can arrogate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to my ſelf, but that <hi>I</hi> was a faithful remembrance to his Lordſhip) that while <hi>I</hi> had moſt credit with him, his fortune went on beſt. And yet in two main points we alwaies directly and contradictorily differed, which <hi>I</hi> will mention to your Lordſhip, becauſe it giveth light to all that followed. The one was, <hi>I</hi> ever ſet this down, and that the onely courſe to be held with the Queen, was by obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs &amp; obſervance; and <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>I</hi> would uſually engage confidently, that if he would take that courſe conſtantly, and with choiſe of good parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:112282:42"/>
to expreſs it, the Queen would be brought in time to <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> queſtion, to ask, <hi>What ſhould be done to the man, that the King would honour:</hi> meaning, that her goodneſs was without limit, where there was a true concurrence, which I knew in her nature to be true. My Lord on the otherſide had a ſetled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Queen could be brought to nothing, but by a kinde of neceſſity and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I will remember, when by violent courſes at any time he had got his will he would ask me. Now Sir: <hi>whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be true?</hi> And I would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſay to him: <hi>My Lord, theſe courſes be like to hot waters, they will help at a pang: but if you uſe them, you ſhall ſpoil the ſtomack,</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:112282:42"/>
                     <hi>and you ſhall be fain ſtill to make them ſtronger and ſtronger, and yet in the end they will leſs their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> with much other variety, wherewith I uſed to touch that ſtring. Another point was, that I alwaies vehemently diſſwaded him from ſeeking greatneſs by a military dependance, or by a popular dependance, as that which would breed in the Queen jealouſie, in himſelf preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the State perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and I did uſually compare them to <hi>Icarus</hi> two wings which were joyned on with wax, and would make him ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſoar too high, and then fail him at the height. And I would further ſay unto him: My Lord, ſtand upon two feet, and fly not upon two wings.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:112282:43"/>
The two feet, are the two kinds of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> Commutative and Diſtributive: uſe your greatneſs for advancing of merit and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and relieving wrongs and burdens, you ſhall need no other art or fineneſs: but he would tell me, that opinion came not from my minde, but from my robe. But it is very true, that <hi>I</hi> that never meant to inthral my ſelf to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> nor any other man, more then ſtood with the publick good, did (though <hi>I</hi> could little prevail) divert him by all means poſſible from courſes of the wars and popularity: for <hi>I</hi> ſaw plainly the Queen muſt either live or die; if ſhe lived, then the times would be as in the declination of an old Prince, if ſhe died,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:112282:43"/>
the times would be as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a new: and that if his Lordſhip did riſe too faſt in theſe courſes, the times might be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for him, and he for them: Nay, <hi>I</hi> remember <hi>I</hi> was thus plain with him upon his voyage to the Ilands, when <hi>I</hi> ſaw every ſpring put forth ſuch actions of charge and provocation, that <hi>I</hi> ſaid to him, my Lord, when <hi>I</hi> came firſt unto you, <hi>I</hi> took you for a Phyſition that deſired to cure the diſeaſes of the State; but now <hi>I</hi> doubt you will be like thoſe Phyſitians, which can be content to keep their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients low, becauſe they would alwayes be in requeſt: which plainneſs he nevertheleſs took very well, as he had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar, and was <hi>patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſimus</hi>

                     <hi>veri,</hi> and aſſured me the caſe of the Realm required it: and I think this ſpeech of mine, and the like renewed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, pricked him to write that Apology which is in many mens hands.</p>
                  <p>But this difference in two points ſo main and material, bred in proceſs of time a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of privateneſs (as it is the manner of men feldom to communicate where they think their courſes not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) between his Lordſhip and my ſelf; ſo as I was not called nor adviſed with, for ſome yeer and a half before his Lordſhips going into <hi>Ireland</hi> as in former time: yet nevertheleſs touching his going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him expreſly and in a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112282:44"/>
ſet manner to deſire mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and counſel. At which time I did not onely diſſwade, but proteſt againſt his, going tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him with as much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and aſſeveration as I could, that abſence in that kinde would exulcerate the Queens minde, whereby it would not be poſſible for him to carry himſelf ſo, as to give her ſufficient contentment: nor for her to carry her ſelf ſo, as to give him ſufficient counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which would be ill for her, ill for him, and ill for the State. And becauſe I would omit no argument, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ſtood alſo upon the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the action: ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him out of Hiſtories, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was ſuch an enemy as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:112282:45"/>
the ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> or <hi>Britons,</hi> or <hi>Germanes</hi> were, and that we ſaw how the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had ſuch diſcipline to govern their ſoldiers, and ſuch donatives to encourage them, and the whole world in a manner to levy them; yet when they came to deal with enemies which placed their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city onely in liberty, and the ſharpneſs of their ſword, and had the natural and elemental advantages of woods, and boggs, and hardneſs of bodies, they ever found they had their hands full of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded that going over with ſuch expectation as he did, and through the churliſhneſs of the enterpriſe not like to anſwer it, would mightily dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his reputation; and many
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:112282:45"/>
other reaſons <hi>I</hi> uſed, ſo as <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> never in any thing in my life time dealt with him in like earneſtneſs by ſpeech, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by all the means <hi>I</hi> could deviſe. For <hi>I</hi> did as plainly ſee his overthrow chained as it were by deſtiny to that journey, as it is poſſible for a man to ground a judgement upon future contingents. But my Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his ear was open, yet his heart and reſolution was ſhut againſt that adviſe, whereby his ruine might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. After my Lords going, <hi>I</hi> ſaw then how true a Prophet <hi>I</hi> was, in regard of the evident alteration which naturally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Queens mind; and thereupon <hi>I</hi> was ſtill in watch to find the beſt occaſion that in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:112282:46"/>
weakneſs of my power I could either take or miniſter, to pull him out of the fire if it had been poſſible: and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, me thought I ſaw ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture thereof, which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended readily; a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity I think be-known to very few, and the which I do the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relate unto your Lordſhip, becauſe I hear it ſhould be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that while my Lord was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I revealed ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt him, or I cannot tell what; which if it were not a meer ſlander as the reſt is, but had any, though never ſo little colour, was ſurely upon this occaſion. The Queen one day at <hi>Noneſuch,</hi> a little (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) before <hi>Cuffes</hi> coming over, I attending on her, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112282:46"/>
a paſſionate diſtaſt of my Lords proceeding in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if they were unfortunate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judgement, contemptuous, and not without ſome private end of his own, and all that might be, and was pleaſed, as ſhe ſpake of it to many that ſhe truſted leaſt, ſo to fall into the like ſpeech with me; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I who was ſtill awake, and true to my grounds which I thought ſureſt for my Lords good, ſaid to this effect: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I know not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Eſtate, and I know this, that princes actions muſt have no abrupt periods or concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but otherwiſe I would think, that if you had my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> here with a white ſtaff in his hand, as my Lord of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:112282:47"/>
had, and continued him ſtill about you for ſociety to your ſelf, and for an honor and ornament to your attendance and Court in the eies of your people, and in the eies of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Ambaſſadors, then were he in his right element: for, to diſcontent him as you do, and yet to put arms and power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, may be a kinde of temptation to make him prove comberſome and unruly. And therefore if you would <hi>imponere bonum clauſulam,</hi> &amp; ſend for him and ſatisfie him with honor here neer you, if your affairs which (as <hi>I</hi> have ſaid) <hi>I</hi> am not acquainted with, will permit it, I think were the beſt way. Which courſe your Lordſhip knoweth, if it had been taken then all had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:112282:47"/>
been well, and no contempt in my Lords coming over, nor continuance of theſe jealouſies, which that employment of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> bred, and my Lord here in his former greatneſs. Well, the next news that <hi>I</hi> heard, was, that my Lord was came over, and that he was committed to his Chamber for leaving <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> without the Queens licence: this was at <hi>Noneſuch,</hi> where (as my duty was) <hi>I</hi> come to his Lorſhip, and talked with him privately about a quarter of an hour, and he asked mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the courſe was taken with him; <hi>I</hi> told him: My Lord, <hi>Nubecula eſt, cito tranſibit:</hi> it is but a miſt: but ſhal <hi>I</hi> tel your Lordſhip, it is as miſts are, if it go upwards, it may haps cauſe a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:112282:48"/>
ſhowre, if downwards it wil clear up. And therefore good my Lo. carry it ſo, as you take away by all means all ombrages and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſts from the Queen, &amp; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if I were worthy to adviſe you, (as I have been by your ſelf thought, and now your queſtion imports the continuance of that opinion) obſerve 3. points: Firſt, make not this ceſſation or peace which is concluded with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> as a ſervice wherein you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but as a ſhuffling up of a proſecution which was not very fortunate. Next, repreſent not to the Queen any neceſſity of eſtate, whereby as by a coercion or wrench, ſhe ſhould think her ſelf inforced to ſend you back into <hi>Ireland;</hi> but leave it to her. Thirdly, ſeek acceſſe <hi>importune,</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:112282:48"/>
                     <hi>oportune,</hi> ſeriouſly, ſportingly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way. I remember my Lord was willing to hear me, but ſpake very few words, and ſhaked his head ſometimes, as if he thought I was in the wrong; but ſure I am, he did juſt contrary in every one of theſe three points. After this, during the while ſince my Lord was committed to my Lord Keepers, I came divers times to the Queen, as I had uſed to do, about cauſes of her revenue and law buſineſs, as is well known: by reaſon of which acceſſes, according to the ordinary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Court, it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, that I was one of them that incenſed the Queen againſt my Lord of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches I cannot tell, nor I will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:112282:49"/>
not think that they grew any way from her Majeſties own ſpeeches, whoſe memory <hi>I</hi> will ever honour: if they did, ſhe is with God, and <hi>miſerum eſt ab il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis laedi, de quibus non posſis queri.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> muſt give this teſtimony to my Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> that one time in his houſe at the <hi>Savoy</hi> he dealt with me directly, and ſaid to me; Couſin, <hi>I</hi> hear it, but <hi>I</hi> beleeve it not, that you ſhould do ſome ill office to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> for my part <hi>I</hi> am meerly paſſive and not active in this action, and <hi>I</hi> follow the Q. and that heavily, and <hi>I</hi> lead her not; my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is one that in nature <hi>I</hi> could conſent with as well as with any one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; the Queen indeed is my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and <hi>I</hi> am her creature, <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:112282:49"/>
may not loſe her, and the ſame courſ I would wiſh you to take: whereupon I ſatisfied him how far I was from any ſuch minde. And as ſometimes it cometh to paſs, that mens inclinations are opened more in a toy, then in a ſerious matter: A little before that time, being about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> terme, her Majeſty had a purpoſe to dine at my lodge at <hi>Twicknam</hi> Park, at which time I had (though I profeſs not to be a Poet) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Sonnet directly tending &amp; alluding to draw on her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties reconcilement to my Lord, which I remember alſo I ſhewed to a great perſon, and one of my Lords neereſt friends, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it: this, though it be (as I ſaid) but a toy, yet it ſhewed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:112282:50"/>
plainly in what ſpirit I procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; that I was ready not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do my L. good offices, but to publiſh and declare my ſelf for him; and never was ſo ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of any thing in my life time, as I was to have carried ſome token or favour from her Majeſty to my Lord, uſing all the art I had, both to procure her Majeſty to ſend, and my ſelf to be the meſſenger: for as to the former I feared not to alledge to her, that this proceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my Lord, was a thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people very implau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and therefore wiſhed her Majeſty however ſhe did, yet to diſcharge her ſelf of it; and to lay it upon others, and therefore that ſhe ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix her proceeding with ſome
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:112282:50"/>
immediate graces from her ſelf, that the world might take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her Princely nature and goodneſs, leſt it ſhould alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the hearts of her people from her, which <hi>I</hi> did ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, knowing wel that if ſhe once relented to ſend or viſit, thoſe demonſtrations would prove matter of ſubſtance for my Lords good. And to draw that employment upon my ſelf, I adviſed her Majeſty, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God ſhould move her to turn the light of her favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Lord, to make ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to him thereof: that her Majeſty if ſhe did it not in perſon, would at the leaſt uſe ſome ſuch mean as might not intitle themſelves to any part of the thanks, as perſons that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:112282:51"/>
were thought mighty with her, to work her, or to bring her about; but to uſe ſome ſuch as could not be thought but a meer conduct of her own goodneſs: but I could never prevail with her, though I am perſwaded ſhe ſaw plainly whereat I level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but ſhe plainly had me in jealouſie, that I was not hers intirely, but ſtill had inward and deep reſpects towards my Lord, more then ſtood at that time with her will and pleaſure. About the ſame time I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an anſwer of mine in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which had ſome affinity with my Lords cauſe, which though it grew from me, went after about in others names. For her Majeſty being mightily incenſed with that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:112282:51"/>
book which was dedicated to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> being a ſtory of the firſt year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, thinking it a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prelude to put into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples head boldneſs and faction, ſaid, She had an opinion, that there was treaſon in it, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if I could not finde any places in it, that might be drawn within caſe of treaſon: whereto I anſwered; for treaſon ſurely I found none, but for fellony ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many. And when her Majeſty haſtily asked me wherein; I told her, the Author had commited, very apparent theft, for he had taken moſt of the ſentences of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> and tranſlated them into Engliſh, and put them into his text. And another time
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:112282:52"/>
when the Qu. would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it was his writing whoſe name was to it, but that it had ſome more miſchievous Author, and ſaid with great indignation, that ſhe would have him racked to produce his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; I replyed, Nay, Madam, he is a Doctor, never rack his perſon, but rack his ſtile; let him have pen, ink, and paper, and help of books, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to continue the Story where it breaketh off, and I will undertake by collecting the ſtiles, to judge whether he were the Author or no. But for the main matter, ſure <hi>I</hi> am, when the Qu. at any time asked mine opinion of my Lords caſe, I ever in one tenor, ſaid unto her: that they were faults which the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:112282:52"/>
Law might terme Contempts, becauſe they were the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her particular directions and inſtructions: but then what defence might be made of them, in regard of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt the perſon had in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties favour, in regard of the greatneſs of his place, and the ampleneſs of his Commiſſion; in regard of the nature of the buſineſs being action of war, which in common caſes cannot be tyed to ſtrictneſs of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in regard of the diſtance of the place, having alſo a ſea between, that demands and commands, muſt be ſubject to winde and weather; in regard of a councel of State in <hi>Ireland</hi> which he had at his back to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow his actions upon, and laſtly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:112282:53"/>
in regard of a good intention that he would alledge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which I told her in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions was held to be a ſufficient diſpenſation for Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, much more for Princes. In all theſe regards, I beſought her Majeſty to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed again and again, how ſhe brought the cauſe into any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick queſtion: nay, I went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I told her, my Lord was an eloquent and wel ſpoken man, and beſides his eloquence of nature or art, he had an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of accident which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them both, which was the pity and benevolence of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and therefore that when he ſhould come to his anſwer for himſelf, I doubted his words would have ſo unequal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:112282:53"/>
paſſage above theirs that ſhould charge him, as would not be for her Majeſties honor; and therefore wiſhed the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might be, that they might wrap it up privately between themſelves, and that ſhe would reſtore my Lord to his former attendance, with ſome addition of honour to take away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. But this I wil never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that I did ſhew no approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally of his being ſent back again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> both becauſe it would have carried a repugnancy with my former diſcourſe, and becauſe I was in mine own heart fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was not good nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Queen, nor for the State, nor for himſelf: and yet I did not diſſwade it neither, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:112282:54"/>
left it ever as <hi>locus lubricus.</hi> For this particularity I do well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that after your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was named for the place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not long before your going, it pleaſed her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at <hi>White Hall</hi> to ſpeak to me of that nomination: at which time I ſaid to her: Surely, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if you mean not to imploy my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> thither again, your Majeſty cannot make a better choiſe, and was going on to ſhow ſome reaſon, and her Majeſty interrupted me with great paſſion: <hi>Eſſex!</hi> (ſaid ſhe) whenſoever I ſend <hi>Eſſex</hi> back again into <hi>Ireland,</hi> I will marry you, claim it of me: whereunto I ſaid; Well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I will releaſe that contract if his going be for the good of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:112282:54"/>
your State. Immediately after the Queen had thought of a courſe (which was alſo executed to have ſomewhat publiſhed in the Star-chamber, for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the world touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his reſtraint, and my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> not to be called to it, but occaſion to be taken by reaſon of ſome Libels then diſperſed; which when her Majeſty propounded unto me, I was utterly againſt it; and told her plainly; that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would ſay, that my Lord was wounded upon his back, and that juſtice had her balance taken from her, which ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of an accuſation and defence, with many other quick and ſignificant tearms to that purpoſe: inſomuch that I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:112282:55"/>
remember I ſad, that my Lord <hi>in foro famae</hi> was too hard for her; and therefore wiſhed her as I had done before, to wrap it up privately. And certainly I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her at that time, which was rare with me: for I call to mind that both the <hi>Chriſtmas, Lent,</hi> and <hi>Eaſter</hi> Terme following, though I came divers times to her upon Law buſineſs yet me thought her face and maner was not ſo clear and open to me, as it was at the firſt. And ſhe did directly charge me, that I was abſent that day at the Star-chamber, which was very true; but I alleged ſom in diſpoſition of body to excuſe it: and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time aforeſaid, there was <hi>altum ſilentium</hi> from her to me touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:112282:55"/>
But towards the end of Eaſter terme, her Majeſty brake with me, and told me that ſhe had found my words tru, for that the proceeding in the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had done no good, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindled factious bruits (as ſhe termed them) then quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and therefore that ſhe was determined now for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the world, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt my-Lord in the Star-chamber by an informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ore tenus,</hi> and to have my Lo. brought to his anſwer: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſhe ſaid, ſhe would aſſure me that whatſoever ſhe did, ſhould be towards my L. <hi>ad caſtigatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; non ad deſtructionem,</hi> as indeed ſhe had often repeated the ſame phraſe before: whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſaid (to the end utterly to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:112282:56"/>
divert her:) Madam, if you will have me ſpeak to you in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſpeak to you as Frier <hi>Bacons</hi> head ſpake, that ſaid firſt, <hi>Time is,</hi> and then, <hi>Time was,</hi> and <hi>Time would never be;</hi> for certainly (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> it is now far to late, the matter is cold and hath taken too much wind; where at ſhe ſeemed again offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and roſe from me, and that reſolution for a while continued; and after, in the beginning of Midſomer tearm, <hi>I</hi> attending her, and finding her ſetled in that reſolution (which <hi>I</hi> heard of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo otherwiſe) ſhe falling upon the like ſpeech, it is true, that ſeeing no other remedy, <hi>I</hi> ſaid to her ſlightly, Why, Madam, if you wil needs hav a proceeding, you were beſt have it in ſome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:112282:56"/>
ſuch ſort as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpake of his miſtreſs, <hi>Eſt aliquid luce patente minus,</hi> to make a counſel table matter of it, and there an end; which ſpeech again ſhe ſeemed to take in ill part, but yet <hi>I</hi> think it did good at that time, and helped to divert that courſe of proceeding by information in the Star-chamber. Nevertheleſs afterwards it pleas'd her to make a more ſolemn matter of the proceeding, and ſome few daies after when order was given that the matter ſhould be heard at <hi>York</hi> houſ, before an aſſembly of Councellers, Peers, and Judges, &amp; ſome audience of men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be admitted: and then did ſome principal Councellers ſend for us of the learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and notifie her Majeſties
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:112282:57"/>
pleaſure unto us, ſave that it was ſaid to me openly by one of them, that her Majeſty was not yet reſolved whether ſhe would have me forborn in the buſineſs or no. And hereupon might ariſe that other ſiniſter and untrue ſpeech that I hear is raiſed of me, how I was a ſuter to be uſed againſt my Lo. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at that time: for it is very true, that I that knew well what had paſſed between the Queen and me, and what occaſion I had given her both of diſtaſt and diſtruſt, in croſſing her diſpoſition, by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſteadfaſtly for my L. of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> and ſuſpecting it alſo to be a ſtratagem ariſing from ſome particular emulation, I writ to her two or three words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, ſignifying to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:112282:57"/>
that if ſhe would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpare me in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſe, out of the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhe took of my obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, I ſhould reckon it for own of her greateſt favors: but otherwiſe deſiring her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to think that I knew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of duties, &amp; that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obligation whatſoever to any ſubject could ſupplant or weaken that entireneſs of duty that I did ow &amp; bear to her and her ſervice; &amp; this was the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſute I made, being a reſpect no man that had his wits could hav omitted: but nevertheleſs I had a further reach in it, for I judged that daies work would be a full period of any bitternes or harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the Queen and my Lord, and therefore if I declared
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:112282:58"/>
my ſelf fully according to her minde at that time, which could not do my Lord any manner of prejudice, <hi>I</hi> ſhould keep my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with her ever after, whereby to do my Lord ſervice. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next news that <hi>I</hi> heard, was, that we were all ſent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that her Majeſties pleaſure was, we all ſhould have parts in the buſineſs; and the Lords falling into diſtribution of our parts, it was allotted to me, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſet forth ſome undutiful carriages of my Lord, in giving occaſion and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a ſeditious Pamphlet, as it was termed, which was dedicated unto him, which was the book before mentioned of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>I</hi> replyed to that allotment,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:112282:58"/>
and ſaid to their Lordſhips, that it was an old matter, and had no manner of coherence with the reſt of the charge, being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therfore that <hi>I</hi> having been wronged by bruits before, this would expoſe me to them more; and it would be ſaid, <hi>I</hi> gave in evidence mine own tales. It was anſwered again with good ſhew, that becauſe it was conſidered how <hi>I</hi> ſtood ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that part was thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for me, which did him leaſt hurt: for that whereas all the reſt was matter of charge and accuſation, this onely was but matter of caveat and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherewith though <hi>I</hi> was in mine one minde little ſatisfied, becauſe <hi>I</hi> knew well a man were

better to be charged with ſome faults, then admoniſhed of ſome others: yet the concluſion bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Queens pleaſure directly, <hi>volens nolens,</hi> I could not avoid that part that was laid upon me; which part if in the delivery I did handle not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly (though no man before me did in ſo clear tearms free my Lord from all diſloyalty as <hi>I</hi> did) that your Lordſhip know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, muſt be aſcribed to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour duty I did ow to the Queens fame and honour in a publick proceeding, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the intention I had to uphold my ſelf in credit and ſtrength with the Queen, the better to be able to do my Lord good offices afterwards: for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as this day was paſt, I loſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:112282:59"/>
no time, but the very next day following (as I remember) I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her Majeſty, fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try and put in ure my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavor (ſo far as I in my weaknes could give furtherance) to bring my Lord again ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Court and favour, and knowing (as I ſuppoſed at leaſt) how the Queen was to be uſed, I thought that to make her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the matter went well then, was the way to make her leave off there; and I remember well, I ſaid to her, you have now Madam obtained victory over two things which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Princes in the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at their wills ſubdue: the one is over Fame, the other is over a great minde: for ſurely the world is now (I hope) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:112282:60"/>
well ſatisfied; &amp; for my Lord, he did ſhew that humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards your Majeſty, as <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded he was never in his life time more fit for your favor then he is now: therefore if your Majeſty will not marre it by lingring, but give over at the beſt, and now you have made ſo good a full point, receive him again with tenderneſs, <hi>I</hi> ſhall then think that all that is paſt, is for the beſt. Whereat <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſhe took exceeding great contentment, and did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iterate and put me in minde, that ſhe had ever ſaid, that her proceedings ſhould be <hi>ad repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem,</hi> and not <hi>adruinam,</hi> as who ſaith, that now was the time <hi>I</hi> ſhould well perceive, that that ſaying of hers ſhould prove
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:112282:60"/>
true. And further ſhe willed me to ſet down in writing all that paſſed that day. <hi>I</hi> obeyed her commandment, and within ſome few daies brought her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the narration, which <hi>I</hi> did read unto her at 2 ſeveral after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons: and when <hi>I</hi> came to that part that ſet forth my Lords own anſwer, (which was my principal care) <hi>I</hi> do well bear in mind, that ſhe was extrordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moved with it, in kindneſs and relenting towards my Lord, and told me afterwards (ſpeaking how well <hi>I</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my Lords part) that ſhe perceived old love would not eaſily be forgotten: wherto <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſuddenly, that <hi>I</hi> hoped ſhe meant that by her ſelf. But in concluſion <hi>I</hi> did adviſe her,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:112282:61"/>
that now ſhe had taken a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the matter to her ſelf, that ſhe would let it go no further: for, Madam, (ſaid I) the fire blazeth well already, what ſhould you tumble it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it may pleaſe you keep a convenienc with your ſelf in this caſe: for ſince your expreſs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was, there ſhould be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter nor clarke to take this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nor no record or memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial made up of the proceeding, why ſhould you now do that popularly, which you would not admit to be done judicially? Whereupon ſhe did agree, that that writing ſhould be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and I think there were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſons that ever ſaw it. But from this time forth during the whole latter end of that ſummer
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:112282:61"/>
while the Court was at <hi>Nonſuch</hi> and <hi>Otlands,</hi> I made it my task and ſcope to take and give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for my Lords reintegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his fortune: which my intention I did alſo ſignifie to my Lord, aſſoon as ever he was at his liberty; whereby <hi>I</hi> might without peril of the Queens indignation write to him, and having received from his Lordſhip a courteous and loving acceptation of my good will and indeavours, I did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it in all my acceſſes to the Queen, which were very many at that time, and purpoſely ſought and wrought upon other variable pretences, but onely and chiefly for that purpoſe. And on the otherſide, I did not forbear to give my Lord from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:112282:62"/>
time to time faithful advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what I found, and what I wiſhed. And I drew for him by his appointment ſome letters to her Majeſty, which though I knew well his Lordſhips gift and ſtile was far better then mine own, yet becauſe he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, alledging that by his long reſtraint he was grown al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a ſtranger to the Queens preſent conceipts, I was ready to perform it: and ſure I am, that for the ſpace of ſix weeks, or two months it proſpered ſo well, as I expected continually his reſtoring to his attendance. And I was never better welcom to the Queen, nor more made of, then when I ſpake fulleſt and boldeſt for him: in which kinde the particulars were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:112282:62"/>
many, whereof for an example I will remember to your Lordſhip one or two; as at one time I call to minde, her Majeſty was ſpeaking of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that undertook to cure, or at leaſt to eaſe my brother of his gout, and asked me how it went forwards; and I told her Majeſty, that at the firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good by it, but after in the courſe of his cure he found himſelf at a ſtay or rather worſe: the Queen ſaid again, <hi>I</hi> will tell you <hi>Bacon</hi> the error of it, the manner of theſe Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and eſpecially theſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks is to continue one kinde of medicine, which at the firſt is proper, being to draw out the ill humor, but after they have not the diſcretion to change
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:112282:63"/>
their medicine, but apply ſtill drawing medicines, when they ſhould rather intend to cure and corroborate the part. Good Lord, Madam, (ſaid I) how wiſely and aptly can you ſpeak and diſcern of Phyſick miniſtred to the body, and conſider not that there is the like occaſion of Phyſick miniſtred to the minde: as now in the caſe of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> your Princely word ever was, that you intended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to reform his minde, and not ruine his fortune: I know well you cannot but think that you have drawn the humor ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and therefore it were more then time, and it were but for doubt of mortifying or exulcerating, that you did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and miniſter ſtrength and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:112282:63"/>
comfort unto him: for theſe ſame gradations of yours are fitter to corrupt then correct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mind of greatneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time <hi>I</hi> remember ſhe told me for news, that my Lord had written unto her ſome very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful letters, and that ſhe had been moved by them, and when ſhe took it to be the abundance of the heart, ſhe found it to be but a preparative to a ſuit for the renuing of his farme of ſweet wines: whereunto I replyed; O Madam, how doth your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty conſture theſe things, as if theſe two could not ſtand well together, which indeed nature hath planted in all creatures. For there are but two ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, the one towards <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the other towards <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:112282:64"/>
That to Perfection, as the Iron con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: that to Preſervation, as the Vine will creep towards a ſtake or prop that ſtands by it, not for any love to the ſtake, but to uphold it ſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Madam, you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh my Lords deſire to do you ſervice, is as to his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be born for: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his deſire to obtain this thing of you, is but for a ſuſtentation. And not to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars like unto theſe, it was at the ſelf ſame time that I did draw with my Lords privity, and by his appointment, two letters, the one written as from my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other as an anſwer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:112282:64"/>
from my Lord, both to be by me in ſecret manner ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Queen, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Lord very ſtrangely to mention at the bar: the ſcope of which were but to repreſent and picture forth unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty my Lords minde to be ſuch, as I knew her Majeſty would faineſt have had it, which letters whoſoever ſhall ſee, (for they cannot now be retracted or altered, being by reaſon of my brothers, or his Lordſhips ſervants delivery, long ſince come into diverſe hands) let him judge, eſpecially if he knew the Queen, and do remember thoſe times, whether they were not the labors of one that ſought to bring the Queen about for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his good. The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:112282:65"/>
troth is, that the iſſue of all his dealing grew to this, that the Queen by ſome ſlackneſs of my Lords, as I imagine, liked him worſe and worſe, and grew more incenſed towards him. Then, ſhe remembring belike the continual, and inceſſant, and confident ſpeeches and courſes that <hi>I</hi> had held on my Lords ſide, became utterly alienated from me, and for the ſpace of (at leaſt) three moneths, which was between <hi>Michaelmas</hi> and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years tide following, would not ſo much as look on me, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away from me with expreſs and purpoſe-like diſcountenance whereſoever ſhee ſaw me: and at ſuch time as I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak with her about Law buſineſs, ever ſent me
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:112282:65"/>
forth very ſlight refuſals, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is moſt true, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Newyears tide I deſired to ſpeak with her; and being admitted to her, I dealt with her plainly, and ſaid: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I ſee you withdraw your favor from me and now I have loſt many friends for your ſake, I ſhall loſe you too: you have put me like one of thoſe that the Frenchmen call <hi>Enfans perdus,</hi> that ſerve on foot before horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo have you put me into matters of envy without place, or without ſtrength: and I know at Cheſs a pawn before the King, is ever much plaid upon: a great many love me not, becauſe they think <hi>I</hi> have been againſt my Lord of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and you love me not, becauſe you
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:112282:66"/>
know I have been for him: yet will I never repent me, that I have dealt in ſimplicity of heart towards you both, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of cautions to my ſelf: and therefore <hi>vivus videnſque pereo.</hi> If I do break my neck, I ſhall do it in a manner as Maſter <hi>Dorrington</hi> did it, which walked on the battlements of the Church many daies, and took a view &amp; ſurvey where he ſhould fall: and ſo, Madam, (ſaid I) I am not ſo ſimple, but that I take a proſpect of mine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, onely I thought I would tel you ſo much, that you may know that it was faith, and not folly that brought me into it, &amp; ſo I will pray for you. Upon which ſpeeches of mine uttered with ſome paſſion, it is true her
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:112282:66"/>
Majeſty was exceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and accumulated a number of kind &amp; gratious words upon me, and willed me to reſt upon this, <hi>Gratia mea ſufficit,</hi> and a number of other ſenſible &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der words and demonſtrations, ſuch as more could not be; but as touching my Lord of <hi>Eſſex, ne verbum quidem.</hi> Whereupon I departed, reſting then determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to meddle no more in the matter; as that, that I ſaw would overthrow me, and not be able to do him any good. And thus I made mine own peace with mine own confidence at that time; and this was the laſt time I ſaw her Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eight of <hi>February,</hi> which was the day of my Lord of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> his misfortune, after which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:112282:67"/>
time for that <hi>I</hi> perform at the bar in my publick ſervice, your Lordſhip knoweth by the rules of duty, that <hi>I</hi> was to do it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and without prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but for any putting my ſelf into it, <hi>I</hi> proteſt before God, <hi>I</hi> never moved neither the Queen, nor any perſon living concerning my being uſed in the ſervice, either of evidence or examination: but it was meerly laid upon me with the reſt of my fellows. And for the time which paſſed, I mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the arraignment and my Lords ſuffering, <hi>I</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but I was once with the Qu. at what time though <hi>I</hi> durſt not deal directly for my Lord as things then ſtood; yet generally <hi>I</hi> did both commend
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:112282:67"/>
her Majeſties mercie, terming it to her as an excellent balm that did continually diſtil from her Soveraign hands, and made an excellent odour in the ſenſes of her people: and not onely ſo, but I took hardineſs to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, not the fact, for that I durſt not; but the danger, telling her that if ſome baſe or cruel minded perſons had entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an action, it might have cauſed much blood and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion: but it appeared well they were ſuch as knew not how to play the Malefactors, and ſome other words which I now omit. And as for the reſt of the carriage of my ſelf in that ſervice, I have many hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable witneſſes that can tel, that the next day after my Lords
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:112282:68"/>
arraignment, by my diligence and information touching the quality and nature of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, ſix of nine were ſtayed, which otherwiſe had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, I bringing their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips letter for their ſtay, after the Jury was ſworn to paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; ſo neer it went: and how careful I was, and made it my part, that whoſoever was in trouble about that matter, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as ever his caſe was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known and defined of, might not continue in reſtraint, but be ſet at liberty: and many other parts, which I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of ſtood with the duty of an honeſt man. But indeed I will not deny for the caſe of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the Q. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding my opinion of it, I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:112282:68"/>
told her, I thought it was as hard as many of the reſt: but what was the reaſon? becauſe at that time I had ſeen only his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and had never been preſent at any examination of his: and the matter ſo ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I had been very untrue to my ſervice, if I had not delivered that opinion. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon a re-examination of ſom that charged him, who weakned their own teſtimony; &amp; eſpecially hearing himſelf <hi>viva voce,</hi> I went inſtantly to the Q. out of the ſoundneſs of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp; not regarding what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I had formerly delivered, told her Majeſty, I was ſatisfied and reſolved in my conſcience, that for the reputation of the action, the plot was to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:112282:69"/>
the action further by him in reſpect of his place, then they had indeed any intereſt or intelligence with him. It is very true alſo, about that time her Majeſty taking a liking of my pen, upon that which I had done before concerning the proceeding at <hi>York houſe,</hi> and likewiſe upon ſome other declarations, which in former times by her appointment <hi>I</hi> put in writing, commanded me to pen that book, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for the better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world: which <hi>I</hi> did, but ſo, as never Secretary had more perticular, and expreſs directions and inſtructions in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very point how to guide my hand in it: and not onely ſo, but after that <hi>I</hi> had made a firſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:112282:69"/>
draught thereof and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to certain principal Councellors, by her Majeſties appointment, it was peruſed, weighed, cenſured, altered, and and made almoſt anew, writing according to their Lordſhips better conſideration, wherein their Lordſhips and my ſelf both were as religious and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of truth, as deſirous of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: and my ſelf indeed gave onely words and form of ſtile in purſuing their direction. And after it had paſſed their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it was again exactly peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Queen her ſelf, and ſome alterations made again by her appointment: nay, and after it was ſet to print, the Queen, who as your Lordſhip knoweth, as ſhe was excellent

And this my good Lord, to my furtheſt remembrance, is all that paſſed wherein I had part, which I have ſet down as neer as I could in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words and ſpeeches that were uſed, not becauſe they are worthy the repetition, I mean thoſe of mine own; but

                  <p>So far then as can be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by my humane judgment, Dread Soveraign, you may judge, that the happineſs of your preſent Eſtate, can no ways be encumbred with one of theſe two means, <hi>(viz)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either by your<list>

                  </p>
                  <p>Your ſtrong and Factious Subjects are the Papiſts, ſtrong I account them, both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and nature; for by number they are able to raiſe a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and by their natural and mutual confidence, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they may ſoon bring to paſs an uniting with Forraign
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:112282:76"/>
Enemies; Factious I call them, becauſe they are diſcontented, Of whom in all reaſon of State your Majeſty muſt determine; if you will ſuffer them to be ſtrong to make them the better content, or if you will diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, by making them weaker; for what the mixture of ſtrength and diſcontent are in genders, there needs no Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm to prove.</p>
                  <p>To ſuffer them to be ſtrong with hope, that with reaſon they will be contented, carrieth with it in my opinion, but a fairer enamling of a terrible danger.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, mens natures are not only to ſtrive againſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſmart, but to revenge by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt injury, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:112282:76"/>
ſo well contented hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which cannot be ſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a pledg to your Majeſty, but that when opportunity ſhal flatter them, they will remem.+ber, not the after ſlacking, but the former binding, and ſo much the more when they ſhall imagine this relenting rather to proceed from fear, the which is the poyſon of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Subject thinks the Prince doth any thing more out of fear then favour. And therefore the Romans would rather abide the uttermoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, then by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be brought to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Again, for to make them contented abſolutely, I do not ſee how your Majeſty either in Conſcience will do or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:112282:77"/>
in policy may do it, ſince you cannot throughly diſcontent your faithful Subjects, and to faſten an unreconciled love, with the loſing of certain love, is to build a houſe with the ſale of lands; ſo much the more in that your Majeſty is imbarqued in the Proteſtant cauſe, as in many reſpects by your Majeſty it cannot be with any ſafety abandoned, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo long time the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruments both of your Councel and Power; and to make them half content, and half diſcontent, methinks car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it as deceitful a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reaſon as can be, ſince there is no pain ſo ſmall, but if we can caſt it off, we will; and no man loves one the better for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:112282:77"/>
giving him the Baſtinado though with never ſo little a Cudgel.</p>
                  <p>But the courſe of the moſt Wiſe, moſt Politick, and beſt grounded Eſtate, hath ever been to make an aſſuredneſs of friendſhip, or to take away all power of enmity.</p>
                  <p>Yet, here muſt I diſtingiuſh between diſcontent and diſpair, for it ſufficeth to waken the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; but there is no way but to kill deſperates (which in ſuch a number as they are) were as hard and difficult, as impious and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, though they muſt be diſcontented, yet, I would not have them deſperate; for among many deſperate men, it is like ſome one will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:112282:78"/>
bring forth ſome deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, conſidering that the urging of the oath, muſt needs in ſome degree beget de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, ſince therein he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think (as without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace of God he cannot think otherwiſe) or elſe become a Traitor, which before ſome hurt done ſeemeth hard: I humbly ſubmit this to your Excellent conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with as much ſincerity of your Majeſties Perſon and State, and more ſatisfaction for them, it were not better to leav the oath to this ſenſe, That whoſoever would not bear Arms againſt all forraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and namely, the Pope, that ſhould any way invade your
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:112282:78"/>
Majeſties Dominions, he ſhould be a Traytor; for hereof this commodity will enſue; that thoſe Papiſts (as I think moſt Papiſts would that ſhould take this oath) would be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the great mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which now is betwixt the Pope and them, by reaſon of their afflictions for him: And ſuch Prieſts as would refuſe that oath then no tongue could ſay for ſhame, that they ſuffer for Religion, if they did ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be objected, they would diſſemble and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with this oath; and that the oath would diſpence with them in that caſe. Even ſo may they with the preſent oath both diſſemble and equivocate, and alſo have the Popes diſpenſation
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:112282:79"/>
for the preſent oath, as well as for the other.</p>
                  <p>But this is certain, that whomſoever the conſcience, or fear of breaking an oath doth binde, him would that oath binde.</p>
                  <p>And that they make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an oath, the troubles, loſſes, and diſgraces, that they ſuffer for refuſing the ſame, do ſufficiently teſtifie: and you know that the perjury of either oath is equal.</p>
                  <p>So then the fartheſt point to be ſought for their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is but to avoid their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. How to weaken their contentment is the next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:112282:79"/>
                     <hi>Weakned they may be, by two means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, By leſſening their number.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By taking away from their force, their number will eaſily be leſſened, by the means of careful and diligent Preachers in each Pariſh to that end appointed; And eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by good School-maſters, and bringers up of their youth; the former by converting them after their fall; and the latter, by preventing them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into their errors. For Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (becauſe their own) groweth a great queſtion; I am provoked to lay at your Highneſs feet my opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the preciſer ſort.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Proteſting to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:112282:80"/>
and your ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that I am not given over, no, nor ſo much as addicted to their preciſeneſs; therfore till I think, that you think otherwiſe, I am bold to think, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in theſe dangerous times, take a very ill and unadviſed courſe in driving them from their cures; and this I think, for two cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it doth diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the reputation and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your power; when the Princes ſhal perceive, and know; that even in your Proteſtant Subjects (in whom conſiſteth all your force, ſtrength, and power) there is ſo great, and heart burning a diviſion, and how much reputation ſwayeth in theſe, and all other worldly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:112282:80"/>
actions; there is none ſo ſimple, as to be ignorant: and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves (though there be moſt manifeſt, and apparent diſcord between the Franciſcans and Dominicans, the Jeſuites, and other Orders or Religious perſons, eſpecially the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims:) Yet will they ſhake off none of them, becauſe in the maine point of Popery they all agree, and hold together: And ſo far they may freely brag and vaunt of their unity.</p>
                  <p>The other reaſon is, becauſe in truth, (in their opinions) though they are overſqueamiſh, and nice, and more ſcrupulous then they need; yet with their careful catechizing, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Preaching, they bring forth that fruit which your
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:112282:81"/>
moſt Excellent Majeſty is to deſire, and wiſh, namely, the leſſning and diminiſhing the Papiſtical numbers.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in this time your Majeſty hath eſpecial cauſe to uſe and imploy them, if it were but as <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (that excellent Emperor) did uſe and employ the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſouldiers againſt the Pope, becauſe he was well aſſured, and certainly knew, that they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would not ſpare his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>And for thoſe objections what they would do, if once they got a full and entire Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they are <hi>inter remota &amp; in certa mala,</hi> and therefore, <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia &amp; certa,</hi> to be firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:112282:81"/>
As for School-maſters (they may be a principal means of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their number) the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and pittiful abuſes of them are eaſie to be ſeen, ſince the greateſt number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts is of very young men; but your Majeſty may prevent that bud, and may uſe therein not onely a Pious and Godly means, in making the Parents of every Shire to ſend their children to be vertuouſly brought up at a certain place, for that end appointed; but you ſhall alſo (if it pleaſe your Majeſty) put in practice a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtratagem, uſed by Certo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Spaine,</hi> by chooſing ſuch fit and convenient places for the ſame, as may ſurely be at your devotion; and by this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:112282:82"/>
means you ſhall under colour of education, have them as hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Parents fidelities, that have any power in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and by this way their number will quickly be leſſned; for I account death doth no wayes leſſen them, ſince we find by experince, that death worketh no ſuch effect; but that like <hi>Hydra's heads,</hi> upon cutting off one, ſeven growes up; perſecution being accounted as the badg of the Church; and therfore they ſhould never have the honour to take any pretence of Martyrdom in <hi>England,</hi> where the fulneſs of blood, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart is ſuch, that they will even for ſhameful things go bravely to death; much more when they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:112282:82"/>
to climb Heaven, and that vice of obſtinacy ſeems to the common people a divine conſtancy.</p>
                  <p>But for my part I wiſh no leſſning of their number, but by preaching, and of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers education under good School-maſters; there taking away of their forces, is as wel by Peace's Authority, as of War proviſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their Peace's Authority ſtandeth, either in Offices, or Tenantries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For their Offices, their credit w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:112282:83"/>
their congregation according to the doctrine received generally into this Realm.</p>
                  <p>For their Tenantries, this conceit I have thought upon, (which I ſubmit to your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piercing judgment) That your Majeſty in every Shire ſhould give ſtrict order, to ſome that are indeed truſty and religious Gentlemen; That whereas your Majeſty is given to underſtand that divers Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Landlords, do hardly uſe all ſuch of your people and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, (as being their tenants) do embrace and live after the authoriſed and true Religion; that therefore you do conſtitute and appoint to deal both with intreaty and authority, (pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as others do) that they be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:112282:83"/>
not thruſt out of their living, nor otherwiſe unreaſonably mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted.</p>
                  <p>This would greatly bind the Commons hearts unto you (on whom indeed conſiſteth the power and ſtrength of your Realm) and it will make them much the leſs, or nothing at all depend upon their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords.</p>
                  <p>And although there may hereby grow ſome wrong, which the Tenants upon that confidence may offer to their Landlords; yet, thoſe wrongs are very eaſily, even, with one wink of your Majeſty redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and are nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to the danger, of having many thouſands depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the adverſe party.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:112282:84"/>
Their Wars proviſion, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count men and munition, of whom in ſome, I could wiſh no man, either great or ſmal, ſhould ſo much as be trained up in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Muſters; except his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if ſuch order were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that conſidering they were not put to the labour and charge of muſtering and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; therefore their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be more and more narrowly looked into: This
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:112282:84"/>
would breed a chilneſs unto their fervour of ſuperſtition; eſpecially in popular reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who if they love <hi>Egypt,</hi> is chiefly for the fleſh pots, ſo that me-thinks this temper ſhould well agree with your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the mercifulneſs of your nature.</p>
                  <p>For to compel them you would not; kill them you would not; ſo in reaſon to truſt them you ſhould not; truſt being in no caſe to be uſed, but where the truſt is of one minde, with the truſting reaſon, which ever commandeth every wiſe man to fly and avoyd that ſhamefac'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the Greeks; which is, not to ſeem to doubt them, which give juſt occaſion of doubt.</p>
                  <p>

This ruined <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſon of Great <hi>Alexander;</hi> for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had moſt manifeſt reaſons, and evident arguments to induce him to ſuſpect his ill ſervant <hi>Poliperchon,</hi> yet, out of the confidence he had of him, and the experience he had of his former Loyalty, he would make proviſion accordingly, becauſe, he would not ſeem ſo much as to miſdoubt or ſuſpect him; and ſo by that means he was murthered by him.</p>
                  <p>But the knot of this diſcourſe is; That if your Majeſty finde it reaſonable of the one ſide, by relenting the rigour of the oath, and of the other by diſabling the unſound Subjects, you ſhall neither execute any, but very Traytors, in all mens opinions
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:112282:85"/>
and conſtructions; nor yet put faith and confidence in thoſe, even for their own ſakes which muſt be faithful.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral part of my diſcourſe, is, the conſideration of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign enemies, which may prove either able or willing to hurt you; and thoſe are <hi>Scotland,</hi> for his pretence and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and <hi>Spain,</hi> for his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and power; as for <hi>France,</hi> I ſee not why it ſhould not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be made a friend, not an enemy; for though he agree not with your Majeſty, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſcience and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet, <hi>in hoc termino,</hi> he doth agree, that he feareth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> and therefore, that may ſoder the link which

                  <p>Firſt; becauſe in Religion, he is ſo much the Popes, and the Pope in Policy ſo much his, as that the minde of Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the power of King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> will, nor can compaſs, or bring us in all probability to be expected, himſelf being a Prince, whoſe cloſet hath brought forth geater victories,

But this offers a great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it bebetter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Amity, or ſtop the courſe of his Enmity; as of a great Lion, whether it be more wiſdom, to truſt to the taming of him, or tying of him.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, If you have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of League, you ſee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what aſſurance, or at leaſt what likelihood you may have, that he will obſerve the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:112282:89"/>
Secondly, that in a Parlying ſeaſon it it be not as a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto him the ſooner to overthrow the low Countries, which hitherto hath been as a counter-ſcarff to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But if you doe not league, then your Majeſty is to think upon means for ſtrengthening your ſelf and weakning of him, and therein your own ſtrength is to be tendered both at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p>For your home ſtrength in all reverence I leave it as the thing which contains in effect the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſideration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>For your ſtrength abroad, it it muſt be in joyning in good
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:112282:90"/>
Confederacy, or at leaſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with thoſe that would willingly embrace the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Truly, not ſo much as the Turk and Morocco, but at ſome time they may ſerve your Majeſty to great purpoſe, but from <hi>Florence, Ferrara,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Venice,</hi> I think your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might reap great aſſurance and ſervice, for undoubtedly they fear his frauds, and abhor his greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>And for the Dutch and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Princes being in Effect of your Majeſties Religion, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think but their alliance may be firm, and their power not to be contemned, even the Countenance of united powers doth much in matters of State.</p>
                  <p>For the weakning of him, I
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:112282:90"/>
would (I muſt confeſs from my heart) wiſh that your Majeſty did not ſpare throughly and manifeſtly both upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Low-Countries, which would give themſelves unto you; and rather take him while he hath one hand free and at liberty, then both of them ſharply weaponed.</p>
                  <p>But if this ſeem fooliſh har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to your Majeſties wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet I dare not preſume to Councel (but beſeech) your Majeſty, that what, I ſay, your Majeſty (without warre) can give to the Low-Countries, you would vouchfafe to do it, ſince as King of <hi>Spain</hi> without the low Countries, he may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our skirts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but can never come to graſp
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:112282:91"/>
with you; but if he once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Low-Countries to an abſolute ſubjection, I know not what limit any man of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ſet unto his greatneſs: divers wayes are to be tryed, among the reſt one, (not the worſt) in my opinion, might be to ſeek either the winning of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or at the leaſt to have the matter ſo handled, ſo as the jealouſie thereof may ariſe betwixt them, as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> did by the notable Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> for he practized, with him for offering the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> not ſo much with whom to joyn him, as to make his maſter ſuſpect him, for when I confider that <hi>Parma</hi> is a Roman by blood, a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:112282:91"/>
Prince born, placed in the place he hath by <hi>Don John,</hi> and maintained in it by the male-contents; whereunto the King hath rather yeelded of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then any other way.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When I remember the Cittadel of <hi>Pierenſa,</hi> kept by the Spaniards, and the apparent title of his Son <hi>Remutio</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> things hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be digeſted by an Italian ſtomack, I cannot ſee how ſuch a mind in ſuch a fortune can ſell it ſelf to a Forraign ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>The manner of dealing with him, ſhould be by ſome man of ſpirit, with the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors at <hi>Paris,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with his own father in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> both which are in their hearts mortal Enemies of the greatneſs of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:112282:92"/>
But theſe ſheets of Paper bare witneſs againſt me, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offered too tedious a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to your Majeſty, divers of which points, yet, as of mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the oath, the School hoſtages, the heartning of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and the dealing with the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> would require a more ample handling; but it is firſt, reaſon to know whether your Majeſty like of the ſtuff before it be otherwiſe trimmed.</p>
                  <p>For my ſelf, as I will then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love my opinions, when your Majeſty liketh them; ſo will I daily pray, That all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may be guided with as much Faith, as I have Zeal to your Majeſties Service, and that they may be followed with infinite ſucceſs.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt conſolations, it is not the leaſt to repreſent to a mans ſelf; like examples of Calamity in others. For examples give a quicker impreſſion then Arguments, and beſides, they certifie us that which the Scripture alſo tenders for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; That no new thing is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto us: This they do the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much the examples are liker in circumſtances to our own caſe, and more eſpecially, if they fall upon perſons that are greater and worthier then our ſelves: For as it ſavoureth of vanity to match our ſelves highly in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; ſo on the other ſide, it is a good ſound concluſion, That if our betters have ſuſtained the like
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:112282:94"/>
events, we have the leſs cauſe to be grieved.</p>
                  <p>In this kind of conſolation I have not been wanting to my ſelf, though as a Chriſtian I have taſted (through Gods great goodneſs) of higher remedies. Having therefore through the variety of my reading, ſet before me many examples, both of ancient and latter times; my thoughts I confeſs have chiefly ſtaid upon three particulars, as the moſt eminent &amp; the moſt reſembling All three perſons that had held chief places of Authority in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, all three ruined, not by war, or by any other diſaſter, but by juſtice and ſentence, as Delinquents and Criminals: All three famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, inſomuch as the remembrance of their calamity is now as to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but as a little picture of Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, remaining amongſt the faire and excellent Tables of their Acts and Works: And all three (if that were any thing to the matter) fit
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:112282:94"/>
examples to quench any mans am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of riſing again; for that they were every one of them reſtored with great glory, but to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruine and deſtruction, ending in a violent death. The men were <hi>Demoſthenes, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> perſons that I durſt not claim affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with, except the ſimilitude of our fortunes had contracted it. When I had caſt mine eyes upon theſe examples, I was carried on further to obſerve, how they did beare their fortunes, and principally how they did imploy their times, being baniſhed and diſabled for publick buſineſſe, to the end that I might learn by them, and that they might be as well my Counſellors as my Comforters. Whereupon I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pned to note, how diverſly their Fortunes wrought upon them, eſpecially in that point at which I did moſt aim, which was the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of their times and pens. In <hi>Cicero</hi> I ſaw, that during his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:112282:95"/>
(which was almoſt two years) he was ſo ſoftned and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he wrote nothing but a few Womaniſh Epiſtles. And yet in mine own opinion, he had leaſt reaſon of the three, to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: For that although it was judged, and judged by the higheſt kind of judgement, in form of a Statute, or Law, that hee ſhould be baniſhed, and his whole Eſtate confiſcated and ſeiſed, and his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes puld down; and that it ſhould be highly penal for any man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his Repeale: Yet his Caſe even then had no great blot of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, but it was thought but a tempeſt of popularity which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him. <hi>Demoſt henes</hi> contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though his caſe was foule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned for bribery, and not ſimple bribery, but bribery in the nature of Treaſon and Diſloyalty; yet nevertheles took ſo little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Fortune, as during his baniſhment, hee did much buſie
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:112282:95"/>
himſelfe, and entermedle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, and took upon him to counſel the State (as if he had been ſtil at the helm) by letters, as appears by ſome Epiſtles of his, which are extant. <hi>Seneca</hi> indeed, who was condemned for many Corruptions and crimes, and baniſhed into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Iſland, kept a mean; &amp; though his pen did not freeze, yet he abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from intruding into matters of buſineſs; but ſpent his time in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books of excellent argument and uſe for all Ages, though hee might have made better choyce (ſometimes) of his Dedications.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Examples confirmed mee much in a reſolution (whereunto I was otherwiſe inclined) to ſpend my time wholly in writing, &amp; to put forth that poor talent, or half talent or what it is that God hath given me. But revolving with my ſelf my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as wel thoſe which I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, as thoſe I have in hand, me thought they all went into the City
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:112282:96"/>
and none into the Temple; where, becauſe I found ſo great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I deſire to make ſome poor oblation: Therefore I have choſen an Argument mixt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Civill Conſiderations; and likewiſe mixt between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative and Active. This work, becauſe I was ever an enemy to flattering Dedications, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to you, in reſpect of our ancient and privat acquaintance. And becauſe amongſt the men of our times, I held you in eſpeciall Reverence.</p>
