            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Having thus ſhortly touched upon
ſuch precedent examples, as have fallen
in the vvay, in my poor obſervation,
I humbly crave pardon to offer up my
ſimple opinion what courſe may beſt be
had of proſecution of this urgent cauſe.
I conceive it not unfit, that vvith the
beſt of ſpeed, ſome of the chief Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarries
vvere ſent to the Ambaſſador by
vvay of advice, that they underſtanding
a notice of this information amongſt
the common people, that they cannot
but conceive a juſt fear of uncivil car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards his Lordſhip or his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
if any the leaſt incitement
ſhould ariſe; and therefore for quiet
of the State, and ſecurity of his perſon,
they vvere bound in love to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to reſtrain as vvell himſelf as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
until a further courſe be taken
by legal examination, vvhere this aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begun, the vvay they onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſecure to prevent the danger;
this fear in likelyhood vvill be the beſt
motive to induce the Ambaſſador to
make diſcovery of his intelligence, when
it ſhall be required: I conceive it then
moſt fit, that the <hi>Prince</hi> and your <hi>Grace</hi>
to morrow ſhould complain of this in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> and leaving it ſo to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65928:8"/>
advice and juſtice, to depart the Houſe,
the Lords at the inſtant to crave a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of ſome ſmall number of the
Commons, and ſo conclude of a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to be ſent to the Ambaſſador to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from him the charge and proofs;
the Perſons to be ſent, the two Speakers
of the two Houſes, vvith ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
company of either, to have their
Maces and enſigns of Office born brfore
them to the Ambaſſadors Gate, and then
forborn, to ſhew fair reſpect to the
Ambaſſadors, then to tell them that a
relation being made that day in open
<hi>Parliament</hi> of the former information to
the King by his Lordſhip, they vvere
deputed from both Houſes, the great
Councel of the Kingdom, to the vvhich,
by the fundamental Law of the State,
the chief care of the Kings ſafety and
public quiet is committed, they vvere
no leſs the high Court of Juſtice, or
<hi>Superſedeas</hi> to all others, for the examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and correcting all attempts of ſo
high a nature as this, if it carry truth;
That they regarded the honour of the
State, for the Catholicks immoderate
uſing of late the Lenity of Soveraign
<hi>Grace</hi> to the ſcandal and offence of too
many, and this aſperſion now newly
reflecting upon the <hi>Prince</hi> and others,
meeting vvth the former diſtaſte (which
all in publique conceive to make a plot
to breed a rupture between the King and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65928:9"/>
State, by that party maliciouſly layd)
hath ſo inflamed and ſharpned the minds
of moſt, that by the acceſs of people to
Term and Parliament, the City more
filled then uſual, and the time it ſelfe
neer <hi>May</hi> day (a time by cuſtom apted
more to licentious liberty then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
cannot but breed a juſt jealouſie
and fear of ſome diſorder likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of this information, if it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
taken up by a fair legal tryal
in that High Court: Neither want
there fearful examples in this kind in
the Ambaſſadors <hi>Genoa</hi> upon a far leſs
ground in the time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
is houſe demoliſhed by ſuch a ſeditious
tumult: The <hi>Parliament</hi> therefore, as
well to ſecure his Lordſhips perſon, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
and friends, from ſuch outrages,
to preſerve the honour of the State,
which needs muſt ſuffer blemiſh in ſuch
misfortunes, they were ſent thither to
require a fair diſcovery of the ground
that led his Lordſhip ſo to inform the
King, that they might ſo thereupon
provide in Juſtice and Honor, and that
the reverence they bear unto the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Maſter, may appear the more
by the mannerly carriage of his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
The two that are never imployed
but to the King alone, were at this
time ſent, and that if by negligence of
this fair acceptance, there ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
out any ſuch diſaſter and danger,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65928:9"/>
the World and they muſt juſtly judge
as his own fault: If upon the delivery
of this Meſſage the Ambaſſador ſhall
tell his charge, and diſcover his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
then there will be a plaine
ground for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to proceed in
Examination and Judgment; But if
(as I believe) he will refuſe it, then
is he <hi>Author Scandali</hi> both by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Civil Laws of this Realm, and
the <hi>Parliament</hi> may adjudge it falſe and
untrue, and declare by a public Act, the
<hi>Prince</hi> and your <hi>Grace</hi> innocent, as was
that of the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter, 2 Rich.</hi> 2.
and of <hi>York</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth his time,
then may the <hi>Parliament</hi> joyntly become
Petitioners to his Majeſty, firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
his Ambaſiador to his houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
his departure, until his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
be acquainted with his offence,
and aſwell for ſecurity as for further
practice to put a Guard upon the place,
and to make a <hi>Proclamation</hi> that none of
the Kings Subjects ſhall repair to his
houſe without expreſs leave: And to
ſend withal a Letter, with all ſpeed, of
complaint againſt him to the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> together with a Declaration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Seals of all the Nobility and
Speaker of the Commons in their names
as was 44 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. to the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt

                  <p>Moſt excellent Majeſty, your moſt
humble ſervant in diſcharge of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and zeal, hath haſtned up this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract,
vvhich in all humility he offers up
unto your gracious pardon. Preſumption
to enter the Cloſet of your Counſell is
far from his modeſty and duty, vvhat
hath been your powerfull Command, he
hath made his Work, vvhat is fit to be
done vvith it, is only your divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He dares not ſay Preſidents are
vvarrants to direct; The ſucceſs (is as
vvorthy obſervation) as the knowledge
of them, ſometimes have made ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by extenſion of Regal power, through
ill Counſels vvith ill ſucceſs. Some as
bad or vvorſe vvhen the people have had
too much of that, and the King too
little, the danger no leſs. To cut out of
either of theſe patterns to follovv, vvere
but to be in Love vvith the miſchief,
for the example. The clearer I preſent
this to your Highneſs, the nearer I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the uprightneſs of your heart,

Pardon, moſt Sacred Majeſty, that I
offer up unto your admired vviſdome,
my vveak, but dutifull obſervations out
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65928:33"/>
of all the former gathering. In Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of State and deciſions of private
plaints, it is clear from all times, the
King not only preſent to adviſe and
hear but to determine alſo, in Caſes
Criminal, and not of Bloud, to bar the
King a part vvere to exclude him the
<hi>Star-chamber,</hi> as far from reaſon as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
The doubt is then alone in Crimes
meer Capital; I dare not commend too
much the times that loſt theſe patterns,
either for the Cauſes or Effects; but vviſh
the one and other never more. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by publick Act of Commons, Peers,
and King, vvas moſt uſuall. Appeals
are given by Lavv of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. of this in
novv debate, the vvay I fear, as yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
as great advice to State is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the manner, as for the Juſtice.

Lords. That of the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> of

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65928:33"/>
the Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi> Stevvard for the King.
The Accuſed vvere of the rank of the
Accuſers, Commons and not Lords:
Hovv this vvill make a Preſident to judg
in cauſes Capital, a Peer of Parliament,
I cannot tell. But if I ſhould conceive a
vvay anſvverable as well to Parliament
as other Courts, if the King and the
Lords vvere Tryers, and the Commons
aſſenters to the judgment to hear toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Charge, and evidence; The
Lords as doth the Jury in other Courts,
to vvithdravv, to find the Verdict, and
then the Stevvard, for the King, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Sentence. It paſſeth ſo by
vvay of Act and Courſe that carrieth
vvith it no exception, and likely to
avoid all curious queſtions of your

often the old, if they were not of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
demeaſne-land, which our forefathers
held impious to alienate from the <hi>Crown,</hi>
and thoſe were ſuch Lands as go under the
title of <hi>Terra Regis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. Domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</note> in the Book of Domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and were the Lands of <hi>Edward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor:</hi>
of other Lands I never obſerved
queſtion, neither do ever find that Acts of
Reſumptions ever reached to Lands that
were ſold for valuable conſideration.</p>
                     <p>By paſſing in Fee-farm, except places
of the Kings Reſidence, Parks, ſpacious
Waſtes or Forreſts, all the Lands of the
the Crown, which remain either in the
annexation, cuſtody lands, or Queens
jointure, and exceed not yearly 32000. l.
Theſe, although largely eſtated out in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
natures, ſome for lives, ſome for
years, will one with the other be advanced
to a treble rent, which amounting to
96000. l. leaving an annual improvement
of 64000. And if the offer be not made
reſtrictive for the new Tenant, there is no
doubt but his Majeſty ſhall find ready and
hearty undertakers amongſt the Gentry
and Nobility too, who have any place of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65928:94"/>
Reſidence neer any his Majeſties Mannors;
and the Kings ſecurity the better, ſince
their abilities will ſettle the Pre-farm rent
upon more Land then the purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall object againſt this, a loſs by
Fines and Profits of Courts, a prejudice in
not ſerving neceſſity (as of late) by ſales
or diminution of Regalities in ſeiſure of
ſo many Royalities. It may be anſwered
to the firſt, that the caſual profits of
Courts never defrayed to the preſent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
their fees and expences; and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
from a collection made the 44. year
of the late Queen, where the total iſſue of
ſuch certain charge exceeded the receipt of
ſuch chances above 8000. l.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond, if looking upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
rates of the Kings Lands, expoſed to
Fee-farm ſales, we find ſome at 50. other
at 21. years as to the late contracters, and
make out of theſe extreams a <hi>medium</hi> of
the largeſt 40. years, and ſet on the other ſide
the Common and current eſtimate for
dead Rents 15. years purchaſe: We muſt
find, that 50 l. Land ſold un-improved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
to the like trebled by a Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farm,
will be 250. l. loſs to his Majeſty in
the ſale. As for Regalities, though it may
adde ſomewhat to a Subject, in increaſing
ſuch his petty command, it can nothing
to a Sovereign, whoſe tranſcendent power
drown'd in it all ſuch ſubordinate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances
&amp; regards. But if we conſider beſides
the former improvement, the increaſe of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65928:94"/>
caſual advantage, and diminution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
charge, we ſhall have juſt cauſe not
to continue this courſe; for if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
in this buſineſs, may be ordered
by inſtruction to reſerve upon every Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of above 30. <hi>per Annum,</hi> a tenure in
Knight-ſervice by half a Fee, and of above
50. l. in Capite by an intire Fee, and of the
purchaſe to pay his Rent into the receipt
himſelf half yearly, and ſtrike there his
Tally: the former will advance the revenue
accidental of the Crown in Wardſhips, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier
ſeiſin,</hi> alienation and aides; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cut off at once ſo many their unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Receivers, Auditors, Stewards, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
and Clerks, as ſtand the King in year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above 12000. l. As for other dues or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Revenues, which now fall under the
charge of theſe Officers, the Collection
and payment may be as it hath been with
the reſt from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 2. until of
late dayes laid on the Sheriffs of the Shire,
and all the accounts left to the 2. Auditors
of the preſs to draw up, and Clerk of the
Pipe to enter in <hi>Magno rotulo</hi> as in former
time, for it muſt ſeem ſtrange to all men
of judgement, that it ſhould be with thoſe
Officers (who had their beginning but
ſince the 25,year of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. by addition
of his new revenue of 150000. l. from the
ſuppreſſed Monaſteries) otherwiſe then
with all things in nature, and reaſon,

                     <p>Beſides this of the general diſpoſing in
Fee-farm, there hath been a project in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to infranchiſe the Copy-holders

tranſported, maketh the State to buy more
then they do ſell, whereas a good Father
of a family ought to be <hi>vendacem</hi> and not
<hi>emacem.</hi> Beſides the condition of our <hi>People</hi>
is now ſuch, that the greater part neither
get nor ſave, which in a private houſe is
an apparent argument of ruining, and
muſt be no leſs in a Common-Wealth.
And it is obſerved generally, that hence the
want of Bullioin now is ſuch, that there is
not money in <hi>Specie</hi> ſufficient to pay the
lenders their principal, ſo that uſury is
paid for money upon ſuppoſition, and not
really.</p>
                     <p>If then his Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed by
adviſe of his Councel, to advantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
any otherwiſe by <hi>coinage,</hi> it will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to do it upon a ſimple mettal, then by
any implyant or beater ſuite, which well
governed States both modern and antient
uſed: For <hi>Rome</hi> in her increaſe and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

auro puto puro,</hi> and ſo have all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies</hi>
abſolute at this day in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And I believe it may be wrought
to his Majeſty of good value, and to the
State of much eaſe, if it may be put in
practiſe with diſcreet caution and conſtant
reſolution; for the danger onely may be
in the venting of the quantity, which may
clogge the State with uſeleſs money, or
extenſion of the example, which may work
in by degrees an embaſement of Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The proportion that I would hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
and ſafe, ſhould be in the Maſs, at
firſt 120000. l. by which his Majeſty ſhould
gain 10000. clearly: the increaſe annual
12000. l. in which his Majeſty ſhould gain
1000. And the limitation, that none be
enforced to take any but in ſummes under
20 s. and then but the twentieth part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this ſome may object, that it
will either not advantage the King ſo
much as it projected, either from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in venting, or facility in Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting,
or elſe prejudice the eſtate with a
worthleſs money.</p>
                     <p>The benefit to the King will eaſily fall
out, if he reſtrain Retailers of victual and
ſmall Wares from uſing their own tokens,
for in and about <hi>London,</hi> there are above
3000. that one with another coſt yearly 5.
l. apiece of leaden Tokens, whereof the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65928:104"/>
tenth remaineth not to them at the years
end, and when they renew their ſtore,
which amounteth to above 15000. l. And
all the reſt of this Realm cannot be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the City in proportion. And the
form and figure may with an Engine ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
be milled, that the charge will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all practiſe of falſe play.</p>
                     <p>For the prejudice ſince <hi>London,</hi> which is
not the 24. part of the People of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
had in it found above 800000. by a
late inquiry by order of the late Queen,
and ſo falleth out to be 2 d. a perſon, in the
intire ſtate it may nothing, either of
loſs by the firſt uttering being ſo eaſie, nor
burthen any with too great a Maſs at a
time, ſince continual uſe will diſperſe ſo
ſmall a quantity into ſo many hands. But
on the other ſide will be to the meaner ſort
(except the Retailers that made as much
advantage formerly of their own Tokens,
as the King ſhall now) of neceſſary uſe
and benefit: For the buyers hereafter ſhall
not by tyed to one Seller and his bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
as they are ſtill, when his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
hereafter made currant by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
ſhall leave him the choiſe of any
other Chapman; and to the Poor in this
time of ſmall charity, it will be of uch
relief; ſince men are like to give a farthing
Almes, that will not part with a greater
ſum.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it cannot but prevent much waſte
of Silver, that is by the minting pence and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65928:104"/>
half pence occaſioned, there will be no
cauſe hereafter to cut any Bullion into
proportion ſo apt for loſſe: what that
hath been may be conjectured, if we mark
but of the great quantities from the peny
downward ſince <hi>Henry</hi> 8. time ſtamped, how
few remain: whereas of all the Coines from
three pence upward which are manual, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

this they did to adde <hi>Seculare Brachium</hi> to

that <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> (an Author of eſpecial

the point might eaſily happen betwixt 9.
<hi>Henry</hi> 3. and 28. <hi>Edward</hi> 1. when this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was firſt exemplified: but certainly,
there is ſufficient left in that which is extant
to decide this queſtion: for the words are,
that no Freeman ſhall be taken or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
but by the lawful judgement of his
<hi>Peers</hi> (which is by Jury; <hi>Peers</hi> for <hi>Peers,</hi>
ordinary Juryes for other, who are their
<hi>Peers</hi>) or by the Law of the Land: Which
Law of the Land muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be of this notion, to be by due
proceſs of the Law; and not the Law of
the land generally: otherwiſe it would
comprehend Bondmen (whom we call
Villaines) who are excluded by rhe word
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65928:116"/>
                     <hi>liber:</hi> For the general Law of the Land
doth allow their Lords to impriſon them at
their pleaſure without cauſe, wherein they
only differ from the Freeman, in reſpect
of their perſons, who cannot be improſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without a cauſe. And that this is the
true underſtanding of theſe words, <hi>per
legem terrae,</hi> will more plainly appear by
divers other Statutes that I ſhall uſe, which
do expound the ſame accordingly. And
though the words of this grand Charter
be ſpoken in the third perſon; yet they
are not to be underſtood of ſuits betwixt
party and party; at leaſt not of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but even of the Kings ſuits againſt
his Subjects, as will appear by the occaſion
of the getting of that Charter; which was
by reaſon of the differences between thoſe
Kings and their People; and therefore
properly to be applied unto their power
over them, and not to ordinary queſtions
betwixt Subject and Subject.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the words <hi>per legale judicium
parium ſuorum</hi> immediately preceeding the
other of <hi>per legem terrae,</hi> are meant of trials
at the Kings ſuit, and not at the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Subject. And therefore if a <hi>Peer</hi>
of the Realm be arraigned at the Suite
of the King upon an Indictment of murder,
he ſhall be tryed by his <hi>Peers;</hi> that is by
Nobles: but if he be appealed of murder by
a Subject, his tryal ſhall be by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Jury of 12. Freeholders, as appeareth

By the ſame reaſon therefore, as <hi>per judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
parium ſuorum</hi> extends to the Kings ſuit;
ſo ſhall theſe words <hi>per legem terrae.</hi> And
in 8. <hi>Edward 3. rot. Parl. m.</hi> 7. there is a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that a Writ under the privy Seal
went to the Guardian of the Great Seal, to
cauſe Lands to be ſeized into the Kings
hands; by force of which there went a Writ
out of the Chancery to the Eſcheator, to
ſeize againſt the form of the Grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that the King or his Miniſters ſhall
out no man of Free-hold without reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Judgement, and the Party was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

did extend to the King. There was no
invaſion upon this perſonal Liberty until
the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3. which was eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
reſented by the Subject: For in 5.
<hi>Edward. 3. cap.</hi> 9. it is ordained in theſe

ſeized into the Kings hands againſt the
form of the great Charter and the Law of
the Land.</p>
                  <p>25. <hi>Edward 3, cap.</hi> 4. is more full; and
doth expound the words of the grand
Charter; and is thus: Whereas it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the great Charter of the <hi>Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> that none ſhall be impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65928:117"/>
nor put out of his Freehold, nor of
his Franchiſe nor free Cuſtome, unleſs it
be by the Law of the Land. It is accorded,
aſſented and eſtabliſhed, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
none ſhall be taken by Petition or
Suggeſtion made to our Lord the King, or
to his Counſel, unleſs it be by Indictment
or Preſentment of his good and lawful
People of the ſame Neighbourhood where
ſuch deeds be done, in due manner, or by
proceſs made by Writs Original at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, nor that none be put out of his
Franchiſes nor of his freeholds, unleſs he
be due brought in anſwer, and forejudged
of the ſame by the courſe of the Law, and
if any thing be done againſt the ſame,
it ſhall be redreſſed and holden for
none.</p>
                  <p>Out of this Statute I obſerve, that what
in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Preamble of this
Statute, is termed by the Law of the Land,
is by the body of this act expounded, to be
by proceſs made by Writ Original at the
Common Law; which is a a plain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the words, Law of the Land,
in the Grant <hi>Charter.</hi> And I note that this
Law was made, upon the Commitment of
divers to the Tower, no man yet knoweth
for what.</p>
                  <p>28 <hi>Edward 3. cap.</hi> 3. is yet more direct;
(this liberty being followed with freſh
Suit by the Subject) where the words are
not many, but very full and ſignificant:
That no man, of what Eſtate or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65928:117"/>
ſoever he be, ſhall be put out of his Lands
or Tenements, nor taken, nor impriſoned,
nor diſinherited, nor put to death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he be brought in anſwer by due proceſs
of the Law. Here your Lordſhips ſee, the
uſual words, of the Law of the Land, are
rendered by due proceſs of the Law.</p>
                  <p>36. <hi>Edward. 3. Rot. Parl. n.</hi> 9. amongſt the
Petitions of the Commons one of them
(being tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>French</hi>)
is thus. Firſt, that the great Charter,
and the Charter of the Forreſt, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Statutes made in his time, and in the
time of his Progenitors, for the profit of
him and his Communalty, be well and
firmly kept, and put in due execution,
without putting diſturbance, or making
arreſt contrary to them, by ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or in other manner.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer to the Petition, which
makes it an Act of Parliament, is: Our
Lord the King, by the aſſent of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
Dukes, Earles, Barons, and the
Communalty hath ordained and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that the ſaid Charters and Statutes
be held and put in execution according to
the ſaid Petition. It is obſerveable that
the Statutes were to be put in execution
according to the ſaid Petition? which is,
that no Arreſt ſhould be made contrary
to the Statutes, by ſpecial command. This
concludes the queſtion, and is of as great
force as if it were printed. For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Roll
is the true warrant of an Act,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65928:118"/>
and many are omitted out of the Books that
are extant.</p>
                  <p>35. <hi>Edward 3. Rot. Parl. nu.</hi> 20. explaineth
it further. For there the Petition is: <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
as it is contained in the grand Charter
and other Statutes, That no man be taken
or impriſoned by ſpecial command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Indictment or other proceſs to be made
by the Law upon <hi>them,</hi> aſwel of things done
out of the <hi>Forreſt</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> as for other
things; That it would pleaſe our ſaid Lord;
to command thoſe to be delievered, that are
ſo taken by ſpecial command, againſt the
form of the Charters and Statutes aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is, The King is pleaſed,
that if any man find himſelf greived, that
he come and make his complaint, and
right ſhall be done unto him.</p>
                  <p>37. <hi>Edward 3. cap.</hi> 18. agreeth in ſubſtance
when it ſaith, Though that it be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the great Charter, that no man be
taken, nor impriſoned, nor put out of his
Freehold without proceſs of the Law:
Nevertheleſs divers People make falſe
Suggeſtions to the King himſelf; as well
for malice or otherwiſe, whereof the King
is often grieved, and divers of the Realm
put in damage, againſt the form of the
the ſaid Charter, wherefore it is ordained
that all they which make ſuggeſtions, ſhall
be ſent with the ſame ſuggeſtions before
the Chancellour, Treaſurer and his grand
Council; and that they there find Surety
to purſue their ſuggeſtions: and incur the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65928:118"/>
ſame pain that the other ſhould have had
if he were attainted, in caſe that his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
be found evil; and that then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Law be made againſt them,
without being taken and impriſoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the form of the Charter and other
Statutes. Here the Law of the Land in the
grand Charter is explained to be without
proceſs of the Law.</p>
                  <p>42. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. at the requeſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
by their Petitions put forth in this
Parliament, to eſchew miſchief and damage
done to divers of his Commons by falſe
Accuſers, which oftentimes have made
their accuſation more for revenge and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
benefit than for the profit of the
King or of his People; which accuſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſome have been taken and ſometime
cauſed to come before the Kings Council,
by Writ or otherwiſe, upon grievous
pains againſt the Law, It is aſſented
and accorded for the good governance of
the Commons, that no man be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
without preſentment before Juſtices
or matter of Record, or by due proceſs
and Writ original according to the old
Law of the Land: and if any thing
from henceforth be done to the contrary,
it ſhall be void in the Law and holden for
Error.</p>
                  <p>But this is better in the Parliament-Roll,
where the Petition and Anſwer (which
make the Act) are ſet down at large 42.
<hi>Edward 3. Rot. Parl. n.</hi> 12. The Petition
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65928:119"/>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> becauſe that many of the Commons
are hurt and deſtroyed by falſe Accuſers,
who make their Accuſations more for
their revenge and particular gaine,
than for the profit of the King or his
People: And thoſe that are accuſed by
them, ſome have been taken, and others
are made to come before the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
by Writ or other Command of the
King, upon grievous pains, contrary to the
Law. That it would pleaſe our Lord the
King, and his good Council, for the juſt
Government of his People, to ordain, that
if hereafter any Accuſer purpoſe any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the profit of the King, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be ſent to the Juſtices of the one Bench
or the other, or the Aſſizes, to be enquired
and determined according to the Law; and
if it concern the Accuſer or Party, that he
take his Suit at the Common Law, and
that no man be put to anſwer, without
preſentment before Juſtices, or matter of
Record, or by due proceſs and Original
Writ, according to the antient Law of the
Land; and if any thing henceforward be
done to the contrary, that it be void in
Law, and held for error. Here, by due
proceſs and Original Writ according to
the antient Law of the Land, is meant the
ſame thing as <hi>per legem terrae</hi> in <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
And the abuſe was, that they were put to
anſwer by the Commandment of the King.
The King's anſwer is thus. Becauſe that
this Article is an Article of the Grand
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65928:119"/>
Charter: The King will that this be done
as the Petition doth demand. By this
appeareth that <hi>per legem terrae</hi> in <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> is meant by due proceſs of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Thus your Lordſhips have heard Acts of
<hi>Parliament</hi> in the point. But the Statute
of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt <hi>cap.</hi> 15. is urged to
diſprove this opinion, where it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, that a man is not repleviſable
who is committed by command of the
King. Therefore the command of the
King without any cauſe ſhewed, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to commit a man to Priſon. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſtrength of the Argument may
appear, and the anſwer be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
I ſhall read the words of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
which are thus: And foraſmuch as
Sheriffs and others, which have taken and
kept in Priſon, perſons detected of Felony,
and oftentimes have let out by Replevin,
ſuch as were not repleviſable; becauſe they
would gaine of the one party, and grieve
the other. And foraſmuch as before this
time it was not certainly determined what
perſons were repleviſable, and what not,
but onely thoſe that were taken for the
death of a man, or by commandment of
the King, or of his Juſtices, or for the
Forreſt; it is provided, and by the King
commanded, that ſuch Priſoners as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were outlawed, and they which have
abjured the Realm, Provers, and ſuch
as be taken with the manner, and thoſe
which have broke the Kings Priſon,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65928:120"/>
Theives openly defamed and known, and
ſuch as be appealed by Provers, ſo long as
the Provers be living, if they be not of
good name, and ſuch as be taken for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Houſes feloniouſly done, or for falſe
money, or for counterfeiting the Kings
Seal, or Perſons excommunicate taken at
the requeſt of the Biſhop, or for manifeſt
offences, or for treaſon touching the King
himſelf, ſhall be in no wiſe repleviſable, by
the common VVrit or without VVrit. But
ſuch as be Indicted by Larceny, by Inqueſts
taken before Sheriffs or Bayliffs by their
Office, or of light ſuſpition, or for petty
Larceny, that amonnteth not above the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 12 <hi>d.</hi> if they were not guilty of ſome
other Larceny aforetime, or guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of Felons, or of <hi>commandment</hi> or force,
or of aid in Felony done, or guilty of
ſome other Treſpaſs for which one ought
not to loſe Life or Member; and a man
appealed by a Prover; after the death of
the Prover if he be no common Thief, nor
defamed, ſhall from henceforth be let out
by ſufficient Surety, whereof the Sheriff
will be anſwerable, and that without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ought of their Goods. And if the
Sheriff or any other let any go at large by
Surety, that is not repleviſable, if he be the
Sheriff, Conſtable, or any other Bayliff
of Fee which hath keeping of Priſons, and
thereof be attained, he ſhall loſe his Fee
and Office for ever. And if the Under-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
Conſtable or Bayliff of ſuch as hath
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65928:120"/>
Fee for keeping of Priſons, do it contrary
to the will of his Lord, or any other Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff
being not of Fee, they ſhall have 3.
years impriſonment, and make a fine at
the King's pleaſure. And if any with-hold
Priſoners repleviſable after they have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſufficient Surety, he ſhall pay a grievous
amerciament to the King; and if he take
any Reward for the deliverance of ſuch, he
ſhall pay double to the Priſoner, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſhall be in the great mercy of the King.
The anſwer is, it muſt be acknowledged,
that a man taken by the command of the
King is not repleviſable, for ſo are the
expreſs words of this Statute, but this
maketh nothing againſt the Declaration
of the Commons: for they ſay not, that
the Sheriff may Replevin ſuch a man by
Surety, <hi>Scilicet Manucaptores:</hi> but that he is
bayleable by the Kings Court of Juſtice:
for the better apprehending whereof, it is
to be known, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Repleviſable, which is alwayes by
the Sheriff upon Pledges or Sureties gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Baileable by a Court of Record,
where the Priſoner is delivered to his
Baile and they are his Jailors, and may
impriſon him, and ſhall ſuffer for him
body for body, as appeareth 33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.
<hi>Edward</hi> 3. in the title of <hi>Mainpriſe, plit.</hi> 12,
13. where the difference betwixt Baile and
<hi>Mainpriſe</hi> is expreſly taken. And if the
words of the Statute it ſelf be obſerved, it
will appear plainly that it extends to the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65928:121"/>
Sheriffs and other inferiour Officers, and
doth not bind the hand of the Judges.
The Preamble, which is the Key that
openeth the entrance into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Makers of the Law) is: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as Sheriffs, and others, which
have taken and kept in Priſon perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
of Felony. Out of theſe words I
obſerve, that it nominateth Sheriffs; and
then if the Juſtices ſhould be included,
they muſt be comprehended under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
word, <hi>Others;</hi> which doth not uſe
to extend to thoſe of an higher rank, but
to inferiours: For the beſt, by all courſe is
firſt to be named; and therefore if a man
bring a writ of Cuſtomes and Services, and
name Rents and other things, the general
words ſhall not include homage, which
is a perſonal ſervice, and of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but it ſhall extend to ordinary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
ſervices, 31. <hi>Edward 1. droit 67.</hi> So
the Statute of 13. <hi>Elizabeth cap.</hi> 10. which
beginning with Colledges, Deans and
Chapters, Parſons and Vicars, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with theſe words, <hi>and others (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
having ſpiritual promotions)</hi> ſhall not
comprehend Biſhops, that are of an higher
degree, as appeareth in the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Caſe reported by <hi>Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Cook lib. 2. fol.</hi> 466. And thus much
is explained in this very Statute, to the
end when it doth enumerate thoſe were
meant by the word <hi>other,</hi> namely Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheriffs,
Conſtables, Bayliffes. Again,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65928:121"/>
the words are Sheriffs and others, which
have taken and kept in Priſon. Now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man knoweth, that Judges do neither
arreſt nor keep men in Priſon; that is the
office of Sheriffs, and other inferiour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;
Therefore this Statute meant
ſuch only. and not Judges. The words
are further, that they let out by replevin
ſuch as were not repleviſable. This is the
proper language for a Sheriff: Nay more
expreſs afterwards, in the body of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute:
That ſuch as are there mentioned,
ſhall be in no wiſe repleviſable by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
VVrit (which is <hi>de homine replegiando,</hi>
and is directed to the Sheriff) nor withour
Writ (which is by the Sheriff, <hi>Ex Officio</hi>) But
that which receives no anſwer, is this: That
the command of the Juſtices (who derive
their authority from the Crown) is there
equalled as to this purpoſe with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the King; aud therefore by all
reaſonable conſtruction, it muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to Officers that are ſubordinate to
both, as Sheriffs, Underſheriffs, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes,
Conſtables, and the like: and it
were an harſh expoſition to ſay, that the
Juſtices might not diſcharge their own
command; and yet that reaſon would
conclude as much. And that this was
meant of the Sheriffs and other Miniſters
of Juſtice, appeareth by the Recital of
27. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. cap. 3. and likewiſe by <hi>Fleta,</hi>
a Manuſcript ſo called, becauſe the Author
lay in the Fleet when he made the Book.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65928:122"/>
For he <hi>Lib. 2. cap.</hi> 52. in his Chapter of
Turns, and the Views of the hundred
Courts in the Countrey, and ſetteth down
the Articles of the charges that are there
to be enquired of; amongſt which, one
of them is, <hi>De replegialibus injuſte detentis
&amp; irreplegialibus dimiſſis;</hi> which cannot be
meant of not bailing by the Juſtices. For
what have the <hi>inferiour Courts</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to do with the Acts of the Juſtices?
And to make it more plain, he ſetteth
down in his Chapter (that concerns She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
onely) the very Statute of <hi>Weſt. 1. cap.</hi>
15. which he tranſlates <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the
<hi>French</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> ſave that he renders,
Taken by the command of the Juſtices
thus, <hi>Per judicium Juſtitiariorum,</hi> and his
Preface to the Statute plainly ſheweth
that he underſtood it of Replevin by She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs:
for he ſaith, <hi>Qui non debent per plegios
dimitti, qui non declaret hoc Statutum;</hi> and
<hi>per plegios</hi> is before the Sheriff. But for
direct authority, it is the opinion of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Chief Juſtice, 22. <hi>Henry</hi> 6. 46. where
his words are theſe: It cannot be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but the Sheriff did ſuffer him to go at
large by mainpriſe: for where one is taken
by the VVrit of the King, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the King, he is repleviſable;
but in ſuch Caſes his Friends may come to
the Juſtices for him if he be arreſted, and
purchaſe a <hi>Superſedeas.</hi> This Judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that the Sheriff cannot deliver
him that is taken by the command of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65928:122"/>
King, for that he is irrepleviſable, which
are the very words of the Statute: but ſaith
he, his Friends may come to the Juſtices,
and purchaſe a <hi>Superſedeas.</hi> So he declares
the very queſtion, that the Sheriff had no
power, but that the Juſtices had power to
deliver him who is committed by the
Kings command, and both the antient and
modern practiſe manifeſts as much. For
he that is taken for the death of a man, or
for the Forreſt, is not repleviſable by the
Sheriff; Yet they are ordiuarily bayled
by the Juſtices, and were by the Kings
VVrits directed to the Sheriffs in the times
of <hi>Edward 1. &amp; Edward 2.</hi> as it appears in
the cloſe Rolls, which could not be done
if they were not baileable: and it is every
dayes experience that the Juſtices of the
Kings Bench do baile for murder, and for
Offences done in the Forreſt; which they
could not do, if the word <hi>Irrepleviſable</hi> in
<hi>Weſtminſter l.</hi> were meant of the Juſtices as
well as the Sheriffs.</p>
                  <p>For the Authorities that have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to prove the contrary,<note place="margin">Object.1.</note> they are in
number three. The firſt is 21. <hi>Edward</hi> 1.
<hi>rot. 2.</hi> in <hi>Scrin.</hi> which alſo is in the book
of <hi>Pleas</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> at the Tower <hi>fol.</hi>
44. It is not an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but a
Reſolution in <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon an Action
there brought, which was uſual in thoſe
times. And the Caſe is, that <hi>Stephen Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab</hi>
the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
and <hi>Warwick</hi> was queſtioned for that he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65928:123"/>
had let at large, by Sureties, amongſt
others, one <hi>William</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Walter le
Perſons,</hi> againſt the will and command of
the King, whereas the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him by Letters under his Privy
Seal, that he ſhould do no favour to any
man, that was committed by the command
of the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> as that man was:
VVhereunto the Sheriff anſwered, that he
did it at the requeſt of ſome of the King's
Houſhold upon their Letters. And becauſe
the Sheriff did acknowledge the receipt of
the King's Letters, thereupon he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Priſon, according to the form of
the Statute.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that the Sheriff was
juſtly puniſhed, for that he is expreſly
bound by the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 1. which
was agreed from the beginning. But this
is no proof that the Judges had not power
to baile this man.</p>
                  <p>The next Authority is 33.<note place="margin">Object.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Henry</hi> 6.in the
Court of Common Pleas, <hi>fol. 28. b.</hi> 29.where
<hi>Robert Poynings</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was brought to the Bar
upon a <hi>Capias,</hi> and it was returned, that
he was committed <hi>per duos de Concilio</hi>
(which is ſtrongeſt againſt what I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
<hi>pro diverſis cauſis Regem tangentibus,</hi>
And he made an Attorney there in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Whence it is inferred, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
was good, and the Party could not be
delivered.</p>
                  <p>To this the anſwer is plain. Firſt,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> no
Opinion is delivered, in that Book, one
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65928:123"/>
way or other upon the Return, neither is
there any teſtimony whether he were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
or bailed, or not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it appears expreſly that he
was brought thither to be charged in an
Action of Debt at another mans Suit, and
no deſire of his own to be delivered or bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and then, if he were remanded, it
is no way material to the queſtion in
hand.</p>
                  <p>But that which is moſt relyed upon,<note place="margin">Object.3.</note> is
the Opinion of <hi>Stanford</hi> in his book of the
Pleas of the Crown <hi>Lib. 2. cap. 18. fol.</hi> 72.
73, in his Chapter of <hi>Mainpriſe,</hi> where he
reciteth the Chapter of <hi>Weſt. 1. cap.</hi> 15. and
then ſaith thus: By this Statute it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that in 4. Cauſes at the Common
Law a man was not repleviſable; to wit,
thoſe that were taken for the death of a
man, by the command of the King, or of
his Juſtices, or for the Forreſt. Thus far
he is moſt right. Then he goeth on and
ſaith; As to the command of the King;
that is underſtood of the command by his
own mouth, or his Council, which is
incorporated unto him and ſpeak with
his mouth; or otherwiſe every Writ of
<hi>Capias</hi> to take a man (which is the Kings
command) would be as much. And as
to the command of the Juſtices, their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
commandment; for if it be their
ordinary Commandment, he is replevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
by the Sheriff, if it be not in ſome of
the Caſes prohibited by the Statute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:65928:124"/>
The anſwer that I give unto this is, that
<hi>Stamford</hi> hath ſaid nothing whether a man
may be committed without cauſe by the
Kings command, or whether the Judges
might not baile him in ſuch Caſe; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ſuch an one is not repleviſable;
which is agreed; for that belongs to the
Sheriff: and becauſe no man ſhould think
he meant any ſuch thing, he concludes his
whole ſentence touching the command of
the King and the Juſtices, that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Juſtice's ordinary command
is repleviſable by the Sheriff; So either
he meant all by the Sheriff; or at leaſt it
appears not that he meant, that a man
committed by the King or the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
without cauſe, is not baileable by the
Juſtices: and then he hath given no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in this Caſe. What he would have
ſaid, if he had been asked the queſtion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known: Neither doth doth it appear
by any thing he hath ſaid, that he meant
any ſuch thing as would be inforced out
of him.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Lords, I have performed
the command of the houſe of Commons,
and (as I conceive) ſhall leave their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of perſonal liberty an antient and
undoubted truth, fortifyed with ſeven Acts
of Parliament, and not oppoſed by any
Statute or Authority of Law whatſoever.</p>

                     <p>IT was agreed by Maſter Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that the ſeven Statutes urged by
the Commons were in force, and that
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> did extend moſt properly to

                     <p>Hereunto is anſwered, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
were as direct as could be, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the reading of them, and that
though ſome of themſpeak of <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of

do, are as effectual; for that they are in <hi>qual</hi>
reaſon; a commitment by the command
of the King being of as great force when
it moveth by a ſuggeſtion feom a Subject,
as when the King taketh notice of the
cauſe himſelf; the rather, for that Kings
ſeldome intermeddle with matters of this
nature, but by information from ſome of
their People.</p>
                     <p>2. Maſter Attorney objected, that <hi>per
legem terrae in Magna Charta</hi> (which is the
Foundation of this queſtion) cannot be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65928:125"/>
underſtood for proceſs of the Law and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Writ: for that in all Criminal
proceedings no Original Writs is uſed at
all, but every Conſtable may arreſt, either
for felony, or for breach of the Peace,
without proceſs or Original Writ: And
it were hard the King ſhould not have the
power of a Conſtable: and the Statutes
cited by the Commons make proceſs of
the Law, and Writ Original to be all one.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer of the <hi>Commons</hi> to this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
was, that they do not intend Original

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65928:126"/>
exposition of theſe words <hi>(per legem terrae)</hi>
the King's Council were deſired to declare
their meaning; which they never offered
to do; And yet certainly, theſe words
were not put into the Statute, without
ſome intention of conſequence.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon M. <hi>Serjeant Aſhley</hi> offered
an <hi>interpretation</hi> of them thus; namely, that
there were divers Laws of this Realm;
As the Common Law; the Law of the
Chancery; the Eccleſiaſtical Law; the
Law of Admiralty or Marine Law; the
Law of Merchants; the Martial Law; and
the Law of State: And that theſe words,
<hi>(per legam terrae)</hi> do extend to all thoſe
Laws.</p>
                     <p>To this it was anſwered, That we read
of no Law of State, and that none of thoſe
Laws can be meant there, ſave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which is the principal and general
Law, and is always underſtood by way of
<hi>Excellency,</hi> when <hi>mention</hi> is made of the <hi>Law</hi>
of the Land generally; and that though each
of the other Laws which are admitted into
this Kingdom by Cuſtome or Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
may juſtly be called a Law of the
land; yet none of them can have that
preheminency to be ſtiled the Law of the
Land; and no Stature, Law-book, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority, printed or unprinted,
could be ſhewed to prove that the Law of
the Land, being generally mentioned, was
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er intended of any other Law than the
Common Law (and yet, even by theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65928:126"/>
Laws a man may not be committed
without a cauſe expreſſed) but it ſtandeth
with the Rule of other legal expoſitions,
that <hi>per legem terrae,</hi> muſt be meant the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, by which the general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Law by which men hold their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances,
and therfore if a man ſpeak of
Eſcuage generally, it is underſtood (as
<hi>Littleton</hi> obſerveth <hi>plt, 99.</hi>) of the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Eſcuage, which is a Knight<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s ſerviec
tenure for the defence of the Realm by the
body of the Tenant in time of VVar;
and not of the certain Eſcuage which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
only a contribution in money, and
no perſonal ſervice. And if a Statute
ſpeak of the King's Courts of Record, it
is meant only of the four at <hi>Westminſter</hi>
by way of Excellency: <hi>Cook. 6. 20. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
caſe.</hi> So the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> by the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
if ſimply ſpoken, do intend
the greater Excommunication; and the
Emperor in his Inſtitutions, ſaith, that the
Civil Law being ſpoken generally, is meant
of the Civil Law of <hi>Rome,</hi> though the Law
of every City is a Civil Law, as when a
man names a Poet, the <hi>Grecians</hi> underſtand
<hi>Homer,</hi> the <hi>Latiniſts Virgil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, admit that <hi>per legem terrae</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all the Laws of the Land; yet a
man muſt not be committed by any of
them, but by the due proceedings that are
exerciſed by thoſe Laws, and upon cauſe
declared.</p>
                     <p>Again it was urged, that the King is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65928:127"/>
not bound to expreſs a cauſe of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
becauſe there may be in it matter
of State not fit to be revealed for a time,
leaſt the Confederates thereupon make
means to eſcape the hands of Juſtice: and
therefore the Statutes cannot be intended
to reſtrain all Commitments, unleſs a
cauſe be expreſſed; for that it would be
very inconvenient and dangerous to the
State to publiſh the cauſe at the very
firſt.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto it was replyed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
That all danger and inconvenience
may be avoided by declaring a general
Cauſe; as, for Treaſon; for ſuſpition of
Treaſon, Miſpriſion of Treaſon, or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
without ſpecifying the particular;
which can give no greater light to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
then will be conjectured by the
very apprehenſion or upon the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if nothing at all were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>It was further alleadged, that there was
a kind of contradiction in the Poſition of
the Commons, when they ſay, that the
party committed without a cauſe ſhewed,
ought to be delivered or bailed; bailing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a kind of impriſonment, delivery a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
freedome.</p>
                     <p>To this it was anſwered, that it hath
alwayes been the diſcretion of the Judges
to give ſo much reſpect to a commitment
by the Command of the King or the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
Councel, (which are ever intended to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65928:127"/>
be done on juſt <hi>and weighty</hi> cauſes) that they
will not preſently ſet him free, but baile
him to anſwer what ſhall be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him on his Majeſties behalf: But
if any other inferiour Officer commit a
man without cauſe ſhewed, they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
deliver him as having no cauſe to
expect their pleaſure; ſo the delivery is
applyed to an impriſonment by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of ſome mean Miniſter of juſtice; bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when it is done by the command of the
King or his Councel.</p>
                     <p>It was urged by Maſter Attorney, That
bailing is a <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of a Court of
Juſtice, and that they may refuſe to do it.
This was agreed to be true in divers caſes,
as where the cauſe appeareth to be for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
or other crime expreſſed; for that
there is another way to diſcharge them in
convenient time, by their tryal; (And yet
in thoſe caſes the conſtant practiſe hath
been, antiently and modernly to bayle
men) but where no cauſe of the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is returned, but the command of the
King, there is no way to deliver ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
by tryal or otherwiſe, but that of
<hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and if they ſhould be then
remanded, they may be perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
without any remedy at all, and
conſequently, a man that had committed
no Offence might be in worſe caſe then a
great Offendor; for, the latter ſhould have
an ordinary tryal to diſcharge him, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould never be delivered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65928:128"/>
It was further ſaid, that though the
<hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſt.</hi> I. <hi>cap,</hi> 15. as a <hi>Statute,</hi> by
way of proviſion did extend only to the
<hi>Sheriff;</hi> yet the Recital in that <hi>Statute,</hi>
touching the 4. Cauſes wherein a man was
not repleviſable at Common Law (namely
thoſe that were committed for the death
of a man; by the command of the King,
or the Juſtices, or for the Forreſt) did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the Juſtices could not baile ſuch
an one, and that Repleviſable and baile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
were <hi>Synonyma,</hi> and all one. And that
<hi>Stanford</hi> (a Judge of great authority) doth
expound it acordingly; and that neither
the <hi>Statute</hi> not <hi>He</hi> ſay repleviſable by the
Sheriff, but generally without reſtraint;
and that if the Chief Juſtiee committed
a man, he is not to be enlarged by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Court, as appeareth in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                     <p>1. To this it was anſwered; Firſt, that
the Recital and Body of the Statute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
only to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> as appeareth by the
very words.</p>
                     <p>2. That Repleviſable is not reſtrained
to the <hi>Sheriff;</hi> for that the word imports
no more, that a man committed by the
<hi>Juftice</hi> is baileable by the Court of the
King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s Bench.</p>
                     <p>3. That <hi>Stamford</hi> meaneth all of the
Sheriff, or at the leaſt he hath not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
expreſſed that he intended the <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. It was denyed that Repleviſable and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65928:128"/>
Baileable are the ſame: For, they differ
in reſpect of the place where they are uſed,
Bail being in the King's Courts of <hi>Record,</hi>
Repleviſable before the Sheriff. And they
are of ſeveral Natures, Repleviſable being
a letting at large upon Sureties; Bailing,
when one <hi>Traditur</hi> in <hi>ballium,</hi> and the baile
are his Jaylors, and may impriſon him,
and ſhall ſuffer body for body; which is
not true of replevying by <hi>Sureties.</hi> And
Bail differeth from Mainprize in this, that
Mainprize is an undertaking in a ſum
certain, Bailing to anſwer the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in civil Cauſes, and in criminal
body for body.</p>
                     <p>And the Reaſons and Authorities uſed
in the firſt conference were then renewed,
and no exception taken to any, ſave that
in 22. <hi>Henry 6.</hi> it doth not appear that
the Command of the King was by his
mouth (which muſt be intended) or by
his Councel (which is all one, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by <hi>Stamford)</hi> for the words are, that
a man is not repleviſable by the <hi>Sheriff,</hi>
who is committed by the Writ or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the King.</p>
                     <p>21. <hi>Edward 1. Rot. 2. dorſo</hi> was cited by
the Kings Counſel, But it was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it concerned the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
only; and not the power of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                     <p>33. <hi>Henry 6.</hi> the King's Attorney con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
was nothing to the purpoſe; and
yet that Book had been uſually cited by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65928:129"/>
thoſe that maintain the contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the Commons;<note place="margin">No.</note> and therefore
ſuch ſudden opinion as hath been given
thereupon is not to be regarded, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
failing.</p>
                     <p>And where it was ſaid, that the <hi>French</hi>
of 36. <hi>Edward Rot. Parl. n.</hi> 9. (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive
no anſwer) did not warrant but what
was enforced thence; but that theſe words,
<hi>(Sans diſturbance metter, ou arreſe faire,&amp;
l'encontre per ſpecial mandement on en autre
manere)</hi> muſt be underſtood, that the <hi>Statutes</hi>
ſhould be put in execution without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
or ſtay; and not that they ſhould
be put in execution without putting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
or making arreſt to the contrary
by ſpecial command, or in other manner.
The Commons did utterly deny the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
given by the Kings Councel; and
to juſtifie their own, did appeal to all men
that underſtood <hi>French,</hi> and upon the ſeven
<hi>Statutes</hi> did conclude, that their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
remained an undoubted truth, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled
by any thing ſaid to the contrary.</p>

I will endeavour, as my clear mind is free
from any perſonal diſtaſte of any one, ſo
to expreſs the honeſt thoughts of my
Heart, and diſcharge the beſt care of my
truſt, as no perſon ſhall juſtly taxe my
innocent and publick mind, except his

others in elder times. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with aſmuch brevity as I can, ſet
down how theſe diſorders have by degrees
ſprung up in our own memories; how
the Wiſdom of the beſt and wiſeſt <hi>Ager</hi> did
of old redreſs the like. And laſtly, what
modeſt and dutiful courſe I would wiſh to
be followed by our ſelves in this ſo happy

now with God, as had ſerved the late

and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ants not ſo often complained of
in Parliaments; Trade flouriſhed; Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
not ſo many, though more then in
the late Queens time: for they exceeded
not 18000. l. now near 120000. l. All
things of moment were carryed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
debate at the Council-Table; No ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſet to ſale; nor places of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Lawes againſt Prieſts and Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65928:141"/>
were executed: Reſort of <hi>Papiſts</hi> to
Ambaſſadors houſes barred and puniſhed;
His Majeſty by daily direction to all his
Miniſters, and by his own Pen declaring
his diſlike of that Profeſſion: No waſtful
expences in fruitleſs Ambaſſages, nor
any tranſcendent power in any one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
For matters of State, the Council-Table
held up the fit and antient dignity.
So long as my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> ſtood in
ſtate of grace, and had by his Majeſty's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the truſt of the Signet Seale; he oft
would glory juſtly, there paſſed neither
to himſelf, or his Friends any long Grants
of his Highneſs Lands or Penſions: For
that which himſelf had, he paid 20000. l.
towards the Marriage-Portion of the
King's Daughter. His care was to paſs no
Monopoly or illegal Grant, and that
ſome Members of this Houſe can witneſs
by his charge unto them. No giving way
to the ſale of Honours, as a breach upon
the Nobility (for ſuch were his <hi>own</hi> words)
refuſing Sir <hi>John Roper</hi>'s Office, then tendred
to procure him to be made a Baron. The
match with <hi>Spain,</hi> then offered (and with
condition to require no further tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Religion then Ambaſſadours here
are allowed) diſcovering the double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and the dangers, he diſſwaded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
from; and left him ſo far in diſtruſt
of the Faith of that King, and his great
Inſtrument <hi>Gondomar,</hi> then here reſiding,
that his Majeſty did term him long time
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65928:142"/>
after a <hi>Jugling Jack.</hi> Thus ſtood th'effect
of his power with his Majeſty when the
Clouds of his misfortune fell upon him.
VVhat the future advices led in, we may
well remember. The marriage with <hi>Spain</hi>
was again renewed: <hi>Gondomar</hi> declared
an honeſt man: Poperie heartened, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of thoſe unſure, before conditions
of Conveniencie. The forces of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
in the Palatinate withdrawn, upon
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> faith improved here and beleived;
by which his Highneſs Children have loſt
their Patrimony, and more money been
ſpent in fruitleſs Ambaſſages, then
would have maintained an Army fit to
have recovered that Countrey. Our old
and faſt Allies diſheartened, by that tedious
and dangerous Treaty: And the King
our now Maſter, expoſed to ſo great a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
as no wiſe and faithful Councel would
ever have adviſed. Errors in Government,
more in misfortune by weak Councels, then
in Princes.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of the County of <hi>Poyntiffe</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> was laid to Biſhop <hi>Wickham</hi>'s charge
in the firſt of <hi>Richard the</hi> 2. for perſwading
the King to forbear ſending aid when it was
required: a Capital crime in Parliament.
The loſs of the <hi>Dutchie</hi> of <hi>Maine</hi> was laid

have been of late, and to become a Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor

Subjects of the State, is worth the
enquiry.</p>
                  <p>VVhat Grants of Impoſitions before
croſſed, have lately been complained of in
Parliaments? As that of <hi>Ale-houſes, Gold-Thred,
Pretermitted Cuſtomes,</hi> and many

<hi>Edward</hi> 3. adjudged in Parliament an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 6. time, in
procuring ſuch another Grant in derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Common Law, was adjudged in
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The gift of Honours kept as the moſt
ſacred Treaſure of the State, now ſet to
ſaile, Parliaments have been Suitors to
the King to beſtow thoſe Graces; as in the
time of <hi>Edward 3. Henry</hi> 4. and <hi>Henry</hi> 6.
More now led in by that way onely then
all the merits of the beſt deſervers huve
got theſe laſt 500. years. So tender was the
care of elder times that it is an Article 28.
<hi>Henry</hi> 6. in Parliament againſt the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> that he had procured for himſelf,
and ſome few others, ſuch Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and thoſe ſo irregular, that he was
the firſt that ever was Earl, Marqueſs,
and Duke of the ſelf ſame place. <hi>Edward</hi>
the firſt reſtrained the number, in pollicie,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65928:143"/>
that would have challenged a Writ by
Tenure: and how this proportion may
ſuit with profit of the State we cannot
tell. Great deſerts have now no other
recompence then coſtly Rewards from the
King; For, we now are at a vile Price of
that which was once ineſtimable. If worthy
Perſons have been advanced freely to
places of greatest truſt, I ſhall be glad.
<hi>Spencer</hi> was condemned in the 15. of <hi>Edward</hi>
3. for diſplacing good Servants about the
King, and putting in his Friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
not leaving, either in the <hi>Church</hi> or
Common-Wealth, a place to any, before
a Fine was paid unto him for his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

great Debts, high Engagements, and
preſent wants: The noiſe whereof I wiſh
may ever reſt incloſed within theſe Walls.
For, what an incouragement it may be to
our Enemies, and a diſheartning to our
Friends, I cannot tell. The danger of thoſe,
if any they have been the cauſe, is great and
fearful. It was no ſmall motive to the
Parliament, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

the 20. of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. in Parliament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other Crimes, for procuring Lands
and Penſions from the King, and having
imployed the Subſidies to other ends then
the grant intended. His Grand-Child,
<hi>William Duke</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> for the like was
cenſured 28. <hi>Henry</hi> 6. The great Biſhop
of <hi>Wincheſter, 50. Edward.</hi> 3. was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Kings mercy by Parliament for
waſting in time of Peace, the Revenues of
the Crown, and gifts of the People, to
the yearly oppreſſion of the Common-VVealth.
Offences of this Nature were
urged to the ruining of the Laſt Duke of
<hi>Somerſet</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> 6. time. More fearful
Examples may be found, too frequent in
Records. Such Improvidence and ill
Council led <hi>Henry</hi> the third into ſo great
a ſtrait, as after he had pawned ſome part
of his Forreign Territories, broke up
his Houſe, and ſought his Diet at Abbies
and Religious houſes, ingaged not onely
his own Iewels, but thoſe of the Shrine
of Saint <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> he was in
the end (not content, but) conſtrained to
lay to pawne (as ſome of his Succeſſors

until by Parliament that bad great man

but an Act of Reſumption followed
the inrollment of the Act of his Exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That was a ſpeeding Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

lohg as the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (a Pattern of

Greatneſs, they ever maintained, with
little or no charge, the Standard of their
Coine. But after the looſe times of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi>

that Shift of Changing the Standard, the

For, in a Memorial of the Lord

And that it was not the ſhort ends of VVit,
nor ſtarting holes of deviſes that can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
the expence of a Monarchy, but ſound
and ſolid courſes: for ſo are the words.
She followed their adviſe, and began to
reduce the Monies to their elder goodneſs,
ſtiling that work in her firſt Proclamation
<hi>Anno 3. A Famous Act.</hi> The next year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
having perfected it as it after ſtood;

                  <p>The regulating of Coine hath been left

of my Good Maſter,, and your Lordſhips
Wiſdoms, that would not upon infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of ſome few Officers of the Mint,
before a free and careful debate, put in
execution this Project, that I much (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Honours Favour) ſuſpect, would
have taken away the Tenth part of every
man's due debt, or Rent already reſerved
throughout the Realm, not ſparing the
King; which would have been little leſſe
then a Species of that which the <hi>Roman</hi>
Stories call <hi>Tabulae novae,</hi> from whence very
often ſeditions have ſprung: As that of
<hi>Marcus Gratidianus in Livie,</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in his <hi>Conſulſhip,</hi> that the Currant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was waſted by uſe, called it in, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Standard; which grew ſo heavy
and grievous to the People, as the Author
ſaith, becauſe no man thereby knew
certainly his Wealth, that it cauſed a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.</p>
                  <p>In this laſt part,<note place="margin">Profit.</note> which is, the Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this enſeebling the coyn will bring
both to his Majeſtie and the Common-Wealth,
I muſt diſtinguiſh the Monies of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65928:149"/>
Gold aud Silver, as they are Bullion or
Commodities, and as they are meaſure:
The one, the Extrinſick quality, which
is at the King's pleaſure, as all other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
to name; The other the Intrinſick
quantity of pure metall, which is in the
<hi>Merchant</hi> to value. As there the meaſure
ſhall be either leſſened or inlarged, ſo is
the quantity of the Commodity that is to
be exchanged. If then the King ſhall cut
his ſhilling or pound nominal leſs then
it was before, a leſſe proportion of ſuch
Commodities as ſhall be exchanged for it
muſt be received. It muſt then of force
follow, that all things of neceſſity, as
Victuall, Apparell, and the reſt, as well
as thoſe of Pleaſure, muſt be inhaunced. If
then all men ſhall receive, in their ſhillings
and pounds a leſſe proportion of Silver
and Cold then they did before this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Alteration, and pay for what they
buy a rate inhaunced, it muſt caſt upon all
a double loſs.</p>
                  <p>What the King will ſuffer by it in the
Rents of his lands, is demonſtrated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
by the alterations ſince the 18. of
<hi>Edward</hi> the 3. when all the Revenue of the
Crown came into the receipt <hi>Pondere &amp;
Numero,</hi> after five groats in the ounce;
which ſince that time, by the ſeverall
changes of the Standard is come to five
ſhillings, whereby the King hath loſt two
third parts of his juſt Revenue.</p>
                  <p>In his Cuſtoms, the beſt of rate being
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65928:149"/>
regulated by pounds and ſhillings, his
Majeſty muſt loſe alike; And ſo in all
and whatſoever monies that after this he
ſhall receive.</p>
                  <p>The profit by this change in coynage,
cannot be much, nor manent. In the
other the loſs laſting, and ſo large, that
it reacheth to little leſs then yearly to a
ſixth part of his whole Revenue: for hereby
in every pound tale of Gold there is nine
ounces, one penny weight, and 19 grains
loſs, which is 25 l. in account, and in
the 100 1. tale of Silver 59 ounces, which
is 14 l. 17 s. more.</p>
                  <p>And as his Majeſtie ſhall undergoe all
theſe loſſes hereafter in all his receipts;
ſo ſhall he no leſs in many of his disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The wages of his Souldiers muſt
be rateably advanced as the money is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.
This <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>third</hi> (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the account of the Wardrobe and
Exchequor) as all the Kings after were
enforced to do, as oft as they leſſened the
Standard of their monies. The prices of
what ſhall be bought for his <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſties</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
muſt in like proportion be inhaunced
on him. And as his Majeſty hath the
greateſt of Receipts and Iſſues, ſo muſt he
of neceſſity taſte the moſt, of loſs by this
device.</p>
                  <p>It will diſcourage a great proportion of
the Trade in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo impair his
Majeſty's Cuſtoms. For that part (being
not the leaſt) that payeth upon truſt and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65928:150"/>
credit will be overthrown; for all men
being doubtful of diminution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
of their perſonal Eſtates, will call
their moneys already out, and no man
will part with that which is by him, upon
ſuch apparent loſs as this muſt bring.
What danger may befall the State by
ſuch a ſuddain ſtand of Trade, I cannot
gueſs.</p>
                  <p>The monies of Gold and Silver former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
coyned and abroad, being richer then
theſe intended, will be made for the me
part hereby Bullion, and ſo tranſported;
which I conceive to be none of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
that hath drawn ſo many <hi>Gold-Smiths</hi>
to ſide this Project, that they may
be thereby Factors for the ſtrangers, who
by the lowneſs of minting (being but 2 <hi>s.</hi>
Silver the pound weight, and 4s. for Gold;
whereas with us the one is 4. and the other
5 s.) may make that profit beyond-ſea
they cannot here, and ſo his Majeſty's mint
unſet on work.</p>
                  <p>And as his Majeſty ſhall loſe apparently
in the alteration of monies a 14. in all the
Silver, and a 25. part in all the Gold
he after ſhall receive; ſo ſhall the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Gentry, and all other, in all their
former ſetled Rents, Annuities, Penſions
and loanes of money. The like will fall
upon the Labourers and workmen in their
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tute-wages: and as their receipts are
leſſened hereby; ſo are their Iſſiues increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
either by improving all prices. or
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65928:150"/>
disfurniſhing the Market, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow. For if in 5. <hi>Edwardi</hi> 6. 3.
<hi>Mariae,</hi> and 4. <hi>Elizabethae,</hi> it appeareth by
the Proclamations, that a rumor only of
an alteration cauſed theſe Effects, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Author of ſuch reports with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
and pillory; it cannot be
doubted but the projecting a change muſt
be of far more conſequence and danger
to the State, and would be wiſhed that
the Actors and <hi>Authors</hi> of ſuch diſturbances
in the Common-Wealth, at all times here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
might undergo a puniſhment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
                  <p>It cannot beheld (I preſume) an advice
of beſt judgment that layeth the loſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our ſelves, and the gain upon our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
for who is like to be in this the
greater Thriver? Is it not uſual, that the
Stranger that tranſporteth over monies for
Bullion, our own Gold-Smiths that are
their Brokers, and the Forreign Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minters
of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> (which terms
them well) have a reſh and full Trade by
this abatement? And we cannot do the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> King (our greateſt enemie) ſo great
a favour as by this, who being the Lord
of this Commodity by his <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt- Indies,</hi> we
ſhall ſo advance them to our impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for it is not in the power of any
State to raiſe the price of their own, but
the value that their Neighbour Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
ſets upon them.</p>
                  <p>Experience hath taught us, that the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65928:151"/>
enfeebling of coyn is but a ſhift for a while,
as drink to one in a dropſy, to make him
ſwell the more: But the State was never
throughly cured, as we ſaw by <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighths time and the late Queens, untill
the coyn was made up again.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but then conclude (my honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lords) that if the proportion of
Gold and Silver to each other be wrought
to that parity, by the advice of Artiſts,
that neither may be too rich for the other,
that the mintage may be reduced to ſome
proportion of Neighbour parts, and that
the Iſſue of our Native Commodities may
be brought to overburthen the entrance of
the Forreign, we need not ſeek any way of
ſhift, but ſhall again ſee our Trade to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
the Mint (as the pulſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth)
again to beat, and our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,

Mint are bound by Oath to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their ſeveral duties in their ſeveral
places reſpectively. But we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how they ſhould ſtand tyed by oath
to account to his Majeſty and your Honors
of the Intrinſick value of all Forreign
coyns, and how they agree with the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of the State (before they come to the
Mint) for it is impoſſible and needleſs: In
the one, for that all Forreign States do,
for the moſt part, differ from us and our
money infinitely amongſt themſelves: In
the other; it being the proper care of the
Merchants, who are preſumed not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
that at a dearer rate then they may
be allowed for the ſame in fine Gold and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65928:152"/>
Silver in the coyn of <hi>England,</hi> within the
charge of coynage. And therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                     <p>To induce the neceſſity of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they produce two inſtances or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
The one from the <hi>Rex Doller,</hi> and
the other from the <hi>Royal of Eight;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have untruely informed your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the price and value in our monies,
and our Trade of both of them. For
whereas they ſay, that the <hi>Rex Doller</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth 18. penny weight and 12. grains, and
to be of the fineſt at the pound weight, 10.
ounces, 10 pence weight, doth produce
in exchange 5. s. 2. d. farthing of ſterling
monies. We do affirm that the ſame <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
is 18. d. weight 18. grains, and in fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
10. ounces 12. d, weight, equal to 4. s.
5.d.ob. of ſterling monies, and is at this

                     <p>Whereas they do in their circumſtance
averr unto your Honours, that this <hi>Dollar</hi>
runs in account of Trade amongſt the
Merchants as 5. s. 2. d. ob. <hi>Engliſh</hi> money:
It is moſt falſe. For the Merchants and
beſt experienced men proteſt the contrary,
and that it paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the ſterling money, or neer thereabouts,
and not otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond inſtance is in the <hi>Royall of
Eight;</hi> affirming that it weigheth 17. pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
weight, 12. grains; and being but of
the fineneſs of 11. ounces at the pound
weight, doth paſs in Exchange at 5 s. of
our ſterling moneys, whereby we loſe 6.s.
7 d. in every pound weight. But having
examined it by the beſt Artiſts, we find it
to be 11. ounces, 2. d. weight fine, and in
weight 17. penny weight, 12. grains;
which doth equal 4. s. 4. d. ob. of our ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
monies, and paſſeth in <hi>London</hi> at that
rate, and not otherwiſe, though holding
more fine Silver by 12. grains and a half
in every <hi>Royall of Eight,</hi> which is the charge
of coynage, and a ſmall overplus for the
Gold-Smiths gain. And whereas they
ſay, that the ſaid <hi>Royall of Eight</hi> runs in
account of Trade at 5 s. of his Majeſtie's
now <hi>Engliſh</hi> money; the Merchants do all
affirm the contrary, and that it paſſeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at 4 s. 4. ob. of the ſterling monies, and
no higher ordinarily.</p>
                     <p>And it muſt be ſtrange (my honourable
Lords) to believe that our Neighbours the
<hi>Netherlanders,</hi> would give for a pound tale
of our ſterling Silver, by what name ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it paſſeth, a greater quantity of their
monies in the like intrinſick value by
Exchange; Or that our Merchants would,
knowing, give a greater for a leſs to them,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65928:153"/>
except by way of uſance. But the deceipt
is herein only, that they continually va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
their coyn, and crying it up at
pleaſure, may deceive us for a time, in too
high a Reputation of pure Silver in it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
truſt, then there is, untill a trial; and
this, by no Alteration of our coyn, unleſs
we ſhould daily, as they make his Majeſtie's
Standard uncertain, can be prevented,
which being the meaſure of Lands, Rents
and Commerce amongſt our ſelves at
home, would render all uncertain, and
ſo of neceſſity deſtroy the uſe of money;
and turn all to permutation of ſuch
things as were not ſubject to will or
change.</p>
                     <p>And as they have miſtaken the ground
of their Propoſition; ſo have they, upon
a ſpecious ſhew of ſome momentary and
ſmall benefit to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> reared up a
vaſt and conſtant loſs unto his Highneſs
by this deſign, if once effected. For, as
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath the 1argeſt portion of any
both in the entrances and iſſues; ſo ſhould
he by ſo enfeebling of his coyn, become the
greateſt loſer.</p>
                     <p>There needs no other inſtance then
thoſe degrees of diminution from the 18.
of <hi>Edwards,</hi> 3.<note place="margin">18. Edw. 3.</note> to this day; at which time
the Revenue of the Crown was paid after
five Groats the ounce (which is now five
ſhillings) which hath loſt his <hi>Majeſty</hi> two
thirds of all his Revenue; and no leſs
hath all the Nobility, Gentry, and other
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65928:153"/>
his <hi>Majeſtie's</hi> landed Subjects in proportion
ſuffered. But ſince, to our great comfort;
we heard your Honours the laſt day to lay
a worthy blame upon the <hi>Mint-Maſters,</hi>
for that intended diminution of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyn
done by them without full warrant;
by which we reſt diſcharged of that fear:
We will (according to our duties and
your Honours command) deliver humbly
our opinion concerning the reduction of
the Silver money now currant to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
equivalent to the Gold.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſterling Standard, which
was no little honour to <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt,
that ſetled it from an inconſtant motion,
and laid it a ground that all the States of
<hi>Europe</hi> after complyed to bring in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which was of Silver an 11 to one
of Gold, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> for the moſt
part ſince have conſtantly continued the
ſame proportion: and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi>
who took from hence his Pattern,
have held and hold unchangeably the ſame
unto this day: but ſince with us, a late
improvement of Gold hath broke that
Rule, and caſt a difference in our Silver of
ſix ſhillings in the pound weight; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but in all humility preſent our fear,
that the framing, at this time of an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
except it were by reducing the Gold
to the Silver, is not ſo ſafe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
as is propoſed by thoſe of the
Mint.</p>
                     <p>For whereas they pretend this, Our
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65928:154"/>
richneſs of our Silver will carry out what
now remaineth: We conceive (under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
it will have no ſuch effect, but clean
contrary. For all the currant Silver now
abroad hath been ſo culled by ſome Gold-Smiths,
the ſame either turned into Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and ſo tranſported, that that which
now remaineth will hardly produce 65. s.
in the pound weight one with another;
and ſo not likely, for ſo little profit as
now it goeth, to be tranſported. But if
the pound ſterling ſhould be as they deſire,
cut into 70. s. 6 d. it muſt of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that the new money will convert the
old money (now currant) into Bullion;
and ſo afford a Trade afreſh for ſome ill
Patriot Gold-Smiths, and others, who
formerly have more endamaged the State
by culling, then any others by clipping;
the one but trading in pounds, the other
in thouſands; and therefore worthy of a
greater puniſhment. And we cannnot but
have juſt cauſe (my Lords) to fear that
theſe bad members have been no idle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
for their private benefit, to the
publick detriment, of this new project,
ſo much tending to enfeebling the ſterling
Standard:</p>
                     <p>We further (under your Lord ſhips fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours)
conceive, that the raiſing of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Gold, will upon ſome ſuddain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
beyond Sea, tranſport our Gold,
and leave the State in ſcarcity of that, as
now of Silver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:65928:154"/>
And to that Objection of the Propoſers,
That there is no Silver <hi>brought</hi> of late into
the mint; The cauſes we conceive to be
(beſides the unuſual quantities of late
brought into the mint in Gold) one the
overballaſing of late of Trade; the other,
the charge of coynage. For the firſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
be but the late infection of this City
was a let of exportation of our beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
Cloth, made by that ſuſpected
in every place. To this may be added the
vaſt ſums of money which the neceſſary
occaſion of war called from his <hi>Majeſty</hi>
to the parts beyond the Seas, when we had
<hi>leaſt</hi> of Commodities <hi>to</hi> make even the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
there. And laſtly, dearth and ſcarcity
of corn, which in time of plenty we ever
found the beſt exchange to bring in ſilver.
And therefore, ſince by Gods great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Plague is ended, and general
Trade thereby reſtored, and more of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
this year, then hath been formerly theſe
many years, of corn, we doubt not but
if the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi> were now as free as
they were of late, there would not prove
hereafter any cauſe to complain of the
want of Bullion in the State.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond cauſe, that the mint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
unfurniſhed; will be the charge of
coynage, raiſed in price ſo far above all
other places, conſtraining each man to
carry his Bullion where he may receive by
coynage the leſs of loſs. And therefore
if it may pleaſe his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to reduce the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65928:155"/>
prices here to the Rates of other of our
Neighbour Countreys, there will be
no doubt but the Mint will beat as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>The meaſures in a Kingdom ought to

that they were worthy to ſuffer death for

upon the People. For, to alter this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
meaſure, is to leave all the Markets

                     <p>Hence of neceſſity, it muſt follow, that

                     <p>And thus far as money is a meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now, as it is a Commodity, it is reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and valued by the intrinſick quality.
And firſt the one metall to the other.</p>
                     <p>All commodities are prized by Plenty
or ſcarſity, by dearneſs or cheapneſs, the
one by the other: If then we deſire our
Silver to buy Gold, as it late hath done,
we muſt let it be the cheaper, and leſs in
proportion valued; and ſo contrary: for
one equivalent proportion in both will
bring in neither. We ſee the proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by the unuſual quantity of <hi>Gold</hi> brought
lately to the Mint by reaſon of the price;
for we rate it above all other Countries,
and Gold may be bought too dear. To
furniſh then this way the mint with both,
is altogether impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>And at this time it was apparently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
both by the <hi>beſt Artiſts</hi> and <hi>Merchants</hi>
moſt acquainted with the <hi>Exchange,</hi> in both
the examples of the Mint-maſters, in the
<hi>Rex Dollar</hi> and <hi>Reall of Eight,</hi> That Silver
here is of equal value, and <hi>Gold</hi> above, with
the forreign parts in the intrinſick; and
that the <hi>fallacy</hi> preſented to the <hi>Lords</hi> by
the <hi>Mint-Maſters,</hi> is only in the <hi>nomination</hi>
or extrinſick quality.</p>
                     <p>But if we deſire both, it is not raiſing
of the value that doth it; but the <hi>ballaſing</hi>
of <hi>Trade:</hi> for buy we in more then we

ſell of other <hi>Commodities,</hi> be the money ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo high prized, we muſt part with it
to make the diſproportion even: If we ſell
more then we buy, the contrary will <hi>follow:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is plain in <hi>Spain's</hi> neceſſities:
For ſhould that King advance to a double
rate his <hi>Reall of 8.</hi> yet needing, by reaſon
of the barrenneſs of his Countrey, more
of Forreign Wares then he can countervail
by Exchange with his own, he muſt part
with his money, and gaineth no more
by enhauncing his Coyn, but that he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a higher price for the Commodities he
buyeth; if his work of raiſing be his own.
But if we ſhall make improvement of <hi>Gold</hi>
and <hi>Silver,</hi> being the ſtaple <hi>Commodity</hi> of his
State; we then advancing the price of his,
abaſe to him our own Commodities.</p>
                     <p>To ſhape this Kingdom to the faſhion

their occaſions. We ſee this by raiſing
the <hi>Exchange</hi> at <hi>Franckford</hi> and other places
at the uſual times of their <hi>Marts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The frequent and daily change in the
low Countries of their monies, is no ſuch
injuſtice to any there as it would be here.
For being all either Mechanicks or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
they can rate accordingly their
labours or their wares, whether it be coyn
or other Merchandiſe, to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their own money in Exchange.</p>

purſued a fifth <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> would firſt have
laid the foundation thereof in <hi>Italy,</hi> by
ſurprizing <hi>Rome.</hi> But from this he was
thruſt by the force and reſpect of <hi>Religion,
Henry</hi> the 8. being made <hi>Caput foederis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him.</p>
                  <p>He then attempted it in <hi>High-Germany,</hi>
Practiſing (by faction and Force) to
reduce thoſe petty States to his abſolute
power. In this <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him, by tying the <hi>Lutber an Princes</hi> under his confederacy and aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>His Son, the ſecond <hi>Philip,</hi> purſued
the ſame Ambition in the <hi>Nether Germany,</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65928:159"/>
by reduction whereof he intended to
make his way further into the other. This
the late <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> interrupted, by
ſiding with the afflicted people on the one
part, and making her ſelf Head of the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> League with the Princes on the
other ſide; drawing in, as a ſecret of
State, the Countenance of <hi>France,</hi> to give
the more reputation and aſſiſtance to them,
and ſecurity to it ſelf,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> ſeeing his hopes thus fruitleſs by
theſe Unions and ſleights, began firſt, to
break (if he might) the Amity of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>England:</hi> But finding the common
danger to be as faſt a Tye, he raiſeth up a
party in that Kingdome of his own, by
the which the <hi>French</hi> King was ſo diſtreſſed,
that had not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Councel and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
relieved him, <hi>Spain</hi> had there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
that next and greateſt obſtacle of
his ambition.</p>
                  <p>His Councel now tells him, from theſe
examples, that the way to his great work
is impaſſible ſo long as <hi>England</hi> lies a let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his way; and adviſeth him, that the
remove of that obſtacle be the firſt of his
intents. This drew on thoſe often ſecret
practices againſt the perſon of the late
Queen, and his open fury in 88. againſt
the Body of the State: For which ſhe (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the advice of a free Councell) will
never after admit of Peace, winning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the hearts of a loving people, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found hands and money for all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65928:159"/>
at home, and keeping ſacredly her
Alliances abroad, ſecured her confederates,
all her time, in <hi>freedome</hi> from fear of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
ſlavery; And ſo ended her old and happy
dayes in great Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> then, by the Wiſdome and power
of that great <hi>Lady,</hi> diſpoiled ſo of his means
to hurt, though not of his deſire, makes
up, with her peaceful Succeſſor of happy
memory, the Golden League, that (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming
us at home by opinion of Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

(bereaft of power abroad) to lead in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,

they have ſwallowed up the fortune of
our Maſter's brother, with the reſt of

(whether from the Plot, or our Fatality)
it hath caſt ſuch a <hi>bone</hi> between <hi>France</hi> and

condition of our State. You may ſee
therefore in what terms we ſtand abroad;
and I fear me, at home, for reſiſtance in
no better State.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be, to withſtand a Forreign
invaſion, <hi>a proportion</hi> both of Sea and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces;
for to give an enemy an eaſie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and a port to relieve him in, is no
leſs then to hazard all at one ſtake. And
it is to be conſidered, that no march by
land, can be of that ſpeed, to make head
againſt the landing of an enemy, nor no
ſuch prevention as to be Mr. of the Sea. To
this point of neceſſary defence, there can
be no leſs then 240000. l.</p>
                  <p>For the land-forces; If it were for an
jOffenſive war, the men of leſs liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
were the beſt ſpared, and were uſed
formerly to make ſuch war, <hi>purgamento
Reipublicae,</hi> if we made no further purchaſe
by it. But for ſafety of a Common-wealth,
the Wiſdom of all times, did never intereſt
the publick cauſe to any other then ſuch
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65928:160"/>
as had a portion in the <hi>publick adventure.</hi>
And that we ſaw in 88. when the <hi>ear of the
Queen and Councel did make the body of that
large Army, no other then of trained bands,</hi>
which with the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> of the whole
<hi>Realm,</hi> amounted to no leſs then 24000.men.
Neither were any of <hi>thoſe</hi> drawn out <hi>from

before the end of May, that there might be no
long aggrievance to the publick;</hi> ſuch <hi>diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments</hi>
being ever to us a more <hi>fatal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The careful</hi> diſtribution <hi>and</hi> direction <hi>of
the</hi> Sea <hi>and</hi> Land-forces, <hi>being more fitting
for a</hi> Councel of War, then a private Man to
adviſe of, <hi>I paſs over; yet ſhall ever be
willing and ready (when I ſhall be called)</hi>
humbly to offer up ſuch obſervations, as I have
formerly gathered by the former like occaſions
of this Realm.</p>
                  <p>To make up this preparation, there are requiſite
two things: Money &amp; affections; for they cannot
be properly ſevered. It was well &amp; wiſely ſaid,
by that great and grave Councellor the Lord
<hi>Burleigh</hi> in the like caſe to the late Queen: Win
hearts, &amp; you may have their hands &amp; purſes;
And I find of late, that diffidence having been a
defect in the one, it hath unhappily produced
the other.</p>
                  <p>In gathering then of money for this preſent
need, there are required three things: <hi>Speed,
Aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> And the way to
gather (as others in the like caſes have done)
muſt be by that path, which hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65928:161"/>
called <hi>Via Regia,</hi> being more ſecure
&amp; ſpeedy: For, by unknown and untroden
ways, it is both rough &amp; tedious, &amp; ſeldom
ſucceedeth well This. laſt way, although it
took place as it were by a ſupply at firſt, and
received no general denyal; yet ſince
it hath drawn many to conſider with
themſelves and others of the Conſequence,
and is now conceived a preſſure on their
liberties and againſt Law, I much fear, if
now again it be offered, either in the ſame
face, or by Privy Seal, it will be refuſed
wholly. Neither find I that the reſtraint
of thoſe Recuſants hath produced any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
effect then a ſtiff reſolution in them
and others to forbear. <hi>Beſides, though it
went at the firſt with ſome aſſurance; yet when
we conſider the Commiſſions and other forms
incident to ſuch like ſervices, as that how long
it hangs in hand, and how many delays there
were, we may eaſily ſee, that ſuch a ſum by
Parliament granted, is far ſooner and more
eaſily gathered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any will make the ſucceſſes of times to
produce an inevitable neceſſity to enforce
it levied (whether in general) by exciſe,
or impoſition, or in particular upon ſome
ſelect perſons (which is the cuſtom of ſome
Countreys) and ſo conclude it (as there)
for the <hi>publick State, Suprema lege</hi>) he muſt
look for this to be told him: That ſeeing
neceſſity muſt conclude always to gather
money, as leſs ſpeedy or aſſured then that
ſo practiſed (which <hi>cannot</hi> be fitter then by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65928:161"/>
Parliament) the ſucceſs attendeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of the heedleſs multitude, that are
full of jealouſie and diſtruſt; and ſo unlike
to comply to any unuſual courſe of Levy,
but by force: which if uſed, the effect is
fearful, and hath been fatal to the State;
whereas that by Parliament reſteth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
on the regal perſon, who may
with eaſe and ſafety mould them to his fit
deſire, by a gracious yielding to their juſt
Petitions.</p>
                  <p>If a Parliament then be the moſt <hi>ſpeedy,
aſſured, and ſafe way;</hi> it is fit to conceive,
what is the ſafeſt way to act and work it to
the preſent need.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the time of the uſual Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
reputed to be 40. days, to be too
large for the preſent neceſſity; it may be
by dating the Writ leſſened; ſince it is no
poſitive law; ſo that a care be had that
there may be one County day, after the
Sheriff hath received the Writ before the
time of ſitting.</p>
                  <p>If then the ſum to be levyed be once
agreed of, for the time there may be in
the body of the <hi>Grant</hi> an <hi>Aſſignment</hi> made
to the <hi>Knights</hi> of every <hi>County</hi> reſpectively,
who (under ſuch <hi>Aſſurance)</hi> may ſafely give
<hi>Security proportionable</hi> to the Receipts, to
ſuch as ſhall in preſent <hi>advance</hi> to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
ſervice any <hi>ſums of money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt and weightieſt conſideration (if a
<hi>Parliament</hi> be <hi>thought fit</hi>) is, how to <hi>remove</hi>
or <hi>comply</hi> the <hi>differences between</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65928:162"/>
                     <hi>Subject</hi> in <hi>their mutual demands.</hi> And what I
have learned amongſt the better ſort of the
<hi>Multitude,</hi> I will freely declare; that <hi>your
Lordſhips</hi> may be the <hi>more</hi> enabled to <hi>remove</hi>
and <hi>anſwer thoſe diſtruſts,</hi> that either <hi>concern
Religion, Publick ſafety of the King and State,</hi>
or the juſt liberties of the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For</hi> Religion (<hi>a</hi> matter <hi>that they lay neareſt

of jealouſie to doubt ſome practiſe againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for that the Spaniſh match, which was
broken by the grateful Induſtry of my Lord of
Bucking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of his Religious care (as he there
declares) that the Articles there demanded
might lead in ſome ſuch ſufferance as might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the quiet, if not the State of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion here: Yet there have (when he was
an Actor principal in the Conditions with
<hi>France</hi>) as hard, if not worſe (to the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Religion) paſſed then thoſe with Spain.
And the ſuſpect is ſtrengthened by the cloſe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of this Agreement in that point there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>It is no leſs an Argument of doubt to them of
his Affections, in that his Mother end others,
many of his Miniſters of neer imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, are ſo affected.</p>
                  <p>They talk much of his advancing men <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtically</hi>
devoted; ſome placed in the camp,
of neareſt ſervice and chief Command: And
that the Recuſants have gotten, theſe late
years, by his power, more of courage and
aſſurance then before. If to clear theſe doubts
(which perhaps are worſe in fancy then in
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65928:162"/>
truth) he took a good courſe, it might much
advance the <hi>Publick ſervice,</hi> againſt thoſe
<hi>ſqueymiſh humors</hi> that have more <hi>violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then ſetled judgment;</hi> &amp; are not the leaſt of
the <hi>oppoſite number</hi> in the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next is, The late misfortunes and loſſes
of Men, Munition, and honour in our late Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
abroad: Which the more temperate
ſpirits impute to want of Councel, and the more
ſublime wits to practiſe.</p>
                  <p>They begin with the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and by
the <hi>fault</hi> of the <hi>loſs there,</hi> on the <hi>improved
credit of Gondomar,</hi> diſtruſting him for the
ſtaying of ſupplyes to Sir <hi>Horace Vere,</hi> when
<hi>Colonell</hi> Cecill was caſt on that imployment, by
which the King of Spain became Maſter of the
King's Children's Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Count-Mansfield</hi> had a Royal
Supply of Forces, to aſſiſt the <hi>Princes</hi> of our
part, for the Recovery thereof: either plot
or error <hi>defeated</hi> the <hi>Enterprize</hi> from Us, to

                  <p>That Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield's expedition</hi>

                  <p>The ſpending of ſo much <hi>Munition, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>

<hi>Spain (our antient enemy)</hi> that the <hi>Parliament
petitioned and gave ſupply</hi> to ſupport, upon
our <hi>Ally</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> and ſoon after, a new &amp;
happy Tye gave much talk that we were not
ſo doubtful of <hi>Spain</hi> as many wiſh; ſince
it was held, not long ago, a fundamental
Rule <hi>of Their ſecurity</hi> and <hi>Our's,</hi> by the old
Lord <hi>Treaſurer Burleigh:</hi> That nothing can
prevent the <hi>Spaniſh Monarchy,</hi> but a faſtneſs
of the two <hi>Princes,</hi> whoſe <hi>Amity</hi> gave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and courage to the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and
<hi>German Princes</hi> to make head againſt his
<hi>Ambition.</hi> And we ſee, by this diſ-union
a fearful defeat hath happened to <hi>Denmark</hi>
and that party, to the great advantage of
the <hi>Auſtrian Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far of the Waſte of publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in fruitleſs Expeditions: An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
cauſe to hinder any new <hi>ſupply</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
Another fear that may diſturb the
ſmooth and ſpeedy paſſage of the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> is the late waſte of the
Kind's <hi>Lively-hood;</hi> Whereby is like (as in
former times) to ariſe this Jealouſie &amp; fear:
<hi>That when he hath not of his own to ſupport his
ordinary charge (for which the Lands of the
Crown were ſetled unalterable, and called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum
Patrimonium Principis) that then he muſt
of neceſſity reſt on thoſe Aſſiſtances of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which ever were only collected &amp; conſigned
for the Common-Wealth. From hence is is like,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65928:163"/>
there will be no great labour or ſtiffneſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
his Majeſty to an act of Reſumption;</hi> ſince
ſuch deſires of the State have found an eaſie
way in the will of all the Princes from the
<hi>third Henry</hi> to the laſt. But that which is like
to paſs deeper into their diſputes and care,
is the late preſſures they ſuppoſe to have
been done upon the publick libertie and
freedom of the Subject, in commanding
their Goods without aſſent by Parliament,
confining their perſons without eſpecial
cauſe declared; and that made good againſt
them by the Judges lately; and pretending
a Writ to command their attendance in a
Forreign War: All which they are likely
to enforce, as repugnant to many poſitive
laws, and Cuſtomary Immunities of this
Common-Wealth.</p>
                  <p>And theſe dangerous diſtruſts, to the
people are not a little improved by this
un-exemplified courſe (as they conceive)
of retaining an Inland Army in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon,
when former times of greateſt fear,
as 88. produced no ſuch; and makes them
(in their diſtracted fears) to conjecture
(idly) it was raiſed wholly to ſubvert
their fortunes to the will of power, more
then of Law; and ſo make good ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breaches upon their liberties and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
at home, rather then defend us from
any force abroad.</p>
                  <p>How far ſuch jealouſies, if they meet
with an unuſual diſorder of lawleſs Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
or an apt diſtemper of the looſe and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65928:164"/>
needy multitude, which will eaſily turn
away upon any occaſion in the State that
they can ſide withal, to a glorious pretence
of Religion and publick ſafety, when their
true intent will be onely Rapine of the rich,
and ruine of all, is worthy a provident and
preventing care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have thus far delivered (with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
you pleaſed to admit) ſuch difficulties
as I have taken up amongſt the multitude,
as may arreſt, if not remove Impediments to
any ſpeedy ſupply in Parliament at this time.
Which how to facilitate, may better become
the care of your Lordſhips Judgments, then
my Ignorance. Only I could wiſh,that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
away a perſonal diſtaſte of my</hi> Lord <hi>of</hi>
Buckingham <hi>amongſt the</hi> People, he might be
pleaſed (if there be a neceſſity of Parliament) to
appear a firſt Adviſer thereunto: &amp; what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty, of grace, to
give at ſuch time to his people (which I wiſh to be
grounded by Preſident of his beſt and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Progenitors, <hi>&amp;</hi> which I conceive will
largly ſatisfy the deſires &amp; hopes of all) If it may
appear in ſome ſort to be drawn down from him to
the People, by the zealous care &amp; induſtry that
my <hi>L.</hi> of Buck hath of the publick unity &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
by which there is no doubt that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
not only ſecure from any further quarrel
with them, but merrit an happy memory amongſt
them of a zealous Patriot. For to expiate the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the people at ſuch a time with ſacrifice of
any his Majeſties Servants, I have ever found
it (as in E. the 2. R. the 2. and H. 6.) no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Alour towards Men, is
an Emblem of Ability;
towards Women, a
Good quality ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a better. Nothing
draws a Woman like to
it. Nothing is more
behoveful for that Sex: for from it they
receive Protection, and in a free way too,
without any danger. Nothing makes a
ſhorter cut to obtaining: for a Man of
Arms is alwayes void of Ceremony, which
is the Wall that ſtands betwixt <hi>Piramus</hi>
and <hi>Thisby,</hi> that is Man, and Woman:
For there is no Pride in Women but
that which rebounds from our own
Baſeneſs (as Cowards grow Valiant upon
thoſe that are more Cowards) So that
only by our pale asking we teach them
to deny; and by our ſhamefac'dneſs we
put them in mind to be modeſt. Whereas
indeed it is cunning Rhetorick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the hearers that they are that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
which the world would have them
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65928:166"/>
to be. This kind of Baſhfulneſs is far
from Men of valourous diſpoſition, and
eſpecially from Souldiers: for ſuch are
ever men (without doubt) forward and
Confident, loſing no time left they
ſhould loſe Opportunity, which is the
beſt Factor for a Lover. And becauſe they
know Women are given to diſſemble, they
will never believe them when they deny.
Certainly before this age of Wit and
wearing Black, brake in upon us, there
was no way known to win a Lady, but
by Tilting, Turneying, and Riding to
ſeek Adventures through dangerous
Forreſts: In which time theſe ſlender
Striplings with little Legs were held but
of Strength enough to marry their Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
And even in our days, there
can be given no reaſon of the inundation
of Servingmen upon their Miſtreſſes, but
onely that uſually they carry their Maſters
Weapons, and their Valour. To be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
handſome, juſt, learned, and
well favoured, all this carries no danger
with it. But it is better to be admitted to
the title of Valiant acts: at leaſt that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the venturing of Mortality; and all
Women delight to hold him ſafe in their
Arms who hath eſcaped thither through
many dangers. To ſpeak 2t once; Man
hath a priviledge in Valour. In Cloaths
and good Faces we do but imitate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and many of that Sex will not
think much (as far as an anſwer goes)
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65928:166"/>
to diſſemble Wit too. So then theſe neat
Youths, theſe Women in Mens Apparell,
are too near a Woman to be beloved of
her; they be both of a Trade, but he of
grim aſpect, and ſuch a one a Laſs dares
take, and will deſire hint for Newneſs
and Variety. A Scar in a Mans face, is the
ſame that a Mole is in a Womans, and a
Mole in a Womans is a jewel ſet in White,
to make it ſeem more white. So a Scar
in a Man is a mark of honour, and no
blemiſh, for 'tis a Scar and a blemiſh in
a Souldier to be without one. Now as
for all things elſe which are to procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

love, as a good Face, Wit, Cloaths,
or a good Body; each of them (I muſt
needs ſay) works ſomewhat for want
of a better; that is, if Valour corri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if it be on a Coward that is baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
the utmoſt of it is to be kiſt; which
rather increaſeth than quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>beth Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
He that ſendeth her Gifts, ſends
her word alſo, that he is a Man of ſmall
Gifts otherwiſe; for wooing by ſigns
and tokens, implies the Author dumb.
And if <hi>Ovid</hi> (who writ the Law of Love)
were alive, as he is extant, and would
allow it as a good diverſity; then Gifts
ſhould be ſent as Gratuities; not as
Bribes; and Wit would rather get pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
than Love. Wit is not to be ſeen,
and no Woman takes advice of any in her
Loving, but of her own Eyes, or her
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65928:167"/>
Wayting Woman: nay, which is worſe,
Wit is net to be felt, and ſo no good
Bedfellow. Wit applyed to a Woman
makes her diſſolve her ſimperings, and
diſcover her Teeth with Laughter; and
this is ſurely a purge for Love: for the
beginning and original of Love is a kind
of fooliſh Melancholly. As for the Man
that makes his Taylor his Bawde, and
hopes to inveagle his Love with ſuch a
coloured Suit, ſurely the ſame man
deeply hazzards the loſſe of her Favour
upon every Change of his Cloaths. So
likewiſe the other that Courts her ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a good Body, let me tell him
that his Cloaths ſtand alwayes betwixt
his Miſtriſs eyes and him. The Comlineſs
of Cloaths depends upon the Comlineſs
of the Body, and ſo both upon Opinion.
She that hath been ſeduced by Apparell,
let me give her to wit, that men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
put off their Cloaths before they
go to bed; and let her that hath been
inamoured of her Servants Body, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that if ſhe ſaw him in a skin of
Cloath (that is, in a ſuit made to the
pattern of his body) ſhe would diſcern
ſlender cauſe to Love him ever after.
There are no Cloaths fit ſo well in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
eye, as a Suit of Steel, though not
of the faſhion: and no man ſo ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth
a Womans Affections, as he that
is the ſubject of Whiſperings, and hath
alwayes ſome 20 ſtories of his own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65928:167"/>
depending upon him Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
me not, I underſtand not by Valour
one that never fights but When he is
backt by Drink or Anger, or hiſſed on
by Beholders; nor one that is deſperate,
nor one that takes away a Servingmans
Weapons, when perhaps they coſt him
his quarters wages; nor one that wears
a privy Coat of defence, and therein is
Confident: for then ſuch as make Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
would be accounted the very ſcum of
the Common-wealth. I intend one of an
even Reſolution, grounded upon Reaſon,
which is alwayes even; having his Power
reſtrained by the Law of not doing
Wrong.</p>

wil write, I know not: For,
as my thoughts have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dwelt long upon one
thing; and ſo my Mind
hath been filled with the
Imagination of things of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
So there is a neceſſity that this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of ſo un-compoſed a Parent muſt
be miſhaped, anſwerable to the Original
from whence it is derived. Somewhat I am
reſolved to write, of ſome Virtues, and ſome
Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, and ſome indifferent things. For,
knowing that a Mans life is a perpetual
Action, which every moment is under one
of theſe three heads; my Imaginations
have ever chiefly tended to find cut the
Natures of theſe things, that I might, (as
much as my Frailty (the inſeperable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of Mans nature) would give me
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65928:170"/>
leave) wear out this Garment of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with as little Inconvenience to my
Soul as I could, and play this Game of
Converſation (in which every one (as
long as he lives) makes one) with the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a fair Gameſter, rather than of
a cunning one.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I will write of Honeſty; not
in its general ſenſe (in which it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all Moral Vertues) but in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in which (according to our phraſe)
it denominates an Honeſt man.</p>
                  <p>Honeſty is a quiet paſſing over the days
of a mans life, without doing Injury to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man.</p>
                  <p>There is required in an Honeſt man, not
ſo much to do every thing as he would
be done unto, as to forbear any thing that
he would not be content to ſuffer; For
the Eſſence of Honeſty conſiſts in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do ill: And to good Acts is a
proper Paſſion, and no Eſſential part of
Honeſty. As Chaſtity is the Honeſty of
Women, ſo Honeſty is the Chaſtity of
Man. Either of them once impaired is
irrecoverable. For a Woman that hath
loſt her Maidenhead, may as eaſily recover
it, as a Man that hath once taken liberty
of being a Knave can be reſtored to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of an Honeſt Man. For Honeſty doth
not conſiſt in the doing of one, or one
thouſand Acts never ſo well; but in ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on the delicate Threds of Life, though
not exceeding Fine, yet free from Bracks,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65928:170"/>
and Staines. We do not call him an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man, but a Wotthy man, that doth
brave eminent Acts: But we give him the
title of an Honeſt man, of whom no man
can truly report any ill.</p>
                  <p>The moſt eminent part of Honeſty is
Truth: not in VVords (though that be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
required) but in the Courſe of
his Life; in his Profeſſion of Friendſhip;
in his Promiſe of Rewards and Benefits to
thoſe that depend upon him; and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acknowledging thoſe good turns that
he receives from any man.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Oppoſite to Honeſty is
Falſhood; and as that is commonly wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon with Cunning and Diſſimulation,
ſo is Honeſty with Diſcretion and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Cuſtome makes ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
falſe; ſome through Impudence,
and too much uſe; and other ſome for
want of Diſcretion, which if they had
had, ſhould have been employed in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it. And there be ſome, in whom
(though it be impoſſible Honeſty ſhould
be a Fault in Society) their indiſcreet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of it, makes it holden for a thing
that's meerly a Vice, a wonderful trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Companion.</p>
                  <p>An Honeſt man is as neer an Aptitude
to become a Friend, as Gold is to become
Coyne: he will melt with good Offices well
done, and will eaſily take the ſtampe of
true Friendſhip; and having once taken
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65928:171"/>
it, though it may be bended and bruiſed,
yet ſtill will keep his ſtamp clean without
Ruſt or Canker, and is not aſhamed to be
encloſed in it, but is contented to have all
his glory ſeen through it onely.</p>
                  <p>It is of it ſelf a Competent Eſtate of
Vertue, able to ſupply all neceſſary parts
of it to a Mans own particular, and a
Man that is born to it, may raiſe himſelf
to an eminency in all Vertues; though
of it ſelf it will not furniſh a Man with
the abilities of doing any glorious thing.
It is pity that Honeſty ſhould be abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the luſtre of all other Vertues.
But if there be ſuch an Honeſty, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Seat for it is the Countrey, where
there will be little need of any greater
Ability, and it will be leaſt ſubject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
And therefore, ſince it is the
Foundation upon which a man may build
that part of his life which reſpects Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
he that builds upon it (let his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be never ſo mean) ſhall be ſure of a
good, though not of a great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whereas letting it periſh, let the
reſt of the Building of his life be never ſo
eminent, it will ſerve but to make the
ruine of his good Name more notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

                     <head>Of Ambition.</head>
                     <p>LOve, Honour, and Praiſe are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Bleſſings of this world: All other
Contents reflect primarily upon the Body:
and pleaſe the Soul onely becauſe they
pleaſe ſome one or more Senſes. But
thoſe therefore only delight the Senſes,
becauſe the Soul by diſcourſe was firſt
pleaſed with them. For in it ſelf there
is more Muſick in a railing Song, thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a good Ayre, than in the confuſed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of the multitude. But becauſe the
Soul, by Diſcourſe, finds this Clamor to be
an argument of the eſtimation which
thoſe that ſo Commend it have of it, it
likes it ſelf better, and rejoyceth the
more init ſelf, becauſe it ſees other men va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
it. For there are two wayes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
the one by Reaſon, and the other
by Witneſs; but the more excellent Proof
is that of Reaſon: For he that can by
Reaſon prove any thing to me makes
his knowledge mine, becauſe by the ſame
Reaſon I am able to prove it to another:
But if 20. men ſhould ſwear to me they
ſaw ſuch a thing, which before I did not
believe; it is true, I ſhould alter mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
not becauſe there appeared any
greater likelihood of the thing; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was unlikely that ſo many men
ſhould lie: And if I ſhould go about to
make others of the fame opinion, I could
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65928:172"/>
not doe it, by telling them I knew it, or
I ſaw it; but all I could ſay, were, I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it; becauſe ſuch and ſuch men told me
they ſaw it. So in the Comfort a man takes
of himſelf (which grows out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of how much it ſelf deſerves to
be beloved) a vertuous wiſe fellow will
take enough Comfort and Joy in himſelf
(though by Misfortune he is troubled to
carry about with him the worlds Ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
by diſcourſing that he is free from
thoſe Slanders that are laid upon him,
and that he hath thoſe Sufficiencies and
Venues which others deny. And on
the contrary ſide, he without deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it (having the good Fortune to
be eſteemed and honoured) will eaſily
be drawn to have a good Opinion of
himſelf; as, out of Modeſty, ſubmitting
his own Reaſon to the teſtimony of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Ambition in it ſelf is no Fault; but
the moſt natural Commendation of the
Soul, as Beautie is of the Bodie: It is
in Men, as Beauty is in Women. For,
as to be naturally exceeding handſome,
is the greateſt Commendation of that
Sex, and that for which they moſt
deſire to be Commended; ſo that Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by which Men deſire Honour the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way (which conſiſts in doing honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and good Acts) is the root of the
moſt perfect Commendation that a Morall
Man is capable of.</p>

Thoſe onely offend in their Ambition,
who out of the earthlineſs of their minds
dare not aſpire to that true Honor which
is the eſtimation of a man, being as it were
the Temple wherein Vertue is inſhrin'd;
And therefore ſettle their minds onely upon
attaining Titles and Power; which at
the firſt were, or at leaſt ſhould be the
Mark whereby to diſtinguiſh men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Rate of their Vertues and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
but are now onely Arguments of
a Mans good Fortune, and effects of the
Princes favour.</p>
                     <p>It is true that Power is a brave addition
to a worthy Man; but a Fool, or a Knave
that is powerful, hath (according to the
degree of his Power) juſt that advantage
of a vertuous prudent man, that <hi>Adam,</hi>
before he fell, had of the Angels that
ſtood; an Ability to do more ill.</p>
                     <p>As for Titles (which at firſt were the
marks of Power; and the Rewards of
Vertue) they are now (according to
their name) but like the Titles of Books,
which (for the moſt part) the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things they promiſe, let a Man nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
peruſe them over, the leſs ſubſtance
he ſhall find in them. And the wooden
<hi>Lord</hi> is like the <hi>Logg</hi> that <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave
the Frogs to be their King; it makes a
great noiſe; it prepares an expectation
of great matters, but when they once
perceived it unactive, and ſenleſly lying
ſtill, the wiſer ſort of Frogs began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65928:173"/>
it, and (in fine) every young Frog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
preſumed to leap up and down upon
it.</p>
                     <p>Some few there are, who (leaſt the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of our antient worthy Lords ſhould
be loſt) do preſerve in themſelves the
will and deſire, ſince they want the means,
to do brave and worthy Acts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſay, let a Man by doing worthy
Acts deſerve honour, and though he do
not attain it, yet he is much a happier
man than he that gets it without deſert.
For ſuch a man is before hand with Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and the world ſtill owes him
that honour with his deſerts cry for, and
it hath not paid; VVhereas that man that
hath a great Reputation, without deſerving
it, is behind-hand with the world; and
his honour is but lent, not paid; And
when the world comes to take accompt
of its Applauſe, and finds his Title of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(by which he pretends to it) weak and
broken, it will recall it's Approbation,
and leave him by ſo much the more a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Bankrupt in his good Name, by how
much the Eſtimation of his Wealth that
way was the greater.</p>

                     <p>FOr a Man to be compleatly happy
there is required the Perfection of all
Morall Virtues; And yet this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65928:173"/>
For, Virtues do rather baniſh
Misfortunes, and but ſhew us Joy, than
eſtabliſh Felicity: VVhich is not onely
an utter Alienation from all Affliction,
but an abſolute Fulneſs of Joy. And
ſince the Soul of Man is infinitely more
excellent than any thing elſe it can meet
withal in this VVorld, nothing upon
Earth can ſatisfie it, but in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the greateſt Abundance of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
that the moſt nimble witted Man
can frame to himſelf; For that his Soul
will ſtill have a further Deſire, as unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that it enjoyes. (Therefore
the Perfection of Happineſs conſiſts in
the Love of God; which is onely able to
fill up all the Corners of the Soul with
moſt perfect Joy; and conſequently to
fix all its deſires upon thoſe Celeſtial
Joyes that ſhall never be taken from it.
But this, as it cannot be obtained by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but by unfeigned Prayer, and
the Aſſiſtance and Illumination of Gods
Grace; So is it not my purpoſe to prick
at it. And for that part of Felicity which
is attained to by moral Virtue, I find
that every Virtue gives a Man Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſome kind, and a degree of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too: <hi>viz.</hi>

to begin what his Succeſſors fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finiſhed, in leſſening the ſtrength and
power of his great Lords. And this was
wrought by ſearching into the Regality
