            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou mayeſt (perhaps) wonder why this Relation of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Months ſince taken upon the Oaths and depoſitions of our people that came thence, and preſented to his Majeſty, and the Lords of his Privy Councel, cometh now at laſt to the Preſs, and was not either ſooner publiſhed, or altogether ſuppreſſed. The truth is, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Company have ever been very tender of the antient amity and good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence held between this Realm and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and have been
<pb facs="tcp:57580:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very loath, by divulging of the private Injuries done them by the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> East-<hi>India</hi> Company, to give the leaſt occaſion of any diſtaſte or diſaffection, which might happily grow between theſe two Nations, for the ſake, and on the behalf the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies reſpectively. For which cauſe, although the wrongs and injuries, or rather contumelies done unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> have been as intolerable as manifold; as to ſay nothing of thoſe great heaps of them buried in the <hi>Amneſty</hi> of the Treaty of the year <hi>1619.</hi> and only to point at the general heads of thoſe committed ſince that Treaty, and groſsly contrary to the main intent, and expreſs words and diſpoſition of the ſame: Firſt, in the point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility; the invaſion of the Iſlands of <hi>Lantore</hi> and <hi>Polaroon,</hi> then and before in the quiet poſſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the name of the Crown of

               <hi>England;</hi> the taking of the ſame Iſlands by force; the razing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forts; the binding of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (that had not ſo much as reſiſted them) to ſtakes with ropes about their necks, throt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling them with the ſame, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing their naked Swords about them, as if they would preſently have diſpatched them; then taking them ſo amazed and bound, and tumbling them down the rocks; and after, carrying their cruſhed and bruiſed carcaſſes away in Irons: Secondly, in the point of their uſurped Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; their taking upon them the Conuſance of controverſies between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Indians,</hi> for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters paſſed far without the compaſs of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> pretended juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and executing their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences thereupon by plain force; ſeizing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies goods, fining, impriſoning, ſtocking,
<pb facs="tcp:57580:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yea, whipping our people at a post in the open Market-place, and after, waſhing them with Vinegar and Salt: Thirdly, in point of Partnerſhip with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> their putting great Sums to the Common Account, which were disburſed to the private and ſole behoof of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> giving great Preſents for the glory of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> without conſent of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and making War for the enlargement of their own Dominion, yet bringing the Charge to the Common Account; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with infinite other the like, the particulars whereof would ariſe to a juſt and ample Volume: Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company from time to time contented themſelves with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming His Majeſty, and His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Councel with their grievances privately in Writing, to the end, that neceſſary Relief and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration might be obtained, without publiſhing any thing to the World in
<pb facs="tcp:57580:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Print, thereby to ſtir up or breed ill blood between theſe Nations, which are otherwiſe tyed in ſo many reciprocal Obligations. And the ſame courſe they have hitherto holden alſo in this Crying buſineſs of <hi>Amboyna;</hi> only offering to the <hi>Manes</hi> of their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Country-men, Factors &amp; Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, their effectual Endeavours in a dutiful courſe unto His Majeſty for Juſtice for their Innocent Blood, and Reparation of the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein intereſſed. In which their wonted way they were ſo constant, that they could not be driven out of the ſame by the contrary courſe of ſome of the other Party; that not glutted nor mollified with the Blood of theſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, nor with all the other Sufferings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> publiſhed a Pamphlet in Print in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Language, not only in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this barbarous Butchery, but withal in diſgrace of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57580:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nation, and the Laws and juſtice of the ſame. But behold now further, the ſame Pamphlet, being called in by an Edict of the States General, was yet afterwards tranſlated, and printed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and diſperſed even in this Realm it ſelf, to brave and diſgrace us at our own doors, and in our own Language. This, no <hi>Engliſh</hi> patience can bear: The Blood of the Innocent cryes out againſt it, the Honour of the Nation ſuffereth in it. Wherefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Company is hereby enforced, contrary to their deſire and cuſtom, to have recourſe to the Preſs, to maintain the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe their Country-men and Servants, that loſt their Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; and to acquaint the World with the naked truth of this cauſe, hitherto masked, muffled, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Fog of Factions, Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and crafty Conveyances of the Author of this Pamphlet, and his
<pb facs="tcp:57580:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clients, the Governour and Councel (ſo termed) of <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus acquainted thee, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader, why this Buſineſs was no ſooner publiſhed in Print, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet further, that thou be ſatisfied in an Objection or two more, which common Reaſon will ſuggeſt unto thee. Without doubt, reading this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and being a true Patriot of thine own Country, and a well-willer of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> (as we preſume and wiſh thee to be,) thou wilt wonder how it cometh to paſs, that our Nation, which hath not been wont to receive ſuch diſgraces, ſhould now be ſo weak and unprovided in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as to ſuffer ſuch indignities, and to be ſo groſly overtopped, outraged and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there? as alſo thou wilt no leſs admire, that any of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> Nation, which hath received ſuch and ſo many favours and ſupports from hence, and held ſo good and antient
<pb facs="tcp:57580:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
correſpondence with our Nation, ſhould now offer and commit ſuch odious contumelies on <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, their Partners and Allies by ſpecial Treaty. Herein thou wilt ſoon anſwer thy ſelf, if thou but conſider the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent end and deſign of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies trading in the <hi>Indies,</hi> appearing by their ſeveral courſe and practice reſpectively. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being Subjects of a peaceable Prince, that hath enough of his own, and is therewith content, without affecting of new acqueſts; have aimed at nothing in their Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Trade, but a Lawful and competent gain by Commerce and Traffick with the people of thoſe parts. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have in ſome places builded Forts, and ſetled ſome ſtrength, yet that hath not been done by force or violence, againſt the good will of the Magiſtrates or people of the Country; but with their deſire,
<pb facs="tcp:57580:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conſent, and good liking, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity only of the Trade, and upon the ſaid Magiſtrate and peoples vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary yielding themſelves under the obedience and Sovereignty of the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> their own antient Laws, Cuſtoms and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, nevertheleſs reſerved. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſame <hi>Engliſh</hi> had undoubted confidence in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there alſo trading, eſpecially being lately conjoyn'd with them in the strict Alliance and ſocial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of the year <hi>1619.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attended nothing from them, but the offices of good affection and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe grounds, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company made their equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages anſwerable only to a courſe of Commerce and peaceable Traffick; not expecting any Hoſtility, neither from the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor eſpecially from the <hi>Dutch.</hi> On the other ſide, the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> from the beginning
<pb facs="tcp:57580:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their Trade in the <hi>Indies,</hi> not contented with the ordinary courſe of a fair and free Commerce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded divers Iſlands, took ſome Forts, built others; and laboured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the Conquests of Countries, and the acquiring of new Dominion. By which reaſon, as they were accordingly provided of Shipping, Souldiers, and all Warlike proviſion, as alſo of places of Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz upon the ſhore, and thereby enabled to wrong the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as others: So the coſt and charges of their Shipping, Forts and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, employed upon theſe deſigns, roſe to ſuch an height, as was not to be maintained by the Trade they had in thoſe parts. Wherefore, for a ſupply, they were forced (as ſome of their own Country-men and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in their Company, affirm) to Fiſh with dry Nets, that is to ſay, to pick quarrels of the <hi>Indians</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:57580:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to take their Ships, and make Prize of their Goods. Which yet not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their Charge and Adventure, they proceeded alſo to quarrel with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to debarr them of Trade to free places; and for attempting ſuch Trade, to take theie Ships and Goods. Touching which, when a good Order was ſet by the ſaid Treaty of the year <hi>1619.</hi> yet they ſaw, they could not make their Reckoning to any purpoſe, unleſs they utterly drave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Trade of thoſe parts; thereby to have the whole and ſole Traffick of the commodities of the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in their own hands; and ſo to make the Price at their pleaſure, ſufficient to maintain and promote their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and withal to yield them an ample benefit of their Trading. Which unleſs they can, by this and the like worrying and weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bring to paſs,
<pb facs="tcp:57580:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is eaſie to be judged by thoſe that underſtand any thing of the courſe and ſtate of the Trade of thoſe parts, that albeit their Returns hereafter ſhould prove as great continually, as of late extraordinarily they have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be, yet the main Stock and Eſtate of the Company muſt needs abate and decay by ſome Hundred thouſands of Pounds yearly. Thus, Reader, thou ſeest what hath made us unprovided againſt ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and what now enforceth the <hi>Dutch</hi> Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> Company, or their Servants in the <hi>Indies,</hi> againſt the common <hi>Genius</hi> of their Nation, and the wonted firm affection betwixt theſe two Nations mutually, thus to degenerate and break out into ſuch strange and incredible Outrages againſt their nearest Allies and beſt deſerving Friends.

ſet for the future proceeding of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts of both Companies in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well in the courſe of their Trade and commerce, as otherwiſe. Amongſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other points, it was agreed, Tha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in regard of the great blood-ſhed and coſt, pretended to be beſtowed by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in winning of the Trade o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore in conſequence of this agreement, the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Company planted certain Factories for their ſhare of this Trade; ſome at <hi>Molluccos,</hi> ſome at <hi>Banda,</hi> and ſome at <hi>Amboyna.</hi> Of the two former of theſe, there will be, at this preſent, ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak further; but the laſt will prove the Scene of a ſad Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Amboyna</hi> is an Iſland lying near

               <hi>Seran,</hi> of the circuit of forty leagues, and giveth name alſo to ſome other ſmall Iſlands adjacent. It beareth Cloves; for gathering and buying in whereof, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company for their part, had planted five ſeveral Factories: the head and <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> of all, at the Town of <hi>Amboyna</hi>; and therein firſt Maſter <hi>George Muſchamp,</hi> and afterward Mr. <hi>Gabriel Towerſon,</hi> their Agents with directions over the ſmaller Factories at <hi>Hitto</hi> and <hi>Larica</hi> upon the ſame Iſland, and at <hi>Loho</hi> and <hi>Cambello,</hi> upon a point of their neighbouring Iſland of <hi>Seran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe Iſlands of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the point of <hi>Seran,</hi> the Hollanders have four Forts, the chief of all is at the ſaid Town of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and is very ſtrong, having four Points or Bulwarks with their Curtains, and upon each of theſe Points, ſix great pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance mounted, moſt of them of braſs. The one ſide of this Caſtle is waſhed by the Sea, and the other is divided from the land, with a Ditch of four or five fathom broad, very deep, and ever fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sea. The Garriſon of this Caſtle conſiſteth of about two hundred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57580:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers, and a Company of free Burgers. Beſides theſe, there is alwaies a matter of three or four hundred <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikers</hi> (for ſo they uſually call the free Natives) in the Town, ready to ſerve the Caſtle at an hours warning. There lie alſo in the road (for the moſt part) divers good Ships of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as well for the Guard of the place by Sea, as for the occaſions of Traffick: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief Rendezvouz, as well for the Iſland of <hi>Banda,</hi> as for the reſt of <hi>Amboyna.</hi> Here the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lived; not in the Caſtle, but under protection, in a houſe of their own in the Town; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſafe, as well in reſpect of the ancient bonds of amity between both Nations, as of the ſtrict conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the late Treaty before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>They continued here ſome two years, converſing and trading together with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by vertue of the ſaid Treaty. In which times there fell out ſundry differences and debates between them: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> complaining that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did not onely laviſh away much Money in building, and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57580:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expences, upon the Forts and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and bring large and unreaſonable reckonings thereof to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but alſo did, for their part, pay the Garriſons with Victuals, and Cloath of <hi>Coromondell,</hi> which they put off to the Souldiers at three or four times the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it coſt them, yet would not allow of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies part of the ſame charge, but onely in ready Money; thereby drawing from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (which ought to pay but one third part) more than two thirds of the whole true charge. Hereupon, and upon the like occaſions, grew ſome diſcontents and diſputes, and the complaints were ſent to <hi>Jacatra,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Java Major</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of defence of both Nations there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding: who alſo, not agreeing upon the points in difference, ſent the ſame hither over into <hi>Europe,</hi> to be decided by both Companies here; or, in default of their agreement, by the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Lords the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, according to an Article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the year, 1619. on this behalf. In the mean time the diſcontent between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> about theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57580:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and other differences, continued, and daily encreaſed, untill at laſt there was a ſword found, to cut in ſunder that knot at once, which the tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> could not untie. And this was uſed in manner as followeth.</p>
            <p>About the eleventh of <hi>February</hi> 1622. <hi>Stilo veteri.</hi> A <hi>Japoner</hi> Soldier of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Caſtle of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the night upon the wall, came to the Sentinel (being a <hi>Hollander</hi>) and there, amongſt other talk, asked him ſome queſtions touching the ſtrength of the Caſtle, and the people that were therein. It is here to be noted, that thoſe <hi>Japoners</hi> (of whom there is not thirty in all the Iſland) did, for the moſt part, ſerve the Dutch as Soldiers, yet were not of their truſty bands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lodged in the Caſtle, but upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion called out of the Town to aſſiſt in the watch. This <hi>Japoner</hi> aforeſaid, was for his ſaid conference with the Sentinel, apprehended upon ſuſpition of Treaſon, and put to the Torture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> affirmed) he was brought to confeſs himſelf, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57580:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſundry others of his Countrey-men there, to have contrived the taking of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Hereupon, other <hi>Japoners</hi> were examined and Tortured, as alſo a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, the Guardian of the Slaves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Dutch.</hi> During this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which continued three or four days; ſome of the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> went to and from the Caſtle upon their buſineſs, ſaw the priſoners, heard of their tortures, and of the crime laid to their charge; But all this while ſuſpected not, that this matter did any whit concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having never had any converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>Japoners,</hi> nor with the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> aforeſaid. At the ſame time there was one <hi>Abel Price,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Abel Price <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> Chyrurgion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> priſoner in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle for offering in his Drunkenneſs to ſet a <hi>Dutch</hi> mans houſe on fire. This fellow the <hi>Dutch</hi> took, and ſhewed him ſome of the <hi>Japoners,</hi> whom they had firſt moſt grievouſly tortured, and told him, they had confeſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have been of their confederacy for the taking of the Caſtle; and that if he would not confeſs the ſame, they would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57580:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uſe him even as they had done theſe <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners,</hi> and worſe alſo. Having given him the Torture, they ſoon made him confeſs whatever they asked him. This was the fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> 1622. <hi>Stilo veteri.</hi> Forthwith, about nine of the Clock the ſame morning, they ſent for Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were in the Town, to come to ſpeak with the Governour in the Caſtle: They all went, ſave one that was left to keep the houſe. Being come to the Governour, he told Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> that himſelf and others of his Nation were accuſed of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, to ſurprize the Caſtle, and therefore, untill further Trial were to remain priſoners. Inſtantly alſo they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached him that was left at home in the houſe, took the Merchandize of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Company there, into their own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, by Inventory; and ſeized all the Cheſts, Boxes, Books, Writings, and other things in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon</hi> was committed to his Chamber, with a Guard of <hi>Dutch</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. <hi>Emmanuel Tomſon</hi> was kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Caſtle; the reſt, viz. <hi>John
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57580:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beomont, Edward Collins, William Webber, Ephraim Ramſey, Timothy Johnſon, John Fardo,</hi> and <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> were ſent aboard the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships then riding in Harbour, ſome to one Ship, and ſome to another, and all made faſt in Irons. The ſame day alſo the Governour ſent to the two other Factories in the ſame Iſland, to apprehend the reſt of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> there. So that <hi>Samuel Colſon, John Clark, George Sharrock,</hi> that were found in the Factory at <hi>Hitto,</hi> and <hi>Edward Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, William Webber,</hi> and <hi>John Sadler</hi> at <hi>Larica,</hi> were all brought priſoners to <hi>Amboyna,</hi> the ſixteenth of <hi>February.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which day alſo <hi>John Powl, John We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theral,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ladbrook,</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended at <hi>Cambello,</hi> and <hi>John Beo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, William Grigs,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> at <hi>Loho,</hi> and brought in irons to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi> the twentieth of the ſame moneth. In the mean time the Governour and Fiſcal went to work with the priſoners that were already there: And firſt they ſent for <hi>John Beomont,</hi> and <hi>Timothy John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> from aboard the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the Caſtle, <hi>Beomont</hi> was left with a guard in the Hall, and <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57580:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was taken into another room. Where, by and by, <hi>Beomont</hi> heard him cry out very pitifully; then to be quiet for a little while, and then loud again. After taſte of the torture, <hi>Abel Price</hi> the Chyrurgion, that firſt was examined and tortured, (as is above remembred) was brought in to confront and accuſe him: But <hi>Johnſon</hi> not yet confeſſing any thing, <hi>Price</hi> was quickly carried out, and <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> brought again to the torture; where <hi>Beomont</hi> heard him ſometime cry aloud, then quiet again, then roar afreſh. At laſt, after he had been about an hour in this ſecond examination, he was brought forth wailing and lamenting, all wet, and cruelly burnt in divers parts of his body, and ſo laid aſide in a by-place of the Hall, with a Souldier to watch him that he ſhould ſpeak with no body. Then was <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> brought to examination;<note rend="inter">Emanuel Tomſon <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> not in the room where <hi>Johnſon</hi> had been, but in another, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther from the Hall. Yet <hi>Beo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> being in the Hall, heard him roar moſt lamentably, and many times. At laſt, after an hour and an half ſpent in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57580:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
torturing him, he was carried away into another room another way, ſo that he came not by <hi>Beomont</hi> through the Hall. Next was <hi>Beomont</hi> called in, and being demanded many things, all which he denied with deep Oaths and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was made faſt to be Tortured, a cloath tied about his neck, and two men ready with their Jarres of water to be poured on his head. But yet for this time the Governour bad looſe him, he would ſpare him a day or two, becauſe he was an old man. This was all Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days work, the fifteenth of <hi>February</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Upon Sunday the ſixteenth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, William Webber, Edward Collins, Ephraim Ramſey,</hi> and <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> were fetcht from aboard the <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to be examined.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57580:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all in order as the Fiſcal asked him.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Edward Collins</hi> called in,<note rend="inter">Edward Collins <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> and told, that thoſe that were formerly examined, had confeſs'd him as acceſſary to the Plot of taking the Caſtle. Which when he denied with great Oaths and execrations, they made his hands and feet faſt to the Rack, bound a cloath about his throat, ready to be put to the torture of water. Thus prepared, he prayed to be reſpited, and he would confeſs all. Being let down, he again vowed and proteſted his innocency; yet ſaid, that becauſe he knew that they would by torture make him confeſs any thing, though never ſo falſe, they ſhould do him a great favour, to tell him what they would have him ſay, and he would ſpeak it, to avoid the torture. The Fiſcal hereupon ſaid, What, do you mock us? and bad, Up with him again; and ſo gave him the torment of water: which he not able long to endure, prayed to be let down again to his Confeſſion. Then he deviſed a little with himſelf, and told them, That about two moneths and a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57580:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
half before, himſelf, <hi>Tomſon, Johnſon, Brown,</hi> and <hi>Fardo,</hi> had plotted, with the help of the <hi>Japoners,</hi> to ſurprize the Caſtle. Here he was interrupted by the Fiſcal, and asked, whether Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> were not of that conſpiracy. He anſwered, No. You lie, ſaid the Fiſcal; did not he call you all to him, and tell you, that thoſe daily abuſes of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> had cauſed him to think of a Plot, and that he wanted nothing but your conſent and ſecrecy? Then ſaid a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, one <hi>John Jooſt</hi> that ſtood by, Did not you all ſwear upon a Bible to be ſecret to him? <hi>Collins</hi> anſwered with great Oaths, that he knew nothing of any ſuch matter. Then they bad make him faſt again: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he then ſaid, All was true that they had ſpoken. Then the Fiſcal asked him, whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the reſt of the Factories, were not conſenting to this Plot. He anſwered, No. The Fiſcal then asked him, whether the Preſident of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Welden</hi> Agent in <hi>Banda,</hi> were not Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or privy to this buſineſs. Again he anſwered, No. Then the Fiſcal asked
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57580:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, by what means the <hi>Japoners</hi> ſhould have executed their purpoſe. Whereat, when <hi>Collins</hi> ſtood ſtaggering and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſome probable fiction, the Fiſcal holp him, and ſaid, Should not two <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners</hi> have gone to each Point of the Caſtle, and two to the Governours Chamber door; and when the hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burly had been without, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour coming to ſee what was the matter, the <hi>Japoners</hi> to have killed him? Here one that ſtood by, ſaid to the Fiſcal, Do not tell him what he ſhould ſay, but let him ſpeak of himſelf. Whereupon the Fiſcal, without attending the anſwer to his former queſtion, asked what the <hi>Japoners</hi> ſhould have had for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Collins</hi> anſwered, 1000 Ryals apiece. Laſtly, he asked him, when this Plot ſhould have been effected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, although he anſwered him nothing, (not knowing what to deviſe upon the ſudden) yet he was diſmiſſed, and very glad to come clear of the Torture, though with certain belief that he ſhould dye for this his confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Next was <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> brought in,<note rend="inter">Samuel Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> being newly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57580:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
arrived from <hi>Hitto,</hi> as is before touched, and was the ſame day brought to the Torture, who, for fear of the pain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſaw <hi>Collins</hi> come out, in ſuch a caſe, that his eyes were almoſt blown out of his head with the Torment of water; choſe rather to confeſs all they asked him: and ſo was quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, coming out weeping, lamenting, and proteſting his innocency.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>John Clark,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">John Clark <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> that came with <hi>Colſon</hi> from <hi>Hitto,</hi> fetcht in, and a little after was heard (by the reſt that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the Hall) to cry out amain: They Tortured him with water and with fire, by the ſpace of two hours. The manner of his Torture (as alſo of <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and <hi>Tomſons</hi>) was as followeth: Firſt they hoiſed him up by the hands with a cord on a large door, where they made him faſt upon two ſtaples of Iron, fixt on both ſides at the top of the door poſts, haling his hands one from the other as wide as they could ſtretch. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus made faſt, his feet hung ſome two foot from the ground; which alſo they ſtretcht aſunder as far as they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57580:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would retch, and ſo made them faſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath unto the door-trees on each ſide. Then they bound a cloath about his neck and face ſo cloſe, that little or no water could go by. That done, they poured the water ſoftly upon his head, untill the cloath was full up to the mouth and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and ſomewhat higher; ſo that he could not draw breath, but he muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſuck in the water: which being ſtill continued to be poured in ſoftly, forced all his inward parts, came out of his noſe, ears, and eyes, and often as it were ſtifling and choaking him, at length took away his breath, and brought him to a ſwoun or fainting. Then they took him quickly down, and made him vomit up the water. Being a little recovered, they triced him up again, and poured in the water as before, eftſoons taking him down as he ſeemed to be ſtifled. In this manner they handled him three or four ſeveral times with water, till his body was ſwoln twice or thrice as big as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes ſtaring and ſtrutting out beyond his forehead: yet all this he bare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confeſſing any thing; inſomuch as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57580:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fiſcal and tormentors reviled him, ſaying that he was a Devil, and no man, or ſurely was a Witch, at leaſt had ſome charm about him, or was enchanted, that he could bear ſo much. Wherefore they cut off his hair very ſhort, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had ſome witchcraft hidden therein. Afterwards they hoiſed him up again as before, and then burnt him with lighted Candles in the bottom of his feet, untill the fat dropt out the Candles; yet then applied they freſh lights unto him. They burnt him alſo under the elbows, and in the palms of the hands; likewiſe under the arm pits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his inwards might evidently be ſeen. At laſt when they ſaw he could of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf make no handſome confeſſion, then they led him along with queſtions of particular circumſtances, by themſelves framed. Being thus wearied and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the torment, he anſwered, yea, to whatſoever they ask'd: whereby they drew from him a body of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to this effect; to wit, That Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon</hi> had upon New-years day laſt before, ſworn all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi> to be ſecret and aſſiſtant to a plot
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57580:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he had projected, with the help of the <hi>Japoners,</hi> to ſurprize the Caſtle, and to put the Governour and the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Death.</p>
            <p>Having thus martyred this poor man, they ſent him out by four Blacks: who carried him between them to a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where he lay five or ſix dayes, without any Chyrurgion to dreſs him, untill (his fleſh being putrified) great Maggots dropt and crept from him, in a moſt loathſom and noiſom manner. Thus they finiſhed their Sabbath dayes work; and it growing now dark, ſent the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (that came that day from <hi>Hitto,</hi> and till then attended in the Hall) firſt to the Smith's ſhop, where they were loaden with Irons, and then to the ſame loathſom Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where <hi>Clark</hi> and the reſt were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the poor <hi>Japoners,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the putrefaction of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The next morning being Munday the ſeventeenth of <hi>February,</hi> Old Stile, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Griggs,</hi> and <hi>John Fardo,</hi> with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Japoners,</hi> were brought into the place of examination.</p>

At laſt being triced up, and drenched with water till his inwards were ready to crack, he anſwered affirmatively to all the Fiſcals interrogatories: yet as ſoon as he was let down, he clearly demonſtrated to

Captain <hi>Newport,</hi> and <hi>Johnſon</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, then alſo preſent, that theſe things could not be ſo. Nevertheleſs he was forced to put his hand to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or elſe he muſt to the torture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which to avoid, he ſubſcribed; and ſo had a great iron bolt and two ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckles rivitted to his legs, and then was carried back to priſon.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>George Sharrock</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant at <hi>Hitto,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">George Sharrock <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> was called in queſtion; who, ſeeing how grievouſly others were martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made his earneſt Prayer to God (as ſince upon his Oath he hath acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that he would ſuffer him to make ſome ſuch probable lies againſt himſelf, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> might believe, and ſo he might eſcape the torment. Being brought to the Rack, the Water provided, and the Candles lighted, he was by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Fiſcal examined, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Conſpiracy. He fell upon his knees, and proteſted his Innocency. Then they commanded him to the Rack, and told him; Unleſs he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, he ſhould be tormented with fire and water to death, and then ſhould be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57580:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drawn by the heels to the Gallows, and there hanged up. He ſtill perſiſting in this his innocency, the Fiſcal bad him be hoiſed up. Then he craved reſpite a while and told them, that he was at <hi>Hitto,</hi> and not in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> upon New-years day, when the conſultation was pretended; neither had been there ſince <hi>November</hi> before, as was well known to ſundry of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there alſo with him. Hereupon they commanded him again to the Rack: but he, craving reſpite as before, now told them, that he had many times heard <hi>John Clark</hi> (who was with him at <hi>Hitto</hi>) ſay, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> had done them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unſufferable wrongs, and that he would be revenged of them: to which end, he had once broken with Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> of a Plot. At which word the Fiſcal and the reſt were attentive, encouraging him to proceed. So he went on, ſaying, that <hi>John Clark</hi> had intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> that he might go to <hi>Maccaſſer,</hi> there to conſult and adviſe with the Spaniards to come with Gallies, and rob the ſmall Factories of <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Seran,</hi> when no ſhips were there.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57580:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Here they asked him, what Cap. <hi>Towerſon</hi> ſaid to this, He anſwered, that Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> was very much offended with <hi>Clark</hi> for the motion; and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth could never abide him. Hereupon the Fiſcal called him Rogue, and ſaid he prated all from the matter, and ſhould go to the torture. He craved favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and began another tale; to wit, That upon Twelf-day then laſt paſt, <hi>John Clark</hi> told him at <hi>Hitto,</hi> that there was a practiſe to take the Caſtle of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi>; and asked him, whether he would conſent thereunto. Whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Clark,</hi> whether Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> knew of any ſuch matter. Which, <hi>Clark</hi> affirming; then he (the ſaid <hi>Sharrock</hi>) ſaid, that he would do as the reſt did. Then the Fiſcal asked him, what time the conſultation was held: He anſwered, In <hi>November</hi> laſt. The Fiſcal ſaid, That could not be: for, the conſultation was upon New-years day. The Priſoner ſaid as before in the beginning, that he had not been in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi> ſince the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> till now that he was brought thither. Why then quoth the Fiſcal, have you belied your
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57580:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelf? whereto the Priſoner reſolutely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that all that he had ſpoken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any treaſon, was falſe, and feigned onely to avoid torment. Then went the Fiſcal out into another room to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and anon returned, and ſent <hi>Sharrock,</hi> unto the Priſon again. The next day he was called again, and a writing preſented him; wherein was framed a formal confeſſion of his laſt conference with <hi>Clark</hi> at <hi>Hitto,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plot to take the Caſtle of <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>: which being read over to him, the Fiſcal asked him, whether it were true, or no. He anſwered, No, Why then, ſaid the Fiſcal, did you confeſs it? He anſwered, for fear of Torment. The Fiſcal and the reſt in a great rage told him he lied; his mouth had ſpoken it, and it was true, and therefore he ſhould ſubſcribe it. Which as ſoon as he had done, he fell preſently into a great paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, charging them bitterly to be guilty of the innocent blood of himſelf and the reſt, which they ſhould look to anſwer for at the day of Judgment: withall he grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the Fiſcal, and would have ſtopped him from carrying in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57580:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Governour, with whom he alſo craved to ſpeak; but was inſtantly laid hold on, and carried away to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

               <hi>William Webber,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">William Webber <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> being next examined, was told by the Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that <hi>John Clark</hi> had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to have been at <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> on New years day, and ſworn to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon</hi>'s plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which he denied, alledging, he was that day at <hi>Larica</hi>: yet being brought to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he then confeſſed, he had been at the conſultation at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> upon New-years day, with all the reſt of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in order as he was asked. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo further told them, he had received a Letter from <hi>John Clark</hi>; after which was a Poſtſcript, excuſing his brief writing at that time, for that there was great buſineſs in hand. But one <hi>Renier</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, then ſtanding by, told the Governour, that upon New-years day, the time of this pretended conſultation, <hi>Webber</hi> and he were merry at <hi>Larica.</hi> So the Governour left him and went out. But the Fiſcal held on upon the other point, touching the Poſtſcript of <hi>Clark</hi>'s
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57580:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Letter, urging him to ſhew the ſame. Which when he could not do, though often terrified with the torture, he gave him reſpite; promiſing to ſave his life, if he would produce that Letter.</p>
            <p>Then was Captain <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> brought to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note rend="inter">Gabriel Towerſon <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> and ſhewed what others had confeſſed of him. He deeply proteſting his innocency, <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> was brought to confront him: who being told, that unleſs he would now make good his former confeſſion againſt Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> he ſhould to the Torture, coldly re-affirmed the ſame, and ſo was ſent away. They alſo brought <hi>William Griggs</hi> and <hi>John Fardo</hi> to juſtifie their former confeſſions to his face. Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> ſeriouſly charged them, that as they would anſwer it at the dreadfull day of Judgement, they ſhould ſpeak nothing but the truth. Both of them inſtantly fell down upon their knees before him, praying him for Gods ſake to forgive them, and ſaying further openly before them all, that whatſoever they had formerly confeſſed, was moſt falſe, and ſpoken only to avoid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57580:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
torment. With that the Fiſcal and the reſt offered them again to the torture: which they would not endure, but then affirmed their former confeſſions to be true.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Colſon</hi> (who had accuſed Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon</hi> before) was required to ſet his hand to his confeſſion, he asked the Fiſcal, upon whoſe head he thought the ſin would lie: whether upon his that was conſtrained to confeſs what was falſe, or upon the conſtrainers? The Fiſcal, after a little pauſe upon this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, went in to the Governour then in another room; but anon returning, told <hi>Colſon</hi> he muſt ſubſcribe it: which he did; yet withall made this proteſtation: Well, quoth he, you make me to accuſe my ſelf and others of that which is as falſe, as God is true: for, God is my witneſs, I am as innocent as the child new born.</p>
            <p>Thus have they examined all that belong to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in the ſeveral Factories of the Iſland of <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>John Wetheral,</hi> Factor at <hi>Cambello</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Seran.</hi> He confeſſed, he was at <hi>Amboyna</hi> upon New-years day: but for the conſultation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was demanded, he ſaid he knew of no other, but touching certain cloath of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, that lay in the Factories rotting and worm-eaten, which they adviſed together how to put off to the beſt avail of their Imployers. The Governour ſaid, they queſtioned him not about cloath, but of Treaſon: whereof when he had proteſted his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, he was for that time diſmiſſed. But the next day he was ſent for again, and Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and accuſe him, having before (it ſeems) confeſſed ſomewhat againſt him. But Mr. <hi>Towerſon</hi> ſpake now theſe words only: Oh, Mr. <hi>Wetheral,</hi> Mr. <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theral,</hi> ſpeak the truth, and nothing but the truth, as God ſhall put into your heart. So Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> was put out again, and <hi>Wetheral</hi> brought to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water with great threats; if wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would not make him confeſs, fire ſhould. He prayed them to tell him what he ſhould ſay, or to write down
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57580:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what they would, he would ſubſcribe it. They ſaid, he needed no Tutor; they would make him confeſs of himſelf. But when they had triced him up four ſeveral times, and ſaw he knew not what to ſay, then they read him other mens confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and asked him from point to point, as they had done others: and he ſtill anſwered, Yea, to all.</p>

doth nothing diſmay me; for, God (I truſt) will be merciful to my ſoul, according to the innocency of my cauſe.

            <p>The ſix and twentieth of <hi>February, Stilo veteri,</hi> the Priſoners were all brought into the great Hall of the Caſtle (except Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi>) to be prepared for death by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The <hi>Japoneers</hi> now all in general, as ſome of them had done before in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, cryed out unto the Engliſh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Oh you Engliſh men, where did we ever in our lives eat with you, talk with you, or (to our remembrance) ſee you? The Engliſh anſwered, Why then have you accuſed us? The poor men, perceiving they were made believe each had accuſed others, before they had ſo done indeed; ſhewed them their tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies, and ſaid, If a ſtone were thus burnt, would it not change his Nature, how much more we that are Fleſh and Blood?</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were all in the Hall, Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain <hi>Towerſon</hi> was brought up into the place of examination and two great Jar<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

there did or ſuffered was unknown to the Engliſh without: but it ſeemeth they made him then to underwrite his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After ſupper <hi>John Powl, Ephraim Ramſey, Thomas Ladbrook,</hi> and <hi>John Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> who were found not guilty, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, were taken from the reſt, and put into another room. By and by alſo were <hi>Samuel Colſon,</hi> and <hi>Edward Collins</hi> brought from the reſt; into the room where <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> lay: The Fiſcal told them, it was the Governours mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to ſave one of them three: and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferent to him, which of them, were the man, it was his pleaſure they ſhould draw lots for it, which they did, and the free lot fell to <hi>Edward Collins</hi>; who then was carried away to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where <hi>John Powl,</hi> and the reſt that were quit, lodged, and <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> back into the Hall. Anon alſo <hi>John Beo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> was brought out of the Hall into the Chamber, where <hi>John Powl,</hi> and the reſt of the acquitted perſons were, and was told, that he was beholding to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Johnſon</hi> the Dutch Merchant of <hi>Loho,</hi> and to the Secretary; for they two had begged his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57580:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>So then there remained in the Hall ten of the Engliſh; for Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Tomſom</hi> (as is ſaid before) were kept in ſeveral rooms apart from the reſt. To theſe that remained in the Hall, came the Dutch Miniſters, who telling them how ſhort a time they had to live, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and exhorted them to make their true confeſſions; for it was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſperate thing, to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at ſuch a time. The Engliſh ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their innocency, and prayed the Miniſters that they might all receive the Sacraments, as a ſeal of the forgiveneſs of their ſins; and withal, thereby to confirm their laſt profeſſion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. But this would by no means be granted. Whereupon <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> ſaid thus unto the Miniſters; You ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto us the danger of diſſimulation in this caſe. But tell us, if we ſuffer guiltleſs, being otherwiſe alſo true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſt Jeſus, What ſhall be our reward? The Preacher anſwered, By how much the clearer you are, ſo much the more glorious ſhall be your reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: With that word, <hi>Colſon</hi> ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, imbraced the Preacher, and gave
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57580:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him his purſe, with ſuch money as he had in it, ſaying; <hi>Domine,</hi> God bleſs you: tell the Governour, I freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; and I intreat you, to exhort him, to repent of his bloody Tragedy, wrought upon us poor innocent ſouls. Here all the reſt of the Engliſh ſignified their conſent to this Speech. Then ſpake <hi>John Fardo</hi> to the reſt, in preſence of the Miniſters, as followeth: My Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Brethren, all that are here with me, condemned to die; I charge you all, as you will anſwer it at Gods Judgment Seat, if any of you be guilty of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof we are condemned, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your Conſciences, and confeſs the truth for ſatisfaction of the World. Hereupon <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> ſpake with a loud voice, ſaying, According to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in this treaſon, ſo Lord pardon all the reſt of my ſins: and if I be guilty thereof more or leſs, let me never be partaker of thy heavenly joys. At which words, every one of the reſt cried out, Amen for me, Amen for me, good Lord. This done, each of them knowing whom he had accuſed, went one to another beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forgiveneſs for their falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57580:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being wrung from them by the pains or fear of torture. And they all freely forgave one another: for none had been ſo falſly accuſed, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had accuſed another as falſly. In particular, <hi>George Sharrock</hi> (who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to relate this nights paſſage) kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to <hi>John Clark,</hi> whom he had accuſed of the tale at <hi>Hitto</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and craved forgiveneſs at his hands. <hi>Clark</hi> freely forgave him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; how ſhould I look to be forgiven of God, if I ſhould not forgive you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf ſo falſly accuſed Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> and others?</p>
            <p>After this, they ſpent the reſt of the doleful night in Prayer, ſinging of Pſalms, and comforting one another; though the Dutch that guarded them, offered them wine, bidding them drink <hi>Luſlick,</hi> and drive away the ſorrow; according to the cuſtom of their own Nation in the like caſe, but contrary to the Nature of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Upon the morrow morning, being the Execution day, the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Stilo veteri, John Powl</hi> being freed (as is above recited) came into the room
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57580:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the condemned perſons were, and found them at Prayer. They all requeſted him to relate unto their friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the innocency of their cauſe; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it upon their deaths, that what they had confeſſed againſt themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, touching this crime, was all falſe, and forced by fear of torture.</p>
            <p>The ſame morning <hi>William Webber</hi> was called again into the Fiſcals room, and there preſſed to produce the Letter, which he had before confeſſed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>John Clark,</hi> in the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> whereof ſome great buſineſs was intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They promiſed him his life, if he would deliver or produce them that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which although he did not, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could, yet at laſt they pardoned him, and ſent him to the reſt that were ſaved, and <hi>Sharrock</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>That morning <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>John Beomont</hi> was pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made means to have him come and ſpeak with him; which, with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, he obtained. <hi>Beomont</hi> found him ſitting in a Chamber, all alone in a moſt miſerable faſhion; the wounds of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bound up, but the matter and gore-blood
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57580:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iſſuing through the Rollers. He took Mr. <hi>Beomont</hi> by the hand, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, when he came into <hi>England</hi> to do his duty to the Honourable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, his Maſters, to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and to his Brother <hi>Billingſley,</hi> and to certifie them of his innocency, which (ſaid he) you your ſelf know well enough.</p>
            <p>All things being prepared for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the condemned were brought forth of the Hall along by the Chamber where the quit and pardoned were; who ſtood in the door, to give and take the farewell of their Countrey-men now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Execution. Staying a little for this purpoſe, they prayed and charged thoſe that were ſaved, to bear witneſs to their friends in <hi>England</hi> of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and that they died not Traitors, but ſo many innocents, meerly murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom they prayed God to forgive their blood-thirſtineſs, and to have mercy upon their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Being brought into the Yard, their ſentence was there read unto them from a Gallery, and then they were thence carried unto the place of Execution, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57580:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with nine <hi>Japons</hi> and a <hi>Portugal</hi>; not the ordinary and ſhort way, but round about in a long proceſſion, through the Town; the way guarded with five Companies of Soldiers, <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyners,</hi> and thronged with the Natives of the Iſland, that (upon the ſummons given the day before by the ſound of the Drum) flocked together to behold this triumph of the <hi>Dutch</hi> over the <hi>Engliſh. Samuel Colſon</hi> had conceived a Prayer in writing, in the end whereof he proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his innocency: which Prayer he read to his fellows the night before, and now alſo at the place of Execution devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced the ſame; then threw away the paper, which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour cauſed to be brought to him, and kept it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> told the reſt, he did not doubt but God would ſhew ſome ſign of their innocency; and every one of the reſt took it ſeverally upon their death, that they were utterly guiltleſs; and ſo one by one, with great cheerfulneſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the fatal ſtroke.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> prayed over his Beads very devoutly, and often kiſſed the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57580:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Croſs; ſwearing thereupon, that he was utterly innocent of this treaſon: yet confeſſed, that God had juſtly brought this puniſhment upon him, for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a wife in his own Countrey, he had, by the perſwaſion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, taken another in that Countrey, his firſt being yet living.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Japons</hi> likewiſe (according to their Religion) ſhut up their laſt Act with the like profeſſion of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. So there ſuffered ten <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> viz. Captain <hi>Gabriel Towerſon</hi> the Agent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Amboyna, Samuel Colſon</hi> Factor at <hi>Hitto, Emanuel Tomſon</hi> Aſſiſtant at <hi>Amboyna, Timothy Johnſon</hi> Aſſiſtant there alſo, <hi>John Wetheral</hi> Factor at <hi>Cambello, John Clark</hi> Aſſiſtant at <hi>Hitto, William Griggs</hi> Factor at <hi>Larica, John Fardo</hi> Steward of the houſe, <hi>Abel Price</hi> Chyrurgion, and <hi>Robert Brown</hi> Tailor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> alſo ſuffered with them: his name was <hi>Augustin Perez</hi>; he was born at <hi>Bengala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The names of the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (if any be curious to know them) were as followeth:

            <p>Beſides theſe, there were two other <hi>Japoneſes</hi>; the one named <hi>Soyſimo,</hi> born at <hi>Firando</hi>; and the other <hi>Sacoube,</hi> of the ſame place: the former of which being tortured, confeſſed both to have been privy to this pretended treaſon, and to have offered his ſervice unto the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> to aid them in taking of the Caſtle: and the latter confeſſed to have had knowledge of the conſultation of the other <hi>Japons</hi> to this purpoſe. But neither of them was executed, nor ſo much as condemned: The reaſon whereof was not known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſaved.</p>
            <p>They had prepared a cloath of black Velvet, for Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>'s body to fall upon; which being ſtained and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57580:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
defaced with his blood, they afterwards put to the account of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>At the inſtant of the execution, there aroſe a great darkneſs, with a ſudden and violent guſt of wind and tempeſt; whereby two of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, riding in the Harbour, were driven from their Anchors, and with great labour and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſaved from the Rocks. Within a few dayes after, one <hi>William Danckin,</hi> who had told the Governour, That <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Brown,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tailor, had a few Moneths before told him, he hoped that within ſix Moneths the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have as much to do in the Caſtle of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi>: This fellow, coming upon an Evening to the Grave where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were buried, being all (ſave Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>) in one pit, fell down upon the Grave; and having lien there a while, roſe up again ſtark mad, and ſo continued two or three dayes together, and then dyed. Forthwith alſo fell a new ſickneſs at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> which ſwept away about a thouſand people <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyners</hi>: in the ſpace wherein, there uſually dyed not above thirty at other
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57580:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeaſons. Theſe ſigns were by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving <hi>Engliſh,</hi> referred to the confident prediction of <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, and were by the <hi>Amboyners</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as a token of the wrath of God for this barbarous Tyranny of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day after the execution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eight and twentieth of <hi>February, Stilo veteri,</hi> was ſpent in Triumph for the new General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and in publick rejoycing for the deliverance from this pretended Treaſon. The day following, being the firſt of <hi>March, John Beomont, George Sharrock, Edward Collins,</hi> and <hi>William Webber,</hi> were brought to the Governour; who told <hi>Webber, Beomont,</hi> and <hi>Sharrock,</hi> that they were pardoned in Honour of the new General, and <hi>Collins,</hi> that he was to go to <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> there to ſtand to the favour of the General. So the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour made them drink Wine with him, and courteouſly diſmiſſed them: willing them to go and conſult with the reſt that were ſaved, who were fit to be placed in the ſeveral Factories. Which done, and their opinions reported to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57580:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Governour, he accordingly commanded each to his place; adding, that he would thenceforth take upon him the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Government of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies buſineſs. To which purpoſe, he had within a few dayes paſt, opened a Letter that came from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> directed to Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>; being (as he ſaid) the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Letter that ever he intercepted; further ſaying, that he was glad that he found by that Letter, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra</hi> were innocent touching this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Governour and Fiſcal having thus made an end at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves for <hi>Banda</hi>: where they made very diligent enquiry againſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Welden,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent there; yet found no colour nor ſhadow of guilt to lay hold on: but at laſt entertained him with courteous ſpeeches, profeſſing to be very glad, that they found him, as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> to be without ſuſpicion of this Treaſon, (as they term it.) Captain <hi>Welden,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the diſorder and confuſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies affairs at <hi>Amboyna,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57580:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by means of this dealing of the <hi>Dutch</hi>; forthwith hired a <hi>Dutch</hi> Pinnace at <hi>Banda,</hi> and paſſed to <hi>Amboyna</hi>: where, inſtantly upon his arrival, he re-called the Companies ſervants, ſent (as before) by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governour to the upper Factories.</p>
            <p>Having enquired of them, and the reſt that were left at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> of the whole proceedings lately paſſed, he found, by the conſtant and agreeing relation of them all, that there was no ſuch Treaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as was pretended: as alſo underſtanding what ſtrict command the Governour had given to the ſurviving <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not once to talk or confer with the Countrey people concerning this bloody buſineſs, although the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people every day reproached them with Treaſon, and a bloody intention to have maſſacred the Natives, and to have ripped up the bellies of women with child, and ſuch like ſtuff; wherewith the <hi>Dutch</hi> have poſſeſſed the poor Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, to make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> odious unto them. The ſaid Mr. <hi>Welden</hi> therefore finding it to ſort neither with the honour, nor profit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57580:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Maſters, to hold any longer reſidence in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> he took the poor remnant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> along with him, in the ſaid hired <hi>Pinnace</hi> for <hi>Jaccatra</hi>; whither the Governour had ſent <hi>John Beomont</hi> and <hi>Edward Collins</hi> before, as men condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and left to the mercie of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</p>
            <p>When this heavy news of <hi>Amboyna</hi> came to <hi>Jaccatra</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, the Preſident forthwith ſent to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to know by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the Governour of <hi>Amboyna</hi> had thus proceeded againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and how he and the reſt of the Dutch there at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> did approve theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Governour returned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that, The Governour of <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Authority was derived from that of the Lords States General of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Neatherlands; under whom he had lawful Juriſdiction both in Criminal and Civil cauſes, within the diſtrict of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi>; further, that ſuch proceeding was neceſſary againſt Traitors, ſuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Executed at <hi>Amboyna</hi> might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be by their own confeſſions: a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py whereof he therewith ſent to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

Preſident; who ſent the ſame back to be Authentickly certified, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not again.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath been recited the bare and naked Narration of the Progreſs and paſſage of this action, as it is taken out of the Depoſitions of ſix ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors; whereof four were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the other two acquitted in this Proceſs of <hi>Amboyna</hi>: all, ſince their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> examined upon their Oaths in the Admiralty Court. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>'s, as alſo of <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi>'s examinations and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, are not yet come to light, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that theſe two were kept apart from all the reſt, and each alone by himſelf; nor any other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffered to come to ſpeak with them, except onely that ſhort Farewell, which <hi>John Beomont</hi> took of <hi>Tomſon,</hi> the morning before the Execution before mentioned. The like obſcurity is yet touching the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers of divers of the reſt that are Executed; being, during their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, ſo ſtrictly lookt to, and watched by the Dutch, that they might not talk together, nor mutually relate their miſeries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57580:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>But becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> defend their own proceedings by the confeſſions of the parties executed, acknowledging ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally under their hands, that they were guilty of the pretended crime; it will not be amiſs to recollect and recall unto this place, as it were unto one ſum and total, certain circumſtances diſperſed in ſeveral parts of this Narration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as well the innocency of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the unlawful proceedings againſt them may be manifeſted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore it is to be remembred, that the <hi>Japons</hi> were apprehended, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and tortured three or four dayes, before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were attached; and the ſame as well of their apprehenſion, as torture, was riſe and notorious in the Town of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning. <hi>Tomſom,</hi> in this <hi>interim,</hi> and the very firſt day of the examination of the <hi>Japon,</hi> went to the Caſtle to ask leave of the Governour to land ſome Rice, and brought back the news with him to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe of the cruel handling of theſe poor <hi>Japons.</hi> This had been <hi>Item</hi> enough to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if they had been guilty, to ſhift for themſelves:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57580:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereto alſo they had ready means by the Curricurries or ſmall Boats of the <hi>Amboyners,</hi> which lie along the Strand in great number, wherewith they might eaſily have tranſported themſelves to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> to <hi>Bottom,</hi> or to <hi>Maccaſſer,</hi> out of the reach and Juriſdiction of the <hi>Dutch</hi>: but in that they fled not in this caſe, it is a very ſtrong preſumption, that they were as little privy to any treaſon of their own, as ſuſpicious of any treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train laid for their bloods.</p>
            <p>In the next place let it be conſidered, how impoſſible it was for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to atchieve this pretended enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Amboyna</hi> is of a very great ſtrength (as is before declared;) the Garriſon therein two or three hundred men, beſides as many more of their free Burgers in the Town. What their care and circumſpection in all their Forts is, may appear not onely by the quick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm they now took at the fooliſh queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poor <hi>Japon,</hi> made to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, above recited; but alſo by that which a little before happened at <hi>Jacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> where one of their Soldiers was ſhot to death for ſleeping in the Watch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57580:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>Durſt ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> men (whereof not one a Soldier) attempt any thing upon ſuch a ſtrength and vigilancy? As for the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Japons,</hi> they were but ten neither, and all un-armed, as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: For, as at the ſeizure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe, all the proviſion therein found, was but three ſwords, two Muskets, and half a pound of powder: ſo the <hi>Japons</hi> (except when they are in ſervice of the Caſtle, and there armed by the <hi>Dutch</hi>) are allowed to have no Arms, but onely a <hi>Catan,</hi> a kind of ſhort ſword: and it is forbidden to all the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon great penalty, to ſell any hand-gun, powder or bullets to the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> or <hi>Amboyners.</hi> But let it be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe twenty perſons <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Japons,</hi> were ſo deſperate as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the exploit; how ſhould they be able to maſter the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Caſtle, or to keep poſſeſſion when they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it? what ſecond had they? There was neither Ship nor Pinnace of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> in the Harbor. All the reſt of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> in the Iſland, were not twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not one <hi>Engliſh</hi> more. The neareſt of the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57580:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Banda,</hi> forty Leagues from <hi>Amboyna</hi>; and thoſe but nine perſons, all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cleared by the Governour and Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal themſelves, from all ſuſpition of this pretended crime, as were alſo the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, beſides the ſtrength of the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have three other ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, well furniſhed with Soldiers in the ſame Iſland, and at <hi>Cambello</hi> near adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They had then alſo in the road of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> eight Ships and Veſſels, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Rotterdam</hi> of 1200 Tun, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorn</hi> of 300 Tun, the Free-mans Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of 100 Tun, the <hi>Calck</hi> of 60 Tun, Captain <hi>Gamals Junek</hi> of 40 Tun, the <hi>Flute</hi> of 300 Tun, the <hi>Amſterſtam</hi> of 1400 Tun, and a ſmall Pinnace of about 60 Tun; and all theſe well furniſhed with Men and Ammunition. It is true, that the Stories do record ſundry valiant and hardy enterprizes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and <hi>Holland</hi> is witneſs of ſome of them, yea, hath reaped the fruit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reſolution; yet no Story, no Legend ſcarcely reporteth any ſuch hardineſs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or others, That ſo few
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57580:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſons, ſo naked of all proviſions and ſupplies, ſhould undertake ſuch an adventure upon a counter-party, ſo well and abundantly fitted at all points.</p>
            <p>But let it be further granted, that they might poſſibly have overcome all theſe difficulties; yet to what end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould they put themſelves into ſuch a jeopardy? They knew well enough, that it was agreed between both Companies at home, That the Forts in the <hi>Indies</hi> ſhould remain reſpectively in the hands of ſuch, as had poſſeſſion of them at the date of the Treaty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1619. and that the ſame was ratified by the Kings Majeſty, and the Lords States General. They knew likewiſe, and all the world takes knowledge of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Religious obſervation of Peace and Treaty with all his Neighbours, yea, with all the world: what reward then could theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> hope for, of this their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and danger? Certainly none other than that which is expreſly provided by the Treaty it ſelf, that is, To be puniſhed as the diſturbers of the Common Peace, and Amity of both Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57580:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>But let theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> men have been as fooliſh in this Plot as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> will have them; is it alſo to be imagined, that they were ſo graceleſs, as when they were condemned, and ſeriouſly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the Miniſters to diſcharge their conſciences, yet then to perſiſt in their diſſimulation, being otherwiſe of ſuch godly behaviour, as to ſpend the time in Prayer, ſinging of Pſalms, and ſpiritual comforting one another, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have had them beſtow in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to drive away their ſorrow? Let <hi>Colſons</hi> queſtion to the Miniſter be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: his and the reſts offer and deſire to receive the Sacrament, in ſign and token of their innocency; their mutual asking forgiveneſs for their like falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of one another, forced by the Torture; <hi>Tomſons</hi> laſt farewell to <hi>Beo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont; Colſons</hi> prayer, and his writing in his Prayer-book; <hi>Fardo</hi>'s farewell to <hi>Powl</hi>; alſo his conjuring exhortation to his fellows, to diſcharge their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and all their anſwers thereunto; craving Gods mercy or judgment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their innocency in this cauſe; their general and Religious profeſſion of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57580:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their innocency, as to their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at their laſt parting with them; and finally, the ſealing of this profeſſion with their laſt breath and blood, even in the very Article of death, and in the ſtroke of the Executioner. What horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unexampled diſſimulation were this? If ſome one or more of them had been ſo fearfully deſperate, yet would not there one amongſt ten be found to think of the judgment to come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was then inſtantly ſummoned without Eſſoin, Bail, or Mainpriſe? What? had they hope of reprieve and life, if they kept their countenance to the laſt? Yet what hope had <hi>Tomſon</hi> and the reſt, when Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>'s head was off? Nay, what deſire had <hi>Tomſon</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> to live, being ſo mangled and martyred by the Torture? They were executed one by one, and every one ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral took it upon his death, that he was guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>Now to blanch and ſmooth over all this rough and Barbarous proceeding; it is here given out, that the Governour and Fiſcal found ſuch evidence of the Plot, and dealt ſo evenly in the proceſs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57580:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they ſpared not their own people; having uſed ſome of their Native <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> partakers of this treaſon, in the ſame manner as they did the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But this, as well by the Relation here truly and faithfully ſet down, grounded upon the ſworn Teſtimony of ſix credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witneſſes, as alſo by other ſufficient reports of divers, (lately come out of thoſe parts) appeareth to be a meer tale, not once alledged by any in the <hi>Indies</hi> in many moneths after the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but only invented and diſperſed here, for a <hi>Fucus</hi> and a fair colour upon the whole cauſe, and to make the world believe, that the ground of this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Tyrannous proceeding was a true crime, and not the unſatiable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by this cruel treachery to gain the ſole trade of the <hi>Molluccos, Banda</hi> and <hi>Amboyna,</hi> which is already become the event of this bloody proceſs.</p>
            <p>To adde hereunto by way of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, will be needleſs; the fact is ſo full of odious and barbarous inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, executed by <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, in a place where both
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57580:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lived under terms of Partnerſhip and great amity, confirmed by a moſt ſolemn Treaty.</p>
            <p>Thus you have had an account of the great miſery inflicted upon defenceleſs mortals, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by their fellow Creatures, yea pretended Friends and Allies, the <hi>Dutch</hi>; a miſery indeed as great as their malice could invent, or cruelty purſue and practiſe. For 'tis too probably to be fear'd, by their own contrived accuſations impoſed upon, and extorted from the innocent Sufferers, that their cruelty reached not only to the tranſitory deſtruction of their frail bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but to the eternal ruine alſo of their immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p>A Tyranny ſo execrable, that Heaven would not withhold a ſevere and ſpeedy Vengeance upon the Authors and Actors of it; for thereupon, Firſt, King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, excepted thoſe Murders from the Indempnities that paſſed in thoſe times between us and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Secondly, a ſudden Hurricane or terrible Tempeſt did much dammage to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships in the Haven of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> about the very time
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57580:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this horrid Execution. Thirdly, the firſt informer againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fell down as dead upon the very place where the murder'd men were buried, riſing again diſtracted, in which condition he continued till his dying day. Fourthly, in the year 1630. eighteen <hi>Dutchmen</hi> (whereof three were guilty of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre at <hi>Amboyna</hi>) ſupping at <hi>Frankford</hi> in their way to <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> boaſted how they ſerved our Nation; which one in the company noting, and relating it to two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captains then in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, whoſe Kindred had ſuffered there; the Captains laying in Ambuſh for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with a Troop of Horſe, took them and commanded them to prepare for death; upon which the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively laid their Treaſure at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, hoping thereby to redeem their lives; but they reſolutely replied, your Treaſure we ſeek not, but you muſt die, for that our Countrymen and Friends you murder'd at <hi>Amboyna</hi>: and ſo hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up one <hi>Johnſon</hi> the chief <hi>Amboyniſt,</hi> and giving the reſt leave, by caſting the Dice, to try their fate which of them ſhould bear the News of this to <hi>Holland,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57580:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they diſpatch'd all but him, whom they ſent home to relate the certainty of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance, and aſſure his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that doubtleſs there is a God that judgeth the Earth.</p>
            <p>They indeed promiſed before, the year 1625. but never made any ſuitable ſatisfaction for theſe injuries, nor reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us any of thoſe Iſlands of Spices that they had taken from us; but added to their inſolencies a ſtrict Order againſt all free Trade to <hi>Flanders,</hi> monopolizing it to themſelves; and indeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have ſeen any advantage, by cunning, force or fraud, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Right, League, Humanity or Religion, they have endeavoured to proſecute their deſigns.</p>
            <p>This cruelty of the <hi>Dutch</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is much more horrible, if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with thoſe aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attend it, for when <hi>England</hi> was newly recover'd from Popery, and unſetled, when engaged in <hi>Ireland</hi> and the Countries about, when govern'd by a Woman, when threatned from <hi>Spain,</hi> did then relieve the <hi>diſtreſſed States,</hi> eſpouſed their quarrel, and ventur'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57580:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their lives and fortunes in their cauſe. Yea, ſo great was the endearment, that they ſeemed but one Nation, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly entertain'd with the affection of Brethren, the love of Friends and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of Neighbours and Allies.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57580:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They demoliſh and deface the Buildings, tranſplant the Nutmeg-trees, plucking them up by the roots, and carrying them into their own Iſlands of <hi>Nera</hi> and <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> there to be planted for themſelves; and, at laſt, find a means to diſpeople the Iſland, and to leave it ſo, as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> might make no uſe of it worth their charge of keeping: It happened that there was a young man (the ſon of an <hi>Orankey,</hi> or a Gentleman in <hi>Polaroon</hi>) that had committed Felony; for which, by the Laws of his Countrey, he was to die; This fellow, to ſave his life, fled to another Iſland of <hi>Banda,</hi> called <hi>Rofinging,</hi> and there turned Chriſtian: but quickly underſtanding, that that would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him ſafe from puniſhment, he went back ſecretly to his own Country of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laroon,</hi> and having lurked there a few days, took his paſſage for <hi>Nera,</hi> another Iſland where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Fort; and told the Dutch Governour, that the <hi>Orankeys</hi> of <hi>Polaroon</hi> had conſpired to Maſſacre the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well at <hi>Polaroon</hi> as at <hi>Poloway,</hi> with help of the People of <hi>Seran,</hi> that ſhould ſend over thirty <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricurries</hi> for that purpoſe.

the ſaid King of <hi>Ternate,</hi> agreed upon (and yet demanded the excluding of all others but themſelves of trading with his Subjects) but inſtead thereof preſented the ſaid Prince with ſeveral rarities of <hi>Europe,</hi> upon which the King of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Complains to his Brother, the King of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> adviſing with him what was the moſt prudent courſe for him to take in that affair.</p>

To this, the Merchants on Shore conſented, but the Commander of the Ship utterly refuſed to ſend the Rudder, anſwering, he would keep the Rudder faſt to his Ship, as long as he could; with much adoe at length, they fixed a preſent upon the King of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> which he accepting, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders</hi> began to expect an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all things, and the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and <hi>Lioneſs</hi> proceeded on their Voyage, the <hi>Nightingale</hi> for <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Banda,</hi> the <hi>Lioneſs</hi> for <hi>Amboyna</hi> onely, who was ſhipwrack'd in her Voyage on an Iſland belonging to the King of <hi>Macaſſar.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1666.

Afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned divers hot skirmiſhes, and then the <hi>Bonneſe</hi> Army which came from <hi>Turata,</hi> conſiſting of 6000 men, landed with the <hi>Dutch</hi> before <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> beſides theſe there were about 7000 <hi>Bougis</hi> and 3000 <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natanes,</hi> and the King of <hi>Macaſſars</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were about 20000. With which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they fell upon <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſperate encounters, it was taken by <hi>Radia Palacca</hi> and the Admirals party, by caſting many hand Granado's and Fire-pots into their Forts: Afterwards the Enemy fled, and after ſeveral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57580:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where the <hi>Macaſſars</hi> had the worſt, the City of <hi>Sambouca</hi> was beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the Wall thereof blown up, which made the King of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> retire into the Land, and keep his Principal Reſidence at <hi>Goa.</hi> Where, being in want of all things, was forced to deſire a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which they granted upon ſuch terms as they pleaſed themſelves: Whereby all Forts towards the Sea, but ſuch as the <hi>Dutch</hi> pleaſe to poſſeſs, ſhall be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; The moſt conſiderable and beſt part of the Land made theirs, to Plant, and themſelves freed from all Cuſtoms for the future, with ſeveral ſums and feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be paid to them for the preſent Peace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now onely add one inſtance or two, which will declare the demeanor of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Japan,</hi> and then conclude with a brief rehearſal and bare recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome injuries and abuſes they have done to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1640. The <hi>Dutch</hi> make their addreſſes to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Japonians,</hi> and with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible acknowledgments ſubmiſſively pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57580:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him to grant them the priviledge of building a houſe, wherein they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to diſpoſe of, and lay up their Merchandize, and alſo to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Members of their Society inhabit; which being once obtained, they not onely raiſe up a ſumptuous and beautiful building for habitation, but ſo ſtrongly fortifie it, and in ſo convenient a Situation, that they ſeem to out brave and threaten the <hi>Japonians</hi>; and will they, nill they, to maintain their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there; ſo that now they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough to monopolize all Wares, and put them off to the <hi>Japonians</hi> at what rate they liſt: But their ſubtle contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances being brought under ſuſpicion, were quickly diſcovered, and their towr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambition unexpectedly laid in the duſt; for the Governour forthwith ſent to them a great Band of Soldiers, with a Command, that they ſhould either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh their new petty <hi>Babel,</hi> or be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put all to the Sword; but ſelf-intereſt ſoon prompted them what they ſhould do, therefore (though unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) yet with a ſeeming chearfulneſs they obey the Governors gracious command,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57580:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and moſt buſily ply them to their new impoſed task, laying waſt that which they did ſo much pride themſelves in and were at ſo great charge to get accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. And ever after their actions were more narrowly obſerved, and the <hi>Japonians</hi> claim'd the priviledge of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their own Coyn, to wit, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing all merchandize, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it on them at their own price. Thus you ſee the juſt recompenſe of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>But further, The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeem to be a people wholly addicted to ſecular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, chooſing rather to enjoy their lives and profits, than hazard either in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Chriſtian Religion; for the Laws of the <hi>Japonian</hi> Kingdome being very ſtrict and ſevere againſt Chriſtians, whereby they are frequently perſecuted and meet with grievous and lamentable tortures, to the end they may deny their Faith; the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not been obſerved at all to endeavour the promoting the Goſpels publication, but rather ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heatheniſh dictates, ſo, that they may live without trouble and moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than quit their Trade, and be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57580:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their ſo ſweet and delicious world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gains.</p>
               <p>And thus you have a brief account of the deportment of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in Forreign Parts, which ſufficiently demonſtrates their ingratitude and injuſtice to thoſe they have had Commerce with.</p>
               <p>But their indignities to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all in number and quality, which the time would fail to recapitulate, how they ſolicited our Queen, and yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly applyed themſelves to the <hi>French</hi> King: How they promiſed us Free Trade, yet ſtopp'd our Ships: How they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed our <hi>Money</hi> to buy a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi>: How they admitted our Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to their ſupreme Senat, yet becauſe they ſhould not underſtand all debates, they preſently ſet up a ſecret Council: How they intreated the Queen to ſend over the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> yet abuſed him ſo far, that he quitted their unworthy Country, and left behind him a Medal whereon there was engraven, a Dog and a Flock of Sheep, with this Motto, <hi>Non oves ſed Ingratos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How they depended on our <hi>Field-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> and yet raiſed jealouſies amongſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57580:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them one againſt another. How they delivered us the Caution Towns we had taken, yet were never quiet till we had trucked for them: How they owned King <hi>James</hi> their Protector, yet ſet up a blaſphemous Reader (I mean <hi>Vorſtius</hi>) in <hi>Competition</hi> with him: What earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they uſed to diſſwade him from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with <hi>Spain</hi> when they had a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent there.</p>
               <p>How they complemented King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt (of bleſſed Memory) when they diſputed his right to his own Seas: How they proteſt their obligations to him, yet cheat us of the Impoſt upon their Herring-Fiſhing, and preſume to fight with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral in our very Havens: How they had their Agents here during our Civil War, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Mediating our Peace, obſerving the Advantages they could make of our War.</p>
               <p>How affectionately they there embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the King's Intereſt, and yet how ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciouſly their Embaſſadors faulter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Death.</p>
               <p>How zealouſly they eſpouſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Intereſt that now is, while hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

1649, 1650, 1651, 1652. (for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to hide their deſign of quitting the Homage they owed to <hi>England</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing its Trade) and when that was done, how cunningly they deſerted it, from 1653, to 1660. How eager they were to entertain his Majeſty (though not till they had aſſurance of his Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) and yet how kind to his excellent Siſter and her Son.</p>
               <p>How inſtant for Peace at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and yet how unreaſonable in their Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, Pyracies, Depredations and Surprizes in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America?</hi> How ready to deliver the Pepper Iſlands, and what pretence from year to year to keep <hi>them</hi>: How earneſt in ſolliciting a War with the Turks in <hi>Algiers,</hi> yet how trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous in deſerting it: For having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Royal aſſurance for their Aid, Sir <hi>John Lawſon</hi> was appointed to attend their Service, and the Intereſt of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but then they moſt perfidiouſly fell off without any notice of their departure, and made as faſt as they could for <hi>Guiny</hi> to fight againſt his Majeſties Subjects there, whilſt his Subjects aſſiſted them in the Streights. How importunate in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57580:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for Peace, yet how diligent in their Preparations for War: How ready to make ſatisfaction for Old Injuries, when in the mean time they offer New Ones: How reſpectful to his Majeſty in their Embaſſies, yet how abuſive of his Perſon, Government and Relations, in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Libels and Pictures; what Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what Kindneſs pretended, yet how barbarous to our Priſoners at home, how ſevere to our Merchants abroad. Thus you have had ſome hints of the baſe and unworthy actings of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whoſe ſeveral branches would admit their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective aggravations, but that is left to the impartial and judicious examiner of each cauſe, for I never intended to cloth the Relation with Burleſque or Railery, but rather choſe to publiſh the truth in its moſt becoming attire, brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you an <hi>exiguous</hi> draught of our ignoble and ill natured Neighbours the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> of whom, an ingenious <hi>Jocaliſt</hi> gives this deſcription, <hi>That they rob God of his Honour, The King of his due; The Fiſhes of their Quarters; and burn up the earth before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
