            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Concerning the right of the Cause, which I am to defend, what need I say any thing? I am to fight for the Church of Christ, for the honour and Obedience of Prelates, and for the example and custome of my Forefathers. And heerin, shall I feare any man?

Non enim dicimus,</hi> The Kings Primacy, <hi>Regis Primatum, sed</hi> The Kings Supremacy, <hi>Regis Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prematum: Quo vocabulo nos quoque deinceps vtemur.

For that <hi>Primacy</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> do greatly differ: <hi>Primacy</hi> seeming to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a power of the same Order; but <hi>Supremacy</hi> not so.</p>

Tompson.</hi> For if they speake properly, seing that the word <hi>Primacy</hi> doth properly signify a Power of the same Order; they do plainely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the King hath Power of the same order with the Bishops and Ministers of his Church. But this now according to M. <hi>Tompsons</hi> opinion, is an error: wherefore eyther they doe erre, or speake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The other is, that a Coniecture may be made of the thing signified, from the word signifying. The word <hi>Supremacy</hi> is a new and lately inuented word, vnknown to the Ancient Fathers, not vsed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21768:6"/>
in Scriptures, vnheard of in the Christian world. Moreouer, what doth it signify? The Supreme power (forsooth) of the King in the Church? Wherefore this is new also. Surely if the ancient Fathers, eyther Latin or Greeke, had knowne this power, they would haue found out at least some word, wherby to haue expressed the same properly. But this it seemes none of them did.</p>

M. Salclebridge</hi> thinketh that they are. Therfore, because he hath once affirmed the King to haue the Primacy of the Church, he consequently auerreth, that the King is Primate of the Church. For that with him this argument hath force <hi>à Coniugatis</hi>: The King hath Primacy, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King is Primate.

               <head>V. Question. VVhether the Kings Primacy do consist in any Power, or Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall?</head>
               <p>HEERE now, is there a great Iarre and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate amongst our English Aduersaries: nor can the same be easily vnderstood, vnlesse it be first well distinguished. Ecclesiasticall Power
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21768:12"/>
is threefold, as the Deuines do teach. One of Order; another of interiour Iurisdiction; the third of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Iurisdiction. To the first belongeth to effect or consecrate, and administer Sacraments: to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to gouerne the Church in the interiour Court, or Court of Conscience; and to the third, belongeth to gouerne the Church in the exteriour Court. Now certaine it is, that the King hath not the Power of Order, by reason of his Primacy. For this doth <hi>M. Tooker</hi> confesse <hi>pag.</hi> 14. where he saith: <hi>Reges non habent potestatem administrandi Sacramenta.</hi> Kinges haue not power to administer Sacraments. It is also certaine that he hath not Iurisdiction of the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Court, or Court of Conscience. For this in like manner doth <hi>M.

               <p n="2">2. All the question then is, whether the King hath Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ecclesiastical in the exteriour Court or no? About this point are the Englishmen at a great iarre and variance amongst themselues: some affirming it, some denying it, others distinguishing. <hi>M.

               <p n="4">4. Heere now the Iarre is euident. For without doubt, that Ecclesiasticall law, which the Apostles decreed, had the force of a law: for that so much is gathered out of these words; <hi>Visum est, nihil vltra im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere vobis oneris, nisi haec necessaria.</hi> It hath seemed good, to lay no further burthen vpon you, then these necessary things &amp;c.

For that they, by their Apostolicall authority and power, which they had receiued from Christ, did decree, and promulgate that law. And the same power &amp; authority haue Bishops now a dayes, not Kings, nor Emperours.</p>

                  <head>The second Poynt.</head>
                  <p n="6">6. The Question then is, whether all the Kings su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biects in <hi>England,</hi> are bound in conscience to take both these Oathes, as often as the King shall exact the same? Or whether they should suffer imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, torments, and death it selfe, rather then sweare? Concerning the former point, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doubt nothing, for that they haue certainly and firmly determined rather to loose their liues, together with the glorious Martyrs Syr <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> then to ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it the Kings Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and abiure the Popes. Now concerning the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Oath, there hath byn some doubt made these yeares past. For that some Catholikes, who percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the force and scope of that Oath, did a little stagger at the beginning, whether they might with a safe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science sweare therto, or no. Which doubt of theirs notwithstanding did not last long, but was soone taken away by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> For the Pope forthwith directed two Apostolicall Breues to the Catholikes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the said Card. wrote a letter to <hi>M. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> then Archpriest of this affaire. Both Pope and Cardinall do deny, that the said Oath may be taken with a safe Conscience. And their reason is this: Because no man, with a safe conscience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> can deny the Catholicke faith. But he now, who should take this Oath proposed by the King, should deny the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith, though not generally, yet in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>art, so far forth as belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to some one article therof: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:21768:28"/>
no man with a safe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science can take this Oath.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This reason, being very sound, all good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks admit: but our aduersaries do not. I, in fauour and consolation of the Catholicks, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to adioyne heerunto two other reasons, especially against the Oath of Supremacy, which by the Aduersaries cannot be reiected. The first is this: No man is bound in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science to sweare that which is eyther apparently false, or at leastwise doubtfull: But, that the King is Primate, and supreme head of the Church, and for such to be obeyed, not only in temporall, but also in Ecclesiasticall matters, is eyther apparently false, or at leastwise doubtfull: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no man is bound in Conscience to sweare the same. The <hi>Maior</hi> is euident of it selfe, for that it is not lawfull to affirme any thing which is eyther false or doubtfull, and much lesse to sweare the same. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued thus: For that, is it iudged ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently false, aswell amongst the Caluinists, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Catholicks, that the King is Primate and supreme head of the Church. But now amongst the <hi>Caluinists</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who adhere vnto the King, the same is called into doubt. For that some of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, others deny these points following: 1. That the King is Primate of the Church. 2. That he is supreme head of the Church. 3. That he hath Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Primacy ouer the Church. 4. That he hath power &amp; iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall. 5. That the K. by his owne proper Authority may assemble Councells or Synods, and sit as chiefe Head or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident therin. 6. That he can confer benefices, or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21768:28"/>
Ecclesiasticall liuings. 7. That he can create and depose Bishops. 8. That he is Iudge in Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of faith &amp;c. So as truly, if these and the like points be doubtfull and vncertaine amongst those who adhere vnto, and fauour the King, seing that some deny them, some affirme them: it followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that the Kings whole Primacy is an vncertaine thing. What rashnes then, and imprudency is it, to go about to bynd Catholicks in their Consciences to sweare that, which they themselues do affirme some of them to be false, some others to be doubtfull?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I will explicate more distinctly that which I haue said. The Oath of the Kings Primacy, doth contayne so many parts as there be, or are thought to be Offices and functions of the Kings Primacy. The offices then eyther are, or are thought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as we haue seene before, to wit, to assemble Synods, to enact and decree Ecclesiasticall lawes, to conferre benefices, to cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te Bishops, to determine controuersies of faith, and the like. Therfore diuers are the parts of the Oath of the Kings Supremacy. Of these parts then, let vs take one of them by it selfe, to wit this: <hi>I A. B. do sweare in my conscience, that I will be faithfull and obedient vnto the King, as often, or whensoeuer he shall, by his owne proper autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, create Bishops, whom he will, and againe depose from their office or dignity, whome he will &amp;c.</hi> If this part only of the Kings Offices should be exacted of all his Maiesties subiects in <hi>England,</hi> what, do you thinke, would be done? Would all, trow you, yea they who most adhere now vnto the King, sweare
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21768:29"/>
this? Let them sweare that would; <hi>M. Tooker</hi> I am sure, if he be a constant man would not. For that he denyeth the creation and deposition of Bishops to belong any way vnto the King. And if so be, that he, who otherwise acknowledgeth the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy (at least in words) would not sweare heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; how then should Catholicks be compelled to do the same, who doe in no wise acknowledge it? And what I haue said concerning this point, the same may be also said of the rest.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. My other reason is this. King <hi>Iames</hi> doth often protest, that he claymeth no more right or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer the Church, then did the Kings in the old Testament in ancient times: and therfore that this his Primacy must be contayned within the same ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, &amp; termes, that theirs was in the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But the Kings in the old Testament could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell their subiects to sweare such an Oath as this: <hi>I A. B. do openly testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie, and in my conscience declare, that</hi> Ieroboam <hi>is the only supreme Gouernour of this Kingdome of</hi> Israel, <hi>aswell in spirituall as temporall matters: And that no forrayner hath any iurisdiction, power, superiority, preheminence, or authority in this Kingdome</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> neyther King <hi>Iames</hi> can inforce his subiects to take such a like Oath. The <hi>Maior</hi> is manifest out of his Maiestyes owne words in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology. The <hi>Minor</hi> I thus explicate. After the death of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> his Kingdome (God so disposing) was deuided into two parts: wherof one conteyned ten Tribes: the other two. So as by this meanes, they became two distinct Kingdomes afterwards, &amp;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21768:29"/>
therin raigned two distinct Kings, one wherof had no dependance of the other in temporall gouerment. One was called King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the other King of <hi>Iuda</hi>: and both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had successours in their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. The first Kings that ruled, after the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the kingdome made, were <hi>Ieroboam</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; <hi>Roboam</hi> King of <hi>Iuda.</hi> In eyther kingdome were Priestes and Leuites. But the high or Chiefe Priest, could not reside in both Kingdomes, but only in one, and that ordinarily in <hi>Iuda</hi>: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he was Head of all the Priestes &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites that remayned in both Kingdomes. Neither could <hi>Ieroboam</hi> lawfully say vnto his Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites: <hi>You shall not obey the High Priest, that resideth in the Kingdome of</hi> Iuda: <hi>but you shall obey me only: for you are exempted from his iurisdiction and power &amp;c.</hi> And though he should haue so said; yet no doubt, but he had offended. If now King <hi>Ieroboam</hi> could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Priests and Leuites of his owne Kingdome, from the Iurisdiction and Power of a forraine High Priest: by what right then doth now King <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>England</hi> do the same? especially, seeing he auerreth, that he claymeth no more right or iurisdiction vnto himselfe ouer the Church, then the Kings of the old Testament did?</p>

               <p n="1">1. ALL then that hath bene hitherto said, may be reduced vnto three heads. The first is, that the Kings Primacy in the

Church is a new thing, and first brought in by <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8. nor hitherto hath bene heard of, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped in any other place then only in the Kingdome of <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngland.</hi> The second is: that there be so many Iarres &amp; disagreements of the English Ministry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hemselues, concerning this Primacy, that it is not manifest nor certaine what the said Primacy is, nor what force or authority the same hath. The third: that the Oath of this Primacy can neyther be exacted by the King; nor may the Subiects take the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Heerehence three other questions which might be made concerning the Subiects, will ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ily be solued. There be three sorts of Subiects in <hi>England.</hi> The first, as some call them, are <hi>Henricians,</hi> who both a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>knowledg, &amp; sweare vnto this Kingly Supremacy. The second sort are <hi>Puritans,</hi> or pure <hi>Caluinists,</hi> who indeed do not acknowledge the said Supremacy, but yet do sweare therunto. The third are Catholikes, which neyther acknowledge it, nor will sweare it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The first question then is, What may be said of these <hi>Henricians,</hi> which both acknowledge and sweare to the Kings Supremacy? I answere: that they do vnwisely and inconsiderately. The reason is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Because it is folly and rashnes, as before I haue said, to sweare a thing that is doubtfull and vncertaine. But the Primacy of the King is a thing altogeather doubtfull and vncertaine amongst the <hi>Henricians,</hi> as is manifest by their iarres and dissentions, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to we haue shewed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to sweare to such a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is both folly and rashnes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The second question is, What may be said of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21768:30"/>
the <hi>Puritans,</hi> or pure <hi>Caluinists,</hi> who do not indeed acknowledg the Kings Primacy, &amp; yet if they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, do sweare therto? I answere: that they are periured persons and Politicians. The reason is. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they belieue one thing, and sweare another. They belieue with <hi>Calnin,</hi> that neyther Kings nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes haue any Primacy in spirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall matters, but only in temporall; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse they sweare Allegiance vnto the King (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the forsaid <hi>Henricians</hi>) as to the Primate and supreme Head of the Church: and this they do, to make an externall and politicall peace, which is more esteemed by them, then their faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therfore they are rather to be called Politicks then Christians. Of whome his Maiesty gaue a most worthy testimony, in his <hi>Preface Monitory,</hi> to wit, <hi>That he had found more truth and honesty in the high-land and bordering theeues, then in that sort of people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The third question is, what may be said of Catholickes, who neyther acknowledge the Kings Primacy, nor sweare therto. I answere: that they be iust &amp; vpright men, who walke before God in truth &amp; verity. They be sincere, who professe with their mouth, that which they thinke in their hart. They are wise indeed, who with good <hi>Eleazarus</hi> had rather dye, then consent to any vnlawfull thing, no not so much, as in outward shew. They be like vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who endeauour to obey God, rather then men. They be like to the Martyrs of the primitiue Church, who freely professe themselues before the

persecutours, to be such as indeed they are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But you will say, they be miserable. For if they refuse the Oath, they are forced to vndergoe imprisonments, torments, punishments.
