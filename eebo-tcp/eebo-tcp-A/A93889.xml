            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu may by theſe few ſheets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in ſome part that great benefit of humane Learning, how ſerviceable it may bee made for Divine. For as the Badger-skins, and Goats-hair were made uſe of for the ſervice of the Tabernacle in the Jewiſh Church: So may the Endowments of prophane Infidel-Philoſophers, Orators, and Poets, bee imployed for the ſervice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And indeed the Arts are but as hand-maids to Divinity. Look but back upon thoſe two famous pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Jewiſh and Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>Moſes</hi> learned in all the wiſdome of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſe in all the learning of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> a great Artiſt, and a good Linguiſt: Now to what purpoſe both thoſe gifts, unleſs improved

            <p>And thus, Reader, mayeſt thou make uſe of this Book, if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for thy Pulpit; if a Lay-man for thy practice.

deſire of propoſing ſomething that was not known at all before, then an improving an advancing, a multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of former inceptions; and by that means no knowledge comes to be perfect. St. <hi>Paul</hi> found that to be all knowledge to know Chriſt; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> thinks himſelf wiſe therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows not, nor acknowledges Chriſt as <hi>Paul</hi> did. Though a man knew not that every ſin caſts another ſhovel of brimſtone upon him in hell; yet if hee knew that every riotous feaſt cuts off a year, and every wanton night ſeven years of his ſeventy in this world; it were ſome degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection in knowledge. Hee that purchaſes a Mannor, will think to have an exact ſurvey of the land; but who thinks of taking ſo exact ſurvey of his conſcience, how that money was got that purchaſed that Mannor? We call that a mans means which hee hath; but that is truly his means what way hee came by it; and yet how few are there (when a ſtate comes to any great proportion) that know that, that know what they have, what they are worth. Wee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115692:14"/>
have ſeen Wills where the Teſtator thinks hee hath bequeathed all, and hee hath not known half his own worth. When thou knoweſt a wife, a ſon, a friend, a ſervant, no better, but that that wife betrayes thy bed, and that ſon thy eſtate, and that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant thy credit, and that friend thy ſecret, what canſt thou ſay thou knoweſt? But let us conſider this Theſis in ſpiritual things, of a more rarified nature than knowledge in faith, hope, and charity; and wee ſhall finde all theſe to fall within this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there is nothing in any of theſe three, perfect. And firſt for faith, if you remember who they were that made that prayer, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine adauge,</hi> and the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves prayed, that their faith might receive an increaſe, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith;</hi> you muſt neceſſarily ſecond that conſideration with a confeſſion, that no mans faith is perfect. There are men that abound in faith, that is in compariſon of the emptineſs of other men, or of their own emptineſs before they imbraced the Goſpel, they abound now, but ſtill it is as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115692:15"/>
God hath given the meaſure of faith to every one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. not as of Manna, a certain meaſure, and an equal meaſure, and a full meaſure to every man; no man hath ſuch a meaſure of faith as that hee needs no more, or that hee may not loſe at leaſt ſome of that. And as our faith is not perfect ſo neither our hope, for ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Yee ask and receive not, becauſe yee ask amiſs;</hi> you cannot hope conſtantly, becauſe you do not pray aright; and to make a prayer, a right prayer, there goes ſo many eſſential circumſtances, as that the beſt man may juſtly ſuſpect his beſt prayer; for ſince prayer muſt bee of faith, prayer can bee but ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as the faith is perfect; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of the beſt faith wee have ſeen, Chriſt hath given us but a ſhort prayer, and yet wee are weary of that. Some of the old Hereticks of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church abridged that Prayer, and ſome new fangled men of theſe times have annihilated, evacuated that prayer, becauſe, ſay they, the ſame Spirit that ſpake in Chriſt, ſpeaks in their extemporal prayers, and they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115692:15"/>
can pray as well as Chriſt could teach them.</p>
               <p>And again (to leave theſe) which of us ſayes over that ſhort prayer with a deliberate underſtanding of every petition as wee paſs, or without deviations, and extravagancies of our thoughts in that half minute of our devotion? I throw my ſelf down in my chamber, and I call in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite God and his Angels thither, and when they are there, I neglect God and his Angels for the noiſe of a flye, for the ratling of a coach, for the whining of a door. I talk on in the ſame poſture of prayer, eyes lifted up, knees bowed down, as though I prayed to God; and if God or his Angels ſhould askmee, When I thought laſt of God in that prayer, I cannot tell: ſometimes I finde that I had forgot what I was about, but when I began to forget it, I cannot tell. A memory of yeſterdayes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, a fear of to morrows dangers, a ſtraw under my knee, a noiſe in mine ears, a light in mine eye, an any thing, a nothing, a fancie, a chymera in my brain, troubles me in my praier;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115692:16"/>
ſo certainly is there nothing, nothing in ſpiritual things perfect in this world; not <hi>in credendis,</hi> in things that belong to faith, not <hi>in petendis,</hi> in things that belong to hope, nor <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis</hi> in things that belong to action, to works, to charity, there is nothing perfect there neither. I would bee loath to ſay that every good word is a ſin, that were to ſay that every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or diſordered man were a beaſt, or that every corrupt meat were poyſon, it is not utterly ſo, nor ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, but it is ſo much towards it, as that there is no work of ours ſo good, as that we can look for thanks at Gods hand for that work; no work that hath not ſo much ill mingled with it, as that we need not cry God mercy for that work. There was ſo much corruption in the getting, or ſo much vain-glory in the beſtowing, as that no man builds an Hoſpital, but his ſoul dyes, though not dead, yet lame in the Hoſpital; no man mends a High-way, but hee is, though not drowned, yet mired in that way; no man relieves the poor, but hee needs relief for that relief, In all thoſe works
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115692:16"/>
of charity, the world that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them is bound to confeſs and acknowledge a goodneſs, and to call them good works, but the man that doth them, and knows the weakneſs of them, knows they are not good works. It is poſſible to Art to put a peccant humour out of a ſick body, but not poſſible to raiſe a dead body to life. God out of my confeſſion, of the impurity of my beſt actions, ſhall vouchlafe to take off his eyes from that impurity, as though there were none, but no ſpiritual thing in us, nor faith, nor hope, nor charity, have any purity, any perfection in themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>Origen</hi> makes this uſe of thoſe words, as hee found them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> chap. 1. <hi>Erat vir unus,</hi> there was one man (which was <hi>Elkanah)</hi> hee adds, <hi>Nomen ejus poſſeſsio Dei,</hi> This one man, ſayes hee, was in his name Gods poſſeſſion, <hi>Nam quem damones poſsident, non unus ſed multi,</hi> for hee whom the Devill poſſeſſes, is not one. The ſame ſinner is not the ſame thing, ſtill hee clambers in his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious purpoſes, there hee is an Eagle; and yet lyes ſtill groveling, and trodden upon at any greater mans threſhold, there hee is a worm. Hee ſwells to all that are under him, there he is a full ſea; and his dog that is above him, may wade over him; there hee is a ſhallow, an empty Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the compaſs of a few dayes, hee neighs like a horſe in the rage of his luſt over all the City, and groans in a corner of the City, in an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p>A ſinner is as many men, as hee hath vices; hee that is <hi>Elkanah, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio Dei,</hi> poſſeſſed by God, and in

poſſeſſion of God, hee is <hi>unus homo,</hi> one, and the ſame man. And when God calls upon man ſo particularly, hee intends him ſome particular good. It is St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> note, That when God in the Scripture ſpeaks of divers things in the ſingular number, it is ever in things of grace. And it is St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> note, that when hee ſpeaks of any one thing in the plural number, it is of heavy and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things; as <hi>Jeptha</hi> was buried in <hi>Civitatibus Gilead,</hi> in the Cities, but hee had but one grave, and ſo that is, they made <hi>Aureos vitulos,</hi> Golden Calves, when it was but one Calf.</p>

                  <hi>vellem, ſed quod relinquam, non habeo;</hi> I would gladly do as the Apoſtles did, leave all to follow Chriſt, but I have nothing to leave; alas all things have left mee, and I have nothing to leave. Even that murmuring at po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, is a net, leave that. Leave thy ſuperfluous deſire of having the riches of this world, though thou mayeſt flatter thy ſelf, that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to have, only that thou mighteſt leave it, that thou mighteſt imploy it charitably, yet it might prove a net, and ſtick too cloſe about thee to part with it. You leave your nets, if you leave your over-earneſt greedineſs of catching; for when you do ſo, you do not onely fiſh with a net, you fiſh for a net, even that which you get proves a net to you, and hinders you in the following of Chriſt, and you are leſs diſpoſed to follow him, when you have got your ends, than before. Hee that hath leaſt, hath enough to weigh him down from heaven, by an inordinate love of that little which hee hath, or in an inordinate and murmuring deſire of more. And hee that hath moſt,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115692:34"/>
hath not too much to give for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Tantum valet Regnum Dei, quantum tu vales,</hi> Heaven is alwayes ſo much worth, as thou art worth. A poor man may have Heaven for a penny, that hath no greater ſtore, and God looks that hee to whom hee hath given thouſands, ſhould lay out thouſands upon the purchaſe of Heaven. The Market changes as the plenty of money changes; Heaven coſts a rich man more than a poor, becauſe hee hath more to give. But in this, rich and poor are both equall, that both muſt leave themſelves without nets, that is, without thoſe things, which in their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they know, retard the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt. Whatſoever hinders my preſent following, that I cannot follow to day', whatſoever may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my conſtant following, that I cannot follow to morrow, and all my life is a net, and I am bound to leave that.</p>

               <p>HEe that would dye well, muſt alwayes look for death, every day knocking at the gates of the grave, and then the gates of the grave ſhall never prevaile upon him to do him miſchief. This was the advice of all the wiſe and good men of the world, who eſpecially in the dayes and periods of their joy, and feſtival egreſſions, choſe to throw ſome aſhes into their chalices, ſome ſober remembrances of their fatal period. Such was the black ſhirt of <hi>Saladine,</hi> the Tombſtone preſented to the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> on his Coronation day; the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> two reeds, with flax, and a wax taper; the Egyptian Skeleton ſerved up at feaſts.

dwell in a houſe of darkneſs, and his body muſt bee the inheritance of worms, and his ſoul muſt be what he pleaſes, even as a man makes it here by his living, good or bad.

Truly, if it were poſſible to fear any defect of joy in heaven, all that could fall into my fear, would bee but this, that in heaven I can no longer expreſs my love by ſuffering for my God, my Saviour, a greater joy cannot enter into my heart than this, to ſuffer for him that ſuffered for mee.

Now though the ſign of the Son of man may bee ſome other thing than the Croſs, yet of this ſign the Croſs, there may bee this good application, that when God affords thee this manifeſtation of his Croſs in the participation of thoſe croſſes and calamities that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, then thou haſt this ſign of the Son of man upon thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to thy ſelf, that the Son of man, Chriſt Jeſus, is coming towards thee, and as thou haſt the ſign, thou ſhalt have the ſubſtance, as thou haſt the croſs, thou ſhalt have the glory; For this is that which the Apoſtle intends, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Unto you it is given</hi> (not laid upon you as a puniſhment, but given as a benefit) <hi>not onely to beleeve in Chriſt, but to ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſeems to make our croſſes a kinde of aſſurance, as well as our faith: For ſo hee argues not onely to beleeve, but to ſuffer; for howſoever faith is a full evidence yet our ſuffering is a new ſeal even upon that faith.</p>

Of a devout uſe of this very name do ſome of the Fathers interpret that <hi>Oleum effuſum nomen tuum,</hi> that the Name of Jeſus ſhould bee ſpread as an oyntment, breathed as a perfume, diffuſed as a ſoul over all the petitions of our prayers, as the Church concludes for the moſt part all her Collects ſo, <hi>Grant this, O Lord, for our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſts ſake.</hi>

If charity commands thee to cover the naked, ſaith St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> how much more to bury the dead? When a friend is taking a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is civility for his friends to bring him on part of his way; when our friends are departed, and now going to their grave, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their laſt journey, from which they ſhall never return till time ſhall bee no more; and can wee do leſs then by accompanying the corpſe to the grave, bring them as it were part on their way, and ſhed ſome few tears for them, whom wee ſhall ſee no more with mortal eyes. The Prophet calleth the grave <hi>Miſcabin,</hi> a ſleeping chamber, or reſting place; and when wee read Scriptures to them that are departing, and give them godly inſtructions to dye, wee light them as it were to their bed;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115692:80"/>
and when wee ſend a deſerved teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony after them, wee perfume the room.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Philoſophy argueth, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon objecteth, or ſenſe excepteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: Let us give more heed to God than man, to the Spirit than to the fleſh, to faith than to reaſon, to heaven than to earth; although they who ſuffer for the teſtimony of the Goſpel ſeem to bee moſt miſerable,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115692:81"/>
their skins being flayed off, their joynts racked, their whole body torn in peeces, or burned to aſhes, their good confiſcate, their arms defaced, and all manner of diſgraces put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Yet they are moſt happy in heaven, by the teſtimony of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, the malice of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cannot reach ſo high as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it cannot touch them much there, much leſs awake them out of their ſweet ſleep in Jeſus.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115692:81"/>
Gods people, or the ſtroaks they themſelves receive from God, or the wounds they give themſelves; there all tears are wiped from their eyes: Here they are alwayes troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led either with the evils they fear, or the fear of evil; but when they go hence, death ſets a period to all fear, cares, ſorrows, and dangers. And therefore <hi>Solon</hi> ſpeaketh divinely, when hee taught <hi>Croeſus</hi> that hee ought to ſuſpend his verdict of any mans happineſs till hee ſaw his end.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If all that dye in Chriſt are bleſſed, as a voyce from heaven aſſureth us, wee do wrong to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven if wee account them miſerable, wee do wrong to Chriſt; if wee count them as loſt, whom hee hath found, if wee ſhed immoderate tears for them from whoſe eyes, hee hath wiped away all tears, to wear perpetual blacks for them, upon whom hee hath put long white Robes. Whatſoever our loſſe may bee by them, it cometh far ſhort of their gain; our croſs is light in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their ſuper-excellent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115692:82"/>
weight of glory, therefore let us not ſorrow for them as thoſe that have no hope. Let us not ſhew our ſelves infidels by too much lamenting the death of beleevers. Weep wee may for them, or rather for our loſs by them, but moderately, as knowing that our loſs, is their gain; and if wee truly love them, wee cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly congratulate their feaſts of joy, their rivers of pleaſures, their Pſalms of Victory, their Robes of Majeſty, their Crowns of glory. Water therefore your plants at the departure of your deareſt friends, but drown them not; For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee complain of here, they are freed from there; and whatſoever wee deſire here, they enjoy there; they hunger not, but feaſt with the Lamb; they ſigh not, but ſing with <hi>Moſes,</hi> having ſafely paſſed over the glaſſie Sea; they lye not in darkneſs, but poſſeſs the inheritance of Saints in light.

               <p>Now juſt ſuch is that fire which conſcience kindles upon the breach of integrity, to wit, a fire that burns inwardly, and conſumes the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the bones, and drinks up the ſpirits.

up his ſpirits, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 4. All that which before hee felt without, was nothing to that which hee now felt within upon his ſpirit.

So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> after hee had made breaches in his integrity, God filled his loynes with loathſome diſeaſes; but this was nothing to ſpeak of; God made things ſtrike into his heart, and then hee roared, <hi>I am feeble, and ſore broken, I have roared by reaſon of the [diſquietneſs of my heart.] David</hi> felt pains gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his heart, and then hee cryes out.</p>
               <p>The heart is the mark that God principally aims at, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath turned aſide from his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right courſe; other outward parts hee may hit, and deeply wound, but this is but to make holes into the heart, where the ſeat of unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that principally offends him, is.</p>

A man muſt look upon affliction from one end to the other, that would fetch in joy to his ſoul from ſuffering.

               <p>Baptiſme is called the <hi>Baptiſme of repentance,</hi> Luke 3. 3. In Baptiſme there is a waſhing away of ſin.

they have blubbered out a few tears, think all is well, when yet they ſtill live, and lye in their ſins, and hold them as faſt as ever the Mariners when they found out <hi>Jonas,</hi> yet fain they would have ſaved him, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous loath to caſt him over-board.

Never deceive thy ſelf therefore, though thou haſt ſighed, cryed, prayed, begged mercy, yet if ſtill thou live, and go on in thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes, there is no truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in thee.</p>

hanging, and bleeding upon the Croſſe, we now ſee him preſſed and cruſhed under the heavy burthen of his Fathers wrath. Now wee ſee him in the Garden in his bloody ſweat.
