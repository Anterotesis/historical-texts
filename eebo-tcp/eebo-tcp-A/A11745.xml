         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS
For which the Service Booke, urged upon
SCOTLAND
ought to bee refused.</head>
            <p>1. IT cònteineth divers points and directions, vvhich vvould breed
a change in some Articles of that Doctrine and Discipline of the
Church of the said Kingdome, vvhich is both vvarranted in Scripture &amp;
approved by Parlament: and it seemeth to be as vvell against State wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as against Religion, to change any thing either in the matter or forme
of the sayd doctrine and discipline, vvithout first shewing both some evill
or defect in the things to bee changed, and what good &amp; benefit it is that
the said <hi>Service booke</hi> vvill afforde more to the Edification of the
Church, or true vvorship of Almightie God, then the points of doctrine &amp;
discipline, vvhich the said Service booke vvould breed a change of?</p>
            <p>2. In the pretended Communion, it hath all the substance and
essentiall parts of the Masse, and so brings in the most abominable
Idolatrie that ever vvas in the vvorld, in vvorshipping of a
breaden God, and makes vvay to the Antichrist of Rome, to bring
this Land under his bondage againe, as may bee seen at large by the
particulars of that Communion, wherein some things, that were put
out of the Service booke of England, for smelling so strong of the
Masse, are restored, and many other things, that vvere never in it,
are brought in, out of the Masse booke, though they labour to cover the
matter. It hath the commemoration of the dead: The Table set Altar
wayes: The oblation of the Bread and Wine to God before the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration:
It hath the Popish consecration, that the Lord would sanctifie
by his Words, and by his holy Spirit, those gifts and creatures of Bread
and Wine, that they may be unto us the body and blood of his Sonne,
and then repeat the words of institution to God, for that purpose.
It hath an oblation of it againe, after it is consecrat, the consuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Priest, kneeling before the consecrate Bread and Wine.
It takes avvay the eating and drinking by faith, mentioned in the
<pb facs="tcp:7986:2"/>

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:7986:3"/>
English Liturgie. It hath the patin challice, two Paternosters in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
before the Masse, and severall other particulars, that vvould
take a long time to rehearse and confute.</p>
            <p>3. Though they vvould take avvay the Idolatrous Masse out of it, yet
it hath a number of Popish superstitions and Idolatrous ceremonies:
as, 29 holy dayes, vvhereof 22 are dedicated to Saints, two of them
to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the one vvhereof is called, <hi>The Anuntiation
of our Lady,</hi> so shee is made a Lady to Christians, not being on
Earth, shee must be a Lady in Heaven: Is not this to make her a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse?
It hath 14 Fasting dayes, and some vveekes. It hath also the
humane Sacraments of Crosse in Baptisme, laying on of the Bishops
hand in confirmation: a Ring for the outward seall in Mariage: a
sanctified Font, holie vvater, holinesse of Churches and Chancels:
private Baptisme, private Communions, Ceremonies for Buriall of
the dead, and purification of vvomen after Childbirth, the Priest
standing, kneeling, turning to the people, and consequentlie from
them, speaking vvith a loud voice, and consequentlie sometimes with a
lowe voice. Peoples standing at Gospels, at <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp; <hi>Creeds:</hi>
their ansvvering to the Minister, &amp; many such-like, in number above
50. besides any religious Ornament, that the King, or his Successours,
shall prescribe, and Ceremonies that Bishops shall determine, or that
shall bee conteined in Bookes of Homilies to bee set foorth heereafter.</p>
            <p>4. And though they would take out of the Booke, both the Masse &amp;
all those superstitious Ceremonies, yet it hath a number of other materiall
errours: as, leaving unread about a 120 Chapters of Gods Worde, and
putting this reproach upon them, that they are least edifying, &amp; might best
bee spared, and reading sundrie Chapters out of Apocrypha, under the
stile of holy Scripture of the olde Testament. It hath a Letanie more like
conjuring then like Prayers: It hath some places out of vvhich Papists may
prove, that Sacraments are absolutelie necessarie to salvation, in apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Baptisme in private, vvith such haste, that, if necessitie require, he
that baptizes needs not so much as to say the Lords Prayer, and out of
vvhich they may proove, that Sacraments giue grace by their vvorke
vvrought, in saying, <hi>Children baptized, have all things necessarie
<pb facs="tcp:7986:3"/>
to salvation, &amp; be undoubtedly saved.</hi> It hath other places out of
which they may proue moe Sacraments then tvvo, vvhich they say euerie
Parishoner, who is alreadie baptized, shall communicate, &amp; shall also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
the Sacraments, and that Sacraments two, are generally necessarie to
salvation, as if there vvere others, eyther not so generall, or not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.
It hath other places out of vvhich they may proue universall
grace: saying, <hi>God the Father made mee, and all the world,
and God the Sonne redeemed mee, and all mankinde:</hi> One
<hi>Collect</hi> pretends to begge from God, that vvhich they dare not presume
to name, and a number others of this sort.</p>
            <p>5. Though likevvise they amend all those errours, and that there were
no materiall errour in it at all: so they read nothing at all but Scriptures,
yea, and that all their Prayers &amp; Exhortations vvere nothing but vvords of
Scripture, yet such a Liturgie vvere not lawfull to be made the onlie forme
of Gods Worship in publike: for, though a formed Liturgie may bee to
serve for Rule to other Churches &amp; monuments to Posteritie what formes
are used, or that it may lead the way, or bee a direction to those that are
beginning in the Ministrie, yet it is not by reading of Prayers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
that the LORD appoints his servants of the Ministerie to
vvorship Him, or edifie his people, but hee hath given gifts to them to
Exhort, Pray, and Preach, vvhich they ought to stirre up and use,
and though they may in their private studies take helpe of other mens gifts,
yet it is not lawfull for a man to tie himselfe, or bee tyed by others, to a
prescript forme of vvords in prayer and exhortation, for these reasons:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Such a prescript Forme is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gainst the <hi>Glorie of God,</hi> in stinting
to him such a daylie measure of service, and so hindring the many spirituall
Petitions and pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses that otherw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se would be, if Gods gifts were used.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondlie,</hi> It is against the <hi>dignitie of Christ,</hi> in making his gifts need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse:
for, though hee send downe no gifts at all, they can serve themselves
with the Booke, without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> It quenches the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> because hee gets no employment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It hinders the <hi>Edification of Gods people,</hi> they may as well
stay at home, and bee edified by reading the Booke themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> It is against the <hi>Conversion of those that know not God:</hi> will
ever a Rat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yme of words sayd over without feeling or blessing, worke upon
an unrenewed heart?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7986:4"/>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> It will never serve <hi>to convince an Hereticke, to check a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Person,</hi> or <hi>to waken a secure Soule:</hi> they may long goe on or such
a service byte upon them: yea, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>osters people in a presumptuous conceit, that
they are well enough if they be present, and say their part of service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It fosters <hi>a lasie ministrie,</hi> and makes way for putting downe
Preaching: they need take no paynes, and therefore needs no stipend: yea,
they may come from the Ailhouse, or a worse place, and step to and read
their Service, without eyther check or preparation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eyghtly,</hi> It may all be done by a <hi>Boy of 7 yeares olde,</hi> and so every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man that can read, yea, a Turcke if he can read, may be such a Minister.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> It cannot expresse the <hi>severall needs of all people to God,</hi>
or deale with them, according to their severall estates, that will alter otherwise
then any prescript forme can be aplyed to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> If any one stinted Liturgie had beene good, or needfull, no
doubt but <hi>CHRIST</hi> would have set one downe to us.</p>
            <p>6. Though a prescript forme of Liturgie were lawfull, yet there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
for imposing of one: for, might not able Ministers (at least) make a prescript
forme to themselves, which would fit them and their people best? But if it were
lawfull to impose one, then there is one in this <hi>Countrie</hi> already. Ought not
that rather be imposed, then any other, seeing it is already established by Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
now of a long time? But now, if a new one ought to be imposed, then
it ought to come in by a lawfull maner: by a generall Assemblie, and men
chosen to make it that are knowne to have the gift of Prayer themselves, and
not the Masse booke, translated into English, urged by <hi>Antichristian Prelats,</hi>
upon Gods people, without consent of any Generall Assemblie or Parlament,
against the will of all men, &amp; with no small offence &amp; scandall to the minds
and consciences of such, as thinke all Liturgie unlawfull, that is either in the
Masse way, or inconsistent with the practise &amp; peace of the reformed Churches
of <hi>Scotland</hi> hitherto, and against the hearts of such as know many things in the
English Liturgie and Canons, which the practise of, neyther hath warrand in
Gods Word, nor can bring any such adition, to the profit, honor, or power of
the King, that is able to compense the losse hee may make of his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
affections, by commanding such a change, as the urged Liturgie would
bring to the Peace of our Church, and respect due to the Acts of
Parlament and long custome, whereby our Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
Order, and Government hath
beene established.</p>
