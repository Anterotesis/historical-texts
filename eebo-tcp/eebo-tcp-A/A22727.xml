            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Remonſtrances made by his Maieſties Ambaſſadour of <hi>Great</hi> BRITTAINE, <hi>to the French</hi> King, and the Queene his Mother, <hi>Iune</hi> 1615.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, the title of your good Brother, and auncient Friend, wherwith the King my Maſter is truly ſtiled, doth aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perſwade him that you alſo on your part haue the like impreſſion of ſincere affection, which is infuſed and ingrafted in him by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue and perpetuall continuance of that vnited amitie and alliance, which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors the Kings of Scotland haue had at all times with your Crowne, hath beene te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified alſo in theſe latter daies, by the Kings of England, in their worthy and effectuall
<pb facs="tcp:826:3"/>
aſſiſtance often performed vnto your State, chiefly vnto your Father, the late King of worthy memory, in the time of his moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult affaires; ſo that you cannot impute any thing proceeding from him, but vnto that ſame entire affection, which his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, on his part, deſires (if it may be) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and perpetuate in his Succeſſours, both to you and yours.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, his Maieſtie by expreſſe command hath charged me, ſeriouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate vnto your Maieſtie, for the good of your Perſon and State, and all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in generall; and as he aſſureth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that all his actions and proceedings ſince his raigne, which began with his life, will iuſtifie him before you and the world, that he neuer through practicality, or curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie intruded himſelfe into forraine affaires, ſo hath he this teſtimonie of his conſcience, and doth proteſt before God, that the onely end and cauſe of his enter-meddling in this action, is the aforeſaid welfare of your State, and diſcharge of his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Sir, his Maieſtie hath been aduertiſed,
<pb facs="tcp:826:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that your Maieſtie is reſolued ſpeedily to take your Iourney, to make an exchange of Princes with <hi>Spaine:</hi> whereupon he findes himſelfe obliged (as wel by the affection he beares vnto you in particular, as by the care he owes vnto the publike of Chriſtendome, faithfully to repreſent vnto you the great &amp; imminent danger, wherinto, by this your reſolution, you wil plunge both the State of your owne Kingdom, and alſo of your nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt neighbours, and beſt allios, not that hee doth counſell your Maieſtie to depart from tho contract which is already paſt touching theſe mariages. For his Maieſty knows wel, that the greatnes and dignity of Kings doth in good reaſon require, that they ſhould ſeeke the amity one of the other, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine theſelues by ſuch alliances and leagues of friendſhip, but only to preſent vnto your view, how expedient and neceſſarie it is, (both for the conſideration and welfare of your perſon in particular, as alſo in reſpect of all Chriſtendome in generall, in this doubtfull vncertaintie, wherein the affaires of theſe times now ſtand, to remit the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the ſaid marriages vnto a
<pb facs="tcp:826:4"/>
time more mature and opportune.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ancient affection, and bond of amity betweene your Crownes, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie takes himſelfe obliged in Conſcience to performe vnto you this office, by reaſon of that faithful promiſe paſſed betweene the late King your Father of happie memorie and him; by the ſecret Miniſterie of ſome certaine of your ſeruants, and namely, the deceaſed <hi>Monſs. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itry,</hi> which was, that when either of the two departed this life, the ſuruiuour ſhould take into his care &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, the Eſtate and poſteritie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. Which, his Maieſtie, preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that vnfortunate accident of the late Kings death, made knowne (by the Baron of <hi>Hales)</hi> vnto <hi>Monſ. de la Borderie,</hi> who was then with him, offering himſelfe to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power for the accompliſhing of this promiſe, whereof ſince the bond yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in his perſon towards your Maieſty, hee cannot, for the diſcharge of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſhew vnto you, and the Queene your Mother, the great wrong, which hee ſuppoſeth, is done vnto you, if, before you haue attained to that maturitie of yeeres
<pb facs="tcp:826:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and iudgement, requiſite and neceſſary for your direction in the choiſe of your Wife and aſſociate, be it for the content of your affection, or welfare of your State, you ſhould be precipitated into the yoke of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to the manifeſt preiudice of your health, and (may be) of your contentment and affaires; for, as touching this laſt point, his Maieſtie weighing that which publikely appeares of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution of your preſent eſtate, the diuers iealouſies and diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the greateſt of your Court, the ill treating of your Parliament, which without doubt hath cauſed much diſcontent in the mindes of your Subiects, in reſpect of the great credit and reputation, which this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and principall member of your State hath with the people, beſides the grieua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which thoſe of the reformed Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, he knoweth not how in the middeſt of theſe agitations and diſorders, your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties may abſent your ſelues from the heart and center of your Kingdom, as you ſhould doe by this voyage; beſides, the leauing of your affaires here expoſed to a great deale of confuſion, and danger of diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:826:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But beſides theſe conſiderations which meerely concerne your Perſon and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in particular, the generaltie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome doth finde it ſelfe greatly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed in the precipitation of this voyage, for if in the doubtfull and vnſettled eſtate of the affaires of theſe times, the accompliſhing of the ſame were for a certaine time ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there would be hope, that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon &amp; ioynt interceſſion of all their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and allies, the differences which now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and menace the quiet of Chriſtendom, might be ordered; whereas if in this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous Coniunction, theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages be ſuddenly perfected, it cannot be in all likelihood, but there muſt enſue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral combuſtion throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>For firſt, what iealouſie and diſcontent will the States of the vnited Prouinces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, when they ſhall ſee France &amp; Spaine ſo ioyntly vnited? can they hope that France will then labour to cauſe the Arch-Duke to make reſtitution of thoſe places kept, and detayned in Cleues and Iuilliers, by the Marques <hi>Spinola,</hi> for the which they are
<pb facs="tcp:826:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now in controuerſie with him; yea rather, will they not ſuſpect all counſels and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to be enterpriſed to oppugne them? yes, without doubt they will beleeue, that in this Coniunction, the ill will of Spaine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, will ſurmount the good will of France, and that it will not ceaſe, vntill it hath ingaged this State in open enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And this with great griefe his Maieſtie is forced to ſay, that if the ſame wil and reſolution had beene brought from hence, as was taken by him, for the ordering of the affaires of Weſell, thoſe points and puntillioes whereon ſo long time the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards haue dwelt, to prolong this affaire, might haue beene long agoe cut off: but now on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, he hath cauſe to grieue, that hauing as much labored to ſollicite the interuention of this State in this affaire, as to draw the Spaniard to ſome reaſon; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this importunitie, he could neuer procure any other anſwere from hence (neither touching this point, or the other affaires) but in generall termes, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that weake ſatisfactorie anſwere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto his Maieſtie, by <hi>Monſ. de Buiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaux,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:826:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as alſo all the other anſwers to the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of the Princes of Germany.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, theſe Princes of the Vnion, knowing that Spaine is the Fauourer and Protector of their Enemies, will receiue no leſſe damage and diſpleaſure by the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of theſe mariages, thus proſecuted without any neceſſity, and ſo out of ſeaſon, that they will not only weaken them by the loſſe of France, but alſo ſtrengthen their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by the aduantage of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And who can ſecure them from feare, (if the troubles of Sauoy can be appeaſed) that the Army of Spaine, which now threatneth Italic, doth not come expreſly by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of this State, to fall vpon them, and in particular, the Elector of Brandenbourg, who hath ſo long timerelyed vpon France, cannot hereafter expect any fauour from hence for the deciding of his controuerſie, ſeeing that the King of Spaine hath taken the Duke of Newenbourg, his Competitor, into his protection?</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of Sauoy, who is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this Crowne, and whoſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation doth much concerne it, as well for
<pb facs="tcp:826:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the neereneſſe, as for the ſituation of his Countrie; if before the accompliſhing of theſe marriages, hee hath found France ſo violent and diſcourteous towards him, as well by the harſh and peremptorie meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which haue been ſent him from hence, as by the rigorous inhibitions publiſhed in disfauour of him, declaring all ſuch as goe to aide or aſſiſt him, offenders of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and ſo vſing them, by confiſcation and razing of their houſes, (a thing neuer heard of, nor practized, eſpecially by France, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Prince and Friend, ſo vexed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Armes of one ſtronger then himſelfe) how may he hope, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the ſaid marriages, that this State will remaine an impartiall Arbitrator betwixt Spaine and him, or that theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters which ſhall be imploied in his buſines, will deale faithfully and ſincerely for the good of his affaires, his Maieſtie proteſting for his owne part that his deſire hath and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall be, firmely to vnite himſelfe with your Maieſties, to incite the ſaid Duke vnto peace, howbeit he iudgeth it fit to haue an equall care, leſt by ſuch disfauour, he might

be inforced to accept of conditions vnſafe and preiudiciall?</p>
            <p>And ſince that the greateſt Honour of France, during the wiſe gouernement of the late King, was the authority and truſt which it had, prudently and profitably to prouide (as it hath done vpon diuers great and important occaſions) for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating of differences betweene forraine Princes and States, to the conſeruation of the publique peace of Chriſtendome, and ſeeing that it is already apparent, that the ſhaddow of theſe double alliances doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter cauſe of feare to your ancient frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that together with them the intereſts alſo of Spaine will be eſpouſed, it is moſt certaine, that the precipitation of theſe marriages wil much augment this feare in them, cauſing France to loſe that authority and truſt which their Councels haue had alwayes heretofore on their part, turning their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence into diſtruſt, and their loue into diſcontent.</p>
            <p>If therefore, notwithſtanding all theſe weighty and vrgent conſiderations, which concerne ſo neerly the perſon of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
<pb facs="tcp:826:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Weale publique, aſwell of your owne State, as of your Neighbors and Allies, you ſhall haſtily proceede to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of this voyage; what may they imagine, who in this State, and alſo among your Neighbours doe clearely perceiue, weigh and apprehend theſe pregnant conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, but that thereby there is ſome hidden deſigne tending to their preiudice?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the King my Maſter ſhall haue iuſt cauſe of regret in his owne particular, if hauing liued ſo many yeeres in loue, and correſpondency ſo firme with this Crowne, inſomuch that theſe two States (hauing had almoſt one &amp; the ſelfe ſame to will, and not to will, the ſame Friends and Enemies) haue alwayes ioyned their Counſels, and guided their actions in all affaires and occurrances, tending to the Weale publique, after one and the ſame manner: Now France diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelfe from him, by the precipitation of theſe Marriages with Spaine, ſhall leaue vnto him alone the burthen and charge of all ſuch affaires and differences, as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in Chriſtendome vndecided; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer notwithſtanding his Maieſtie is not
<pb facs="tcp:826:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ignorant of the aduantage, which elſewhere is offered vnto him by this alienation, if he were a Prince ambitious to winne vnto him ſelfe alone the good will and friendſhip of all thoſe ancient Allies, which by this action ſeeme abandoned, if he alone ſhould not enterpriſe the managing of their affaires, as hee will neuer bee wanting either by aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or counſell, to effect the ſame, when neceſſity ſhall require. But being not able on his part ſo ſleightly to forget &amp; renounce the ancient correſpondence &amp; Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hee hath hitherto maintayned with this Crowne, hee is willing to vſe all care and meanes for the preſeruation of it in its owne eſtate, before hee change his courſe, or addreſſe himſelfe to new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, if he be not thereunto conſtrayned by this ſudden alteration.</p>
            <p>And this is it that his Maieſty hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me, thus freely to repreſent theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid conſiderations vnto your Maieſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you to accept and embrace this his aduice, euen as he preſents it vnto you, that is to ſay, with his true and ancient affection for the good of your Perſon and State, and

A Declaration made by his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Ambaſſadour of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> vnto <hi>the French King, and the Queene his Mother,</hi> concerning an Oration made by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Perron, <hi>in the late generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Eſtates at Paris.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIr, the King my Maſter, (hauing ſeene a certaine Oration, made in the Aſſembly of your States Generall, held lately in this City, and ſince publiſhed by <hi>Monſ.</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Perron,</hi> wherof he himſelfe hath ſent a Copie vnto his Maieſtie) cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wonder at the licentiouſneſſe, and deprauation of this age, animated with ſuch audacity by the ſpeeches and writings of a perſon of that qualitie, who, to ouerthrow a wholeſome propoſition, made in the third Chamber of the ſaid States, for preſeruation of the life and authoritie of Kings, vnder pretence of maintaining the intereſt and rights of the Pope, doth not onely expoſe and lay open as a prey, the life and States of Princes, by the doctrine maintained in the ſaid Oration, but alſo doth vnworthily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the Crowne of his owne King, to the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage
<pb facs="tcp:826:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and authoritie of the Sea of Rome; and thirdly, doth ſend forth, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, diuers reproches and iniurious inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues againſt the Perſon and Gouernment of the King my Maſter.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, his Maieſtie complaines, and takes in ill part, that the ſaid Cardinall, in diuers places of this ſpeech, publikely maintaines, that a King by the Law of God may fall from his Right, and ceaſe to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as a King. That a Pope or Councell hath authoritie, particularly in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Hereſy or Apoſtafy, to depoſe Kings, and abſolue Subiects of their oath of Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and that conſequently their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects may enterpriſe againſt them. Which were not only to put the State and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dignity of Kings, into the hands and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Pope, but alſo diſobedience into the hearts of their Subiects, and a knife into the hands of Aſſaſſines, to execute vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Sacred perſons, the decrees of a will tranſported either by error or malice vnto their ruine; whereof, within theſe fiue and twentie yeeres, this Kingdome hath felt too too lamentable &amp; remarkeable effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:826:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, the ſaid Cardinall, applying this execrable Maxime, in particular vnto <hi>France,</hi> maintaines, that it hath alwaies been receiued and authoriſed here, yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for crimes of Religion, leſſe weightie then Hereſie or Apoſtafie: And if any hold the contrary, the Popes do but tolerate the ſame for the good of the Churches peace, conditionally that they hold it as doubtfull, and Problematicall, and not affirme it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie to the word of God; by which meanes, your Maieſties Life remaines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed to the ſame danger and enterpriſes, that your two Predeceſſors felt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his Maieſtie findes himſelfe greatly offended in particular, by the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that the ſaid Cardinall vſeth of him and his actions, chiefly, that vnder pretence of gratifying his perſon, he rankes him (as much as in him lyeth) in the number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, commending him onely for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Morall and Naturall, without attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him any Chriſtianitie at all; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Maieſtie glories principally.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he accuſeth him of malice and
<pb facs="tcp:826:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faction, affirming that he hath enterpriſed to ſow Schiſme and deuiſion in this aſſembly of the Eſtates, and in the States of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, endeuouring thereby, to bring in the ſame Article and oth, which himſelfe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on his own ſubiects, and which is worſt of all, deſcribes him in his Gouernement, as if he were a bloudy Tyrant, and as if no ſort of torments could be deuiſed, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth not vpon his Catholike Subiects, whom he preſents ſighing, and as it were, breathles vnder the yoke of perſecution; &amp; at the end of this diſcourſe (by way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis) ſaith, that, God bee thanked, the French are not vnder a King that maketh Martyrs. Inferring thereby, that the King of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> is ſo cruell and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as he taketh pleaſure in the effuſion of the bloud of Innocents.</p>
            <p>But his Maieſtie being content to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder his feete, all theſe opprobries and iniuries, which concerne but his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſtandeth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any reparation with the Cardinall, but onely eſteemeth himſelfe obliged, and ſhould thinke himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue and wanting in that, which God and
<pb facs="tcp:826:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nature hath made him to bee, if he did not teſtifie vnto the full, the ſenſible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he herein hath, touching the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſafetie, and dignitie of Kings in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; which the ſaid Cardinall by this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime and pernicious ſpeech of his, doth abaſe and ſubiect to the diſpoſing of another.</p>
            <p>This is that which his Maieſtie hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me liuely, and ſeriouſly to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate vnto this State, to the end, that your Maieſties, and my Lords of your Counſell, opening your eyes to ſee and apprehend (as is requiſite) the ſcandall, danger, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence of this doctrine, aſwell in generall to all Chriſtendome, as to the State of France in particular, may ſpeedily prouide a forcible remedy for the choaking of the ſeede hereof. And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Maieſtie out of the impreſſion of that hearty and ſincere amitie, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the late King, whoſe loſſe he daily deplores, and whoſe memory hee honours with all reſpect in his heart, hath charged me to ſhew and call to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties remembrance, that during the life of the ſaid King, they contracted this amiable
<pb facs="tcp:826:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accord, and brotherly agreement, betweene them in ſuch ſort, that when it ſhould pleaſe God to take vnto him one of the two, the Suruiuor ſhould vndertake as Father and Protector of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the predeceaſed.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe, his Maieſtie (deſiring to acquit himſelfe of this obligation and duty, which he beareth to the remembrance of him, whom he ſo faithfully loued during his life) cannot but declare the liuely fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and commiſeration, which hee hath of the miſerable and perillous eſtate of your Maieſtie his moſt deare Brother, which is continually in danger, if the doctrine of the Cardinall be receiued &amp; allowed in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore his Maieſtie, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charage of his conſcience, and dutie of his quality, deſires, and requires this ſtate, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to manifeſt to the view and knowledge of all the world, (by publike and rigorous ſuppreſſion of the oration of the ſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and by a ſolemne decree touching the ſame) their diſauowing and condemning of this new and accurſed doctrine, to the end, that by this declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the licentious Spirits of your ſubiects may the better bee kept in the duty of their fidelitie and obedience</p>

            <p>SIR, hauing vnderſtood by your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which your Maieſtie vouchſafed to write vnto mee, by <hi>Monſ. de Pont Chartrain,</hi> the 26. of this Moneth, the ſpeedy reſolution which you haue to vndertake your voyage into Guyenne, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it pleaſeth your Maieſty to impoſe on me, to goe and accompany you in the ſame, I judged that this departure ſo haſtie (without order firſt giuen to the affaires of your State, and prouiſion for the diſorders which haue beene repreſented vnto you, both by your States generall, as alſo your Court of Parliament of Paris) was but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

couert of their owne pernicious deſignes, and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t counſels too manifeſt to be now doubted of, and too publike to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſuffered any longer, ſeeing they tend to the ſubuerſion of your State, the weakning of your Crowne, and the ruine of thoſe of your Bloud and other Princes, and Officers of your Crowne, and principall Lords of your Kingdome.
