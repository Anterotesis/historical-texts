            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat if it be altogether uncomfortable to ſay unto the naked and deſtitute of daily food, be you warmed and filled, when nothing is given needful for the body, how extreamly grievous would it be to ſay unto ſuch; ye are warmed, ye are filled, when their cold and hunger is increaſed; but nothing miniſtred for ſuſtent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet except we ſhould ſtifle our Conſciences, betray the truth, and by a ſinful ſilence, even break our hearts; we cannot but atteſt and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that, of this ſad and woful nature is our miſery.</p>
            <p>For how uncomfortable, yea, what torment of ſpirit, muſt it neceſſarily be to a people that have done and ſuffered ſo much and ſo many ſeveral kinds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for recovery of our Native Liberties, and for redreſs of grievances, not only to be fruſtrated in all our hopes, and to be deprived of them by thoſe who can and ought in Conſcience to reſtore the one, and to redreſs the other, (being oblieged thereunto by all poſſible tyes both to God and Man,) but to be born down continually, by private and publick diſcourſes, (yea, and to have it dangerous for any to deny) that we are a free people, that we have injoyed the firſt, and that this is the ſecond year of <hi>Englands</hi> Liberty, when <hi>God</hi> he knoweth, we find and feel the contrary: our juſt fundamental Liberties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never more invaded and reſtrained, our burthens never more grievous, and which maketh them ten fold more grievous: our very groans, ſighes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints (of late) meet with no relief, but are attended with threats, bonds, impriſonments, yea death it ſelf; a condition ſufficient to diſtract us, but that <hi>God,</hi> we truſt, ſupports us for better things, in dread of whoſe awful and glorious name, we dare neither by ſpeech nor ſilence call good evil, nor evil good; we dare not ſay, our Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rties are reſtored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or our grievances as yet redreſſed.</p>
            <p>And although there are a ſort of men, formerly full of complaints, for want of thoſe Liberties, and frequent in <hi>Petitions</hi> for them whoſe mouthes being ſince ſtop't with Offices and imployment of gain, Honour, or domination, or by relations to ſuch as have them, that are not only ſilent themſelves, as to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint now, but make it their works to ſuppreſs and ſilence all others, and to boaſt of the happineſs and freedom of theſe ſad times; yet the woful lamentations of well minded people, throughout the Land, bear witneſs againſt them; and the things themſelves bear witneſs againſt them, and againſt all ſuch unchriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions: We judge our ſelves bound in Conſcience, to bear our witneſs perpetually, though 10000. High Courts of Juſtice (thoſe new <hi>Engliſh Monſters;)</hi> were ſet up to terriefie or devoure us, chuſing rather to ſuffer for a cauſe ſo evidently righteous, then to enjoy the pleaſures of corruption, for a ſeaſon; and it will be good that all ſuch mockers, remember that it will be bitterneſs in the latter end.</p>
            <p>And that it may not be ſaid unto us, as it was to the over-grieved <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ye are idle, ye are idle, or that we intend to aſperſe or ſcandalize <hi>Authority,</hi> (a hard meaſure we frequently meet withall.) In the bowels of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> we beſeech you, bear with us in comparing times with times, and the things of the former times of bondage, with the preſent; ſo much cryed up, for Liberty and Freedom.</p>
            <p>And ſurely it will be found, and cannot be denyed, that if it were a breach of known liberty, and a ſore grievance that any Laws ſhould be made, or Cuſtoms brought in, contrary to our Native Liberties contained in <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> ſuch being null and void in themſelves, and not to be obeyed, though made in full <hi>Parliament:</hi> (as appeareth in the caſe of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley)</hi> how exceeding grievous muſt the late Act declaring what ſhall be treaſon, that for unlicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Printing,</hi> and that for erecting the High Court of Juſtice, &amp;c. appear in theſe times; was impriſonment for debt, confeſt by all to be an incroachment upon our juſt Right? and is it not lamentable, it ſhould be continued to the ruine of the poorer, and to the ſheltering of the richer ſort of debters, as it is known to be? was it grievous, that all men were made liable to be attached by <hi>Purſevants,</hi> to be adjudged, fined, impriſoned, by the Councel-board High Commiſſion and <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> without being tryed by <hi>Juries,</hi> to be examined againſt themſelves, and impriſoned in illegal Priſons, and remote Caſtles, and there to be moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly abuſed? And doth not the ſame dealing from a continued <hi>Parliament,</hi> a <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Committees,</hi> executed by <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> and <hi>Souldiers</hi> too, violently hauling and terrifying people, prove much more grievous? If Tythes were then a burthen to the induſtrious and conſcientious, is it not much heavier now, being exacted upon treble damages? If Cuſtoms then were accounted an unreaſonable burthen, diſtructive to traffique and navigation, can they be leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required with more ſtrictneſs and ſeverity? If Patents and Projects, and Ship-money, were intolerable burthens and grievances: how much more burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and deſtructive to Trade, is the Exciſe and the perplexities thereon depending to all <hi>Tradeſ-men,</hi> and conſequently to all induſtrious people? If the great number of Officers belonging to the <hi>High Commiſſion Star-Chamber Councel-board,</hi> to <hi>Pattentees, Projectors, Biſhops, Courts,</hi> and the like, bred and foſtered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt againſt the common freedom of the People, to their exceſſive charge and trouble: all ſuch being arguers for arbitrary power, and maintaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by the ſweat of other mens browes, is it not ſo and much more, by thoſe many imployed about <hi>Cuſtoms, Exciſe,</hi> and in <hi>Committees:</hi> in ſo much, as men can har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

If it were then deemed moſt injurious, to make it dangerous to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Parliament:</hi> is it not moſt lamentable, that it ſhould be now as dangerous to move for a new <hi>Parliament,</hi> after ſo long continuance, and ſo many grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unremoved? If Conſcience then were oppreſſed by Oaths of Allegiance and ſupremacy is not the enforcement of the <hi>Engagement</hi> upon penalty of being our-law'd, a greater grievance? If Conſcience in divine worſhip were free only to ſome, is not its freedom reſtrained now? or ſhould we for that one part of our juſt freedom, ſell all the reſt of our <hi>Birth-right, (God</hi> forbid) and the liberty of <hi>Printing</hi> more reſtrained, (except to books maintaining the moſt tyranous principles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es were judged of cruelty, in cenſuring men to be whipt, gag'd, and pillor'd, for ſmall or verbal things; how can that time eſcape that makes the like verbal things Capital, as is evident in many Acts of this <hi>Parliament?</hi> If it were deemed of dangerous conſequence, that almoſt all <hi>Officers &amp; Magiſtrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> both civil &amp; milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>Judges, Sheriffs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtices, &amp;c.</hi> were not choſen in a free way by the People, (as by right they ought) but were choſen and impoſed by the <hi>Court,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to incline all men and things to the bent of one particular party or Intereſt, rather then to the impartial good of all, is it not as prejudicial to be ſo now? If monopolizing of the principal Marchandizes of the Nation by Companies, were then eſteemed a moſt pernitious evil, they remain ſtill much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo alſo do Law-ſutes, and all proceedings in Law, continue as full of tedious chargable perplexities as ever, and the numbers of <hi>Lawyers, Attorneys, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors, Goalers,</hi> and their <hi>Officers,</hi> all feeding themſelves fat, as the other <hi>Officers</hi> forementioned) by the ſpoyles of the diſtreſſed, never more countenanced, yea, 1000. pounds a peece <hi>per annum,</hi> added to the <hi>Judges</hi> above their ordinary Fees, which alone was formerly accounted a large proportion, and great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If tryals by extraordinary packt <hi>Commiſſions</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and <hi>Tryals</hi> by <hi>Court-Martials,</hi> (though of looſe and diſſolute people) were eſteemed utterly deſtructive to the Lives &amp; Liberties of the People, (as appeareth by the <hi>Petition of Right,)</hi> are not thoſe kinds of <hi>Tryals</hi> more frequent now, or can any thing exceed in dangerous <hi>Tryals</hi> by <hi>High Courts</hi> of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> a <hi>Court</hi> againſt which no legal defence or priviledge is permitted, it being to be admired, that in times preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding liberty, there ſhould be found perſons to ſerve in ſuch a <hi>Court.</hi> If theſe are the effects of Freedom, then are we free indeed; but if they are, we have loſt our underſtandings. If then be conſidered the manifold miſeries accompanying theſe ten years ſtrife for liberty, as decay of <hi>Trade,</hi> exceſſive <hi>Taxes, Poverty</hi> and <hi>War:</hi> to ſupply which, a new and never before heard of grievance is added, as the loſs of Servants and Children, through a liberty given them, to betake themſelves to Arms, though againſt their <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Parents</hi> liking, to the impoveriſhment of whole <hi>Families,</hi> and to the unexpreſſible grief of many tender-hearted <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers.</hi> And then if the <hi>Parliaments Declarations</hi> in behalf of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> with all things concerning <hi>Life, Limb, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> be duly weighed, and after them, thoſe of the <hi>Army,</hi> manifeſting a moſt deep ſenſe of the long ſuffering of the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for want thereof: would it not pierce and grieve the moſt hard and ſtony heart, that yet all things ſhould remain in this woful condition, as is evident they now do? And that through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, diviſions, and diſtractions, ariſing from ſo continued an unſettlement, and the preſumption of enemies thereupon, a War ſhould frequently be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the bowels of the Land, (as more then once hath been ſeen) and that a more dangerous one then any yet is now already begun, and yet no regard taken for the real reſtoration of our liberties, or redreſs either of old or new grievances, (the only means of reconcilement) but in place thereof, all mouthes are ſtopt with the meer Title of a free <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and of a free people, to the heightening of all diſcontents, and withholding from the Army the aſſiſtance of thouſands of zealous cordial people, that upon the real (but not verbal) reſtoration to juſt Liberties, and the real redreſs of thoſe known grievances, would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>And therefore as you tender the preſervation of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> from utter annihilation, (a thing much to be feared upon prevalence of an Enemy, which <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend) the ſupply and recruit of this Army, the ſpeedy ending of this moſt threatning War, as you regard the end for which the people choſe you, or that for which the Army reſerved you; when they excluded the greater number of your own Members: as you regard you own ſafeties, or that which is above all the known will of God in the keeping of a good Conſcience, and performance of all your promiſes and vowes, made in his all-ſeeing preſence: We beg and beſeech you for the tender mercies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that you will be pleaſed inſtantly to make a plenary reſtoration to our fundamental liberties, and really redreſs all the grievances foremencioned; and for a clear pledge of your full purpoſe therein, that you will immediatly and for ever aboliſh the High Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (that <hi>Serpent</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with open mouth to devoure us: and from which, none can be ſafe, whilſt treacherous Informers can be found) and to null all things and proceedings apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereunto, as a Plant, which our fore Fathers never planted, but would have ventured all they had willingly, to have rooted out any juriſdiction of ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign a breed, ſo expreſly oppoſite to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, as is manifeſt by what trouble and danger they under went in all former times.</p>
            <p>But if ſo be the whole work be too hard for you, or that you cannot agree therein, before the War growes to faſt upon you; We beſeech you then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the humble Petition and advice of his <hi>Excellency</hi> and Councel of Officers, the 20. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1649. with thoſe other Petitions to the ſame effect, concerning the way of ſettlement by an agreement of the People, and that you will be pleaſed to give countenance and protection to all peaceable people, in entering into ſuch an agreement as themſelves ſhall judge moſt effectual to their own ſafety, Freedom and well-being, and whereby they may ſet ſuch expreſs bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, to all kinds of Authorities, ſo reſtore and eſtabliſh their fundamental Liberties, and ſo unrevocably remove their burthens, and redreſs their grievances, as ſhall not be in the power of future Authorities or perſons (without certainty of puniſhment) to ſupplant the one, or to re-impoſe the other; and this work we truſt in God, you will freely incourage, having acknowledged by your votes, the People to be the original power, from whom all juſt Authorities are derived, which were unavailable, if you ſhould (which <hi>God</hi> forbid) withhold them from exerciſing the ſame, in a work wherein they are ſo nearly concerned: and which once effected, would render the Nation abſolutely free, (not in word only) but in deed and in truth, to the exceeding joy of your humble, (but as yet grieved <hi>Petitioners,</hi> and of all well-minded people) reſtore it to much more unity within it ſelf, and ſo, would become more formidable to all ſorts of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, your labours would be exceedingly abated. And in countenancing ſo juſt, ſo due a work, would bring great Honour to God, Peace, Freedom, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> be at reſt in your own Conſciences, guarded by the cordial volentary affection of the People, whilſt you live here, and remain as a ſweet ſavor to all Poſterity. And thus as faithful Witneſſes to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and in behalf of the Nations juſt Rights, we have diſcharged our Conſciences, referring the Iſſue and our ſelves wholly to <hi>God,</hi> whom we continually worſhip in <hi>ſpirit</hi> and in <hi>truth;</hi> and before whoſe righteous judgement we muſt all one day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: and therefore although for <hi>the Truths ſake,</hi> our portion in this life ſhould be ſcofs, reproaches, afflictions, poverty, impriſonment, or Death: We have choſen it, rather then at that great and terrible day of the Lord, to have our portion with the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or that our Conſciences ſhould then teſtifie againſt us, that we have made lyes our refuge. <hi>This is printed only for the better gathering of Subſcriptions, 'tis deſired you would make no other uſe of it.</hi>
