            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>TO THE SOCIETIES FOR THE Reformation of Manners, In the CITIES of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster.</head>
            <p>WHEN First desired by You to Preach the Ensuing Sermon, my Compliance would have been more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly obtained, had I taken time to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That it came within the Number of the Discourses that were to be Printed at your Request; yea, to be the <hi>last</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>A Subject, exhausted by <hi>Eleven Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> of so great Name and Worth, can receive little Advantage by the succeeding Attempts of a Head so barren, and a Heart so cold as mine.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, My Promise being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I intreated His Assistance whose Cause I plead; and the Event I commit to Him.</p>
            <p>IF I have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> on any thing said by Others (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> its scarce possible to avoid) its not borrowed from them; for I consulted
<pb facs="tcp:43121:3"/>
none of the former <hi>Sermons</hi> in preparing this.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Medium</hi> which runs through this Discourse is very fit, I'm sure, to inforce what is said before, and notwithstanding the Defects of my Management, I can say, I believe what I deliver, and approve heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily of your <hi>Good Design,</hi> and what's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter urged by others to promote it.</p>
            <p>ITS Matter of <hi>deepest Sorrow,</hi> When Villanies of all Sorts abound, When Men declare their Sins with <hi>Sodoms</hi> Insolency, When our <hi>Settlement</hi> is thereby so exposed, and a probable Safety from the awfullest <hi>Woes,</hi> is held by a Thred so tender as the Life of His Majesty <hi>King WILLIAM.</hi> That yet some Persons of Note require <hi>other</hi> Motives to espouse this Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: And many <hi>Magistrates</hi> shift off the execution of the Laws, tho the Oath of God be upon them.</p>
            <p>HOW rare is a Zealous <hi>Nehemiah?</hi> Nay, Symptoms of our Condition were less dangerous, if all who served at God's Altar admitted <hi>Phineas</hi> for a Pattern of Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedness in resisting Sin as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> are capable, tho he is not to be imitated in the manner of his Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43121:3"/>
BUT amidst great Causes of Fears and Lamentation, let's not ungratefully neglect to adore God's undeserved Goodness, that our Constitution retains so many good Laws against gross Enormities: The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath made an <hi>Address,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant thereto, published a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> so excellently acknowledging the dueness, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and value of <hi>Reformation,</hi> with <hi>Resolves</hi> of promoting it to the utmost. It were very afflictive, as well as uncharitable, to think a stop could be made <hi>here,</hi> and the <hi>execution</hi> of the Laws suspended as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, for this would turn to the Nations <hi>Reproach,</hi> and be an Aggravation of its <hi>Guilt,</hi> by rendring the forecited Instances, a meer <hi>Testimony</hi> against future Neglects, and a cause of severer Judgments.</p>
            <p>NOR is it an inconsiderable Presage of Good, as well as a probable Means of <hi>England</hi>'s Amendment, that you have formed your selves into <hi>Societies for the Reformation of Manners,</hi> a Title becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Christian Name,</hi> an Enterprize alike owing to flagrant Zeal, and amazing Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, an ordinary <hi>Spirit</hi> under common <hi>Assistances,</hi> had been overwhelmed with the very view of the strength of that Tide
<pb facs="tcp:43121:4"/>
of <hi>uncontrouled Wickedness,</hi> which was at first to be stem'd by so very few.</p>
            <p>HOW soon did Divinely inspir'd Minds <hi>coalesce</hi> in this Undertaking?â€”And easily made it evident, That there is no such difference between Members of the <hi>Establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Church,</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that will not be <hi>overlook'd</hi> by all Serious Persons, when the undoubted Concernments of Christ and Practical Godliness are in danger.</p>
            <p>BY an Union founded on a <hi>Bottom,</hi> and designed to <hi>Ends</hi> so truly <hi>Christian,</hi> your <hi>Numbers</hi> were soon increased; Very many Magistrates and Persons of <hi>Eminent Figure</hi> gave up themselves to this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, fit <hi>Rules</hi> were adjusted, and the strange <hi>Successes</hi> which encourag'd your ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attempts, do still grow more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing, being as much beyond the hopes of your <hi>timerous friends,</hi> as the expectations of <hi>surprized Offendors,</hi> (who as Such only, can be ill-willers to this Design) nay, Men <hi>strong in Faith,</hi> are as in a Dream, to see the Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> advanced thus far in so short a time; and induced to hope this to be the dawning of that Season, wherein <hi>Reforming Attempts</hi> shall succeed to those <hi>higher</hi> degrees of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:43121:4"/>
which are prophesied of; altho awful Dispensations may shake the frame of things to introduce it.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, it is no mean effect of your successful Example, That Men of the same Temper in other Places in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are awakened to exert their United Strength in pleading the Cause of <hi>Christ</hi> against <hi>Profaness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YEA <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if blushing at enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging so late, when their Distress and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance had been so astonishingâ€”Do even exceed your Fervour, and <hi>Protestants</hi> of every <hi>Communion</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> account <hi>Reformation</hi> their greatest Business.</p>
            <p>MAY not we hope that your influencing President may in time extend to all other <hi>Protestant Countries;</hi> that none called <hi>Reformed,</hi> as to their <hi>Faith,</hi> may wear the Reproach of neglecting a <hi>Reformation</hi> in their <hi>Manners:</hi> They owe the same Love to their Neighbour as you do, their <hi>Municipal Laws</hi> against Vice, are a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for which they are as accountable as you be for yours: Gross Sins will be as dangerous to every Nation which has equal Light, as they be to <hi>England,</hi> and the Heart wherein a <hi>Divine Principle</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb facs="tcp:43121:5"/>
will <hi>naturally</hi> prompt to the same Zeal against Sin, as they shall hear to be now at Work in your <hi>Societies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT let the happy issue of your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking be more or less extensive; Bless you the Merciful God for <hi>inclining</hi> your Hearts to this Work, and giving you the present <hi>Oportunity</hi> to express your good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not denying you such encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Success.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BE Conscientious in observing the <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> given you in the <hi>Sermons</hi> of all those <hi>Ministers</hi> invited to your assistance, and neglect not to apply their <hi>Encouragements,</hi> that you may be strong and faithful in what respecteth your own Duty in this glorious Attempt, so you will die in Peace in a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> of upright <hi>Vigorous Endeavours</hi> to <hi>serve your Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT this Discourse may among the rest, contribute somewhat to your good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, is the Prayer of,</p>

            <p>TO understand this Text in its aptness to excite your promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>a Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> we must consider the occasion of these Words, which you'll find in the foregoing Verses, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Christ healed a Man possessed with a Devil, who had deprived him of both Sight and Speech. The Hand of that Enemy is sometimes great in Bodily Diseases, and when they come by his immediate Agency upon any Person delivered up by God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure statedly such Effects of his Power; so far, and so long, that Person is said to be <hi>possessed</hi> with the Devil, who is Commissioned thus to vex and hurt him. In this Condition the Man was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43121:6"/>
brought to Christ, who not only remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Diseases, by restoring his Sight and Speech, which was a Cure; but therein he overcame the resisting Power of the Devil, and expell'd him; so that he could no longer have access to the Person as his own priviledged Place, to make him Blind and Dumb: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the Devil's Agency in this Disease, and Christ's Conquest over him in his healing the Diseased Person. V. 23. <hi>And all the People were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of</hi> David? This Miracle filling them with amazement, induceth them to receive Christ as the promised <hi>Messias: q. d.</hi> Who should he be, but <hi>that Rod out of the Stem of</hi> Jesse? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 1. 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 6. Could any below him perform what we have seen and heard? What more Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous can the <hi>Messias</hi> do? The Power of God would never work such a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to favour an Impostor; and no Power below what's Divine, could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly effect it: And seeing his Doctrine agrees with the Old Testament; and these his Works are so plain a Testimony of the Spirit to his being sent of God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43121:6"/>
he must be what he declares himself, <hi>viz. The promised Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Pharisees</hi> not able to deny the Fact, attempt to enervate the Inference the People made therefrom. V. 24. <hi>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, this Fellow doth not cast out Devils, but by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of Devils: q. d.</hi> We grant there is a power more than Humane, in what this Man hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before you, but it's a Diabolical Power this Work is owing to; and it's to serve the Purposes of the Devils, and under the Conduct of their Prince, that this Contemptible Man, unworthy of any Name, is employed even in what you are so amazed at. Therefore instead of thinking him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> you ought to conclude him a grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and reject him as such, and the more for these Infernal Assistances you see afforded to him.</p>
            <p>THIS was a Conclusion too malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for an Apology from meer Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which with what our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to these Men, <hi>V.</hi> 31. 32. gives a probable Reason to conclude, That the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost</hi> is a wilful

ascribing to the power of the Devil, those evident Miracles wrought by the Holy Ghost in Testimony to <hi>Jesus</hi> being the Messias, that so it might be concluded, Jesus was not the Christ, but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor.</p>
            <p>IT'S no wonder, that it's impossible to bring such as commit this Sin to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and consequently to obtain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, because they hereby deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the advantage of Miracles to subdue their Unbelief; yea, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to harden themselves in Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity against him, <hi>who is exalted to give Repentance,</hi> and deliver the Will of God to Mankind.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord Jesus answers this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assertion, by detecting its Weakness, Falshood, and Impossibility<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by justisies the Peoples Conclusion from <hi>v.</hi> 25. to 29. Not to mention his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, <hi>v.</hi> 27. from their Childrens Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the principal Argument is thus drawn <hi>ab impossibili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SATAN must be a designingly wilful Destroyer of his own Kingdom, if Christ did cast out Devils under his Conduct, and by his Virtue, which was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43121:7"/>
a thing of which Satan who was such a Self-lover, and had so great a Reach, could not possibly be guilty. No, the Devil is too wise not to understand his Interest better than thus, especially in a Case so obvious, and so nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself.</p>
            <p>OUR Saviour to clear the force of this Argument, declareth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT God and the Devil have two very distinct Kingdoms, which are Constituted, Ruled, Supported, and Propagated by Ways, and in a manner extremely different, V. 26. <hi>If Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then can his Kingdom stand?</hi> Here is one Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devils, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>But if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God is come among you:</hi> This is the other Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE is in this World so fixed a War between these two Kingdoms, that the one grows upon the others Ruines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE way of Christ, and the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his Doctrine, and scope of all his Attempts, were utterly to overthrow Satan's Kingdom, and advance the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43121:8"/>
4. SATAN's Kingdom was effectually weakned, and the Kingdom of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and enlarged by all that power which Christ had put forth in this and all other Miracles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WHATEVER Christ did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute by his exerted Power to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Satan's Kingdom, was in a way of force and violence upon Satan, and not with his Consent.</p>
            <p>ALL these things are implied in <hi>v.</hi> 26. 28. and most expresly <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Or else how can one enter into a strong Man's House, and spoil his Goods, except he first bind the strong Man, and then he will spoil his House.</hi> The Sum of Christ's Plea is this, it's impossible the Devil who is a Being so sagacious and experienc'd, should wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly help me to offer violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and thereby enable me to force him out of his Throne, rescue the Prey out of his Jaws, pluck down what he hath so studiously erected, defeat his chief design, and advance God's Throne and Interest, upon the obstructing whereof Satan is constantly and maliciously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. These are things so inconsistent, that without inveterate Malice they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43121:8"/>
be surmized. Nay, I am so far from working Miracles by the power of <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> that it must be evident to every unprejudic'd Person, they are wrought by the Power of God, in whose interest I am so entirely engaged, and which I hereby subserve.</p>
            <p>HAVING given you this account of the Matter our Blessed Saviour is treating of, I shall consider the Text; <hi>He that is not with me, is against me, and he that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth not with me, scattereth abroad.</hi> Herein several things seem designed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AN inforcement of the forecited Argument. <hi>q. d.</hi> Satan is so far from concurring with me in my design, or yielding me assistance by his Power, that he would employ his Skill to support what I am casting down, he would neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect no Method to pull down what I am building up: And instead of favouring my Attempt, his Power would be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against it; the utmost Strength pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by him, he would be sure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert, to obstruct Mens Faith in me, and not to induce them to believe; he would prove me an Impostor, instead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing my Commission. Who then can
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43121:9"/>
surmize that my Miracles are wrought by any virtue derived from him? <hi>Seeing he must be against me, if he be not for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER thing designed is to assert, That the Lord Jesus is the Head of God's Kingdom in its present Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</p>
            <p>THIS is evidenced by the alteration of the Terms; for in a strict connexion with the foregoing Passages, the Words would run thus; He that is not with God's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is against God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But instead thereof, they are, <hi>He that is not with me,</hi> (the Christ) <hi>is against me;</hi> to denote, that the Administration of God's Kingdom is committed to Christ God-Man the Mediator. <hi>q. d.</hi> Legislation, Dominion, Judgment, the Care and Disposal of all Persons and Things which appertain to the Divine Kingdom in this World, I am entrusted with; to me they belong: <hi>The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is upon my Shoulders,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. I am <hi>the King,</hi> Zech. 9. 9. and the Interest of the Deity among Mankind, is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Hands; and therefore Mens adherence to God's Kingdom, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by their adherence to me,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43121:9"/>
to whom the Authority therein is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated.</p>
            <p>CHRIST considered abstractedly as God, is of the same Essence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so originally possessed the Kingdom of God as Creator, in the same very respects as the Father did; he had the same absolute Royal Dominion, and Rectoral Authority was essential to him without a Delegation.</p>
            <p>BUT to Christ as <hi>Mediator,</hi> this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which refers especially to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Fallen Men, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them as redeemed, is given as a Reward: Joh. 13. 3. <hi>Jesus knowing that the Father had put all things into his Hands.</hi> Joh. 5. 22. 27. <hi>For the Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son: And hath given him Authority also to execute Judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</hi> Matth. 28. 18. <hi>All power is given me in Heaven and Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to reduce Apostates to a subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, against whom they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled; this as Wisely, Justly, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and Perfectly administred by Christ, shall be delivered up after all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43121:10"/>
Men have been Tryed at this Redeemer's Bar, and the Equity of his Procedure is solemnly vindicated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>A due Consideration of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as in Christ's Hands, and as it is his Kingdom, would evince <hi>his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> as well as his Mediatorial Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: For were not he truly God, he could not know, and influence so many Minds; Direct, Inspire, Uphold, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, Restrain, Succeed and Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date such a Multitude of Persons, in such variety of Exigencies, at the same time, in different Places, and judge the Secrets of all Men at last.</p>
            <p>IT would also force Mens acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of a <hi>Gospel Law,</hi> without which the Notion of a Gospel Kingdom would be in many respects incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and a judicial proceeding upon Sinners, as Believers, or Unbelievers, Penitent, or Impenitent, were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For by the Law of Innocency, the Penitent believing Sinner would be as infallibly condemned, as he who is a believing Penitent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:43121:10"/>
NEITHER would it be such a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to comprehend how an Obedience short of legal Perfection, is acceptable at a Redeemer's Bar, as a Condition of a Sinner's possessing the Effects of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Righteousness; for his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness being the sole meriting cause of those beneficial Effects, the <hi>Impetration</hi> of them is confined to his Obedience, which was more than adaequate to the Law of Innocency; and so there is no room left for our meriting by our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Gospel, which is the Rule by which Christ only <hi>applieth</hi> the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings purchased by himself: But yet if that Gospel do not entitle us to those Blessings upon our compliance with the Conditions whereupon it offered them to all Sinners, and exclude not them who refuse to comply; then Christ's Gospel Kingdom is a meer <hi>Physical</hi> Kingdom, wherein Benefits are no Motives to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Danger a Disuasive from Sin. Gospel Pleadings, Perswasions, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, have no more place with, and are as improper to them, as to the raging Sea, or hardest Stones; the influence of Consideration is totally excluded, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43121:11"/>
some are haled to Heaven by meer exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, without any regard to their voluntary subjection to the Gospel; and others thrust into Hell, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their wilful refusing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and self-hardening against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Calls, and the Grace offered by the Redeemer. Such thoughts could scarce be conceived possible to one who ever read the Holy Scriptures, unless an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional obscure Passage must govern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole and plain scope of the <hi>Bible;</hi> where a Rectoral Administration towards fallen Man in order to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, is so constantly expressed, and our Saviour is found designedly to call this so very often by the Name <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SHOULD any Sinner <hi>object,</hi> If I should be cast into Hell from under the Gospel, I shall be so dealt with because the Curse of the Law of Innocency lies against me only as a Fallen Sinner. <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> That Sentence took hold of you as Fallen Sinners; but with that, there shall be a <hi>sorer Destruction</hi> for refusing Christ, and rejecting the Mercy of God, which offered you a Freedom from that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43121:11"/>
               <hi>first Condemnation:</hi> And that very offer of Deliverance upon Gospel Terms, the earnest Pleadings of Christ with you to accept it, his Complaints of your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, his Threatnings of sorer Punishments to excite your Minds, his laying your continued and aggravated Ruine upon your wilful Disobedience, and for that as Judge Condemning you at last as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relieved, do fully demonstrate, that Christ's Gospel Kingdom is a Rectoral Constitution adapted to Subjects capable of Moral Government, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Apostacy; and that by these Methods joyned with his assisting Grace, he was treating with you <hi>as such,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing designed by the Text, is a distribution of all Persons into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors of, and Contenders for Christ's Kingdom on the one side, or the Devil's Kingdom on the other. <hi>q. d.</hi> All are with me, or against me, as the Head of the Gospel Kingdom; and he that is not for me, is against me, and for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors: They who gather not with me, <hi>i. e.</hi> they who do not under my Conduct assist and propagate the Divine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43121:12"/>
Interest, which I am managing, such scatter abroad, <hi>i. e.</hi> they oppose the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of God, and in conjunction with Satan they exalt his Dominion and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. None are Neutrals, each is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and suitably employed.</p>
            <p>FROM the Text in connexion with the foregoing Verses; we have ground for these following Observations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Observ.</hi> THERE are two Kingdoms, with their several Interests, in opposition and contest against each other in this lower World.</p>
            <p>THE one is a Kingdom <hi>of Light,</hi> the other of <hi>Darkness;</hi> the one of <hi>Truth,</hi> the other of <hi>Error;</hi> the one administred by <hi>Holy Laws,</hi> the other by <hi>Diabolical</hi> and <hi>Carnal</hi> Maxims:â€”The one a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> the other of <hi>Enmity, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Discord.</hi> The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi> in the one are Rational, Spiritual, and Heavenly; in the other, they are Vain, Sensual, and Earthly. As the one prevaileth, Men become Just, Kind, Temperate, Humble, Pious, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded, and adorned with every Grace; as the other obtaineth, Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Unjust, Malignant, Intemperate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43121:12"/>
Proud, Impious, Earthly-minded, void of every Grace, and Universally vitious. The voluntary <hi>Subjects</hi> of the one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are Men Sober, Regular, Useful, Good, and truly Religious; the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the other are all either Wild, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, Mischievous, as well as Unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Bad, Idolatrous, Profane, or Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: These Kingdoms, so extremely opposite, are in perpetual War, one grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the others decay, as the one prevaileth, the other loseth ground; Peace is impossible between them, yea, a Truce or Cessation cannot be admitted for a moment, tho the Struggles some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in some Places, are more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible than in other.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Observ.</hi> THE Rulers of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Kingdoms and Interests, are Christ God-Man our <hi>Mediator</hi> on the one part, and the Devil consider'd Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively as the Head of the Apostacy on the other part. The Lord Jesus in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature opposeth Satan, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the Territories he long possessed, and erects his Throne where his Seat had been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43121:13"/>
THE Devils severally under whatever Conduct the Superiority in Order, Power, or Office among them doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, do oppose Christ's Attempts, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their own Conquests, defend the Degeneracy introduced by them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Man's Hostility against Heaven, closely guard their Prisoners, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whatever of their Image or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Christ at any time impaireth. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is the Ruler, with whom Christ stands Competitor in every Age.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Observ.</hi> ALL Men are divided into two Parties by their adherence to these two <hi>opposite</hi> Rulers, in their respective In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Designs.</p>
            <p>THE one Party is for Christ, and the <hi>Purposes</hi> he pursues; in this are included all <hi>Good Men,</hi> and whatever <hi>good</hi> they do, especially of a Publick Nature: These under the Conduct of Christ, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance what he is building up, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate what he came to destroy; they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark with him, and fight under his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from an Approbation of his Design as very agreeable to their own renewed Temper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43121:13"/>
THE other Party includes all such who yield up themselves to Satan's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, these have an <hi>Aversion</hi> to Christ and his Interest, from their own corrupt Nature, and no less a <hi>Fondness</hi> for those things he attempteth to destroy. By this their vile Disposition the Devil easily actuates their Faculties, and employs their Powers, and so they become his ready <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> tho they see not that its he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Observ.</hi> ANY Man's <hi>Neutrality</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these engaged Parties, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Rulers and Designs, is altogether impossible.</p>
            <p>EVERY Person is in the one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or the other. By Nature all Men are in Satan's Interests, and under his Power, Eph. 2. 2, <hi>He ruleth in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Disobedience:</hi> By Grace we are delivered from Satan's Power, <hi>and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus,</hi> Col. 1. 13. Christ by the Gospel invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and presseth all to side with him; but until they obey his Call, they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> in Satan's Kingdom, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue on his side in this War, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they can the success of Christ's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43121:14"/>
Attempts, against the Devil's Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>SOME please themselves with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that they are not of a Party with the Devil against Christ, tho they are conscious they are not engaged on Christ's side.â€”But the Vanity of it is apparent from this, that their very <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized Neutrality</hi> is really their being a Party with Satan; for they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bound to be God's <hi>Subjects,</hi> because they were his <hi>Rational Creatures,</hi> and tho by their Rebellion they forfeited the Immunities of his Kingdom, yet an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to continue his Subjects, ceased not thereby.</p>
            <p>NAY further, Christ by his Merits having procured a Restoral of their forfeited <hi>Priviledges,</hi> if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and offering his <hi>Assistance</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to return, he now claimeth their Allegiance, both as God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as his <hi>own Redeemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF therefore after this Claim, Men shall <hi>refuse</hi> to joyn actually with Christ, and to give up themselves to him, must not every Man confess they continue in actual <hi>Rebellion?</hi> Keep they not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43121:14"/>
still in the Enemies Camp, whilst they List not themselves in Christ's Army?â€”Are they not there? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they <hi>lag</hi> or <hi>hide,</hi> 'till they come over to our Lord, whom God hath sent to bring them back to him?</p>
            <p>ALL of you therefore have reason to assure your selves, if you are not actually and explicitly <hi>for</hi> the Lord Jesus, you are <hi>against</hi> him; yea, the Devil is your Leader, you and he have the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest, and drive on the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. These words, <hi>He that is not with me, is against me,</hi> prove what I say, and should awaken us to deep thoughts when we neglect an explicite <hi>Dedication</hi> of our selves to Christ; and also whenever he hath any <hi>Momentous</hi> Concern in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in our Day.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Observ.</hi> IT'S in vain for any Man to <hi>profess</hi> to be on Christ's side, or <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> to his Concernments, if he do not in his place contribute his utmost to serve Christ in promoting his Interest, and pursuing the Designs he is carrying on against Satan's Kingdom in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43121:15"/>
               <hi>HE that gathereth not with Christ, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth abroad, and is not with him, but against him:</hi> By these words he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they who are indeed with him, must be <hi>active</hi> in his Cause, for he will use their Service, tho he do not need it: They must gather with him, or he deems them to be his Enemies, and adjudgeth them <hi>Obstructors</hi> of his Work, if they statedly neglect to <hi>contribute</hi> to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Power.</p>
            <p>NAY, in his account, if his Interest <hi>grows</hi> not by their Labour, they are Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to its <hi>Detriment;</hi> and they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Devil's Purposes, tho they <hi>own</hi> it not.</p>
            <p>SOMEWHAT all Men are doing and pursuing as the scope of their Lives, which fails not to be <hi>pernicious,</hi> if it be not <hi>profitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is our Redeemer's Demand, that Men be entirely and heartily devoted to his Cause, which will not fail to command their <hi>Time,</hi> and employ their <hi>Talents</hi> in his Service. Idle Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and unactive Wishes, are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Testimonies against Hypocrisie in their professed Regards for him,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43121:15"/>
nor fit Evidences that they are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
            <p>AND as vainly do Men hope to escape the <hi>Odium</hi> of being of a Party with the Devil, because they do not <hi>professedly</hi> abet his Cause, or to be unhurtful to Christ's Designs, if they make no direct and deliberate opposition thereto.</p>
            <p>ALAS, you'll find your State will be determined by more <hi>close and substantial</hi> Indications. Our Lord who requir'd <hi>Peter</hi> to evidence the Truth of his Love to him <hi>by feeding his Sheep,</hi> Joh. 21. 16. expects our Discipleship shall be instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a <hi>vigorous</hi> advancement of his Conquests.</p>
            <p>WE must not only cease to provoke him by our <hi>own</hi> Enormities, but we must help on the Reformation of <hi>others,</hi> we must <hi>increase</hi> his Kingdom, by lessening the number of Rebels; and <hi>vindicate</hi> it, by restraining Mens profligate Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as far as we are able.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>is gathering with Christ,</hi> which if we omit, we do one way or other promote Mens Rebellious Disobedience, <hi>which is scattering abroad;</hi> whereby we make Christ's Building more difficult,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43121:16"/>
and less probable, we make havock in his Heritage, pull down what he is so studious to erect; and disperse into the <hi>open Wastes</hi> (where Satan presides) those whom Christ is bringing into his own <hi>Enclosures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Subject would require my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement on each of these <hi>Observationsâ€”</hi>But one Discourse will not admit a prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution even of this last to its full extent. Therefore I shall satisfie my self to have laid a Foundation for what may be most properly directed to your assistance; <hi>as Societies attempting the Reformation of Manners, by putting the Laws in Execution against sundry open Immoralities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT can <hi>engage</hi> you to, or <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> you in this Undertaking; yea, or oblige you to <hi>Diligence</hi> and accurate Circumspection in the prosecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, like this? In this your Attempt you have <hi>Christ</hi> for your Head, and his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and designs to promote, and this in <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> Also, that to neglect it, would <hi>state</hi> you on <hi>Satan</hi>'s side, and for his Interests, in <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43121:16"/>
HOW forcible is any one of these <hi>Considerations?</hi> How much more all of them conjoyned? As indeed they be in favour of your Blessed Enterprize: And this I hope to evidence in the following <hi>Propositions,</hi> which are founded on what I have already spoken to, and will lead me to reassume, and improve those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations I more hastily passed over.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Prop.</hi> THE <hi>Reformation of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Mankind,</hi> is a considerable part of the design of Christ, as Head of the Divine Kingdom in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BY Reformation of Manners,</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the adaequate design of Christ; I mean the turning of Men from Sin to Holiness. This, I confess, is beyond a <hi>Restraint</hi> to such flagitious open Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which limiteth your Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>AND therefore I shall say little of <hi>Reformation,</hi> but under a respect to such <hi>open Evils.</hi> Our Lord finds the World grosly depraved<hi>â€”Serving divers Lusts and Pleasures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. The gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fulfilling of Carnal and Spiritual Lusts, make up the <hi>Sordid Employment</hi> of Apostate Sinners, and this oft in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43121:17"/>
open defiance of God's Authority. Some <hi>are Mad upon their Idols,</hi> Jer. 50. 38. Some are <hi>Blaspheming</hi> the Sacred Name of God, from their Contempt of, and Enmity against him. Some profaning his <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Worship:</hi> Others destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Harmony of this Lower State, by violating the Laws of those several <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> Men stand in to each other; some guilty of <hi>Blood,</hi> others of <hi>Filthy Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Adulteries,</hi> or <hi>defrauding their Neighbours,</hi> or <hi>Lying, Slandering,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>The <hi>prevalency</hi> of such Crimes argueth the <hi>Devil's Empire,</hi> and as far as they obtain <hi>he Reigneth in any place,</hi> Rev. 2. 13. But when these be <hi>Reformed,</hi> his <hi>Seat</hi> so far is overthrown, and the Kingdom of Christ gets ground.</p>
            <p>To reform a World so corrupt, was very becoming a <hi>Holy Jesus,</hi> but possible only to an <hi>Almighty Saviour,</hi> when <hi>all that was in it is Lust,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 16. and the <hi>whole</hi> of it is so easily, agreeably, and deeply <hi>fixed</hi> in Wickedness; yea, <hi>in that wicked one,</hi> who introduced, excites, and maintains this Corruption, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, 1 Joh. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43121:17"/>
AMONG other designs for the Glory of God, and the Benefit of the Creation, Jesus Christ resolveth the Reforming of Menkind; <hi>He came to bless us, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of us from his Iniquity,</hi> Act. 3. 26. For, well knowing Impunity would make no Man happy, whilest his Temper and Course of Life is wicked, he will <hi>Bless us</hi> by Reforming us; and to effect this, was a considerable part of his Errand; the same is attested 1 Joh. 3. 8. <hi>For this Purpose the Son of God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, that he might destroy the Works of the Devil, i. e.</hi> Unrighteous Wicked Works; these <hi>Devilish Bands</hi> wherein <hi>Satan</hi> held Men, <hi>Christ</hi> came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loose.</p>
            <p>The Methods <hi>Christ</hi> took to reform the <hi>World,</hi> are greatly adapted to this end, as well as expressive of his <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> to accomplish it; consider his GOSPEL, <hi>That teacheth us to deny Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteously and Godly in this present World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. And if you will examine this as the <hi>Standard,</hi> it will be found, that the highest professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion with <hi>a bad Life,</hi> and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43121:18"/>
greatest Pretences to Grace, where <hi>Vices</hi> are indulged; make up no more than a <hi>dead Image,</hi> and will prove no other than Damning <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE same Gospel-light will convince you, that the Doctrinal <hi>Opinions</hi> which tend not at all to promote Practical Godliness, are but <hi>vain Notions;</hi> the most <hi>plausible Speculations</hi> which obstruct it, are destructive <hi>Errors;</hi> yea, the most <hi>Orthodox</hi> Conceptions which influence not to a Sober Behaviour, will eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>increase</hi> Mens Condemnation. Nor can any Man wisely examine whether his Knowledge, Faith, or Love, be <hi>saving,</hi> or <hi>not saving,</hi> unless he try them by the Efficacy they have upon the scope of his <hi>Practice;</hi> for they will never prove Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in that Man whom they fail to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>OUR Blessed Lord did not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to our <hi>Reformation,</hi> but he also <hi>suffered Death</hi> to remove the Obstacles to it, and to <hi>procure</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Operations for restoring the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> and turning Men from their wicked Course.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43121:18"/>
HE spoiled the Devil of his Power to that Degree, that he cannot <hi>compel</hi> Men to Transgress, as otherwise he had been able.</p>
            <p>WICKEDNESS he put to the Blush by his own Holy <hi>Example;</hi> and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Barier</hi> against it, by the Authority enstamped on both <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEED I add, his continuing (if not a new implanting) such <hi>Notices</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts</hi> in Fallen Men, as render them <hi>Shy, Asham'd,</hi> and <hi>Afraid</hi> of gross wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, till they be <hi>hardned</hi> by Custom; and even by this scarce ever brought so far, as not <hi>secretly</hi> to disallow their own Vitious Courses, and approve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>NOT to mention his <hi>Providential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints,</hi> and sensible Rebukes to flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Evils, nor his clear Explication of God's Laws; let us note how full and plain an Account he hath given us of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> whereby Sin and Holiness must be far enough from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indifferent Matters to Immortal Souls; for as either of them do Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, we shall be <hi>Eternally</hi> lodged in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43121:19"/>
the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of those two places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>AND for what is this, and the rest which our Lord hath done? But that <hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi> may be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,</hi> and true Religion, Justice, Truth, Love, Purity, and Temperance might <hi>again</hi> prevail, with an <hi>Acknowledgement of himself as the great Means of all.</hi> How happy will this Earth-be, when his Kingdom <hi>overcomes?</hi> That is, when this designed <hi>Reformation Universally prevailethâ€”</hi>The Natural, as well as the Moral Effect of it will be a stop to the <hi>Miseries,</hi> and the Improvement of the <hi>truest Welfare</hi> of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Prop.</hi> ALL they who promote the <hi>Reformation of the Manners of Mankind;</hi> are <hi>so far</hi> with Christ and his Kingdom, and against the Devil and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>THIS determineth whom they follow as their Leader, and what End they live to. Whenever you put a stop to Sin by Advice, Reproof, or <hi>Restraints,</hi> you are opposing what Christ came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy; and when you contribute to the Advancement of Piety and Virtue, you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43121:19"/>
concur with Christ in what his Heart is set on. You may say, <hi>We are Workers together with Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1. and this in what he will own at last. Nor need you fear opposition therein from any besides the Devil, and such as he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: You fight under Christ's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and this is the truest Indication that you are his Subjects and <hi>Followers;</hi> yea, if you do it heartily, and for <hi>right Ends,</hi> it's an Infallible Evidence you are his Disciples in <hi>Sincerity.</hi> To <hi>Proselyte</hi> Men to a Party among <hi>Christians,</hi> will be found no such Testimony of your being for <hi>Christ,</hi> as this Faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Reform Mens Ways.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Prop.</hi> Every Man in his proper Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be for Christ, in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Reformation of others.</hi> To take the Sense of this, you may observe the <hi>extent</hi> of the Obligation; it's <hi>all Men,</hi> each should do somewhat; the <hi>Measure</hi> and Limitation of Men's Attempts, that's to be <hi>according to their proper Station;</hi> the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Service in this Work, must be accommodated to your Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Opportunities. Any <hi>Neglect</hi> is culpable, <hi>utmost</hi> Endeavours will be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43121:20"/>
accepted, and <hi>Order</hi> must be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>THIS is part of the Charge that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies every <hi>Office</hi> of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. <hi>Magistrates</hi> have their Power and Honour, with this affixed thereto, That <hi>they be a Terrour to Evil Doers, and a Praise to them that do well,</hi> Rom. 13. 3, 4. The Supreme Magistrates should enact Laws against <hi>Immoralities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness;</hi> and all in Power must execute the established Penalties <hi>impartially,</hi> and conscientiously.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MINISTERS</hi> are appointed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Threatnings, Instructions, and Censures to disswade from all Iniquities, and prevent them what they can; and a <hi>Woe</hi> is denounced expresly against such as omit this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 6. It were easie to prove that <hi>Masters</hi> are to restrain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Vice in their <hi>Servants,</hi> and that it's incumbent on <hi>Parents</hi> to use all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to subdue Transgressions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Vertue in their <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Charge is so evident, that one would think a claim to Honour and Duty as by Divine Appointment, were disingenious in any in these Superiour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43121:20"/>
Relations, who disregard that <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work,</hi> for which God appointed the said Honour and Authorityâ€”Nor is it any Wonder that Providence oft permits the Inferiour Correlates to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and disobey them who are over them, when Superiors suffer Vice in them to go unrestrained.</p>
            <p>BUT the Obligation of such Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to Reforming Work, is too obvious to insist on; the Scruple may appear greater among Equals, and such may be ready to excuse themselves by saying, <hi>I am a Private Man, without Power over my Neighbour, and therefore free from all Obligations to endeavour their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> To such <hi>I answer,</hi> Either Reforming others is not Christ's Interest, or thou according to thy Station, art obliged to do it; and thou mayest innocently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Amendment of others, or it's thy Duty to promote their Amendment: For the Text is thus extended, <hi>Whoever is not for me, is against me, and who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not with me, scatters abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE, The Magistrate's Sword is not thine to do execution thy self, but Christ by the Magistrate calls to thee,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43121:21"/>
as Exod. 32. 20. <hi>Who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me.</hi> It is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded Fault of the Common People, as well as of others, <hi>None calleth for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> against Atrocious Criminals, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 4. and you may as well say, None except the Magistrate, should <hi>help</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the flying Murtherer; as that no other should assist to Convict the Drunkard, Fornicator, Sabbath-profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Blasphemer. If there were no <hi>Laws</hi> to punish these Offenders; thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate seasonable Reproof, and forbearing their Company, would be thy last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>BUT when there be Laws against such; nay, when the Laws expresly <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> Private Mens Prosecution of such, what can be pretended to exempt you from doing so small a thing as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> against Transgressors, that they may be reclaimed, and the <hi>Land acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by their Punishment?</p>
            <p>THE same Providence that led thee to behold that Offence, (if private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof recover not the Delinquent) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates to thee, thou art that Person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to embitter his Sin to him by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43121:21"/>
Publick Punishment, and so prevent the Contagion by his indulged Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Ends of good Laws</hi> are frustrated, if private Men must not Convict Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for what great use are our Laws against Vitious Practices and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if Multitudes may offend, and none be Punished, unless that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate their Villanies in the sight of some Zealous Magistrates, which are not many? Moreover, the Obligation of Private Persons to restrain Sin as they are able, doth result from that Duty of Love you all owe to your Neighbours, Lev. 19. 17. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy Heart; thou shalt in any wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi> Thy Neighbours Amendment is the End, rebuking him is the Means:â€”But what is meant by this <hi>Rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> No less than that just Severity which is sufficient to reclaim him be used, when gentle Reproof hath been tried in vain:â€”For you may as well say, to reprove him by <hi>Word</hi> is no Duty, if you may stop at that, when you can lawfully bring him under Methods <hi>more severe.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43121:22"/>
For to rebuke him includes the <hi>last</hi> as well as the former:â€”Nor is it less hatred to deny him the help of Legal Punishments, to affright him from 'em, than to grudge him the assistance of a few words of thine own.</p>
            <p>BUT to issue this Point. I put it to your Consciences, is not every Private Person obliged to do all which he hath both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to do, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning of Satan, advancing of Christ, serving his Country, and saving his Neighbour? Will any Man deny this?â€”Now Reforming others by judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prosecuting the Flagitious, tend to these good Ends, and that the meanest among you have a Right and Ability to Convict such Criminals, which is a fit means to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> you cannot pretend: What Pretence than will the obscurity of your Condition yield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the convicting them, being your Duty, as well as others, especially when any Man's giving Testimony for Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is but as a Private Man, and the Law authorizes you therein, as much as if you were a Magistrate; therefore you are as much obliged to Witness, as any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43121:22"/>
Magistrate: And you have no Plea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst engaging herein, but what might command a Blush; for he that <hi>pondereth the Heart</hi> sees, and will force your selves to own, that you omit it, because you secretly favour Satan's Empire against Christ, you make a light account of the evil and danger of these Sins, you are under a Cursed Indifferency for Christ's Interest, and prefer your Gain, Ease, and Safety above them: Nay, you hate your Brother, and are well content, that <hi>Satan</hi>'s depraving and destructive ways should abide and prevail.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE lay by your Excuses, and say no more, <hi>Am I my Brother's Keeper?</hi> Why should I intermeddle?</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Prop.</hi> EVERY Faithful Christian, and Follower of Christ, must and will subserve <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Work of Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Text will bear this Connexion, <hi>He that is for me, will gather with me:</hi> If any Man be truly devoted to me as his Head and Leader, he will concur with me in promoting Religion, Truth, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Temperance, and Purity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ruines of Irreligion, Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Falshood, Injustice, Drunkenness,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43121:23"/>
and Debaucheries. And, my Friends, this is so far from Contingency, that there is a necessity, and a certain futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it from the very Constitution and Essentials of a true Christian, even such, that he cannot be a <hi>Christian</hi> indeed, who statedly, and altogether omits it.</p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>IT is implied in our Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Christ.</hi> We become Christians by our Dedication to the Lord Jesus, and that Dedication can amount to no less than that we do renounce the World, Flesh and Devil, and will fight under Christ's Banner, and stand by his Cause and Interests against <hi>Satan</hi> and his Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, which interpretatively is not only, that the Devil and the Flesh shall not govern me in particular, but that as far as I am able, they shall govern no other Person; they shall have no place whence I can expel them, I'll adhere to Christ, and vigorously follow him in all just Attempts for their Restraint and Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
            <p>YOU wear a Christian Name, and you own that you yeilded up your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Christ by Covenant-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: How then is it possible, if your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43121:23"/>
Hearts were right, to hear his Name Blasphemed, see his Day Unhallowed, his Laws trampled on, and what he came to destroy, maintained with defiance, and you connive at Mens doing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, when you have the happy advantage of <hi>good Laws</hi> to put a stop thereto.</p>
            <p>TO reconcile this to <hi>Christianity,</hi> you must reckon that Profaness and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are <hi>part</hi> of your <hi>Christian Vow;</hi> or that <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in vowing is allowable, or else that in giving up your selves to Christ, you <hi>truly intended</hi> no more than what may be thus expressed. Oh thou my Saviour! To thee I yield up my self, that by thee I may <hi>get</hi> Safety, and Life Eternal; but I am not so much as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a wicked Neighbour, or at all to expose my self in resisting <hi>thy</hi> Enemies, avouching <hi>thy</hi> Interests, or pleading <hi>thy</hi> Cause: I must be <hi>exempted</hi> from all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Expence, and Hazard, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee as my Leader; I will be <hi>Neutral</hi> in thy Undertaking to reform the <hi>World,</hi> and excepted from pursuing that Design. <hi>With these Limitations,</hi> I'm content to give up my self to thee, this is all I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43121:24"/>
mean by my <hi>Christian Dedication,</hi> and if therein thou insistest upon more Service on my part, I disavow and <hi>renounce</hi> that Dedication, and shall shew that I do so by my indifferency and neglect, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou puttest me on helping forwards <hi>the Work of Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHATEVER you may farcy, thus must your <hi>Foederal</hi> Transactings with Christ be interpreted, if you esteem your selves <hi>unobliged</hi> to restrain other Mens Oaths and Enormities.</p>
            <p>BUT how are you imposed on by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and your own Carnal Minds, if you can imagine that this is to be <hi>Baptized in (or into) the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. or that <hi>a good Conscience answers</hi> to no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in <hi>that Baptism which saveth,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. Read the <hi>Gospel</hi> again, and you'll soon find it Condemneth such a heartless and <hi>deceitful</hi> sense of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedness to Christ, a sense which every <hi>Gracious</hi> Soul must abhor; yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ingenuity will detest, as Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Base, and too mean for a <hi>Christian</hi> to offer, or a Blessed Redeemer to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Every real Saint will reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43121:24"/>
               <hi>separated</hi> to Christ, and that Christ hath thereupon an absolute <hi>Propriety</hi> in him, and that it's by the utmost <hi>Services</hi> this Propriety is to be acknowledg'd; his Language is <hi>the God whose I am, and whom I serve,</hi> Act. 27. 23. <hi>To me to live is Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Regenerate Nature impels</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to further the Work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>EVERY true Christian is <hi>partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. by this he is denominated the Regenerate <hi>Seed</hi> of Christ, because he is in a degree tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformed to Christ in his Temper and Inclinations, and thence he loveth and abhorreth things correspondently to what Christ doth: Upon which very account the reforming designs of Christ are <hi>lovely</hi> to the Genuine Christian, and all daring wickedness is <hi>detested</hi> by him; yea, a Zeal for the restraint of Sin, and for promoting Holiness, is become his <hi>Natural Instinct;</hi> and therefore he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the Criminal Exorbitancies he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and must offer a violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self when he testifieth not his dislike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst open Wickedness, as well as his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43121:25"/>
approbation of what's virtuous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</p>
            <p>HOW impossible then must it be to such a Man to have a prospect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the flagitious and a certainty of restraining their open and daring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and yet neglect the means which are in his Hand to effect these things?</p>
            <p>YOU must suppose the Judgment, Conscience, Will and Affections of this Man altogether unactive; nay, himself to move statedly against his strongest biass, and Divine Influences to yield, nor excite any Holy Propensions, if Sloath, or Carnality can reconcile him to indulge what he so abominates, and to neglect what his Heart is so intensly bent for.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, you must conclude this Man to pray in a deceitful manner, and to counter-act his own Petitions, for he daily prayeth, <hi>Thy Name be Sanctified,</hi> and yet suffers it to be Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed; <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> and yet countenanceth Rebellion: <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> and yet conniveth at the daring violation of God's plain Commandments, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

            <p>A good Man from the instinct of a Holy Nature saith, <hi>Rivers of Water run down mine Eyes, because they keep not thy Laws,</hi> Ps. 119. 136. And is it possible he should refuse Labour and Expence to ease himself of what he thus heartily complains. What costs him Floods of Tears when he cannot prevent it, must force his utmost endeavours to subdue it.</p>
            <p>WHENEVER you determine that a Regenerate Person may neglect to help forwards the Work of Reformation, you must account him to frustrate his greatest hopes, which are, That there shall be <hi>a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 13. He must be reckon'd free from the impress that <hi>every Nature</hi> is under the power of, <hi>viz.</hi> an abhorrence against what is destructive to it, and an aptness to propagate it self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THE Reforming of the World is one great design of Christ's Discipling and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Men into his Kingdom.</hi>

THIS is the Charge they receive, this is a great part of their Trust, and they must be treacherous to him, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that Trust, if they omit to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, cleanse, and reform the World to the utmost of their Capacity. Christ as the Head of the Humane Nature, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a War against the Devil, to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue Sinners out of his Power, <hi>to divide the Spoil,</hi> Isa. 53. 12.</p>
            <p>HE might have employed Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in this Contest; but he will put an Honour upon sinful Men also in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. He could have furnished all the Men he employ'd, with the Dignity, Force, and Authority of <hi>Princes;</hi> but for the generality he makes use of a few mean ordinary Persons, that <hi>Satan</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, tho assisted with the Scepters of most Kings, might be more <hi>tormenting</hi> to the Devil, and more <hi>Honourable</hi> to Christ. Of this number assisting Christ in this War is every real Christian reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and upon his efficacious Call, he <hi>enrolls</hi> them his Subjects, and by making them Christians, he lists them <hi>Soldiers;</hi> not only to fight their <hi>own</hi> way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but to assist Christ's Cause, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

            <p>VERY often they bear their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for Christ, by <hi>enduring only a Fight of Afflictions,</hi> Heb. 10. 32. and thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Dying, Rev.</hi> 12. 11. The more qualified among them defend the Faith by <hi>Arguments</hi> as well as by Sufferings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. But the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Trust of each Christian, and at all times, and by all due ways, is no less than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That in defence of the Laws of Christ, they <hi>strive against Sin,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. (which must oft be other Mens Sins, or their Blood had not been in apparent danger to be shed for striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against them.) And that with the Doctrine of Christ, they promote Piety, and Virtue, which that Doctrine fails not to produce, where-ever it is sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received.</p>
            <p>AT some Seasons Christ gives an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his Followers, by wholsome Laws, and Godly Magistratesâ€”And when it's so, can you think their own safety suspends their Trust? Or that he who was to <hi>die a Martyr,</hi> for testifying against Sin, must not oppose Sin by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43121:27"/>
to put those Laws in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which are enacted against it, such a supposition argues their <hi>Quiet</hi> is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Church in a worse sense than it hath been as yet accounted, <hi>viz.</hi> that it relaxeth all Obligations on <hi>private</hi> Christians to endeavour faithfully the Worlds Amendment.</p>
            <p>THEY that govern themselves by this Notion, would scarce have been Martyrs for any concern of Christ in a Day of Suffering; for if Idleness, or a Scoff be enough to deter from <hi>resisting</hi> Sin, surely a Flame, a Gibbet, or loss of Estate would prove sufficient to make them <hi>commit</hi> those Sins, and <hi>Condemn</hi> all Holiness.</p>
            <p>HAD former <hi>Martyrs</hi> lived in our Days, that Zeal which governed them to <hi>die</hi> for Christ's Truths, and Laws, must have compelled them now to <hi>act</hi> vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously for his Laws, and never cease to adore that Grace which afforded them the Protection and Assistance of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in so acting for Christ against Sin and Satan.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>UNION</hi> in these great things may well consist with <hi>difference</hi> in less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Matters, and is more Christian

               </p>
               <p>DIFFICULTIES I know are apt to deter from <hi>beginning,</hi> and to discourage you from <hi>proceeding</hi> in this Work, tho Honourable; and he is unthoughtful who acknowledgeth not the Difficulties to be great.

               <p>IN our Land <hi>Custom</hi> hath heightened the Torrent of Profaness and Irreligion, and makes feeble means incapable to put a stop thereto.</p>
               <p>GREATNESS and Multitude still too much support these, as former Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for unworthy Designs, had a great hand in introducing and making them fashionable.</p>

                  <hi>you, than can be against you;</hi> and the ground for Courage much exceeds that of Despondency. For this end review a little.</p>

               <p>MY Text tells you it is <hi>for Christ;</hi> he is your Head, to whom <hi>the Kingdom is given,</hi> and who is <hi>far above Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers,</hi> Eph. 1. 21, 22. You have him for your <hi>Leader,</hi> who hath the security of Heaven, that he shall <hi>Reign and Overcome,</hi> Rev. 17. 14. and <hi>of whose Kingdom there shall be no end,</hi> Dan. 7. 14. In the Fight you are sure to prosper in the <hi>proper</hi> Season, which if delayed, he will alike own and reward your Faithful Endeavours, as if your Success were greatest.</p>

CAUSE of fear in this Enterprize you have none, when he can protect you in the utmost danger, and hath a Right to admit you into his Heavenly Kingdom when your Work is over, both which he will infallibly do, for <hi>he hath the Keys of</hi> David, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 7.</p>
               <p>GO on then, for no Faithful Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can ever be <hi>ashamed</hi> of this General; nor will he be ashamed of such. His Eye is still upon you, and his Presence ever with you, to renew your <hi>strength</hi> and afford <hi>Supports. Angels</hi> think this Employment for him to be their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. And can you disdain it? Millions of <hi>Martyrs</hi> have esteemed his Service <hi>safe,</hi> even when they <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and how can you be afraid?</p>
               <p>YOU are for him who is <hi>the God of the Spirits of all Flesh,</hi> able to alter Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and change Mens Minds. Yea, can command unexpected <hi>Success</hi> to the poorest Instruments.</p>
               <p n="2">II. CONSIDER what you are striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and against what.</p>
               <p>'TIS <hi>for what</hi> God, and Angels, and all Good Men approve; yea, it's for the Interest of CHRIST on Earth:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43121:30"/>
Things, that when they prevail, will make Mankind happy? And they are what shall most certainly prevail against the utmost opposition of Earth and Hell; what you attempt to advance, will justifie the greatest Expence, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Hazards.</p>
               <p>BUT against what do you contend? It's against <hi>Profaness and Debauchery;</hi> not things <hi>good,</hi> nay, not <hi>disputable,</hi> or <hi>indifferent;</hi> but so plainly <hi>evil,</hi> that the most brutish would <hi>blush</hi> to plead for; it's against the <hi>Reproach</hi> and <hi>Leprosie</hi> of Humane Nature, the <hi>Causes</hi> of our past Calamities, and what can alone <hi>endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> the Nation for the future: These Sins, themselves are the <hi>sorest Plagues.</hi> It's Vice you would extirpate, which makes its Abettors <hi>Cowardly:</hi> It's what <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as Revelation, testifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, it's what few Sinners like in their own Children: Who would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to reduce and remove such?</p>

               <p>TAKE Courage, it's against one who is an <hi>Usurper,</hi> and whom his most Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious Followers are <hi>ashamed</hi> to own, and <hi>afraid</hi> to see.</p>
               <p>IN a word, greater, stronger, wiser, and better is he that leads you in this Work, than he whom the World fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in opposing Reformation.</p>
               <p>AND as for the <hi>Men</hi> who engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the attempt of suppressing Vice, they can be none but the <hi>Inconsiderate</hi> part even of <hi>Brutal</hi> Persons; and as they are at this Day <hi>restrained</hi> by Laws from doing you much open Injury, so their own Consciences will soon approve your Attempts to better them, they'll

               <p n="1">1. WITH respect to the <hi>Preliminaries to, and the first Words of my Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>STATE not <hi>Christ's</hi> Designs which you propose to serve by your <hi>hasty Fancy,</hi> but <hi>his</hi> own plain adjustment of them; you are not for Christ by espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing an <hi>Error;</hi> you act not with, or for him in opposing what he <hi>forbids not,</hi> or violently contending for what is <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> trivial, or doubtful; his Kingdoms Concernment lies in what is <hi>commanded, plain,</hi> and <hi>momentous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND therefore let your Endeavours be laid out in proportion to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his <hi>Word</hi> gives concerning things, and tho it be too unusual, yet be you as earnest for what is important, and <hi>plainly</hi> commanded, and <hi>against</hi> what is flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and <hi>plainly</hi> Prohibited, as others are apt to be for trifles of <hi>their own</hi> invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43121:33"/>
or against Sins of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>AND withal, be <hi>afraid,</hi> without high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Scripture Evidence</hi> well applied, to judge any Men, or Party of <hi>Protestants,</hi> to be <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against Christ,</hi> in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from others: It would make a Tender Heart to bleed to hear <hi>two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes</hi> apply that one Text against Men of a <hi>duer</hi> Temper, <hi>How long halt ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Opinions?

               </p>
               <p>THINK not lightly as to your selves of such Sins as fall not under the edge of the <hi>Magistrate's Sword:</hi> For tho they are not so hurtful to <hi>Humane Societies,</hi> and therefore not so provided against by the Law of Man, yet they are as contrary to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and inconsistent with it, as others be. <hi>Brutal</hi> Sins are chiefly those you have the Law on your side to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish: But be you alike watchful against <hi>Devilish</hi> Sins, such as Malice, Envy,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43121:33"/>
Pride, Rancour, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Guard also against Infidelity, Hypocrisie, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Selfishness, and all Impurity of Heart; which with the like Sins God <hi>reserves</hi> for Punishment in endless Flames.</p>
               <p>WATCH strictly that no Scandalous Practices of <hi>your own,</hi> blemish, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct your Undertaking; for you will be more observed than others, and your Faults will induce a Charge of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie upon all active Instruments, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so sincere.</p>

               <p>TAKE care that your Ends, and the Principle you act from, be approved by the <hi>Heart-searching God;</hi> that so you may not loose your Reward, nor forfeit his Defence: And know, it's possible for <hi>Carnal-Selfishness</hi> to be the Spring of

Actions advanced to the height of these, tho so very excellent.</p>
               <p>Go not out of your own Station, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use any unjustifiable means, least you prove <hi>Snares</hi> to others, or your selves, instead of Reformers.</p>
               <p>BE tender of your Neighbour's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and therefore publish no Man's Faults, unless it be before the Magistrate in order to Civil Punishments; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Persons authorized to inflict Church Censures: <hi>Reproachful Railing</hi> was never ordained by God, or Man, to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Means: And he who chargeth you <hi>to speak not evil of one another,</hi> Jam. 4. 11. <hi>Yea, of no Man,</hi> Tit. 3. 2. will require at your Hands all that obstructed Service, and all afflictive Dammage oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by your Reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>ATTEMPT to Convict no Man of Punishable Crimes, where your <hi>Proof</hi> is not <hi>full</hi> and <hi>evident;</hi> for thereby you'll discover your own Folly, and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness, baffle your great Design, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your Neighbour to Suspicion, and your selves to Danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:43121:34"/>
BEGIN not with Severest Methods, where you hope milder will prevail; for it's not <hi>Cruelty,</hi> but <hi>Reformation</hi> is your Honest Aim; and the last is <hi>best</hi> attained, when the least of the first is needful.</p>
               <p>ADMIT nothing to <hi>excuse</hi> your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Care to restrain Sin, which will not bear your <hi>Dying</hi> Thought, in a view of God's <hi>Tribunal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET nothing <hi>below</hi> or <hi>besides</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, be your Design, and yet be not satisfied with the meer Honesty of your <hi>Intention,</hi> but use the best and justest ways which a well informed Mind directs, as likeliest to reach that End.</p>
               <p>TRUST not in your <hi>own Heart,</hi> nor reckon Success to be at <hi>your</hi> own Beck, but depend on, and <hi>Pray</hi> much to God for his Conduct, Defence, and Blessing.</p>
               <p>LIMIT not your Resolution to persist in this Blessed Attempt by the <hi>continued Assistance of others;</hi> for many now Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, may cool in time, but your <hi>Obligation</hi> will not cease by their <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:43121:35"/>
REPENT not of beginning this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if you should meet with <hi>less Success,</hi> and <hi>more Trouble</hi> than you at first expected: For it was not well <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,</hi> if you did not count your Costs; and your Undertaking may be well managed <hi>on your part,</hi> tho great Success be wanting. But however, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected</hi> Trouble will not lessen Duty, nor Disappointment as to expected Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, hinder <hi>your Reward;</hi> nor will <hi>other</hi> Men's Faultiness be charged on you.</p>
               <p>ALLOW not your Spirits to grow <hi>Luke-warm</hi> and <hi>remiss</hi> in this Work; when you have for some time applied your selves to it, and attained some <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi> thereby. There is need of this <hi>Caution,</hi> on these several Accounts. Your Endeavours will be faint, proportionably to the Remissness of your <hi>Spirit:</hi> Time is apt to allay that Fervour, which in the <hi>beginning</hi> of an Enterprize is more common and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; the need of Reforming Methods will <hi>continue,</hi> tho you should find some Reformation as to open Impieties, for many Defilements will <hi>abide</hi> unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43121:35"/>
                  <hi>Corrupt Nature</hi> will soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it self, when Restraint diminishes, and the <hi>more</hi> violently, because a while kept in.</p>
               <p>SET no bounds to the Reformation you propose, <hi>short</hi> of what the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land do countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHATEVER</hi> Evils they remark, do not you connive at, tho they appear not <hi>so gross</hi> as those you at first encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It's Wisdom in a very Degenerate Nation, <hi>to begin</hi> with the <hi>greatest</hi> Crimes:â€”But it will be Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when these are somewhat amended, to overlook <hi>the Lesser;</hi> for they are <hi>Evils,</hi> and will, if indulged, dispose Men to return to such as are more <hi>Atrc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WISELY <hi>prevent</hi> all Divisions, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and Sinister Dealings in your <hi>own Societies.</hi> Should you be uneasie to each other, your <hi>Strength</hi> is broken, and the least injustice will sully your <hi>Reputation,</hi> which is so absolutely necessary to your Usefulness. The Reason why I caution you against <hi>Divisions,</hi> is this: It too often happens, that forwardness in such Attempts proceeds from a <hi>Natural Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43121:36"/>
as well as a <hi>pure</hi> Heavenly Zeal; and as far as this <hi>Natural Fire</hi> is active, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Insolence, and Indiscretion, are <hi>hardly</hi> with the greatest Care prevented, and what tendency the discovery of these have to Quarrels and Disgusts, is too obvious to insist on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HAPPILY</hi> would this Work be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, if a Divine Zeal in <hi>Sedate</hi> Tempers <hi>directs</hi> it, and every one shall <hi>bear</hi> as much with each other's Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as he would in a <hi>Profitable</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of his <hi>own.</hi> As to that part of the Caution which relates to <hi>Sinister Dealings,</hi> I have no ground to suggest it, but that the Holiest Society here, may have a <hi>Judas,</hi> and whilst our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not wholly healed, we should be warned against <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, TAKE heed that your <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Degenerate not,</hi> nor be made to serve lower, or other Purposes, than this of the <hi>Reformation of Manners. Earthly</hi> Minds may <hi>debase</hi> their use, and <hi>Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Men endeavour to <hi>pervert</hi> them. They now are <hi>duly</hi> managed to Ends for which they deserve this <hi>Glorious Name:</hi> Oh let that Name <hi>ever</hi> govern
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43121:36"/>
all your Discourses, Designs, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. He too little knows Mankind, and the History of former Times, that thinks this very Caution need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
               <p>THE Lord impress these <hi>Warnings</hi> which Faithfulness to Christ, and a great Esteem of your Undertaking, compelled me to deliver.</p>
               <p>I shall <hi>conclude</hi> the whole by calling you <hi>to Lament</hi> with me; that the City and Nation so <hi>hate</hi> to be Reformed, that they who seriously attempt it, must bear the <hi>Scoffs</hi> of <hi>most;</hi> and to be an <hi>Informer</hi> against the obstinately Vicious, is with them a reproachful <hi>Title,</hi> tho God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords it for a <hi>Commendation</hi> to Men of highest rank, <hi>v.</hi> 9 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LET's Bewail;</hi> That after all God's <hi>long</hi> use of all Reforming Methods, we should still have so <hi>much need</hi> to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. That <hi>Text,</hi> Ezek. 22. 24. is applicable to us; <hi>Say unto her, Thou art the Land that is not cleansed.</hi> And when we consider that the Pestilence, the Burning this City, the Sword, loss of Trade, growing Poverty, and above all, the Gospel Means of Grace have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43121:37"/>
been all so <hi>notoriously</hi> uneffectual to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim us, have we not great cause to pray that God pass not that <hi>Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us,</hi> which you find uttered by this same Prophet? Cap. 24. 13. <hi>In thy Filthiness is Lewdness, because I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thee, and thou wast not purged; thou shalt not be purged from thy Filthiness any more, till I have caused my Fury to rest upon thee.</hi>
