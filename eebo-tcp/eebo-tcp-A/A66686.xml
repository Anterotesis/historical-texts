            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ear Country men, when ſome of you ſee my name ſubſcribed to this enſuing Diſcourſe, you may wonder at it, and it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe me in your heart, as <hi>Davids</hi> Brethren deſpiſed him, and told him it was the pride of his heart to come into the Battell, &amp;c. but know, that <hi>Gods</hi> works are not like mens, he doth not alwaies take the wiſe, the learned, the rich of the world to manifeſt himſelf in, and through them to others, but he chuſeth the deſpiſed, the unlearned, the poor, the nothings of the world, and fills them with the good things of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when as he ſends the empty away. I have writ nothing but what was given me of my Father; and at the firſt beholding of this Myſtery, it appeared to be ſo high above my reach, that I was confounded and loſt in my ſpirit; but God, (whom I believe, is my teacher, for I have joy and reſt in him) left me not
<pb facs="tcp:34600:3"/>
in bondage, but ſet me at liberty, and cauſed me to ſee much glory in theſe following truths; and when God works none can hinder. It may be ſome things herein may ſeeme very ſtrange at the firſt reading and you may crie out, an error; an error; for this is uſuall, when the fleſh cannot apprehend and be are a truth of <hi>God,</hi> it brands it for an error, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it as a wicked thing; as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe they could not behold God in Chriſt, did breake out in bitterneſſe of ſpirit againſt Chriſt, calling him a deceiver, and that he preached blaſphemy, and error, &amp; never reſted till they had killed him; &amp; our Lord Chriſt told his diſciples, that he had many things to ſpeak to them, but they were not able to bear them as yet. And this I ſpeak in experience, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truths of God, wherein I now ſee beauty, my heart at the firſt hearing roſe againſt them, and could not beare them; and therefore, if what I have writ meet with ſuch hard entertainment in any of your hearts, it is no wonder, for I know that the fleſh that is in you, luſts after envy, but it is part of your bondage which God will deliver you from in due time: You ſhall finde that I call the whole power of darkneſſe by the name Serpent, which dwells in, and hath taken every man and woman captive, and that God through his Sonne Chriſt will redeeme his own workmanſhip, mankinde, from it, and deſtroy the Serpent onely; but do not count this a ſlight thing; for when God lets you ſee into the Myſtery of this iniquity, in the leaſt degree of it, it will prove too hard for you, and you will be nothing but death,
<pb facs="tcp:34600:3"/>
curſe, and miſery. Therefore, as you deſire that God would manifeſt love to you, and make you free, be not offended to hear, that God, who is love it ſelf, hath a ſeaſon to manifeſt his love to others that are loſt, and quicken them that were killed, while you were made alive, and that fell further under death, when you that were loſt are redeemed an houre or two before them. Ieſus Chriſt ſhed his bloud wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for them that did put him to death; and the Saints of God rejoyced, that <hi>Paul</hi> their bitter perſecutor, was received to mercy with themſelves: Why then ſhould you be offended, and thinke you are miſerable, if your perſecutors and enemies ſhould in Gods time be delivered from under the curſe, and partake of the glory of the City, together with you. It is much for the glory of God for him to redeeme, not part onely, but all mankinde from death, which his own hands made, it is his revealed will ſo to do, therefore let it be your joy that the will of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, and ſhall be fulfilled; and do not thinke the Saints are made unhappy, and God diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, if he heale them that were loſt, and that did not enter into the City, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the great day of judgment, for as he is honored in ſaving you of the Citie that were loſt: ſo he will be honored in redeeming theſe that lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the ſecond death. and that entred not into the City, ſeeing there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them, till the will of God made the difference, in taking you at the firſt and leaving them till the laſt houre; for Chriſt gave himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:34600:4"/>
a ranſome for all, to be revealed in due time. God doth not reveale his love to all at one time but when he will; and God hath ſome thing to do after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, as he hath, and will yet do much before that day. Well, I leave, not queſtioning, but if any of you be unſatisfied with what I have writ, that you will ſpeak to me, and <hi>I</hi> hope God will be my wiſdom and ſtrength to confirme it; ſince <hi>I</hi> had writ it, <hi>I</hi> met with more Scriptures to confirme it, ſo that it is not a ſpirit of private fancie, but it is agreeable to the written Word.

            <p>What the Serpent is, that cauſed <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and whence he ſprang.</p>
            <p>The Serpent is not Gods Creature.</p>
            <p>What the bondage of death is, that <hi>Adam</hi> or all mankind lies under.</p>
            <p>What the good, and what the bad Angels are.</p>
            <p>God hath caſt the twofold murderer out of heaven, and what that is.</p>
            <p>God will ſubdue the Serpent, not under part, but under the whole Creation, Mankinde.</p>
            <p>When all creatures, except Man, are to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into nothing.</p>
            <p>Seven Diſpenſations which God will have Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to paſſe through before he ſubdue the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent under the feet thereof, and what they are.</p>
            <p>The Citie Sion, or the Elect, are in gathering up to God in ſix of thoſe diſpenſations, in every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of time; and in the ſeventh the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, and not till then.</p>
            <p>The Citie Sion, or the Elect, ſhall firſt be taken up to God, afterwards they that were caſt into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, while the Elect were in gathering, ſhall be redeemed, and partake of the glory of the Citie.</p>
            <p>What is meant by everlaſting fire, and the word, <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> ſo often uſed in Scripture.</p>
            <p>God is honoured in the ſalvation of Beleevers, and in the loſſe and ſhame of unbeleevers.</p>

Gods judging the ſerpent, is mankinds redemption What the day of Judgement is.</p>
            <p>Though loſt man drink the top, yet the Serpent ſhall drink the dregs of Gods judgment, before the Son can deliver up the Kingdom to the Father.</p>
            <p>What the firſt and ſecond death is, or the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and ſecond death.</p>
            <p>What the Bookes are that muſt be opened at the great day of judgement.</p>
            <p>God hath been judging the Serpent ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and will ſtill ſit upon the Throne till the laſt day be finiſhed, &amp; yet all but one day of judgment</p>
            <p>God hates none but the Serpent and his ſeed; hee loves every branch of mankinde, and in his owne ſeaſons wil manifeſt his love to every one, though to ſome at the ninth, ſome at the tenth, and ſome at the laſt houre.</p>
            <p>God hath given a time, times, and halfe time to the Serpent now in the latter dayes to reigne in theſe.</p>
            <p>How the Serpent under the names of Beaſt, Whore and falſe Prophet, makes uſe of that time God hath given him.</p>
            <p>The bitterneſſe that is in mens ſpirits in theſe dayes, is the ſmoak of the Serpents torment, the reſtleſneſſe of that wicked one day and night, and beginning of his ſorrowes.</p>

            <p>Now as the pureſt water being let ſtand, does in time putrifie, ſo I ſay, God knew that the firſt fruit that this created Being would bring forth, would be an aſpiring deſire to be equall, or like <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2. 17.</note> to God himſelfe, which if the creature delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and ſo ate, or ſatisfied himſelfe in his own fruit, he ſhould die; but if he forſook his own invention, and ſtuck cloſe to God, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34600:6"/>
his Being to be his life, and all in all, then he ſhould live.</p>
            <p>Therefore God made it under a law, that the creature might know himſelfe to be a creature, and acknowledge God his maker to be above, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5.</note> to whoſe command he was to ſubject himſelfe; for when God had made him a pure living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, very good, and a being diſtinct from the being of God, yet in the image of God, like two trees from whence fruit ſhould grow, for <hi>Adam</hi> would bring forth fruit to maintain his created being equall with God; and God would bring forth fruit to maintain his uncreated being, and to ſwallow up all other beings into himſelf, and he to become all in all to every Creature that <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.</note> he made.</p>
            <p>Now ſaith God, I have made thee the Lord of all my Creatures, and for thy uſe I made them; and thou mayeſt make uſe of any that pleaſes thine eyes, and eat of the fruit of any tree that delights thy taſte, excepting the tree of knowledge of good and evill that ſtands in the middle of the Garden, and of that thou ſhalt not eat; for in that day that thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou ſhall die the death. And this is the Law or Covenant that I have made between me, that am a Being of my ſelfe; and thee, that art a Being created by me.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Adam</hi> had taken of the tree of knowledge of good and evill, that was in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Hiſtory, and did eat of it:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34600:7"/>
It declares, that he did eat likewiſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the forbidden fruit that aſpired up in himſelf the living Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> the myſtery, and gave way with content and delight to that aſpiring ſelfiſhneſſe within himſelfe, to be as <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 4. 34.</note> God, knowing good and evill; for eating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies delight and ſatisfaction: for <hi>Adam</hi> did not onely eat of the tree in <hi>Edens</hi> Garden, but he had a ſecret tickling delight ariſing in him, to be a more knowing man then God made him, and thereby began to reject God; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with the Being God made him in, which if hee had been content with, he had acknowledged God all in all, and the onely infinite and one Being, that ſhall ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
            <p>But he eats, delights in that aſpiring Weed, (or Myſtery of Iniquity) for himſelfe to have a Being above, equall to, or diſtinct from God: So that the ground of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes up firſt in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, as fruit growing up from a created Being; for in that it was in <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 18.</note> his heart to doe evill, God imputes it to him for evill.</p>
            <p>Well, this ſelfiſhneſſe in the midle of the living garden, <hi>Adam,</hi> is the forbidden fruit, and this is called the Serpent, becauſe it windes it ſelfe into every creature, and into every created faculty, and twiſts it ſelf round about the Tree, Mankind.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Adam</hi> put forth his hand to take,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34600:7"/>
and eat of the fruit of the Tree, in the Hiſtory, his hand was guided thereunto by this Serpent, whoſe ſecret whiſperings he delighted in: And truly this delight in ſelfe, was the eating, and it was the chiefe forbidden fruit that grew up in the middle of the living garden, <hi>Adam,</hi> which God forbad him to eat of, or delight in: But <hi>Adam</hi> did begin to delight in that inward fruit of wickedneſſe; and then by the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, took the fruit of the Tree in the middle of <hi>Eden,</hi> and delighted his outward ſenſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and ſo brake the Law and Covenant of God, fell from his purity, and died, according to the word of his Maker, <hi>That in the day thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7</note> 
               <hi>eateſt, thou ſhalt dye.</hi> And all the faculties and powers of that living created Being, <hi>Adam,</hi> are now become abſolute rebellions, and enmity it ſelfe againſt the Being of Godl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>And that garden of pleaſant plants, <hi>Adam,</hi> is become a ſtinking dunghill of weeds, and brings forth nothing but pride, envy, diſcontent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.</note>, and the whole actings of the ſpirit, and power of darknes.</p>
            <p>And if the creature ſhould bee honoured in this condition, then God would be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe his command is broke, and yet the creature remains glorious, therefore he died.</p>
            <p>And if ſo be the creature be utterly loſt and periſh, and this garden ſhould never be ſo dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to bring forth fruit to Gods delight, then likewiſe God would ſuffer diſhonour, becauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34600:8"/>
his work is ſpoyled in his hand, and there is no hopes of recovery. But the work of God ſhall be reſtored from this loſt, dead, weedy, &amp; enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved condition, and the fruit of the created Being ſhall utterly periſh and be aſhamed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>And things being thus conſidered, God is pleaſed to lead us to ſee a little into theſe two <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13.</note> myſteries: Firſt, the myſtery of Iniquity, or work of the Serpent, which was the aſpiring <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 5.</note> fruit of pride, and ſelfe-love, that ſprung up in the created Being, to be as God, and ſo to be an abſolute Being of himſelf, as God is an abſolute <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</note> Being of himſelfe; and ſo this ſelfe-honouring would ſit in Gods Temple, that is, the humane <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 25.</note> Nature, which God made a Garden for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to walk in; and if that Spirit of Self-love <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13.</note> could not be deſtroyed, and the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture recovered from that bondage, God would ſuffer much diſhonour; becauſe he being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and happy in himſelfe, hath made a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be a vexation and ſcourge to him, and cannot ſubdue it. And this myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or power of darkneſſe, hath, does, and will fight againſt the Being of God, till it be taken out of the way, and quite ſubdued; as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath promiſed he will ſubdue it under the feet of his Sonne, the Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, God leads us to the myſtery of himſelfe, and makes us able to ſee into the knowledge of that great work that hee is in working: and that is, to deſtroy this Serpent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34600:8"/>
out of the fleſh, and all Beings, that is enmity againſt him, and to ſwallow up his Creature <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. 54.</note> 
               <hi>Man</hi> into himſelfe, that ſo there may bee but one onely pure, endleſſe, and infinite Being, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God himſelfe all in all, dwelling and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this garden, <hi>Mankinde,</hi> in which he will plant pleaſant fruit trees, and pluck up all weeds. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>Adam</hi> fell, to this preſent day, wee ſee the wiſdome, power, and affection that dwels and rules in Man, leads him any way, either to juſt or unjuſt actions, ſo that Selfe may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, not caring whether God be honoured, yea, or no.</p>
            <p>Now the myſtery of God is this, hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> and ſubdue this power of darkneſſe, under the feet of the whole Creation, <hi>Mankinde,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18.</note> every particular branch, <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from this bondage and priſon, and dwel <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6</note> in his own Houſe and Garden himſelfe; ſo that the wiſdome, power, love, life, beauty, and Spirit of truth that dwels and rules in <hi>Man,</hi> may be <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, <hi>even the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> and no other being or power, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And as God did dwell bodily in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, Jeſus Chriſt, who was the firſt manifeſtation of this great myſtery of God, ſo <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23.</note> when his work is compleated, he will dwell in the whole Creation, that is, every man and woman without exception, as he did dwell in that one branch, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the pledge, or firſt fruits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34600:9"/>
And therefore you ſhall finde, that when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had broke the Covenant, and died by the Law, God did not denounce an utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without recovery to the Creation, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which was his own work, which his own wiſdome and power did produce and bring forth. But he pronounces the finall curſe againſt the Serpent, or mans work, which was the fruit that ſprung up in, and was acted both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15</note> and outwardly by the Creation, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Being, in rebellion againſt the Being of God: Therefore ſinne is properly mans owne act.</p>
            <p>The words of the Father run thus, ſpeaking to the Serpent: <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed, it ſtall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele:</hi> So that the Serpent muſt be killed; for bruiſe his head, and he dies. Now the curſe that was declared to <hi>Adam,</hi> was temporary: That he ſhould undergoe ſorrows, and ſuffer a bruiſing in his out-member; but not a killing, though <hi>Adam</hi> had killed himſelfe: ſo that he hath brought himſelfe under the bondage; God will not ſtrike him now he is downe, and make his death without recovery, but God will deſtroy death, and quicken <hi>Adam,</hi> or Mankinde againe, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</note> that we may all ſee our ſalvation is from God, though our miſery was from our ſelves, that ſo whoſoever glories, may glory onely in the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:34600:9"/>
And now by the way mind one thing, That when this Serpent rules, and cauſes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to act, ſuch actings become the creatures loſſe &amp; ſhame; but when God acts in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures life, glory, and redemption; to advance <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23.</note> ſelfe, and deny God, is the creatures death. But to deny ſelf, and to acknowledge God, is the creatures life; before <hi>Adam</hi> acted Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this aſpiring ſpirit of pride, to be as God, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</note> led the humane nature, to diſobey God; And ever ſince the fall, the ſame ſelfiſh ſpirit, leads every man and woman captive at his will, and inſlaves them in that priſon, and bondage, and darkneſs, to walk in wayes directly contrary to the God of light: and yet many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them, that they do God good ſervice; let a man read, hear, ſtudy, preach, pray, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form actions of Juſtice; yet if God be not mercifull to the man, this power of darkneſs will deceive him; making him to conceit or think he pleaſes God, when the truth is, he ſerves but ſelfe all the time, it is ſo full of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſtrong deluſions.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, the myſtery of God is this, God will bruiſe this Serpents head, and caſt that murderer out of heaven, the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein it dwels in part, as in the man Chriſt Jeſus: And he will dwell in the whole creation in time, and ſo deliver whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind out of that bondage.</p>
            <p>This I ſee to be a truth, both in my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34600:10"/>
and by teſtimony of ſcripture, as God is pleaſed to teach me.</p>
            <p>As firſt, by experience, I ſhall inſtance in my ſelf, who am a branch of <hi>Adam;</hi> or part of the humane creation: And I lay under the bondage of the Serpent, my own invention, as the whole creation does from <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and I ſaw not any bondage; but ſince God was pleaſed to manifeſt his love to me, he hath cauſed me to ſee that I lay dead in ſin, weltring in blood and death, was a priſoner to my luſts, for though through his grace, I ſaw pride, covetouſneſs, envy, uncleanneſs, ignorance, injuſtice, and the whole body of unbelief, working and ruling in me; yet I was aſhamed men ſhould know it, this ſelfiſh ſpirit ſought to hide himſelf ſo cloſe; and ſtill made proviſion to have the will of theſe luſts ſatisfied in me.</p>
            <p>And before God manifeſted his love to me, I delighted in the favour of theſe weeds, but ſince God revealed his Son in me, he lets mee ſee, that thoſe things wherein I did take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, were my death, my ſhame, and the very power of darkneſs, wherein I was held, as in a priſon; ſo that although I felt this deadly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or wicked one act within me, and although I have been troubled at it, ſighed and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrove againſt it, and prayed againſt it; yet I could not deny ſelf, and the more I uſed meanes to beat him down, as I thought, the more did this power of darkneſs appear in me,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34600:10"/>
like an overflowing wave of wickedneſs, drowning me in ſlavery, and I ſaw I was a wretched man, wrapped in miſery, I mourned that I was ſo rebellious againſt God, and I mourned to ſee I had no power to get out of that bondage of ſelfiſhneſs. And ſo I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till God was pleaſed to pul me out of ſelfiſh ſtriving &amp; ſelfiſh actings, &amp; made all meanes lie dead before me, and made me dead to ſuch means as I made uſe of, and thought that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance muſt come that way: And ſo made me to lie down at his feete, &amp; to waite upon him, &amp; to acknowledg, that unleſs God did ſwallow me up into his own being, I ſhould never be delivered, for I ſaw that the power within me ſtrived to maintain its being, againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God; and all that while I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to God, though among men, I was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, as I thought, of God.</p>
            <p>But now God hath ſet me free from that bondage, ſo that it rules not, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it ſeemes to face me, like a daring cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered enemy, that cannot hurt. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God cauſes me to ſee with much joy and peace of heart, into this myſtery of himſelf, that his eternall councel, which was grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law of love, himſelf, was not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me, nor any of his own creation; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Serpent, which is my work, or the firſt fruit that ſprung up out of the creation; which is our bondage, and that he himſelf will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34600:11"/>
my ſelf, and liberty, and the life and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his whole creation. And in theſe two things he hath cauſed me greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſee and feele, that God hath ſet me free from the dominion and over-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that body of ſin. It raines not as a King, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.</note> though ſometimes it appeares creeping in like a ſlave, that is eaſily whipped out of doores by ſtrength of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I rejoyce in perfect hope and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in God, that although this Serpent, or murtherer do begin, by reaſon of any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or outward troubles, to ariſe, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to act in raſh anger, in pride, in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or the like, as ſometimes it does, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appearance of this wicked one in me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his further ruine, and ſhall never riſe to rule and enſlave me as formerly; for God thereby takes the occaſion to call me up high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into himſelf, and ſo makes me to ſee and poſſeſs freedom, in my own experience from him, every day more and more; I am not ſtill a captive, in a being of darkneſs diſtinct from God, but God hath freed me therefrom, and taken me up into his own being; ſo that now his wiſdom, his love, his life, his power, his joy and peace, is mine, I glory here, I can glory no where elſe. And here I wait upon God with a ſweet peace, under reproaches, under loſſes, under troubles of the world, being that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34600:11"/>
of his patience which God will have me wait upon him under, till I partake of the full enjoyment of this inheritance, which I have fully, in hope and aſſurance, but in poſſeſſion, but in part.</p>
            <p>And as God is pleaſed thus to deal with me, or with any branch of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſame kind; ſo he hath cauſed me to ſee, and to rejoyce in the ſight, that he will not loſe any of his work, but he will redeem his own whole Creation, to himſelf, and dwell, and rule in it himſelf, and <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13.</note> ſubdue the Serpent under his feet, and take up all his Creation, Mankind, into himſelf, and will become, the only, endleſs, pure, abſolute, and infinite being, even infinitely for ever all in all, in every one, and in the whole, that no fleſh may glory in it ſelf, but in the Lord only.</p>
            <p>But this myſtery of God is not to be done all at once, but in ſeverall diſpenſations, ſome whereof are paſt, ſome are in being, and ſome are yet to come; but when the myſtery of God is abſolutely finiſhed, or, as the Scriptures ſay, The Son hath delivered up the Kingdom to the Father, this will be the upſhot or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 24.</note> that Gods work ſhall be redeemed, and live in God, and God in it; but the creatures <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 15.</note> work without God, ſhall be loſt and periſh, Man, <hi>Adam,</hi> or whole Creation of Mankind, which is Gods work, ſhall be delivered from Corruption, Bondage, Death, and Pain, and the Serpent that cauſed the fall, ſhall only periſh,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34600:12"/>
and be caſt into the lake; and God will be the ſame in the latter end, accompliſhing what in the beginning he promiſed, that is, to bruiſe the Serpents head, and ſubdue him under the feet of his Son, the humane nature, wherein he will walk, as a Garden of pleaſure, and dwell himſelf for ever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in the next place mention ſome Scriptures as a Teſtimony that does counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this truth, that God will not loſe any part of his Creation, Mankind, but will redeem and preſerve it, both in particular, &amp; in whole, and will deſtroy nothing but the Serpent, that wicked one, that would be a being equall to, or above God; but Gods work ſhall ſtand, and the creatures work ſhall periſh and ſuffer loſſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture I ſhall mention, is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Every mans Work ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by fire: and the fire ſhall try every mans work, of what ſort it is.</hi> That is, whether it be of God, or of the Serpent. If any mans work abide, he ſhall receive a reward, that is, he ſhall live in God, and God in him, becauſe God in the man, was the ſtrength of his work, If any mans work ſhall be burned, he ſhall ſuffer loſſe, but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, (mark this) yet ſo, as by fire; not by materiall fire of purgatory, but by the bright, and clear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34600:12"/>
coming of God into this man, whoſe indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling preſence, like fire, burnes up the ſtubble of mens own inventions, and purges the droſſe from the gold, &amp; divides between the marrow <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8.</note> and the bone, that is, makes a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his own work and mans work.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>And the Devill, or murderer, that deceived the Nations, was eaſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone,</hi> and v. 14. <hi>And death and hel were caſt into the lake of fire:</hi> the Nations were not caſt in at this time, for this Scripture I believe points out the great day of Judgment, when Nations ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of that fire, and there ſhall be no more curſe, death, ſorrow, nor pain lie upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Creation, but all teares ſhall be wiped from its eyes, and the Serpent only ſhall periſh in the Lake; for after that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-work is finiſhed, and the number of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect gathered in, and eſtabliſhed in glory; then the diſpenſations of God, who is the tree of <note place="margin">

River of the water of life, cleer as Criſtall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb, that is, from the judgment ſeat of God, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, condemning, and killing the Serpent, and ſo reſtoring his own creation to purity and life.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>For we in this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle do groane, being burdened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon: that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> By mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, is not meant the laying of the body in, or raiſing of it out of the duſt or grave, but it is the very death which <hi>Adam,</hi> by diſobeying, fell under, and that is the death of his purity, or pure being, which is a falling from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a being directly oppoſite to the being of God; as rottonneſs of fleſh, is death to ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fleſh, darkneſs is the death to light; for whereas before the fall, <hi>Adam</hi> knew God, loved and acknowledged God, and was in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part ſo pure, as God ſaid, Behold, it is all very good, but after the fall he became envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, proud, diſobedient, full of all luſts and concupiſcence of evill, even as we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience our bondage; and ſo from a friend, he fell to be enmity againſt God, of a pure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he became unclean, and of a Child of Gods delight, he fell to be a Child of wrath; and of a pure garden, he became a ſtinking <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2. 3.</note> dunghill; and this is the death or mortality, which not only <hi>Adam</hi> in particular, but all the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34600:13"/>
branches of <hi>Adam,</hi> men and women, lie under. Even under a corrupt Being.</p>
            <p>Now this rottenneſſe, or death, under which the whole Creation is fallen, and lies in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage too, it is that Serpent, or power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which <hi>Paul</hi> deſires might be ſwallowed up of life; that is, that God, who is life, would be pleaſed to come and dwell in him, and in his creation, and ſo caſt out that mortality, or ſtrong man that is ſo ſtrongly armed: and this is the Serpent that God hath pronounced the dreadfull curſe againſt; for this is mans work, and it muſt bee deſtroyed. I conceive God calls it mans own invention, becauſe it was the firſt fruit that the creature brought forth; after he was made, and left to himſelfe, even this aſpired and ſprung up in him, to which he gave conſent to promote Selfe, and become as God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely mention one Scripture more, though I beleeve I could bring above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Scriptures that doe countenance this truth. And if you ſeriouſly minde what you read, you ſhall finde that this is the Royall blood that runs through the golden veines of the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles: It is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. to 26. but for ſhortneſſe ſake I ſhall mention onely the 21. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19.</note> and 22. verſes, <hi>Beeauſe the creation it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered</hi> (as well as we that are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the elected Citie) <hi>from the bondage of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34600:14"/>
corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God: For we know</hi> (by our experience) <hi>that the whole creation</hi> (of which we are branches) <hi>groaneth and travelleth in pain together untill now.</hi> By <hi>Creature,</hi> or <hi>whole Creation,</hi> I ſee it to be a cleare and ſoul-comforting truth, to be only mankinde, for whoſe uſe, or for the time that God hath determined to finiſh this great deſigne, to make his garden <hi>Man,</hi> a garden of pleaſure to himſelfe, when he hath plucked up all the weeds, and ſo husbanded the ground, that weeds ſhall never grow again. I ſay, all the time, God hath made all other creatures for mans uſe, or rather to ſerve his own provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, while he is in working this great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about man, and when the work is finiſhed, then all other creatures ſhall bee diſſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing as at firſt; for as God is a Spirit, he delights in ſpirituall things, but theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Some may ſay, If this be true, that God will ſave every one, then I will live, and take my pleaſure in ſin, and eat, drink, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take all delights while I live, for I am Gods workmanſhip, and he will not loſe his own work, I ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But if he will not loſe his work, yet thy work ſhall periſh, think upon that; and truly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the Serpent in thee, will make ſuch a merry concluſion, and cry down this truth of God for an errour preſently in others, becauſe it beares teſtimony of his deſtruction, as the Jewes called Chriſt a deceiver, or a man of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 7. 12.</note>, and killed him, becauſe he bore witneſſe that their deeds were evill.</p>
            <p>Well, make that concluſion and take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſin, yet for all that know, thou enſlaved creature, that thou ſhalt be brought to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou ſhalt not eſcape puniſhment; for though ſinne be ſweet in thy mouth, as it was in <hi>Judas,</hi> to take the 30 pieces of ſilver, and to act treachery againſt his Maſter, it wil be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe in the belly, as it was to him; for the jealouſie of the Lord ſhall burn hot againſt thee, ſo that thou ſhalt cal upon the mountains <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 15, 16.</note> to cover thee from his preſence, and wiſh that thou hadſt never been born; and all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34600:15"/>
ſpoke of in Scripture, ſhall overtake thee, and ſuch preſumptuous ſinners as thou art; and thy joy ſhall be turned into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thou ſhalt be caſt into the everlaſting fire, which God hath prepared and appointed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 42.</note> for the Serpent and his ſeed, or for the Devil and his Angels: and while thou art in it, the worm of thy gnawing conſcience ſhall never die, nor the fire of Gods wrath, or the ſenſe of his anger upon thee, ſhall never goe out, and ſhall be a pain more intollerable, then the plucking out of the right eye, or the cutting off the right hand.</p>
            <p>But now leſt ſcruples ſhould ariſe in others, as though I writ contradictions, or as though I made God changeable. Firſt, to bid a ſinner depart into everlaſting fire, and yet afterwards take him out again. Now to give anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Firſt know, that this was and is the great myſtery, worke, and counſell of God, after he had made a viſible creature, in a pure Being, diſtinct from himſelfe, his purpoſe being to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the inventions and actings of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that did ſpring up and ariſe from the creatures Being, as a creature, and not from Gods acting in the creature: and God foreſaw that the firſt buddings of this creature would be a deſire to maintain it Selfe, or Creature-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo caſt God off; therefore God made him under a Law, that if his creature did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34600:15"/>
to that ſelfiſh deſire, he ſhould die; if not, he ſhould have lived a pure Being ſtill, though diſtinct from God, yet under his protection, as a Creator. Now every thing that is in, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Creature, that is of God, ſhall ſtand; but every thing that is in, or from the creature, that is not of God, ſhall fall and periſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore to proceed a little further, that this truth may ſhine in its own beauty, God does teach me to ſee, that every action, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God, is called a Spirit, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and every action, or aſpiring principle that riſe up in <hi>Adam,</hi> which led him to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it pleaſed God that it ſhould have a Being, and likewiſe be called a Spirit, but it is a dead Being, and a Spirit of darkneſſe, quite oppoſite to the God of Light and Life, and God gives it the name of Serpent, Dragon, Murtherer, wicked one, and unclean Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it twiſted it ſelfe into the middle of the Creation, and was an aſpiring to be like God, but God did not make the nature of it; for it was the firſt fruits of a created Being, without God.</p>
            <p>Now God is pleaſed to make known himſelf in divers diſpenſations in the carrying on of this great work of his.</p>
            <p>As firſt, he declares himſelfe by way of a Law, <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die;</hi> now <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</note> this Law, though it was holy, juſt, and good, yet it was a killing word, or the killing Letter,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34600:16"/>
for it took hold of <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience, and flew him; ſo that word, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye,</hi> becauſe fleſh, for all fleſh broke the Covenant in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and all fleſh died, and all humane fleſh was caſt under that diſpenſation of death, and the more we ſtirre to climb up to God by the workes of the Law, the more we intangle our ſelves in death; for by the workes of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.</note> law no fleſh ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And here is two murtherers which mankind is to be delivered from, before it can live again; Firſt, this word of the Law, which is holy, juſt, and good, which ties the creature onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Being of God, and no other: when the creature began to minde another Being, this righteous Law killed him; for it is not the King, but the Kings Law that hangs an offender; and if the rigorous Law ſtands ſtill in force, no fleſh can be ſaved, becauſe every man and woman are ſelfiſh, and minds a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Being, oppoſite to God, therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of the Law is to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>The ſecond murtherer is the Creatures own invention, or aſpiring ſpirit to be as God, knowing good and evill, or to maintain Selfe, and this killed the creature, and threw him under the curſe of the righteous Law, becauſe this would be a Being equall with God, and acknowledge another being beſides God, whereas there is no other righteous Being to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34600:16"/>
be acknowledged, but onely God, or what is in God, or God in it.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt diſcovery of Gods counſell and purpoſe to the Creature, if he be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this compound murtherer muſt be caſt out of heaven by a ſtrong hand, and out-ſtretched arm of God, ſo that the Being of God might be preſerved, the Law of God kept pure, and yet fallen man redeemed. As firſt, this diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, <hi>Do this, and live; Do not this, and die,</hi> muſt be caſt out of Heaven, that is, out of Gods hand, and God muſt not, in the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, appeare to the creature under that diſpenſation: for if he doe, it will ſtill hold the loſt creature under death and bondage: and if the creature were made pure again, and left ſtill to deale with the Law by his created ſtrength onely, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, truly he would fall again; for a meere created ſtrength, being diſtinct from God the Creator, would fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for no Being can ſtand pure, but ſuch a created Being as God is pleaſed to dwell bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in; for every oppoſite Being will ſeek to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore if God redeem his creature from death, he muſt appeare abſolutely a God of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 25. 12.</note> love, under no other diſpenſation but the law of love, doing all in, and for the creature, and <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7.</note> thus in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> he does; for this is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that quickens and ſaves the creature: and <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</note> when this Word of Love was made Fleſh, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34600:17"/>
was the firſt diſcovery from God, to aſſure the creature of his redemption from death; and this was when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in fleſh,</hi> working, doing, ſuffering all things for the creature, pardoning, accepting, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the creature freely into communion with <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> own power, and for his own name ſake, promiſing never to remember diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences any more, but would blot out that hand-writing, the Law, of <hi>Doe and live,</hi> not <hi>doe and die.</hi> And now the killing letter, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is caſt out of heaven, out of <hi>Gods</hi> hand, <hi>God</hi> will never have that to ſtand between him and his creature any more; but hee himſelfe, who is the Law of <hi>Love,</hi> even <hi>Love</hi> it ſelfe, will dwell and rule a King of Righteouſneſſe in the Creature, and be the Creatures wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8. 15.</note> ſtrength, life, joy, and comfort, and his <hi>All in All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, the other murderer, which is worſe then this, muſt be caſt out of heaven too, or elſe the creature cannot live, and that is the Serpent, or this aſpiring ſpirit in him to promote Selfe: for ſo long as the creature <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 8, 9.</note> acknowledges any other being but <hi>Gods,</hi> he is loſt; and truly I think none can be ignorant of this, that the ſpirit of ſelfiſhneſſe is in himſelf, and in every man and woman, therfore it muſt be caſt out of this heaven, <hi>Mankinde,</hi> before it can live again to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Jeſus Chriſt, or <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Man</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 1. 14.</note>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34600:17"/>
then the word of Love was made fleſh, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> And when Jeſus Chriſt fought the great battell, or rather <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Serpent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7.</note> did fight in heaven, that is in the creation, the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> or the anoynting, prevailed, he caſt the Serpent out of heaven, out of that humane fleſh which he took up as a part for the whole, or as an earneſt of the Fathers love to all the reſt; for I beleeve that all temptations that Jeſus Chriſt met withall, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(for in all things he was tempted like unto us)</hi> they were but the ſtrivings of the Serpent, as he did ſtrive in <hi>Adam</hi> that fell, to maintain its being oppoſite to <hi>God;</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt, or the anoynting in fleſh, being not a created power, but the power of <hi>God</hi> in that created <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.</note> humanity, did not conſent as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did, for he with ſtrong hand reſiſted the whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Serpent, and would acknowledge no other Being but <hi>God,</hi> and ſo prevailed, and caſt the Serpent out of fleſh, and hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a legall power to quicken whom he will, or <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21</note> to caſt the Serpent out of what man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he will: ſo that it is this anoynting that ſets us at liberty from the bondage of ſin and the Serpent, and he himſelfe becomes our life and ſtrength, and <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Michael</hi> our Prince had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10.</note> over the Dragon, then there were voyces and Songs heard in heaven, that is, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34600:18"/>
               <hi>Mankind; Now is come ſalvation and ſtrength, and the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is caſt down, which accuſed them before God day and night.</hi> This ſong, I conceive, was ſung by the Elect, the Citie Sion, or Saints of <hi>God,</hi> who are firſt enlightned, and they ſing <hi>Glory to God</hi> in the name of the reſt that ſhall be redeemed; for the Serpent that accuſed the Creation before <hi>God,</hi> is caſt out in part for the whole, or a part for an earneſt peny to the whole.</p>
            <p>So that now mark, The Law of <hi>God</hi> that did accuſe and condemne the offending crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is caſt out of <hi>Gods</hi> hand, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he will be a <hi>God of love,</hi> in an intire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of love; I ſpeak as <hi>God</hi> doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf now under the Goſpel and as he ever will be when the creature is perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
            <p>And the Serpent, which is the Sting, or Worme to the Creatures conſcience, becauſe it was ſtill acting a ſelf-being, oppoſite to <hi>God,</hi> and then accuſing the creature before <hi>God day and night,</hi> by the force of a condemning Law, for diſobediences, which is the creatures bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and miſery; for the ſpirit of ſin within, this enſlaves him, and the condemning Law, this caſts him from <hi>God,</hi> and ſo throwes the ſinner under utter darkneſſe and ſorrow. I, but for the creatures comfort, this Serpent is caſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34600:18"/>
out of heaven, the Creation likewiſe, and though for the preſent many poore creatures lie under the bondage, yet the time is drawing neer that they ſhal be delivered, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one himſelfe, the Serpent, ſhall be caſt into the Lake, and periſh for ever. Indeed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent would have Gods created work to die with him, for he knowes he muſt dye irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably, but <hi>God</hi> will redeem his creature, and the Serpents head only ſhall be bruiſed, which will be his death.</p>
            <p>Well, this two-fold murderer is caſt out of Heaven, that is, the condemning Law is caſt out of <hi>Gods</hi> hand by Jeſus Chriſt, the Law of grace and love; and the Serpent is caſt out of the creation in part, and ſhall be caſt out of the whole when the <hi>Myſtery of God</hi> is finiſhed by the power of the ſame anointng, Jeſus Chriſt; for <hi>God</hi> the Father is reconciled, and he hath taken the creature into fellowſhip with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: <hi>For God was in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conciling</hi>

               <hi>the world,</hi> that is, mankind, <hi>to himſelf, not imputing their ſins to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Myſtery, or work of <hi>God</hi> is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fully and compleatly in a two-fold ſenſe, but not in a third, as yet; and when this third term is finiſhed, then the whole work is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not till then.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in <hi>Gods</hi> everlaſting counſell and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, this worke was done from all eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world was laid, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34600:19"/>
               <hi>God</hi> declared ſo much, when he uttered this word, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; between thy ſeed &amp; her ſeed, he ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> Here the Curſe and Death is ſealed up to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but here is Mercy and Redemption ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the creature; the creature ſhall bee redeemed, but he ſhall goe through bruiſings, or pain:</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is compleatly done in action, in the pledge and earneſt-penny. When <hi>God</hi> was manifeſted in fleſh, in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who was born of a woman. And this is the firſt fruit of the Fathers love manifeſted and ſealed up to the whole Creation, Mankinde, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 15.</note> that as he dwels bodily in that part of humane nature, Jeſus Chriſt, ſo in time, according to his own counſell and pleaſure, hee will dwell bodily in the whole creation likewiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I goe to my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to my God and your God;</hi> and he doth not onely ſpeak to his twelve Diſciples, but to all others that ſhall beleeve through their word. And when the Kings of the Earth, and the Nations are healed by the leaves of the Tree <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24.</note> there will not be a man that partakes of humane nature, nor woman neither, that ſhall not partake of faith &amp; ſo beleeve in <hi>God through Chriſt</hi> the anointing, that fils all, and is <hi>all in all.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34600:19"/>
But now in the third ſenſe, the worke is not yet compleated in the whole Creation; for <hi>God</hi> is pleaſed to doe this worke in length of time, by degrees, calling ſome at one houre, and ſome at another, out of the Serpents bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <note place="margin">

            <p>Therefore in the further clearing of this Truth, <hi>God</hi> is pleaſed to ſhew forth ſix diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations or diſcoveries of himſelfe more, which he will have the creature to paſſe through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he finiſh his work, to caſt the Serpent, Death, and Hell, into the Lake, and before he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14.</note> himſelfe appeare to be the Tree of Life on each ſide, and in the middle of the pure River of the water of Life: which I conceive is the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1.</note> whole creation, <hi>Man,</hi> perfectly redeemed; which River proceeded out of the Throne of <hi>God,</hi> and of the Lamb; take notice of that.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Diſpenſation, for there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Diſpenſations in the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt I have ſpoken of already, which was, when <hi>God</hi> gave the Law to <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſoon as hee had made him: And now the ſecond lies in that firſt promiſe, or manifeſtation of love to the Creature, and curſe to the Serpent, in theſe words, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Serpents head,</hi> and this continued from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the third diſpenſation or diſcovery of God is more cleare then the former, for to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34600:20"/>
he ſpeakes more particularly; he doth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18.</note> not ſtill ſay in generall termes, <hi>The ſeed of the woman, &amp;c.</hi> But in thy ſeed, <hi>Abraham,</hi> all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth ſhall be bleſſed, and ſo points-out more directly in what linage and generation of mankind, God would firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in to bruiſe the Serpents head; and this diſpenſation continued from <hi>Abraham</hi> till <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and our Fathers embraced theſe promiſes, and rejoyced in them.</p>
            <p>The fourth diſpenſation is from <hi>Moſes,</hi> till God manifeſted himſelf in fleſh, or till Jeſus Chriſt was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> that was one of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> of the linage of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and this diſpenſation is more then the former, for <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7.</note> God, by types, figures, ceremonies, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, did more manifeſtly ſet forth his love to his creature, and his wrath to the Serpent; when the ſacrifice was ſlain and offered, God received an attonement, it being a type of Gods in-dwelling in fleſh, or a ſhadow of Chriſt, the Lamb, the ſubſtance of all thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Achan</hi> that troubled <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 26.</note> put to death in the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods wrath was turned away. And I believe God doth teach us by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 14. where he ſaith, <hi>I will give the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>of Achor for a doore of hope,</hi> which was the place of <hi>Achans</hi> death; ſo when the Serpent, who is our trouble, is ſubdued and killed in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34600:20"/>
the valley, humane fleſh, then the diſpenſation of Gods anger is turned away from us.</p>
            <p>The fifth diſpenſation is from the time that God was manifeſted in fleſh, in the perſon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to the time that he appeared in the fleſh and perſon of his Saints likewiſe; and this is more cleare then the former, for Jeſus the anointed, was the ſubſtance of all thoſe types and ſhadowes of the Moſaicall Law, for now God doth manifeſtly appear to dwell in fleſh, in his creature, and he hath broke the Serpents head, and caſt him out of heaven (his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and now this Jeſus Chriſt is the Lamb of <hi>God</hi> that takes away the ſins of the world, that is, deſtroyes the Serpent, who is the ſin that dwells in mankind, for now the life of <hi>God</hi> doth viſibly appear to ſwallow up the death of the creature, and a manifeſt beginning to ſet the creature free from bondage; and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of <hi>God</hi> was ſpoke of by the Prophets very often before it appeared, that a Child ſhould be borne, a Virgin ſhould have a ſon, which ſhould be called <hi>Emmanuel, God with us;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> would bring forth his branch, and the Redeemer ſhould come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> that is the anointing that is in <hi>Sion</hi> the Church, ſhall in <hi>Gods</hi> time go forth to heal the Nations likewiſe; now <hi>God</hi> throws down the ſhadowes of the Law and drawes his creature to eye Jeſus, the anointed, or God manifeſted in fleſh, and this is the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of viſible Goſpel, or of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 19.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34600:21"/>
bringing glad tydings to men, and ſo worthily deſerving everlaſting honour and praiſe from all creatures.</p>
            <p>The ſixth diſpenſation is, from the time that God appeared in the fleſh of Saints, till the perfect gathering up of the Elect, which is called the Reſurrection day, or the great day of Judgement. And this is ſtill more cleare then the former, for though God appeared in the perſon Jeſus Chriſt, who was a branch of mankind, yet we might ſtill be in doubt, and lie under death ſtill, if he there remain; But God did not appeare in the man Chriſt Jeſus only, but in the Saints likewiſe, according to his promiſe by <hi>Joel, in the latter dayes, I will power out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, upon my Sons and Daughters, and young men ſhall ſee viſions, and old men ſhall dreame dreames,</hi> and this was fulfilled in the Apoſtles, for the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt was ſent down upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>And I know,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that I have the ſpirit of Chriſt; And know ye not that the anointing dwells in you, except ye be reprobates.</hi> And again, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that have received the firſt fruits of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23.</note> 
               <hi>ſpirit, we groane within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption,</hi> to wit, the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtles in their firſt preaching, they preached Jeſus, the anointed, or the Lamb, or God manifeſted in fleſh, and this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 4.</note> they ſaw and heard, and they could not but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34600:21"/>
ſpeak in the name of Jeſus, and God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>God</hi> had fully declared himſelf in that diſpenſation, he ſent forth his Apoſtles then to preach more ſpiritually; and now, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> though formerly we have known Chriſt <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.</note> after the fleſh, that is, <hi>God</hi> only manifeſted in that one man Jeſus, the anointed, yet hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him no more, (in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint) for now the myſtery of <hi>God,</hi> which hath been hid from ages and generations paſt, is now revealed to his Saints in theſe laſt dayes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 27</note> which is Chriſt, or the anointing in you, the hope of glory; not only <hi>God</hi> manifeſted in the man Chriſt Jeſus, but the ſame anointing, or tree of life in you likewiſe, according to that of the Prophet, <hi>A King ſhall reigne in the earth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6</note> that is, in mankind, <hi>and his name ſhall be called the Lord our righteouſneſſe:</hi> and again, <hi>The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27.</note> 
               <hi>which ye have received abideth in you, and ye need not that any teach you, for the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things.</hi> And truly I believe, that whoſoever preaches from his book, and not from the anointing, and ſo ſpeaking in experience what he hath ſeen and heard from <hi>God,</hi> is no Miniſter ſent of <hi>God,</hi> but an hireling, that runs before he be ſent, only to get a temporall living; therefore O <hi>England,</hi> mind what thou doſt, leave off to imbrace hirelings, that come in their own name, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5. 43.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34600:22"/>
receive ſuch in love whom Chriſt hath ſent in his name, and his Fathers.</p>
            <p>And in this diſpenſation we are to note two things; firſt, when as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, it was neither light nor dark, for it was between the legall worſhip that was falling, and goſpel truths that were riſing, upon the very parting of time between the ſhadowes of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the appearance of Chriſt the Lamb, who was the ſubſtance thereof; and troubles and vexations began to ariſe in and among the ſtrict profeſſors of the Law, ſo that they could not be ſatisfyed till they had killed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 7.</note> Chriſt, whom they called the man full of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that deceived the people.</p>
            <p>So now the Church is at a ſtand, and the worſhip is partly light, and partly dark; ſome reſting upon the bare letter, according to the example of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles only, which is a worſhip after the fleſh, and was true, and was of <hi>God</hi> in the time of its diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>And others do acknowledg <hi>God,</hi> not exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily, but by the faith, the name, and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Jeſus Chriſt, ruling, teaching, acting, and dwelling in them; therefore think it not ſtrange, though ſome old profeſſors, and the book-hirelings eſpecially, be offended hereat, and brand the Saints for men full of errors, and ſeeke to ſuppreſſe their teſtimony; it was ſo then, it will be ſo now, for the ſame ſpirit of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34600:22"/>
the world, the Serpent, does ſtill perſecute the ſame anointing of <hi>God</hi> in this, as in the former diſpenſation; but you Saints of <hi>God,</hi> be patient, waite upon <hi>God,</hi> this troubled ſea, the Serpent, ſhall not over-whelm you, for ſtronger is he that is in you, then he that is in the world; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> the time of your redemption drawes neere.</p>
            <p>And againe, think it not ſtrange to ſee many of the Saints of <hi>God</hi> at a ſtand, in a wildernes, &amp; at a loſſe, and ſo waiting upon <hi>God</hi> to diſcover himſelf to them; many are like the tide at full <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 12. &amp;c.</note> Sea, which ſtands a little before the water runs either way; and aſſure your ſelves, I know what I ſpeak, you muſt be dead to your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes before you can run in the Sea of truth, or the River of the water of life; ſome walk ſtill according to example, and have either ſeene nothing, or very little of the anointing in them; and ſome walk more in ſpirit and truth, as the ſame anointing of the Father, which dwells bodily in Chriſt, teacheth them, and leadeth them into all truth. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 16. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame anointing unites Chriſt and the Saints, and makes them but one myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy: <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</note> I pray not for theſe alone, ſaith Chriſt, but for all that ſhall believe through their word, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 17. 20.</note> that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, I in them, and thou in me, that they may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34600:23"/>
be made perfect in one, that is in thee, who art the only pure and holy being.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not, that under this diſpenſation is the time that the elect, which is ſo much ſpoken of in the Scriptures, are to be gathered into one City, and perfected, and this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Angell which God hath ſent forth in theſe laſt dayes, to gather together his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, from one end of heaven to the other, or out of every nation, kindred, tongue &amp; people, in the earth. And where it is ſaid, that God will ſend forth not his Angel, but his Angels, to gather his elect together, it points out the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13.</note> ſeverall meaſures, or diſpenſations of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, to every Saint, as God will, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of the guift of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now ſometime God calls his elect by the name of one, in the ſingular number, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God declares his firſt born, Jeſus Chriſt, who is the head in the name of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As the Prophet writes, behold my Servant whom I have choſen, mine elect, in whom my ſoule delighteth: God hath not choſen the Serpent, or creature-invention to dwel in fleſh, for this he hath rejected, and takes no delight in. But he hath choſen the anointing, or his own power and name to dwell in fleſh, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. 1.</note> this he delights in, therefore Jeſus the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is called the Son of God, in whom he is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes God calls his elect in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34600:23"/>
plurall number, as many, and then he declares <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 22. 31.</note> the myſticall body, or the City, <hi>Sion,</hi> or thoſe that he hath given to Chriſt, and whoſe names <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. &amp;c.</note> are written in the Lambs book. And in this 6. generall diſpenſation, theſe only ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15.</note> into the City, and whoſoever is not writ in the Lambs book of life, ſhall not enter in at this time and ſeaſon of the Father, though there is a time and ſeaſon known to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they ſhall be healed likewiſe, and enter in; and eat of the heavenly Manna, the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2.</note> tree of life, that is in the middle of the City.</p>
            <p>Now this City <hi>Sion,</hi> which conſiſts of head and members; Jeſus Chriſt and his Saints, who are all baptized into, and knit together by one ſpirit of God, the anointing. And this City God will redeeme firſt, or he will ſubdue the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. &amp;c.</note> Serpent under the feet of this his Son firſt: All that do his Commandements, that is, have <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. 15.</note> faith and love, theſe ſhall enter into the City, but the fearfull and unbeleevers, murderers, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and every one that loveth, and maketh a lie, are without, and are caſt into the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, or the death of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the Serpent ruling in man is the firſt death which God redeemes us from.</p>
            <p>All thoſe that were not found writ in the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15.</note> Lambs book of life, were caſt into the lake of fire. Or as <hi>Mathew</hi> calls it, into everlaſting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34600:24"/>
fire. Or as <hi>Matthew</hi> calls it, into everlaſting fire, and ſhall lie under that diſpenſation of wrath for ever, that is, all the time of this diſpenſation, or till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ended, that the Serpent, Death, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3.</note> Hell, are caſt into the Lake of fire, and that there ſhall no more curſe lie upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14.</note>, but from the judgement ſeat, or Throne of God; the whole Creation being redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall flow forth a pure River of the water of life; for every Diſpenſation is called a full period, or tearme of time, and an everlaſting ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>All this time that God is gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his elect, he hath given a time, times, and halfe time to the Serpent. Which in thoſe threefold ſhapes and a halfe, or in thoſe three dayes and halfe, he is called the Beaſt, or the Whore, and this time is given him to make warre, and to fight againſt the Prince of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 24, 25.</note>, and his Saints, and to overcome them, and to waſte and deſtroy the holy people mightily.</p>
            <p>And this appointed time is the yeare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Beaſt lives, and <hi>God</hi> gives all advantages <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17.</note> to the Beaſt, as riches, outward liberty, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, and generally humane Authority into his hand. And puts no weapons into the hands of his Saints; but faith, or the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to fight againſt the reproaches, ſlanders, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 15.</note> oppreſſions, poverties, weakneſſe, priſons, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34600:24"/>
the multitude of temptations which the Beaſt, through her wit, malice, and power, caſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints, like a flood of water to drowne them. And to overthrow the work of <hi>God</hi> by great hand, if it were poſſible.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the Serpent ſtirs up ſome, whom ſhe deceives, to be ſeeming profeſſors, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly religious, having a form of godlineſſe, but through hypocriſie, pride, and ſelfiſhneſſe, might diſhonour <hi>God,</hi> diſcourage the tender Lambs of Chriſt, and bring an ill report upon the wayes of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it is that <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old were tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were not in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And hence it is, that the Beaſt muſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2, 3.</note> tread the holy City under foot 42 moneths. That in the day of judgement it may be ſaid, that the Serpent had faire play given him, hee had all advantages, he had a long time given him to ingage warre. I, but God did beat him with his own weapons, and encounters <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11, 12.</note> with all the temptations, malice and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Serpent, by the faith and patience of his Saints, and thereby fairly deſtroyes him, himſelfe may be judge.</p>
            <p>But in the latter dayes, when the time, times, and halfe drawes to an end, then God ſends forth ſeverall diſpenſations, or Angels, as aſſiſtances to this ſixth and great Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to poure out Vials of wrath upon all the glory of the Beaſt, and curſes all his glory by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34600:25"/>
ſeven degrees, and ſounds forth ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets of glory to God, one after another; which implies perfection of ruine upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, blaſting, curſing, or downfall of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.</note> Beaſt.</p>
            <p>And when theſe dayes appeare, then the rage of the Serpent increaſes, becauſe his time growes ſhort, and his violence, wrath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, oppreſſion, provocations and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt the Saints are multiplied, and times grow very bad: for now iniquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, and the love of many in whom the Serpent dwels, waxes cold, and extreamly bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and mad againſt the Saints, in whom the anointing dwells, ſo that they gnaſh their tongues with vexation of ſpirit, and the ſmoak of their torment aſcends upwards (towards God and his Saints, that are above, not ſo much downward to ſuch like themſelves) and that for ever and ever. By the doubling of this word, <hi>ever and ever,</hi> he declares that this miſery continues untill the ſixth Diſpenſation be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11, 12.</note> ended, that is, the one <hi>for ever;</hi> and all the time of the great day of judgement, that is the ſecond <hi>for ever,</hi> and ſo they have no reſt, day nor night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and whoſoever receiveth the mark of his name; here is the patience of the Saints, here are they that keep the Commandments of God, and the faith of Jeſus: for truly the faith and patience of the Saints are tried to ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34600:25"/>
purpoſe, while the Beaſt thus rages, and ſwels with malice againſt them.</p>
            <p>And I beleeve it will appeare more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible in time, to me it appears very plain, that the great bitterneſſe, envy, reproachfull languages, and expreſsions of malicious wrath, in and among men and women in theſe dayes, againſt others whom they brand Sectaries, by ſeverall names, will prove part of the ſmoak of her torment, and part of the reſtleſneſſe of her Spirit day and night, which is the beginning of her ſorrowes; for this is the raging Sea that caſts out its own ſhame: and men in whom <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 13.</note> the Serpent dwels, ſpeak evill of that they know not.</p>
            <p>Now all the time of this ſixth Diſpenſation, God is declaring his great power, in pulling what fire-brands he will out of the Serpents hand, and he will take here one, and there one, as he pleaſes himſelf. And let the Serpent put forth all his wit and power, he ſhall not hinder the ſalvation of one man or woman, whom God hath choſen, and purpoſes to deliver from his bondage; but he will ſave under every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation whom he will, and bring them into <hi>Sion,</hi> Neither ſhall the Serpent, nor any of his ſeed, ever attain communion with God by all his wit, learning, ſtudy, actings and power, but he ſhall periſh, and all creatures in whom the Serpent reignes and acts, ſhall be loſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15.</note> in their work, yet every man ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34600:26"/>
be ſaved in the end, yet ſo, as by fire.</p>
            <p>And here mind two things, Firſt God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the ſalvation of beleevers, becauſe he hath undertaken to pull them out of the Serpents hand, and to bind that ſtrong man, and to bring in the Citie to himſelfe, and to appeare in them firſt; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That judgement begins at the Houſe of God firſt,</hi> that is, God judges, condemnes, and caſts the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent out of his elect, and ſaves the whole, and every member of that Citie, before he judge, condemne, and caſt the Serpent out of them, that did not enter into the City, but were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15.</note> becauſe their names were not written in that Lambs Book of life.</p>
            <p>Now for God to ſave ſome at one houre, and ſome at another, both when he will, and whom he will, and thoſe ſcattered ſheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom God hath choſen, theſe ſhall enter into the Citie, though all the wit and power of the Serpent ſtrive to hinder them from entring, And thoſe whom God hath not choſen, ſhall not enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though all the learning, ſtudy, and ſelfiſh and meritorious actings of the Serpent, <hi>ſtrive to enter in</hi> never ſo much: It makes much for the honour of his Wiſdome, Power, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24.</note> Name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is honoured in the loſſe, death, or as the word is interpreted, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unbeleevers; for faith, or the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34600:26"/>
which is born of God, and whereby the Saints overcome the World, is the power of God dwelling and ruling in Man: And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe is the Serpent, which is born of the fleſh, and perſecutes Chriſt till the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled; and this power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is that which dwels and rules in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Now both theſe <hi>are grinding at the Mill,</hi> and are at work for life in humane fleſh; and it advances the glory of God, <hi>That they ſhall live in whom his Divine power dwels, though they be full of weakneſſe in themſelves, and though they be compaſſed about with divers temptations,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27.</note> 
               <hi>being deſpiſed of all, and regarded of none, but are the weak, the poore, the fooliſh things of the world.</hi> And it makes for the glory of God, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, in whom the power of the Serpent dwels, ſhall die, though they have all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and means outward, as may be, and though they ſtrive much by learning, ſtudy, &amp; actings, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did, <hi>who attained not to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though he ſought after it greatly, becauſe he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32.</note> 
               <hi>ſought for it as it were by the workes of the Law, and not by faith,</hi> that is, he ſought for it in the ſtrength of the Serpent, or ſelfiſhneſſe, but not in the ſtrength of God.</p>
            <p>Well, this ſixth Diſpenſation is the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring time, wherein God ſummes up the whole number of his elect; and as every beleever hath fought his fight, kept the faith, and finiſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34600:27"/>
his courſe, they return to duſt; and the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever he returns to duſt, for as the one dies, ſo dies the other; and as in this world all things come alike to all, we cannot tell either love or hatred by any thing that happens in this life; and both return to duſt alike, as if there were no other reckoning to be made of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And ſo from <hi>Adams</hi> time, til the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect be taken up to God, out of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9.</note> every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, out of which God in all ages of the world is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to chooſe ſome to be Members of his Son, or Citizens of <hi>Sion,</hi> and hath appointed in his Councel, that mankind ſhall increaſe in the world, and act a while, and then return to duſt, and one generation paſſe away, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come in the place; but when the elect are gathered as wheat into Gods ſtore-houſe, and the City made compleat, and the chaffe burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fire, and none enters into the City, but ſuch whoſe names are written in the Lambs book of life; and none enters into the lake of fire, but ſuch as are not writ in the Lambs book; ſo that Gods will under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is done; then followes immediately the great day of judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the reſurrection of mens bodies out of the graves.</p>
            <p>And this day of judgment is the 7. diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and this day windes up the whole myſtery of God, and makes the eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34600:27"/>
of God compleatly manifeſt and true; That the Serpents head is bruiſed, and the whole creation, <hi>Adam,</hi> redeemed from the bondage of death, and in this diſpenſation we are to mind two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in this great day of the Lord he raiſes up the bodies of believers, and unbelievers out of the duſt again, wherein he hath reſerved them all the time of the battel, between the anointing and the Serpent, as a man would keep his jewels in a box for an appointed time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God brings every man to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5. 29.</note> and rewards every man according to his work, ſome riſes to the reſurrection of life, and others to the reſurrection of loſſe and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12.</note> death: and the bookes were opened, as <hi>John</hi> writes; that is, firſt the book of the myſtery of iniquity, or the nature of the Serpent in fleſh laid open, and made manifeſt to be a power and ſpirit of darkneſs, that ſtrived to be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal with God, nay, above God; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weighed in the ballance, it is found too light.</p>
            <p>And then the book of the myſtery of God, or the anointing of God in fleſh, this is made manifeſt, and laid open to be the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and the ſpirit of truth, which hath advanced God to be the only one infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; even God, all in all, and that beſides him there is none.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34600:28"/>
And then another book was opened, that is, the book of life and death, or the book of the Law, and of Judgment, which gives the ſentence, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the foundation of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 5 34.</note> 
               <hi>world:</hi> and to unbeleevers, <hi>Go ye curſed into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting fire:</hi> And now every man is judged according to his works; the anointing, or the righteous one, is rewarded with life, and all they in whom the anointing did dwell, who are the elect City, and ſpouſe of Chriſt, are called bleſſed, and taken up into Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is, into love never to fall again.</p>
            <p>But the Serpent, the wicked one, is rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with death, and all thoſe diſobedient ones, in whom the Serpent dwelt, are caſt into the everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devill and his Angels; this is a ſecond part in the day of judgment, which is a trying of every mans work, and the eſtabliſhing the City, which is the Lambs wife, in perfect glory, and in juſtly condemning the reſt: and here God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſalvation of believers, and in the damnation, or loſſe of unbelievers; for his work ſtands, and abides triall; but mans work ſuffers loſſe, and is aſhamed: But this is not the end, for as yet the Son hath not delivered up the Kingdom to the Father, for he muſt raign till all enemies be ſubdued, but death, curſe, and ſorrow is not yet quite ſubdued; for it raignes over part of the Creation ſtill, even
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34600:28"/>
over thoſe poor creatures that were loſt, or that did not enter into the City, but were caſt into the lake of fire. The Serpent as yet holds <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15.</note> a power, for there is part of Gods work not yet delivered from his bondage: And the Serpent would be glad, and it would be ſome eaſe to his torment, if any of Gods work might die and periſh with him. As I have heard ſome ſay, that they would be content to ſuffer the miſery of a new war in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that ſuch as they mentioned, might ſuffer as well as they; this is the ſpirit of the Serpent. I, but the Serpent only ſhall periſh, and God will not looſe a hair that he made, he will redeeme his whole creation from death. The ſpirit of darkneſſe cannot beare this ſpeech, therefore reader obſerve thy heart, as thou readeſt, it will either cloſe with a tender ſpirit of pitty and love herewith, or elſe ſwell and fret againſt it.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the third part of this great day of judgment, after the City work is finiſhed, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24.</note> and the triall over, then does the tree of life, God himſelf that dwells in the City, and is the light, and life, and glory of it, ſend forth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, or Angels, bringing love to heale the Nations, and to bring their glory into the City; likewiſe that for the preſent lies under the diſpenſation of wrath, and throws the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that deceived them, death, and hell, into the Lake, but there is no mention that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34600:29"/>
are caſt therein, in this laſt caſting in, for they are redeemed from it; as the tree of life brought forth fruit every change of time, and age of the world, to heale the elect, the loſt ſheep, or City; ſo in this laſt and great day it brings forth leaves to heale the Nations, or ſuch as were not of the City; their turne to receive mercy comes, though it be at the laſt houre; And then all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or whole creation, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26.</note> that groaned under the bondage of death, ſhal partake of the glorious manifeſtation of the Sons of God, for now the deliverer comes out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſhall turne away ungodlineſſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. 3.</note> from <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſaith <hi>John,</hi> I ſaw a pure River of the water of life, cleare as Criſtall, proceeded out of the throne of God, and the Lamb. Now I conceive clearly that this pure River, is the whole creation, mankind, fully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly delivered from death, and curſe, as in that 3. verſe. And this pure redemption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from the throne of God and the Lamb, that is, from the judgment ſeat of God, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, condemning, and bruiſing the Serpents head, and ſo ſetting his own work, mankind, free from that death and bondage.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention one Scripture more that countenances this truth: And I looked, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate like the Son of man; having on his head a Crown of gold, and in his hand a ſharpe ſickle:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34600:29"/>
And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a loud voice to him that ſate on the cloud, ſaying, thruſt in thy ſickle and reape, for the harveſt of the earth is ripe; and he that ſate on the cloud, thruſt in his ſickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. And then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Angel came out of the altar, and cryed in the ſame manner, to him that had the ſickle, as you may read.</p>
            <p>By a white cloud, I conceive is meant the City <hi>Sion,</hi> or ſpouſe of Chriſt, that is arayed in pure and white, in whom there is no ſpot, for ſhe is perfectly redeemed; by him that ſate upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this white cloud, is ment the whole anointing, or the great manifeſtation of God in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Jeſus Chriſt; And the ſeverall Angels that cryed one after another, are ſeverall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or diſcoveries of God, that proceed from Chriſt at ſeveral times, and ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>Therefore the City being made white, now <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7. 8.</note> the manifeſtations of Gods love begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare towards the earth, or nations, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not into the City; now the time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 21.</note> requires, that the ſickle of Chriſt ſhould be thruſt into the earth, that is, that the brightneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and ſhine forth upon the Nations alſo, as it did ſhine upon the City,</p>
            <p>And we ſee the concluſion in the 20. verſe, And the wine-preſſe was troden without the City, (mind that) and blood came out of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34600:30"/>
wine-preſſe, even unto the horſe bridles, &amp;c. This phraſe I conceive points out the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine and deſtruction of the Serpent, that held the earth or Nations which were without the City, in bondage. But now the anointing, or the great diſpenſation of the love of God, hath reaped the earth as well as the City, and deſtroyed the Serpent there, as well as in the City; the wine-preſſe, or the bruiſing of the Serpents head, and ſhedding his blood, was without the City; and ſo both City and Country, City and whole earth of mankind, is made a pure River of the water of life, which proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb.</p>
            <p>But here ariſe 3. ſcruples: Firſt, is not God changeable ſaith one, In ſaying, go ye curſed into everlaſting fire; and yet afterwards takes them out againe?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, this fire is the diſpenſation of Gods wrath; and it is everlaſting, without end to the Serpent; it was prepared for him and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and though God bid the unbeleevers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into it; yet he did not ſay, you ſhall lie there, and never be redeemed.</p>
            <p>But the ſcruple lies in the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> which I as well as you have taken it to be a miſery without end to the creature. But I anſwer, that in ſcripture phraſe, every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God was called an everlaſting time; as in the day of <hi>Moſes,</hi> every ſervice in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34600:30"/>
Temple that <hi>Aaron</hi> was to perform, God ſaid <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 29.</note> it ſhould be a Statute and a Law for ever, which notwithſtanding ended to be a Law in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 8.</note> the beginning of the next diſpenſation, or the appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh; and ſo, though God ſend unbelievers to lie under the diſpenſation of his wrath, and call it everlaſting fire, it is but for the time of his diſpenſation, while he is finiſhing City work, and judging and rewarding every man, that is, the Serpent, and the anointing, according to their works: and after this, comes in their healing time and ſeaſon, and theſe times and ſeaſons the Father <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7.</note> hath reſerved to himſelf, the Son knowes them not.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſcruple is this; Shall a man be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delivered out of hell? out of hell, ſaith ſome, there is no redemption.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, that there is no Scripture, as ſaith, out of hell there is no redemption, therefore the ſcruple is raiſed upon it without ground; indeed the Prophet ſpeaking, how that the living praiſe God, and the dead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, hath theſe words in preferring life before death: <hi>The grave cannot praiſe thee, death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. 18.</note> 
               <hi>celebrate thee, they that go down into the pit, cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to anſwer more directly, let us conſider what hell is, and then whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall be delivered out that is there: Hell is called death, or a condition below life; and this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34600:31"/>
is twofold, either a death of purity, far below the nature of God, or a death of ſorrows, which is a condition far below the comfort and joyes of God. Now every man and woman, as they are branches of <hi>Adam,</hi> have no purity in them, and therefore are in a hell far below the life and nature of God; and likewiſe they are unavoidably ſubject to the ſorrowes of that death, as an effect following the cauſe, therefore unavoidably ſubject to a condition far below the comfort and joyes of God. This is the condition of every man and woman, and they have no power for to deliver themſelves, for God only is our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>And then it followes, that a man may be in hell, and yet may be delivered out; for as in all this diſcourſe paſt, it appeares, that as we ſpring from <hi>Adam,</hi> we do all lie under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and death, and power of the Serpent, which is one part of hell, and yet God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his elect from out of it; and therefore it followes cleare, that if men are capable of ſo much mercy, being Gods creatures, as to be delivered from ſin and death, which is one part of hell; or of a condition below God, they are capable to be delivered through the mercy of the ſame God, from the ſorrowes and paines that follow ſin, both which are but the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Serpent, which God will deliver his creature from: this twofold death is the Serpents head, which God will bruiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:34600:31"/>
A third ſcruple is, concerning the day of Judgement: Some think it is but one ſingle day, of twenty foure houres long; nay, ſome make it leſſe, but the length of the twinkling of an eye, becauſe the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture runs thus, <hi>That in the twinkling of an eye, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, the Dead ſhall be raiſed up to judgement.</hi> But to anſwer this phraſe, <hi>Twinkling of an eye,</hi> it onely ſhewes that the day of judgement is very ſhort in compariſon of the dayes by-paſt; like that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>And there was ſilence in Heaven for the ſpace of half an houre,</hi> which is not a direct halfe houre, according as men account, but it declares a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conceive, this is not a ſingle day, of 24. houres, but a longer time; while the Judge ſits upon the judgement ſeat, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Serpent, ſo long time it is called a day of judgement, becauſe that is the work of this day, or tearm of time, or the full length of that diſpenſation; as formerly it was called <hi>the Day of Moſes,</hi> which was the time while that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Law continued in force, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator; and ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham deſired to ſee my Day,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſaw it,</hi> that is, the day and time that Chriſt reignes as King in the power and law of <hi>Love,</hi> in and over the Saints, and this <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Day of Chriſts reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this in the truth of it, is that which we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34600:32"/>
call the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> or <hi>Day of a Chriſtians reſt;</hi> and it is not one day in ſeaven, ſtill typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath was, but it is the conſtant reign of Chriſt in and over the Saints, which is their reſt, and which indeed is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> typicall Sabbath; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the earth rejoyce, the LORD reignes.</hi> And, <hi>a King ſhall reigne in the earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremy, and his name ſhall bee called, The LORD our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> Now Chriſt, or the Anointing, doth not reigne one ſingle day in the ſeaven in his Saints, but every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, which is the ſubſtance of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſingle Sabbath; therefore I wiſh that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile-</hi>Chriſtians could underſtand, that what the <hi>Jewes</hi> did in the type, theſe are to perform in the ſubſtance, and it is not for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to worſhip in Types, as did the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the time of the indignation, or while God ſuffers the Beaſt to reigne, is called, <hi>The Day of the Beaſt;</hi> and God hath given her <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36.</note> 
               <hi>three Dayes and a halfe to tread the holy Citie under foot,</hi> or the ſpace of 42 <hi>moneths,</hi> which is <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. 9.</note> three ſhapes, three diſcoveries of the reigne of the Beaſt, or three degrees and half of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents reformation from bad to worſe, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen prophaneneſſe to cloſe hypocriſie; and not the ſingle dayes of a week. And ſo here it is called the <hi>Day of Judgement,</hi> from the work and buſineſſe of the day, or full length of that Diſpenſation, ſo that the great and generall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34600:32"/>
day of judgment, from the time that the bodies of beleevers and unbelievers are raiſed out of the grave, till the Son deliver up the Kingdome to the Father, I beleeve is a long time, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeares; the full length or ſhortneſſe of it, God onely knowes, and reſerves the time and ſeaſon of that ſecret to himſelfe; but it is called the day of judgement, while the worke <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</note> of judgement laſts; as in our language it is called the <hi>Day of Aſſizes,</hi> though the Seſſions or buſineſſe continue divers dayes.</p>
            <p>Now all this day the condemned creatures lie under the diſpenſation of wrath, under the curſe, and under weeping, wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth for anguiſh, and this Hell, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or Puniſhment, or Death, is everlaſting, becauſe it continues the full time of the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, &amp; the worm never dies all the time, the fire and ſenſe of wrath ſhall never goe out all the time, the fire of luſt ſhall ſtill be burning, and the ſmoak of blaſphemy ſhall aſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.</note> and they ſhal have no reſt day nor night, and the fire of Gods wrath ſhal ſtill be ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſuming, which ſhall be an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pain to the creature.</p>
            <p>Therefore if any man or woman take liberty to ſin, let them know this is a truth, they ſhall be condemned and die, and depart into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, and puniſhed in that Hell, lie under the diſpenſation of wrath, and lie at Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for delivery, ſo that thoſe that will not now
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34600:33"/>
wait upon God in his time of long-ſuffering, or in the diſpenſation of his patience; they ſhal wait upon God whether they will or no in the diſpenſation of wrath, in ſorrow, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, which is the ſecond death. The firſt death I conceive, and I clearly ſee a truth in it, is <hi>Adams</hi> death, or <hi>Adams</hi> bondage to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; the ſecond death is the Serpents death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God hath judged him, which is to lie under the wrath of God without end.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection,</hi> that is, to be delivered from the bondage of the Serpent, and raiſed up from the death of ſin, and ſo made alive to God through the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing; over ſuch a man, <hi>the ſecond Death,</hi> or the endleſſe diſpenſation of wrath, which is prepared for the Serpent, <hi>ſhall have no power.</hi> But if a man have not part in the <hi>firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and ſo enter not into the City new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he ſhall then <hi>taſt of the ſecond Death,</hi> which is the everlaſting fire, prepared for the Serpent &amp; his ſeed, and it ſhal have power over him, and he ſhall lie under it for ever, that is, till the diſpenſation change, or till the myſtery of God be finiſhed, that the Serpent, Death, and Hell is ſubdued, and caſt into the Lake, and the whole Creation be ſet free, and the <hi>Son deliuer up the Kingdome to the Father,</hi> and <hi>God become all in all,</hi> as at the beginning he was, before any oppoſite power appeared againſt <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27.</note> him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34600:33"/>
But doth not God ſit upon the Throne of judgement before this great day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appear? Yes, God &amp; the Lamb have ſate upon the judgement ſeat, or Throne, ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi> delighted in his own fruit, or conſented to the Serpent, and God hath been judging the Serpent, and bruiſing his head in every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his, ever ſince that time, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Serpent, that ſtrong Man, out of his Elect.</p>
            <p>And by the powring out of the ſeven Vials, and the ſounding of the ſeven Trumpets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares how God hath been ſubduing the Beaſt, the Whore, and the falſe Prophet, which hath been the ſeverall appearances of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent under thoſe names, by which he hath made warre with Chriſt and his Saints, ſo that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 24.</note> God hath been about this work of judging the Serpent long before this day of judgment <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.</note> came.</p>
            <p>Then it ſeemes God hath two judgement dayes: No, it is all one; for from <hi>Adams</hi> time till the <hi>Son deliver up the Kingdome to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> God hath ſate upon the Throne, judging the ſerpent; but it pleaſed God ſo to eſtabliſh his counſell, that he would not finiſh this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in a ſhort time, but in ſeverall degrees of times and ſeaſons, <hi>which he hath reſerued in his own power:</hi> And this great and laſt day, is the concluſion of this work, that the ſerpent ſhall be ſubdued under the feet of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34600:34"/>
and be deſtroyed everlaſtingly, as it is written, <hi>Judgement begins at the Houſe of God;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and if it begin at us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, who are his Temple, his little Flock, his Royall Nation, his peculiar people, what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> Why truly they muſt come to judgement too, but in the laſt day, or in the end of time; ſo that it is not two judgement dayes, but all one day.</p>
            <p>And ſo to wind up all, I ſhall deſire men to mind one thing, That though God hath in Scripture declared ſeven great diſpenſations, or diſcoveries of his Counſel, and each one clearer then the other; yet in every one of theſe God ſends forth ſeverall other diſpenſations, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for the carrying on of the work of that time, or ſeaſon, which are diſcoveries of his glory; for whatſoever comes from God is a Spirituall power, not a dead work, but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>As whatſoever came firſt from <hi>Adam,</hi> it was a ſpiritual power, as pride, diſcontent, envie, and the whole body of unbeliefe, which ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the being of God, and ſeekes to preferre a Creature-being before him. This diſcovery of <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſpiritual power, which is the very bondage which all creatures lie under, and it is an unclean and dead power, but not a living power.</p>
            <p>But whatſoever comes from God, is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Angel, or leſſer diſpenſation, as an aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34600:34"/>
to the greater. As for example, when God took fleſh, and appeared in the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, it was the fifth great diſpenſation, and the Angel of Gods preſence, and <hi>Michael</hi> our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 22, 8.</note> Prince, that ſtands before God for us. Yet his ſufferings in that day, or ſeaſon of time, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Diſpenſation of Gods patience, wiſdome and love, &amp;c.</hi> The ſtrength of patience is an Angel of God.</p>
            <p>I mention this, becauſe I know in my own experience, that if God ſet it home to others, as I find, it quiets the heart under what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoever. If thou lie under ſorrowes for ſins, now know, that it is Gods diſpenſation to thee, wait patiently upon him, hee will work a good iſſue in his time, but not in thy time. If thou lie under the temptations of men, of loſſes, of poverty, of reproaches, it is Gods diſpenſation to thee, wait with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quiet ſpirit upon him, till he give delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. If thou lie under darkneſſe, emptineſſe, and in a loſt and wildernes-condition wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently (it is his diſpenſation to thee) till God ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace when thou thinkeſt leaſt of it. If thou be filled with joy and peace through beleeving, wait with an humble thankfull heart ſtill upon God, it is his diſpenſation to thee, and aſſure thy ſelfe, that now God begins to diſpenſe out love to thee, he will ſtill be feeding thee in diſpenſations, or diſcoveries of his love; and he will never let
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34600:35"/>
thee lie under the ſenſe of anger any more, for his freedome is a freedome indeed, to a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; the peace that he gives, none can, nor ſhall take away: And be ſure he will never take it again, <hi>For the gifts and callings of God are without repentanct.</hi> And this is all I have to ſay concerning this truth. And I have done.</p>
