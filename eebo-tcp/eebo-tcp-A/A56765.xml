            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your laſt, with your Requeſt, to know what Specifick I have obſerved in the <hi>Indies</hi> to be moſt Effectual againſt difficult Labour in Women, which amongſt us in <hi>Europe</hi> ſweeps away ſo many People. I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44435:3"/>
muſt tell you, that I have been very Curious in taking Notice of this particular Caſe and have obſerved them to make great uſe of the <hi>Maldiva Nut,</hi> with very good Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> tells us, that one of theſe Nuts was preſented as a great Rarity to the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> generally eſteemed in the <hi>Indies</hi> worth twenty five Pounds. It's Death for any Common People to meddle with them, as being the Kings Profit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augerius Cluſius</hi> hath written a Book in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this Rare Nut, and given many Examples of the wonderful Cures wrought by it, and particularly of a Patient of his, a Citizen of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> whoſe Life was in great Danger by an acute Diſeaſe, when all other Means failed, very much importuned him to preſcribe him the <hi>Maldiva Nut,</hi> which the Patient had ſeen do great Cures in <hi>India,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Womens difficult Labour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told <hi>Cluſius</hi> it could do him no Injury if it did him no Good; upon which he gave it him, and the Man ſpeedily recovered; upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44435:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he gave Dr. <hi>Cluſius</hi> a piece of the Nut, with which he gave Relief to many Women in Difficult Labour.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Groll</hi> tells us of the Wife of one <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus,</hi> who had been tormented for three days with moſt violent Pains of Child bearing, and filled all the Neighbourhood with her Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries; when all things had been given as are uſual in that Caſe, and to no purpoſe, he then gave her the Powder of this Nut in a little Sirrup and Water that's uſual in that Caſe, upon the uſe of which ſhe was ſpeedily and ſafely delivered of a Child, to the great Joy and Comfort of the Mother.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells of a Shoomakers Wife who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured great Miſery, and was in great Danger, her long and acute Pains having cauſed a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; at length the <hi>Maldiva Panacea</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtr'd, ſhe was deliver'd of a dead Child.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cluſius</hi> tells of the Son of a Duke, who was ſtrangely recovered from a languiſhing Diſtemper, only by Drinking all his Liquid Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44435:4"/>
out of this Shell, it did mightily corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate all the Power of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Famous Dr. <hi>Tulpias</hi> uſed frequently to preſcribe this Nut with very good Succeſs.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in his <hi>Herbal</hi> tells us, that Perſons of the Beſt Quality in <hi>India</hi> carry a piece of it always about them, faſten'd to a Chain, which they ſteep in Wine or other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as an Antidote againſt any Poyſon or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and drinking out of the Cup made of the ſhell they look upon as a Preſervative againſt all Diſeaſes, and a Means to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a ſound and healthful ſtate: He alſo commends it as very available in Womens hard and difficult Labour.</p>
            <p>When I travelled in <hi>Spain,</hi> they uſed to call it the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwife, I ſuppoſe only by way of Alluſion to the ſpeedy Delivery of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Women by their Means.</p>
            <p>For my own particular, I can truly ſay, that I have often experienced it to be admirable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44435:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in that Caſe, if I may beleive the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in our Countrey, and particularly one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Midwife, who hath gotten great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>I knew a Country Gentlewoman who by very ſtrait Lacing her ſelf, and Eating Green Fruit, and Drinking Red Wines, uſed to have hard Labour, but after ſhe had found out this <hi>Indian</hi> Remedy, never met with Difficulty in her Travels. I could name others but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, becauſe they are needleſs.</p>
