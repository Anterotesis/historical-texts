            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Honourable Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bove a yeare agoe I petitioned your <hi>Honour,</hi> and under your name the <hi>Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the raiſing of a future Plantation of Wood and Timber throughout the Land: Conſidering it as one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life, a worke of mercy and charitie to the poore, of piety towards God, and his Church, and of abſolute neceſſitie for the maintenance of Navigation, the building of Houſes, the maintenance of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and divers uſefull and neceſſary Trades in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. All which notwithſtanding, it was not my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the matter could be throughly proceeded in ſo ſoone as my ſelfe and others could wiſh or deſire: Neither doe I hould it the worke of one yeare, but rather ſuch as will take up an employment for divers yeares one after another ſucceſſively. True it is, if it like your <hi>Honour,</hi> I have heard it eſtimated by ſome of good underſtanding and knowledge, that the loſſe of any one yeare in the due proſecuting of this affaire for the Common-wealth, is of no leſſe value, if not farre greater, then the loſſe of one hundred thouſand pounds. Yet this I conſider with my ſelfe, that the State may be ſo employed otherwiſe, that they cannot ſo inſtantly purſue it as ſome thinke they may. Such a diſhonourable, diſloyall conceit cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that thoſe which ſit at the Sterne, watching and waiting all opportunities to doe publique good, can wilfully, enviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or careleſly betray the honour, ſtrength, comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Common-wealth in ſuch a maine, and moſt important buſines as this. In as much as Wood and Timber will alwayes be worth money, it is in the power of the State, very eaſily, and within a reaſonable time, to raiſe divers milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of money, by planting and encreaſing of woods: beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforts and commodities ariſing thereof. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, woe to this Land, at leaſtwiſe as I conceive, for the decay of Woods, not onely if Shipping ſhall faile, whereof it is ſayd

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118306:3"/>
to be in apparant danger for time to come, but if Sea-coale ſhall faile, as I am ſure it may by more accidents then one: the miſery whereof began to be ſeene and felt not very many yeares agoe, when the <hi>Scots</hi> were poſſeſſed of <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi> Certainly, it is the will of God, that mens lives ſhould by all means be made comfortable, and that we uſe our wits, ſtrength, &amp; knowledge, whatſoever it is, to the profiting of one another, and ſetting forth the praiſe of God in the world. Imitating the nature of good Angels, who though they excell in dignity and beauty all other creatures, yet they diſdaine not to be ſerviceable to men, doing it with ſingular love, and good will; and infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing therein. In conſideration whereof a certain Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Writer hath this excellent ſaying: <hi>That after the example of Angells we ought to employ our ſelves, in ſoule, and body, calling, credit, and all we have for the good of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have preſumed (under aſſurance of honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and leave) to revive the memory of my late Petition, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or Remonſtrance, for repairing the decay of Wood and Timber. Toward the latter end whereof I did intimate to your <hi>Honour,</hi> how that I had alſo travailed with the late King for the planting and propagating of the word of God in a juſt and due manner throughout the Land. I did it by way of Petition, as the caſe neceſſarily required, and briefly, and ſummarily the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was this: In the firſt place I did juſtly and truely affirme it, that the ſtate and condition of Impropriations is apparantly derogatory to the glory of God, and ſalvation of ſoules. Next, I ſhewed unto the King, how it reſted in his owne ſole power, to grant Licences in <hi>Mortmaine,</hi> whereby to make the Churches capable of a reſtauration in that caſe by due courſe of Law, and not otherwiſe. Thirdly, I propoſed a Collection of benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be had and made throughout the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> whereby Appropriatories might be ſatisfied, either in Land, or money, to the full value of their eſtates. Laſtly, I ſuggeſted a competency of yearly rent to be reſerved upon all thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, as they ſhould grow to be purchaſed, to the King, his heires and Succeſſors, in lieu, of firſt Fruits, Tenths, and Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: to the end that the revenew of the Crowne or State, might not ſuffer diminution by any device or propoſition of mine. This was the maine ground, and the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my Petition. Whereby it may appeare, as I ſuppoſe,

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118306:3"/>
that I intended no wrong or violence to any, but proceeded in a lawfull, peaceable, and ſatisfactory way, and not otherwiſe. As for a generall, free reſtitution of Impropriations (which hath been often &amp; earneſtly urged heretofore) I have ever held it a moſt unreaſonable, and uncharitable demand, beſides the impoſſibility of obteining it. And in caſe that it were poſſible to have it prevailed in at this day, it would not onely be the undoing of private Families, but alſo the diſſolving of Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate Societies, which are the Seminaries &amp; Nurceries of good learning, and of Gods true Religion in the Land. It was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Satanicall device, tending to the deſtruction of ſouls, when Impropriations were put upon Colledges in exchange for Lands of another tenure. For then, and from thence-forth, the Church could not build up it ſelfe without deſtroying it ſelfe: In as much as Colledges are rightly called, <hi>Semen Eccleſiae,</hi> the ſeed of the Church.</p>
            <p>I omit for brevity ſake, to ſhew how the matter was diſcuſſed at my attendance at the Councell board, how the King was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have proceeded, and by whom, and under what pretence the proceeding was ſecretly ſtopt and ſtayd. Whatſoever ſhall be conceived of my proceeding with the ſaid late King, which is here above recited, it is a comfort to my Conſcience, that I have faithfully travailed in a lawfull and peaceable way for the propagating of the word of God, which is the glory &amp; ſtrength of a Nation, and the light, and life, and everlaſting happines of every true Chriſtian Believer. I never propoſed any thing to the ſaid late King, but what I meant to juſtifie at, and to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whenſoever. For though the times then were ſuch, that no Parliament could be had (the reaſon whereof I well perceived, and underſtood) yet I did not believe that the ſtate of thoſe times would continue long, whatſoever the alteration ſhould be. And the ground &amp; reaſon of my conjecture did not faile me.</p>
            <p>Now to crave humble leave to ſpeak ſomewhat of the matter in generall, although but briefly in compariſon of that which might be ſaid, I doe thus conceive of it. There is nothing dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God then his ſacred Word, and the ſaving of ſoules, for which the Son of God was incarnate, and ſuffered ſhame &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and a cruell death. Now when once the true Religion is eſtabliſhed in a Nation, the planting and propagating of it is of all religious cauſes the next in order by the neceſſity of juſt

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118306:4"/>
conſequence. For otherwiſe, we make our ſelves unworthy of ſo great a benefit, and at length we hazard the loſſe of it. As for this our Nation, it hath abounded in wealth and peace hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that of a very long time together, through the great and rich bleſſing of God upon it. Wherefore it is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that in all that peaceable time, a pious learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery hath not been planted, and ſetled throughout the Land, as it might and ought to have been. For this cauſe eſpecially, as I in my conſcience am perſwaded, is the wrath of God incenſed, and ſtirred up againſt the Land. Other ſins there are very great, and many, even a multitude and heape of them. But the neglect and contempt of the Word of God in this kinde, overthroweth all in the foundation. Under correction, it may ſeeme to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ground of publick proceeding in the late lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warre. Which I could declare more particularly, if I thought it convenient. Sure I am, if we refuſe to plant our own, and the onely true Religion, when God giveth time and meanes to doe it, our conſciences, if we aske them, will tell us, that we doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deſerve to be plagued with the contrary. It is Gods exceeding great mercy, &amp; forbearance, that the true Proteſtant Religion (which we praiſe, and profeſſe) is not utterly taken from us a good while agoe, and the Antichriſtian placed, and ſet up in the roome thereof. Wee have wanted neither time nor means to do the will of God in this kinde, but we have wanted love and good will to ſtirre us up thereunto. If we have found and known the ſweetnes of the Word of God in our ſelves, and for our own particulars, how is it that we have not earneſtly ſought to communicate it to others? <hi>When thou art converted,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>convert thy Brother.</hi> It is extreame cruelty, thus to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſoules of our Brethren, and Neighbours, which ought to be as deare unto us as our owne. He liveth not the life of a Chriſtian, but a dead, dull, uncomfortable being he hath in this world, whatſoever he is, that enjoyeth not the benefit of the word of God duely preached &amp; taught in the dayes of ſolemne Aſſemblies, I meane, the Sabbath dayes in the publique Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, according to the Ordinance and appointment of God. There is nothing under heaven that may be compared to the benefit thereof. It is the eaſe and releaſe of all weekly labour, all worldly ſorrow, miſery and trouble. And in ſome degree it is a lively repreſentation of the Kingdome of heaven, where the

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118306:4"/>
Pſalme-ſingers, the holy Saints and Angells are filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy &amp; gladneſſe by their continuall beholding of the glorious preſence of God, and giving him thankes and praiſes: As it is written in the booke of the <hi>Pſalmes; In thy preſence is the fulneſſe of joy, and at thy right hand there is pleaſure for evermore.</hi> I will ſhortly conclude this point, with a briefe recicall of that which was uttered at the Councell, or rather the Conſpiracy of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is well knowne that that Councell was packt and plotted for the Pope. Nevertheleſſe, there were divers grave, learned, judicious, and religious men convened therein, and no great favourers of the Pope. Amongſt whom the Biſhop of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> ſitting as Ambaſſadour for his Maiſter the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſpake thus; <hi>I have heard it often ſaid, that if there were yet but one ſoule to be ſaved</hi> (ſuppoſing that the propitiation for ſins were not throughly made as it is) <hi>Chriſt would deſcend againe and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Wherefore,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I marvaile with what Conſcience the Pope can give himſelfe any reſt, having the cure of ſo many Churches lying upon him, and no courſe taken to diſcharge the ſame.</hi> Thus ſpake he according to the common error and opinion of the deluded Princes and people of thoſe times, as touching the unlimited power and juriſdiction of the Pope over all Churches: The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof were eaſie to be made in regard of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſolate and unprovided Churches in this our Land, but I omit it for brevity ſake, humbly referring it, to all pious, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſerious, and religious conſideration. For the longer that this matter is deferred, the more pernitious it is to the State. God never yet left the contempt of his holy word, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſtery thereof unrevenged, nor never will.</p>
            <p>From hence I ſhall humbly crave leave to deſcend to the third, and laſt particular, which I had in mine intention to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſaid late King, that is to ſay, for the working of the works of mercy and charity towards the poore, in a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſort, anſwerable to his regall eſtate, and in ſome degree to the exigency of the people. For otherwiſe, as for the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of ſmall ſummes of money at certaine times, we know there was an ordinary courſe ſetled in the office of the Kings Almoner. About a yeare or two agoe, I heard of ſomewhat that was intended by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be done in this kinde within the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> Which gives me the greater encouragement to ſpeake and treate of the matter here. I would not preſſe this

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118306:5"/>
duty to the preſent State in theſe ſo chargeable times, but that I know moſt aſſuredly how it may be moſt eaſily and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently performed, notwithſtanding any taxes or payments now already impoſed upon the people, or ever likely to be impoſed. It may be done in a privative way, &amp; in a poſitive. In this place I ſhall onely inſiſt upon the privative, for the encreaſe of the workes of charitie, by ſubſtracting and taking away from the works of ſuperfluitie, vanity, and overflowing wickedneſſe. My moſt humble and earneſt requeſt now therefore is, that a ſtrong permanent Act, may be framed and put forth againſt the pride of apparell. As I conceive it, the pride of this Land will be the deſtruction thereof, if it be not timely repreſſed: It is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, that I ſuppoſe the divine juſtice of God cannot beare it. Let not my fancy or folly be objected againſt me in this caſe, but let the matter be examined by the Word of God, which is the rule of truth. In the third Chap. of the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> there is a particular enumeration and recitall of thoſe proud faſhions and geſtures which were uſed among the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in thoſe dayes. If any man ſhould goe about to doe the like among us, as the Prophet doth there, he would ſeeme to trifle and to deale abſurdly and ridiculouſly. But the Spirit of God doth not trifle, neither is any Word of God idle or vaine. If any man ſhould doubt whether the eye and obſervation of God were ſo upon all the actions of men and women on earth, as to mark and take notice what apparell they weare, and what geſture of body they uſe, he might be ſatisfied in it by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall of that place of Scripture. In the end and cloſe whereof there is no leſſe puniſhment threatned, then the deſtruction of the Land. And did God ſo hate the pride of women in thoſe dayes, and will he tolerate it now in the people of this our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If the miſery of a civill warr (which did manifeſtly threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our deſtruction) cannot ſerve to bring downe our pride, how, doe we thinke, ſhould God deale with us? For in reſpect of our obſtinate rebellion, and diſobedience, we doe none other in the effect, then make this the queſtion: Whether we ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit to God, and feare before him as we ought, or that he ſhould yeeld to us, to give us leave to live, and doe as we liſt? <hi>Doe we provoke him to anger,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, are we ſtronger then he? And both in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that if they will not turne and repent upon

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118306:5"/>
his firſt chaſtiſing of them, he will encreaſe their plagues ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more. Our bleſſed Saviour in his divine Sermon upon the Mount, pronounceth them bleſſed that are mercifull, as it is in the ſixt Chapter of the Goſpel of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew, Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercy.</hi> If they are bleſſed that are mercifull, then they are curſed that are unmercifull, and cruell. It is a true inference, and it is <hi>Englands</hi> caſe concerning alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, and the reliefe of the poore. In the proud carriages of men in theſe dayes, and their vaine, fooliſh, and gariſh attire, as there is a bold audacious preſuming againſt God himſelfe (for it is done in his ſight) ſo moreover there is a mercileſſe, cruell perſecuting of the poore, whoſe eyes cannot but behold it, to the griefe of their hearts: according to that ſaying; <hi>The poore are perſecuted in the pride of the ungodly.</hi> I know there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other ungodly, and uncharitable wayes of miſſpending the good gifts and bleſſings of God in the world, beſides the vanity of apparell. But I inſiſt upon this, becauſe I hold it for the moſt generall &amp; expenſive way. Concerning my poore and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſelfe, I declare my conſcience in this reſpect: I would not deſire to be the Planter of wood, no, nor of the Word of God it ſelfe, without exerciſing the works of mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and charity to the poore, according to that ability and meanes, which God ſhould pleaſe to put into my hands: Conſidering how the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trinity was content to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe poore, that he might enrich others, and how the diffinitive ſentence of abſolution and condemnation ſhall goe upon it at the laſt day. It is not Popery to relieve the poore, as ſome are pleaſed to account it now adayes: It is pride, covetouſneſſe, and cruelty, not to doe it. No man poſſibly can know aright how to give almes, or to doe any good worke whatſoever, ſave one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true Proteſtant, who beleeveth, and knoweth that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life, and glory, are already purchaſed by the death and merit of Chriſt, and therefore good workes muſt be done to the glory of God, and Chriſt, to teſtifie our faith in him, and our love to him, who hath ſo loved us, that <hi>he gave himſelfe a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and ranſome for our ſins.</hi> Theſe things I am bould to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe I hold my ſelfe bound thereunto in the behalfe of God, and for the publique ſafety of the Land, that the loving favour of God may reſt upon it.</p>

I might enlarge this Diſcourſe to a very great length, but I will rather abridge it. In the firſt Covenant that came forth from the Parliament divers yeares agoe, this reaſon was given of all the common calamitie that hath befallen us, namely this, that <hi>we have not received Chriſt into our hearts:</hi> And I doe verily believe it to be ſo. For if the love of Chriſt had been ſhed abroad in our hearts, it would have kept us from thoſe great, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold tranſgreſſions, which we now ſtand guilty of: It would have led us into all good wayes, and learned us to keepe his Commandements. Nothing in the world would have been ſweeter, and dearer to us. Since I knew this world (in which I have lived a long time) I never heard the name of Chriſt ſo much in the mouths of men as it is now adayes, and hath been of late yeares. That great, and holy, and excellent Name is worthy to be mentioned, and had in honour, and to be exalted, and magnified at all times, and in all places throughout the world. But God grant we may have him in our hearts as well as in our mouths, leaſt otherwiſe our deepe hypocriſie ſhould be diſcovered at the laſt, and we be found to have collogued with the world, and dealt untruly with God. <hi>Amor ſi eſt, mira operatur; ſi operari renuit, amor non eſt.</hi> The love of Chriſt, if it be in us indeed, will conſtraine us to doe thoſe good things, which will ſeeme ſtrange unto the world: but if we refuſe to propound him to us as an enſample, that we may tread in his ſteps, how then abideth his love in us? If we have yet received Chriſt into our hearts, or if we will yet receive him, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſure, the things that I have here propoſed will be readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto, and put in due execution: Wherefore I will not doubt of the integrity, and ſinceritie of the Superiour Powers under which we live, but that they will ſet themſelves with all faithfulneſs and diligence to doe the will of God in all things. It was the voyce of an envious malignant Papiſt, namely, the Cardinall <hi>Matheolangi,</hi> that was heard in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſpeaking thus to ſome of his intimate friends, as concerning <hi>Luther: That Luthers demands, and his vehement complaints againſt the abuſes of the Court of Rome were juſt, and reaſonable; but that a poore Fryar ſhould reforme all, this was not to be endured.</hi> I am not ſo jealous of my poore credit in the world, but I can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be neglected, and deſpiſed of all that are of it, of all that

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118306:6"/>
are in it, ſo that God may vouch ſafe to have reſpect unto me, as to one that deſireth to feare his Name in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to ſeeke his glory, and the good of his people. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Monarchy were ſtill on foote, and in place, and power, yet nevertheleſſe I would be bold to affirme thus much, being able to prove it: that if this State and Common-wealth ſhall be preſerved from ruine and deſtruction, it muſt be by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Parliaments, in ordaining good, and wholeſome Lawes, and not onely ſo, but ſeeing them put in due, and ſtrict execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partly by imitating the office of Cenſorſhip among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> whereof we read in their Hiſtory. I will ſhut up all with little more then the recitall of a very briefe ſaying in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> but ſomewhat pertinent, as I ſuppoſe, to theſe proud, licentious, and luxurious times in which we live: <hi>It is not ſo hard to refute Heretiques, as to reforme vices.</hi> Religion will decay and dye where diſſolutenes of manners is not repreſſed and kept downe. It is not any ſingular, cenſorious conceit of mine, but a common complaint, that the pride of this Land was never ſo great as now. I am ſure, it is ſuch, and ſo great, that it cryeth for Judgement, True it is, we enjoy great peace, and quietneſſe at this day, being farre above, and contrary to our deſert. Nevertheleſſe, I hould it a cleare caſe, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that by reaſon of thoſe great, and ſtrange alterations, which have lately happened in our Land, we doe live as yet, but in a controverted divided State: And it is impoſſible to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and ſtabliſh it by any other way, ſave onely by repenting (without hypocriſie) for the fore-paſſed time, and now hence forward walking humbly with God, holding cloſe with him, and working the workes of piety, and charity, and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his glory: Becauſe his loving kindnes, and goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and our late Anceſtors, and Predeceſſors, hath been exceeding great, but we all have been unfaithfull, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, abuſing our long peace, neglecting his glory, and our owne, and others Salvation, reſolutely provoking his wrath. Wherefore God alſo hath as reſolutely revenged his own cauſe by drawing out money, and bloud in abundance; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>I ſet every man againſt his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he the ſame God can and will yet further by one meanes or other, avenge himſelfe, and will doe it like a God indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118306:7"/>
if we deale ſtoutly, perverſly, or deceitfully with him. <hi>Who ever waxed feirce againſt him, and proſpered?</hi> So ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And againe, it bringth in God thus ſpeaking of himſelfe; <hi>I the Lord am he that ſearcheth the reines, and the heart.</hi> There is no State in the world, but is ſubject to alteration: not any people more apiſh, more ridiculous, more fickle, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant then a ſort of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> There is no ſtability to be found in the world, nor in the minds of men. It is onely found, and founded in God, who alone is immovable, immutable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be honoured, and magnified throughout the world, having freely reconciled it to himſelfe, in a wonderfull, ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, by the death of his onely begotten Sonne; In whoſe hands is our life, and our breath, who is bleſſed for ever. As long as I live I will ſeeke the honour of his Name, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blaſpheme it, and will endeavour my ſelfe to ſhew forth his praiſe: <hi>For his loving kindnes is better then the life it ſelfe,</hi> even as <hi>David</hi> ſaith: Conſider we then on the contrary part, what his anger, and diſpleaſure is. And let not mortall, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched creatures, poore ſilly wormes, and vermin, be preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous out of meaſure, leaſt their breath be ſuddenly ſtopt, and then they rue it to all eternity. For there is ſomewhat to be feared that is worſe then the fire of Hell, if a true Saint, and Servant of God were not infinitely deceived in ſo ſaying, who yet, without queſtion knew very well, and throughly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what he ſpake, and ſaid in that point: <hi>Multi gehennam cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt eſſe extremum omnium malorum; at ego è contrà <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Woe unto thoſe ſoules that ſhall one day experience it in themſelves. The mercifull and gratious Lord preſerve this our State from being deepe in that condemnation of offending Chriſt, and provoking that moſt holy One either by words or deeds.</p>
