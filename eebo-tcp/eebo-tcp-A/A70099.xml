            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But I deſire you, my moſt honourable and deare children, to conceive of me aright, and be not deceived with vaine and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhowes and worldly pompe; For my glory is internall and heavenly, more ſplendent then the pure gold of more curious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderers, which no eye can ſee, but that Divine eye of right
<pb facs="tcp:54411:4"/>
which is given you of your Father. For I teſtifie unto you, that I am not to be conſidered by the pompe and glory of the world, nor yet by the wiſedome of the wiſe man, or by the nature of fleſh and blood, for thoſe are not heavenly, but earthly ſenſuall and diveliſh, and doe not, cannot, nor will not pleaſe God, but conceive you me to be heavenly, ſpirituall. and divine, ſuch as your Father hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed me to be.</p>
            <p>A mountaine, even Mount Zion, a City, the City of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the celeſtiall Jeruſalem, filled with the ſocietie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Angels, and the aſſembly of the firſt borne, which are written in heaven, and with the preſence of God in Trinitie ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Throne, Judge of all, and with the unity and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſpirits of juſt and perfect men, made perfect with that individuall union which they have with Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the New Testament, and with the blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things then that of <hi>Abel,</hi> even the remiſſion of ſinnes to the imputation of righteouſneſſe for juſtification of ſinners, for he came to ſave ſinners, by drawing ſinners, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And I pray you ſhake of all carnall apprehenſions of mee, and conceive me to be really ſuch in nature and condition as my Lord hath revealed me by the mouth of his bleſſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Peter, 1 Pet. 2.</hi> affirming mee to bee a ſpirituall houſe or temple, <hi>1 Pet. 2. 5.</hi> built and compact of living ſtones, made a ſpirituall houſe a holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, who is my foundation that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtone, on whom I am built, though hee be diſallowed of men, yet choſen of God and precious.</p>
            <p>Neither ſuppoſe me to bee a politique body, compoſed of a temporall head or ſoveraigne Monarchy, or a Nationall and poſitive lawes and cuſtomes (which though they bee ordained of God, yet in ſubſtance they are humane inventions and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men) nor conſiſting of civill and humane Magiſtrates, endewed with morall gifts and vertues for the externall government, power and poſteritie of humane ſocieties, politique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſely providing for the defects of depraved nature, and preventing the dammage, danger and ruine, which the malice of Satan and the corrupt nature of man, would draw upon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men in their terreſtriall abode. Though I bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:54411:4"/>
called a Kingdome in reſpect of my eternall King, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and of his divine ſpirituall power and heavenly dominion, which never ſhall have end: Yet am I never any where in Scripture deſcribed to bee a temporall or earthly Kingdome. But on the contrary, my Lord did plainly affirme and teach, that his kingdome was not of this world,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 26. Math. 20. 25.</note>
 and prohibited the ſubjects of his kingdome to take dominion and government upon them one over another, nor ſet up a Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie among them, as the Princes and Lords of the world did, whoſe manner is to thirſt after preheminence and dominion, but that in his divine kingdome, hee that would be the greateſt, ſhould be the leaſt, and hee that ſhould be found to take moſt diligent labour and paines in miniſtration of his divine Word and food of life, ſhould bee eſteemed a faithfull ſervant to his Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>But conſider me as I am the miniſter and diſpenſator of God, to whom is committed the Adminiſtration of that hidden myſterie of God, which was promiſed ſince the world began, it was hid from all ages, <note place="margin">Col. 1. 26. 27.</note>
but now in theſe latter dayes made manifeſt to his Saints, To whom God would make knowne what is the riches of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Myſtery among the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Which riches is Chriſt in you the hope of glory, and Chriſt is the Image of the inviſible God, the firſt begotten of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that Word by whom all things were created in heaven and in earth, and he is before all things, and in him all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and he is the head of the body of the Church, hee is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the firſt begotten of the dead, that in all things hee might have the preheminence, for it pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſſe ſhould dwell, And through peace made by the blood of that his Croſſe to reconcile to himſelfe through him (even through Chriſt) all things, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth.<note place="margin">Col 1. 15. 16. 18. 19.</note>

Therefore I requeſt you to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your conſideration the heavie burdens grievous to bee borne, (which the Scribes and Phariſees of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretended to fit in <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſeat) have laid upon my ſhoulders: the Epiſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall waight whereof you my ſonnes have heretofore borne, with much griefe, whilſt they advanced themſelves to the chiefe ſeates and moſt eminent dignities, loving to be reputed great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rabbies, even above you the naturall Peeres and Potentates of State.</p>
            <p>And now I conclude, and doe offer unto your ſacred conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the holy Sinode of the Apostles, ſet forth for a perfect patterne of all Counſells and Eccleſiaſticall cauſes.

Their conſultation was according to the rule of the written Word, there concluſion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was thus; It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us to lay no more burden upon you then theſe things neceſſarie.

And the Divine reaſons why God uſed no Sacramentall ſignes, nor figurative Sacrifices was, for that <hi>Adam</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity had not altogether forgot that Divine light of life, which hee was endued with in his creation, though hee had newly loſt the poſſeſſion thereof, yet he was more capable of inſpiration, then the next generations were, who had ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered even the light of nature by multiplying their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: And this was a principall cauſe why they lived in this age above 960.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Why God ſhortned the dayes of mans life.</note>
But in the ſecond age God did not onely for their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth of ſinfulneſſe cut ſhort the dayes of man, but hee alſo did chooſe himſelfe a people from the loynes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and renewed unto him the promiſe of his bleſſed ſeed, and made him a great Nation and Church unto himſelfe, and to this Church and people God gave Sacramentall ſignes to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from all other Nations to be his owne, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them Statutes, Lawes, and ordinances to inſtruct them as under a Schoolemaſter, and by ſignes to lead them unto the ſpirituall power, and efficacie of the Incarnation of Chriſt and his death unto the remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But it is undeniable and manifeſt, that hee required no other manner of worſhip and ſervice of them, then hee did of the firſt people, for God is unchangeable in his nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot nor will not have any other kinde of worſhip: but one ſimple pure worſhip of praiſe, prayer, and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and feeding of this worſhip with the plaine miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his promiſed word of life preached unto them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The reaſon why the ſecond age was clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note>
But why was this ſecond age burthened with ordinances and figures? becauſe this age was drowned with the growth of ſinne, and incapable of light, for ſinne by the law became more raging and ſinfull; and the law was weak, and could not prevaile with man becauſe of ſinne, for mans ſinfulneſſ:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54411:14"/>
was ſo great, that the ſpirit of the law which is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, could not dwell in fleſh and blood but it muſt be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for this cauſe the law became death unto man, and man, by the law became dead: for the law did not onely reprove, but condemne. But in this third age the righteouſneſſe of the law became incarnate, and was made man, that man might be made the righteouſneſſe of the law: Thus that Chriſt, who was promiſed to the firſt age, is become our righteouſneſſe: ſo that now the ſpirit is communicated in a fuller meaſure, and more evident and powerfull then it was unto the Jewes in figurative types and ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And this is the reaſon why all things are become more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and God will have his worſhip now to be known to be onely ſpirit and truth; for through him we are become new creatures unto God the Father, created in Chriſt, not to a new worſhip, but to the ſame worſhip more pure and perfectly to worſhip in ſpirit then heretofore.</p>
               <p>The reaſon (why Chriſt would inſtitute no other worſhip, nor allow none to be true-worſhippers; <note place="margin">Why Chriſt did inſtitute no new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and practiſed the old.</note>
but thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in ſpirit and truth, ſimply, plainly, and nakedly, is extracted from Gods owne Eſſentiall nature, God is a ſpirit, and therefore will be worſhip'd in ſpirit and truth. Alſo God is one ſimple pure ſpirituall Eſſence, therefore he will have no invention, nor no mixture of any Rites, Ceremonies, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations but plaineneſſe. And againe, God will with the ſimple plaineneſſe of his worſhip and preaching confound the wiſedome and ſuperſtitious curioſity of man, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note>
for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption of man not ſavouring nor diſcerning the beauty and ſweetneſſe of ſpirituall things, <note place="margin">Why man ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to invent new worſhip.</note>
doth out of a ſlaviſh feare and ſuperſtitious curioſity, ſeeke a will-worſhip of his owne invention which God hates; But the enlightned ſoule ſees moſt heavenly and glorious delights in the plaine and ſimple miniſtration of Gods word; for the minde not ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the outward forme and ſignes of the myſteries: ſhee flies with the wings of Divine ſpeculations into the preſence of God and his Angels, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith ſpeaking of the ſoule. We have a ſiſter (ſaith hee) among us, unto whom is given the gift of Revelation, in the middeſt of Divine Service, ſhe

is eaſt into an extaſie, ſhe is brought into the company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſometimes into the preſence of the Lord himſelfe. Againe, according to the Scriptures that are read, the Pſalmes that are ſung, the Sermons that are made, and prayers which are offered: new matter of viſion is adminiſtred and offered unto her.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe that have not this ſpirituall ſence, and eye to taſte and ſee how good and gracious the Lord is, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how beautifull his Tabernacles are, <note place="margin">The firſt in-let of ſet prayers compiled into a Service-book</note>
they think it was the ignorance or poverty of the age that ſuffered the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and his miniſtration to be clad in ſuch baſe and meane array and cloathing, and comparing her to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pomp of Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhip, they were aſhamed to ſhow the Church in ſuch plaine roabes before the Gentiles and Iewes; therefore every Metropolitane after the Nicene Counſell having got the ſole government into their hands, deviſed ſome ſentences out of the Scripture to beautifie the ſervice and the Sacraments, and ſome rites and ceremonies to correſpond both with Iew and Gentile in ſerving God; All which things though at the firſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters had a good intent, and the words and rites carried a glorious ſhow of holineſſe; yet becauſe they were not the things that God ordained, nor thought fit to be done or to have done in his ſervice and miniſtration: <note place="margin">Mans inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is of dangerous conſequence to the Church.</note>
therefore they brought forth in the end a malignant effect both in worſhip and Doctrine, Idolatry and Superſtition with damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies in the end; which the firſt Inventers never dreamed of.</p>

It is profitable for us to obſerve that <hi>Adam</hi> by his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, loſt neither the natural faculties of his ſoule, nor the honour and dignity of his birth-right and dominion though at the firſt, (by loſing that breath of life which was the light and life of his ſoule, and that made him the perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God) they were weakened and blemiſhed in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. For if he had loſt his naturall faculties, hee had loſt the forme of his being, and if his birth-right and dignity of dominion had beene aboliſhed before it had beene conferred
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54411:17"/>
upon another, then ſhould nature have been deprived of the miniſtration of judgement, Juſtice, and equity, which would have brought forth an utter diſſolution of the whole genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man; But after the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their dignity and birth-right of dominion by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying tranſgreſſion, then God the Father conferred the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence thereof upon the Sonne of Man (even Chriſt) that he might conſecrate and appoint, whom it ſeemed good unto him to ſit upon his temporall Throne, ſo that birth-right and preheminence might be his in whom all fulneſſe dwelt.

               <p>Thus the Regall power of Princes is derived from Chriſt by the rule of divine ordination in nature, (for he that is the Author of nature, is the obſerverr and preſerver of all the ordinances in nature) ſo that this royall office is reſtored to man by ordination in Chriſt; But the prieſtly and propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office man hath from God by union and communion with Chriſt, and by inſpiration and ſupernaturall donation through the holy Ghoſt; For this cauſe a Tyrant may bee a lawfull King by ordination of God, yet no Chriſtian member of Chriſt.</p>

               <head>Difference betwixt Regall ordination and Divine power.</head>
               <p>From hence we may extract an evident difference betwixt the power of royall ordination in nature, and the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of God which is given to his Church on earth; That is a miniſteriall power to diſtribute Judgement, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and equity amongſt men, with abſolute power of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action to puniſh actuall offences, with corporall or pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puniſhment upon body, lands, and goods. This other is a ſupernaturall power and divine efficacy properly given to the elect of God by inſpiration, whereby they have union and communion with Chriſt, and one with another for every ones owne particular prerogative of ſon ſhip, and for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication one of another, and to ſome men it is given in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

manner, and a greater meaſure of divine power and gifts, for the miniſtration, writing, teaching, and preaching of the Word and Sacraments of God, which is that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God to the antient Prophets, and that which was taught by Chriſt, and after written by the Spirit of God, from the pen and mouth of the Apoſtles; And this power is a miniſteriall power, mighty in operation to bind and looſe the conſcience, to open and ſhut heaven and hell, by declaring the judgement of God againſt unpentient ſinners, and his mercy in Chriſt to the penitent man, as he hath taught and revealed; for this power doth not follow the judgement and will of man, nor ſucceſſion of profeſſion, but is tyed and limited to the power of the Word and will of God; Therefore what they bind on earth by this miniſteriall power, Chriſt bindes in heaven by his abſolute power. By this there is no power of coaction given to the Church over the body, nor purſe, nor life, but onely over the ſoule and conſcience, and to rule by inſtruction, admonition, and correction. <note place="margin">Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to cut ſin by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall is to pull it up by the rootes.</note>

For no Kingdome nor Common-wealth can be bleſſed, which doth not entertaine the true Church of God in her boſome, or in which the Church is not involved; For this cauſe God doth make good Kings a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his people, and commands his Saints to pray for Kings, Princes, and Governours, that they may lead a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and happy life under them, and that there his Goſpell may have a free paſſage; And ſo Kings and Princes become nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers; And in this combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt Church and Common-wealth, righteouſneſſe and peace doe kiſſe each other.

then they are ſent for a puniſhment and ſcourge of God to the the people, and when God hath whipped his people, then he burnes his roddes with judgements.

juſtice, and equity, is the Divine nature and holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>For as the nature of God is ſtrong and mighty full of pitty and compaſſion, ſlow to anger, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth, whoſe purity of nature expelleth and conſumeth every impure and imperfect thing, even ſo doth God require his King ſhould be like unto him on earth, as he is in heaven, for he hath ſet none above him on earth. Therefore as God is in purity of eſſence a law unto himſelfe, and a conſuming fire of evill, ſo ought a King in his politique capacity to be a law unto himſelfe by conforming himſelfe in a ſpirituall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation to the nature of God in purity of juſtice, puniſhing the evill and cheriſhing the good.</p>

               <p>And as the eternall law of God is the begotten Counſell of the Trinity in the Deity, ſo are the lawes politique the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten Counſell of a politique Trinity which is the Soveraign, the Nobles and Magiſtrates, and the Councell of Commons, reſembling the Divine Trinity in Unity, the indiviſible ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a Kingdome; So that Kings are by this pattern and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54411:19"/>
rule bound to keepe the lawes of their Kingdomes inviolate, and to doe all things by their lawes, as God doth all things by his word: And this is the greateſt prerogative of a King, that he keepe his owne lawes freely without compulſion like God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe as the holy Ghoſt is the univerſall Miniſter and Divine Diſpenſator of all divine powers, gifts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne; even ſo are the Peeres, Princes, Judges, Magiſtrates, and Miniſters of Juſtice in a Common-wealth, proceeding from the King and his lawes: The univerſall Miniſters of the Royall powers and lawes of the Kingdome. For though they be many as members in diverſity of Diſpenſation of Juſtice, Judgement, and equity of the lawes, yet are they all but as one ſpirit of the body politique, as the ſpirit of God being one, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diverſity of Adminiſtrations properly called the ſeaven ſpirits before the throne of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. And as the individuall unity of this diſtinct Trinitie is the ſubſiſtence of the God-head; Even ſo is the unity of the King with his Lawes, and his Princes and Magiſtrates, the ſubſiſtence of a body politique or Common-wealth; Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Judgement and Juſtice is the eſtabliſhment of the Throne. For this ſimilitudes ſake, Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates are called Gods: I have ſaid, ſaith the Lord, yee are Gods, but yee ſhall die like men, for they are in all things to bee in their Common-wealth as God himſelfe; Therefore wee are taught to pray, Thy will, O God be done on earth as it is in heaven, that Kings may rule by thee, and Princes decree Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on earth as thou doſt in heaven.</p>

So is divine and ſupernaturall power derived from Chriſt, not onely as he is the firſt begotten Son of God, but alſo as he is the light and life of man, without whom man cannot be a living ſoule, and as he is the eternall Mediatour betwixt God and man, that promiſed ſeed, the Redeemer of the Elect of God, the predeſtinated Lambe, ſlaine from before the ſounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, for the remiſſion of ſinnes, their ordained King, Prieſt, and Prophet, of God the Father in a ſpirituall and more peculiar manner, and meaſure of myſticall union and communion, then either can be, or ever was, or ever ſhall be in all the ordinances of God in nature, For this cauſe that all men might know that he was, and is, the ſpirituall King of Glory, and that he came not into the world to deprive Kings and Princes of their ſubordinate power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: therefore he told them plainly, that his kingdome was not of this world, <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 26.</note>
and he told his Apoſtles that among them there ſhould bee no ſuch government or dominion in his Church, as the Princes have on earth among men, <note place="margin">Math. 20. 25, 26.</note>
but the chiefeſt among them ſhould be he that tooke the moſt paines to ſerve the reſt with food of life.</p>
               <p>The Church is called a kingdome, becauſe as in earthly kingdomes Kings and Princes have power by their politique lawes over the bodies, goods, and lives of men: for their wealefull being on earth to the glory of God: ſo in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome Chriſt onely and abſolutely from the Father through

And God hath ſaid touch not mine annointed, and doe my Prophets no harme; For this cauſe (in this ſigne of the Church) there is ſaid to proceed out of the Throne light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and thunders, and voyces, becauſe God doth puniſh the wicked horribly for the Churches ſake: none can eſcape his hands, that oppreſſe his Saints, for the Lord will roare out of Sion, and will put forth his voyce out of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>A ſecond ſort of gifts are inward graces of Sanctification expreſſed in this viſion by ſeven Lampes of fire burning before the Throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God, which is the internall ſanctification of Gods Spirit filling every ſoule with gifts like oyle of grace, and fire of zeale to burne with praiſes before the Throne; Like to the lampes in the Temple, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27, 20. by ſeven, ſignifying by a definite number, manifold gifts indefinite.</p>
               <p>Next are outward gifts, which are allegorically called a ſea of glaſſe before the Throne like Cryſtall, which expreſſeth the ſpirituall pure and unſpotted worſhip of God, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his Word as tranſparent to the eye of the inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mind, as Cryſtall glaſſe is to the eye of the body, through which the Saints may ſee the glory and majeſty of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus. As this worſhip is pure without any ſpot of mans invention, and conſiſts (as in the firſt tract is ſaid) of prayer, praiſe and thankes, ariſing and alwayes nouriſhed by the doctrine of the word of God, which the ſea doth ſignifie,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54411:21"/>
becauſe it is an Ocean of living waters pure like Cryſtall; This Sea therefore declares the whole worſhip of God. And in reſpect that the Saints inlightned by the holy Ghoſt are called burning Lampes, it is to them like a ſea of oyle to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and encreaſe their lights.</p>
               <p>Another outward gift is deſcribed to be foure Beaſts; And in the middeſt of the Throne, and round about the Throne were foure beaſts, the firſt like a Lyon, the ſecond a Calfe, the third a face like a man, the fourth like a flying Eagle, and their bodyes are full of eyes before and behind; Theſe are the miniſters and ſervants of God, who attend the miniſtration of the Word and Doctrine, and are placed betwixt the Throne and the Elders, as embaſſadours and meſſengers of God to his people, their place is in a neerer ſtation to the Throne then the Elders. They are compared to beaſts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their qualities, which is required for the conditions of the times and ſeaſons, as the ſtrength and courage of a Lyon, the patience of an Oxe, the prudence and wiſedome of a man, the Eagle-like contempt of earthly things, and ſharper ſight in ſpirituall and heavenly things.</p>
               <p>The number is foure, to double the number of the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> under the law, to anſwer the number of Elders, which is double to the twelve Patriarkes.</p>
               <p>Their bodyes are full of eyes behind and before, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes that ſharpneſſe of riches and underſtanding in divine things, wherewith they are inducd by the gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to diſcerne things paſt, things preſent, and things to come.</p>
               <p>Theſe beaſts each one of them hath ſixe wings placed round about them, and full of eyes within the wings; theſe wings are not for that uſe that the wings are to the beaſts in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#APEX" extent="5+ letters">

            <p>Therefore we may ſay the Word in the perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the unbegotten Word in the perſon of the Sonne, it is the begotten Word, and in the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, it is the proceeding Word. So that by the proceeding Word all things flow from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
            <p>By the order of this proceeding power the world was made by the word of God. As the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 33. 6. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoast of them by the breath of his mouth.</hi> By this proceeding power of the Word man was made a living ſoule, as <hi>Gen. 2. 7. And God breathed in his face the breath of life, and the man was a living ſoule;</hi> and <hi>Ioh. 1. 4. in it was life, and that life was the light of man, not naturall reaſon, but ſupernaturall light which inlightened nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this proceeding word <hi>Adam</hi> was reſtored after his fall, by promiſing to make the Word the ſeed of the Woman, and to breake the Serpents head. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for God by the proceeding of the Word, ſaying he will put enmity betwixt Satan (whoſe nature is wicked and evill altogether) and the humane generation or ſeed which Satan had made like
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54411:22"/>
himſelfe, he thereby promiſeth that by his proceeding Word, he would make his Word the feed of the Woman, whereby it ſhould be of a contrary nature to wickedneſſe, of a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure and holy nature and condition powerfull againſt Satan.</p>
            <p>Thus by the proceeding Word, the word (God) is made the word of promiſe, and the Promiſe is made life, and thus it comes to paſſe that the Juſt ſhall live by faith.</p>
            <p>By this proceeding word all the Elect of the Father are called, are ſanctified, are waſhed, are inſpired, and by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are made ſonnes of God, Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets, for by inſpiration of the proceeding Word, God the Word dwelleth in them, for in the proceeding Word, is both the begotten Word, and the unbegotten Word the Father, as Chriſt ſaith, my Father and I are one, and the proceeding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is one with the Father and the Sonne, ſo theſe three are one in themſelves, and beare record in heaven, and they alſo agree in one by inſpiration in the ſoules of the faithfull, or the Church which makes three to beare record on earth, as the water of Sanctification, and the blood of juſtification, and our ſpirit enlightned with the Spirit of God; it beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes and ſervants of God. For this cauſe the faithfull are called the Temple of the living God, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. as God hath ſaid, I will dwell among them and walke there, and I will bee their God, and they ſhall bee my people.</hi> Alſo, know yee not that your body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which yee have from God? Ye are not your owne, for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in body and in Spirit for they are Gods.</p>
            <p>As the proceeding Word hath proceeded by inſpiration to dwell in man, which is his internall miniſtration: ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth by externall miniſtration to divulge and write the ſame proceeding Word by the inſtrumentall pen and voyce of man for mans inſtruction, at firſt written by his Prophet <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and after by the reſt of Prophets and Apoſtles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts to feed and preſerve their holy faith &amp; worſhip of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54411:23"/>
God among the faithfull; As <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15. 16. Thou haſt knowne the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For the whole Scripture is given by inſpiration of God and is profitable to teach, to convince, to correct, to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the proceeding Word doth proportion it ſelfe to mans capacity, firſt it becomes the word of promiſe in the ſeed of the woman, then the inſpirated word to dwell in the mind, and alſo it is the miniſteriall Word, declared, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, taught, and preached for mans inſtruction, and all is one Word: for this cauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, we have a moſt ſure word of the Prophets, to which yee doe well, that yee take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, untill the day dawne, and the day ſtarre ariſe in your hearts, and from hence it is evident, that the Scripture is the very word of God, which proceedeth out of God by inſpiration, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall publiſhing, and writing the ſame, and the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word being the ſame proceeding word of God, (even God declared in writing.) The Scriptures therefore are the Fountaines of living water, and the ground of truth, for preaching, teaching, and inſtruction, exhortation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Scriptures are to be had in Divine eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for they containe the divine Word it ſelfe, and the Paſtors and teachers thereof (being thereunto called of God by a full meaſure of inſpiration) are to be eſteemed the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and Embaſſadours of God.</p>

            <p>This word of God not having beene after this order knowne and conſidered, hath beene the cauſe and occaſion of much miſtake and errours in the Church of God, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Word in the true nature and property of Gods order and manner of working, leadeth us by the hand from one gradation to another, and ſtoppeth the mouth of all men that ſpeake againſt the Scriptures and the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>For conſidering the word of God in theſe gradations we ſhall evidently perceive and underſtand, that the power and authoritie giuen and committed to the Church, is no other thing, but the proceeding word of God, miniſtring the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Word from the Father manifeſted in the fleſh, which miniſtration is two fold, internall by inſpiration through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, becauſe man is an intellectuall Spirit, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54411:24"/>
therefore a proper Tabernacle for the divine Word to dwell in; Alſo externall miniſtration, becauſe man dwells in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, earthly, and naturall tabernacle, therefore the holy Ghoſt applyeth himſelfe to mans infirmity, and doth uſe in his externall miniſtration, elementary, earthy, and naturall inſtruments by which as a meanes and ordinance the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Word, and the power thereof is daily communicated unto man both to ingraft him into the Word, and to nouriſh him in the Word unto everlaſting life; For this manner of externall miniſtration is neceſſary for man ſo long as hee dwelleth in this body or earthly houſe.</p>
            <p>The inſtruments which the holy Ghoſt doth uſe in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the miniſteriall Word, are either proper, as ſome members of the Church ſet apart for the worke of the miniſtery, or leſſe proper as the ſignes of the Sacraments. I may call thoſe the externall gifts which God gives to his Church, for it is ſaid that unto every one of us is given grace or the gifts of the Spirit, according to the meaſure of the gift in Chriſt. For wee may diſcerne the Church is a compact body knit to the head Chriſt, and conſiſteth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members, yet in unity of the ſpirit they are one body, and although there be but one Spirit, yet are there diverſities of gifts, diverſities of adminiſtrations, diverſities of operations, yet all one and the ſame ſpirit, and theſe diverſities of gifts, make diverſities of functions; So there are many functions in the Church, but God worketh all in all. But the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withall, but peculiar gifts without the which the Church cannot at any time be, and therefore moſt proper, of which it is ſaid that Chriſt aſcended on high, and lead captivity captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts to give unto men, as ſome to bee Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers. Here is to bee obſerved, that the divine power by internall diſpenſation is given in common to all, and every member of the Church, ſo that all have common intereſt in the word of God, and peculiar power thereby to admoniſh, comfort and inſtruct one another, and pray for one another, and beare one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54411:24"/>
anothers burdens, eſpecially they are all Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets in their Families. For every Father ought to uſe the office of an Elder in his houſe, <hi>Deut 6. 6, 7. Deut.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
            <p>But for the externall diſpenſation of the Word, the power and efficacy thereof is committed unto peculiar men, wherof Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, &amp; teachers, are in the firſt ranke and functions, and the power and efficacy which is given them, is onely the miniſtration of the Word, they have not that abſolute power which Chriſt hath, to know who are his from the beginning, and to have compaſſion, on whom he would have compaſſion, and to ſhew mercy, on whom hee would ſhow mercy. For Chriſt had not this abſolute power as he was the Son of man, but as he was the perſon of God; For as he was Man, he came not to do his owne will, but the will of his Father; So likewiſe when he ſent his Apoſtles and Diſciples to teach all Nations, he ſent them, as he was ſent of his Father. So ſend I you, ſaith he, which was not to doe their owne will, nor to teach their owne doctrine, but to do his will as he did his Fathers will, and to teach his doctrine which he taught them, as his Father taught him: ſo by the Word they are to do and teach, but nothing beſide the Word, or without the Word. More at large of this in the Treatiſe of Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the word of life is God in the perſon of the Father, the unbegotten Word, in the Sonne the begotten Word, and the incarnate Word, In the perſon of the Spirit it is the proceeding Word, and the miniſteriall Word, and this miniſteriall Word is the power, and the authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church; So the Miniſters cannot doe any thing but by the power of the Word, and this Word is Chriſt who abideth with them, and with the whole Church alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world; So Chriſt is the chiefe, and they are his ſervants and embaſſadours.</p>

               <note place="margin">The firſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the miniſtration of the Word.</note>
The firſt ordination of this miniſtration was inſtituted and practiſed by God himſelfe in Paradiſe, preaching unto <hi>Adam</hi> in a created voyce in the coole of the day, and by that meeke voyce Gods preſence was knowne unto man; <hi>I heard thy voyce and was afraid.</hi> The voyce or word of God (for it is a ſignificant voyce, making it ſelfe to be underſtood) howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God uſeth weake and deſpiſed inſtruments to expreſſe himſelfe to mans capacity, yet his voyce is mighty, as in the 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> Reade the whole Pſalme. <hi>For the voyce of the Lord is powerfull, the voyce of the Lord is full of Majeſty.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes it, it is mighty in operation, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing through, even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſoule and the ſpirit, and of the joynts and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; For this cauſe preaching is called the power of God unto ſalvation. But if the glorious beauty and power of Gods miniſtration ſeeme weake and fooliſh unto ſome men, becauſe it is miniſtred by the voyce of man, and the weake ſignes of the Sacraments being of no ſtrength nor beauty in themſelves, It is becauſe the glorious Goſpell is hid unto them that periſh, and becomes the ſavour of death unto death, becauſe the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that beleeve not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them.</p>
            <p>Theſe riches are ſent unto us of God (from the Father of lights by the Sonne, of the fulneſſe of all rich grace, through the Spirit the over-flowing waters of life and bleſſedneſſe) and we have it in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may appeare to be of God, and not of man, and thoſe that are ſent of God, are qualified with the word of God, and by having the Word, they are knowne to be ſene of God; For they teach and preach not themſelves, but Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, and approve themſelves meſſengers and ſervants to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54411:26"/>
the Saints for Jeſus ſake. For the word of God wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to conceive to be the eternall Sonne of God by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to proceed from God by ſpiration in creation, and to be communicated unto man ſince his fall by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſpiration, and united unto man, and man unto it by incarnation, and miniſtred unto man by externall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the Word deſcends unto man by inſpiration, and dwels in man through the Spirit, for the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is the Word, for the Word and the ſpirit cannot be divided nor ſeparated, they are one. For this cauſe God uſeth the externall miniſtration of his Word and Spirit, that he may inſpire and regenerate the mind of man. After this manner are the miniſters and meſſengers that are ſent of God indued with the Word and Spirit of God. Therefore let no man ſay that hee hath the Spirit, if hee want the light of the Word, neither can any man have the Word but by the Spirit, and the Word and Spirit are both made manifeſt in this, that they reveale the hid things of God, even the myſterie of God in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. 10. which in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. is called a full aſſurance of underſtanding in the knowledge of the myſterie of God in Chriſt, for he which commanded light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhines into the hearts of the Meſſengers, to give the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>As the externall Miniſtration cannot be without the Word and the Spirit, ſo the Church cannot bee without Miniſters and meſſengers of God, and as the miniſtration is publicke and externall, <note place="margin">Paſtors ought before their admiſſion to be well known to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations where they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerved, that nothing was to bee done in the Church, either by the Apoſtles, or by thoſe that in the miniſtration ſucceeded them, without the conſent of the whole Church, which then at firſt were called Diſciples.</p>

               <p>Touching the manner of their Ordination that we find in the firſt of the Acts, they prayed and ſaid; <hi>Thou Lord which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew which of theſe two thou haſt choſen, and then they gave forth lots, and the lot fell upon Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias.</hi> And alſo afterwards in the ſixt of the Acts, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Diſciples or brethren thoſe ſeven and ſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place of Scripture it is ſaid, the Diſciples ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed two, and left the choyce to God, and therefore they give forth lots, becauſe it was an extraordinary calling to an Apoſtleſhip to ſucceed <hi>Judas;</hi> But in the ſecond place it is ſaid, they choſe <hi>Srephin</hi> a man full of faith and the holy Ghoſt, and <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Prochorus,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that the Church received inſtruction from the

Theſe are the reſpects which ought to bee had in chooſing Paſtors, Deacons, and Governours in the Church; For all gifts of learning and humane Sciences, howſoever they be excellent and worthy much praiſe and honour, yet without theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of grace they are nothing, and not to be eſteemed.</p>

               <p>It is evident that the orders and degrees of Miniſters and Governours of the Church of God under the Law were Prieſts, Levites and Elders, God alſo ſending among them Prophets of extraordinary inſpiration, for revelation of the VVord to teach, admoniſh and exhort the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Prieſt. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 10.</note>
The Prieſts office was figurative, prefiguring Chriſt untill his comming, offering ſacrifices to figure the ſacrifice of his body, inſtructing the people in the promiſed ſeed unto the remiſſion of their ſinnes, whoſe manifeſtation in the fleſh ſhould be the accompliſhment of all figures and ſhadowes in the law, which thereby were abrogated.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Levite.</note>
The Levites were given unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> as an addition to his office, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. to miniſter unto him, to keepe his charge, and the charge of the whole Congregation to doe the ſervice, and to keepe the inſtruments of the tabernacle of the Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Elder.</note>
The Elders, (though every Father of a Family bee called Elder, and alſo the twelve tribes of <hi>Iacob)</hi> yet thoſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Elders who are choſen and appointed to be Governours and Rulers both in Church and Common-wealth. For the Governours in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> houſe were called Elders, and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54411:28"/>
Rulers in the Church, as firſt in the Tabernacle, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. and Temple were alſo called Elders. And the Lord ſtirred up Prophets among them both of the Levites and Prieſts, and others, as occaſion required, never leaving his Church without a Prophet and Rulers till <hi>Shilo</hi> came.</p>
               <p>And when that faithfull Prophet of God came into the world, whoſe effectuall power, and fulneſſe of all divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection aboliſhed all figures and darke reſembling ſhadowes, then in his owne perſon and humane preſence, hee ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the glad tydings of his glorious Goſpell, cauſing the light of his truth to ſhine evident without vaile or vizard, notwithſtanding he neither altered nor aboliſhed the order of miniſtration, nor the manner of government, but eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame by his owne example, and the practiſe of his Apoſtles. And therefore he ſaid that Chriſt when he aſcended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men, As <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4 11. he gave ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and Teachers.</p>
               <p>

In this place of Scripture he onely ſetteth forth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall functions in the Church, whereof the firſt paire, as namely Apoſtles and Evangeliſts were of immediate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and appropriated to the time, ordained by Chriſt, onely for the propagation and firſt progreſſion of the Goſpell, the gifts of prophecie and working of miracles, attending the confirmation of their doctrine; As the neceſſitie of thoſe times required, and as Chriſt had promiſed, <hi>Marke 16. 17, 18. And theſe ſignes ſhall follow them that beleeve in my Name: they ſhall caſt out devils, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly poyſon, it ſhall not hurt them, they ſhall lay their hands on the ſicke, and they ſhall recover.</hi>

The ſecond paire, are Paſtors and Teachers diſtinguiſhed by their ordination, for theſe were ordained internally by the outward diſpenſation of hearing the Word preached by the Apoſtles, then externally choſen by the Church, as <hi>Acts</hi> the ſixth, after conſecrated by the Apoſtles, by prayer, and laying on of hands of the Apoſtles and Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23.

Both theſe paires are but one and the ſame function and office, and have but one and the ſame Commiſſion, which was given by the immediate ordination of Chriſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For as God the Father ſent his beloved Sonne to bee a light unto the Gentiles, and the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in declaring unto them the glad tydings of ſalvation in his death unto the remiſſion of ſinnes. So Chriſt ſayd to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> John 20. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Authority committed.</note>
The power and authority committed unto them by this commiſſion is the breath of life, out of the mouth of Chriſt proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, as it is ſaid; <hi>Man lives not by bread onely, but by every word that proceedteh out of the mouth of God;</hi> Therefore he breathed on them and ſaid, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For the word which Chriſt ſpake or breathed out of his mouth, hee affirmed to be ſpirit and life, ſaying, <hi>John 6. The fleſh profiteth nothing, but the word that I ſpeake is ſpirit and life.</hi>

The ſubſtance of this Commiſſion is mandatory, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrinall part of their commiſſion, is teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and <hi>Marke</hi> 26. 15. hath it in theſe words; <hi>Preach the Goſpell to every creature.</hi> Now the ſumme of the doctrine, which Chriſt taught, is ſet downe more plainly by St. <hi>Luke. 24. 44. Theſe are the words that I ſpake unto you, whilſt I was yet with you, that all things muſt be fulfilled, which were written in the law, and the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes concerning mee. And he</hi> (who was ſpirit, life and light) <hi>opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that they might underſtand the Scriptures; and ſaid, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer and riſe from the dead the third day; And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Ieruſalem.</hi> And after this manner doe the Paſtors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters bleſſe, teach, and ſanctifie the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54411:29"/>
Thus Chriſt by preaching and teaching unto them the word of God, out of his mouth, he opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Scriptures, and thereby they received the holy Ghoſt, for this is Chriſts manner of breathing upon them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. when hee ſaid, <hi>receive yee the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But in <hi>Luke</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you;</hi> Which is to ſay, I will ſend a viſible token of the Spirit upon you, or the efficacie of the Spirit upon you. Therefore he ſayd, <hi>Tarry yee in the Citie of Ieruſalem, untill you bee endued with power from on high.</hi> Not but that they had received the holy Ghoſt before, but not the manifeſtation and evident power thereof, as afterwards it did fall upon them in the ſimilitude of fiery cloven tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The fruites and operative effects of miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſet forth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 23. Whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſinnes ye retaine, they are retained. For this is the power and efficacie of the miniſteriall Word (as hath beene formerly ſhowne) which floweth from the abſolute power of Chriſt, which was given unto him of the Father, as he affirmed to his Diſciples, <hi>Matt. 28. 18. All power is given me in heaven and in Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this miniſtration of the Goſpell is that key of <hi>David</hi> committed unto Chriſt, by which he ſhould open and no man ſhut, and ſhould ſhut, and no man ſhould open. And in the 16. of <hi>Matthew</hi> 16 17. &amp; 18. ver. it is evident, that this power of the keyes, is onely the power of the Goſpell of Chriſt, or rather as <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed the Lord Jeſus to bee that Chriſt, that Sonne of the living God, which he received not by the intelligence of fleſh and blood, but by Revelation from God the Father, this power changeth the whole cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature of man, and gives him another denomination or qualitie, making him a ſtrong and immoveable rock, turning <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Petra.</hi> Thus after this manner is the revelation and power of the Word, given in generall to every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the knowledge of Chriſt, to beleeve that he is that Chriſt, that Sonne of the living God, (God himſelfe) againſt this rocke the gates of hell, the powers and principalities of

But the particular and publicke miniſtration thereof, is committed to the Paſtors and teachers of the Church of God, by whoſe miniſtration and publicke diſpenſation of the Word, the hearts and conſciences of men are opened and ſhut, bound and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every day, as <hi>Lydia</hi> and others in the <hi>Acts,</hi> in which the Word becomes the ſavour of life unto ſome, and the ſavour of death unto others; And this miniſteriall power is alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them for divine cenſure and publicke correction, to roote out abominable and unſufferable vices in the Church and Congregations, as ſhall be ſhewed in his proper place.</p>

               <p>Under the Law it is undeniable, that the Miniſters and Governours of the Church, were called Prieſts, Levites, and Elders.

                  <note place="margin">The office of Elders.</note>
Now touching the particular dutie and office of Elders, which in this our age is taken in a corrupt and improper ſence calling them lay Elders, which in Scripture from the antient originall, are tearmed Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as to ſay, Elders of the Church of God, or of the people of God, to diſtinguiſh them from civill Elders and Governours: and they are either ſuch as by natures ordination are Fathers of Chriſtian families, or ſuch as are publickely choſen by the ſeverall Congregations of the Church, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by their Paſtors and Teachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:54411:32"/>
                  <note place="margin">Ambroſius.</note>
Their office and duties were ſuch, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe counſell nothing was done in the Church; and that both the Synagogue, and the Chriſtian Church had Elders; They were to be choſen men, ſuch as <hi>Jethro</hi> adviſed <hi>Moyſes, Exod.</hi> 18. choſen out of the people, men of courage, ſuch as feare God, men of truth hating covetouſneſſe, and place ſuch over the people to rule thouſands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. But theſe Elders are here rather to be for civill affaires then Church cares; But thus we muſt conceive that Church El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might as well be exerciſed in miniſtration of Juſtice for the Common-wealth, as in the miniſtration of Diſcipline for the Church. For this is the proper duty even of Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their Magiſtrates; as alſo of fathers of Families, becauſe the Common-weale of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is involved in the Church of God, and the Church of God in a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale; For ſo ought our Chriſtian Kingdomes to bee compoſed, as Magiſtrates may be choſen Church Elders in the Church of God. For bleſſed is the Nation, whoſe God is the Lord, <note n="*" place="margin">Thus the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in the Common-wealth, &amp; the Common-weale in the Church.</note>
And in ſuch a Kingdome Chriſt raigneth as a King in <hi>excelſis,</hi> and his Vice-roy by him, and for him, and the flouriſhing propagation of the miniſtery of the Word is the ſoule of ſuch a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A cleare diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Elders of the Church and Common-wealth.</note>
But there is an evident difference detwixt the Elders that governe the Common-wealth, and the Elders that governe the Church; Diſtinct they are in their ordination, and in their endowments, and in the manner of exerciſe, and execution of their office; For Magiſtrates and Elders in a Kingdome are thoſe who are appointed of the King or chiefe Governour, as in the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 13, 14. Submit your ſelves unto all ordinances of man for the Lords ſake, whether to Kings as ſuperiours, or to Governours as ſent of them, and their office is for puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well. And theſe are ſuch as <hi>Moyſes</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the counſell of <hi>Jethro</hi> before expreſt. But <hi>Moyſes</hi> by Gods expreſſe appointment did afterward ordaine other El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders choſen out of thoſe Elders, whom God indued with the ſpeciall gifts of his Spirit, for helping of <hi>Moyſes</hi> in governing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54411:32"/>
of the Congregation of the Tabernacle, as it is ſet downe <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 16. 17. 25. 26. <hi>Then the Lord ſayd unto</hi> Moyſes, <hi>Gather unto me ſeventy men of the Elders of Iſrael, whom thou knoweſt that they are Elders of the people, and Governours over them: and bring them unto the Tabernacle, and let them ſtand there with thee. And I will come downe, and talke there with thee, and take of the ſpirit which is upon thee, and put upon them, and they ſhall beare the burthen of the people with thee, ſo thou ſhalt not beare it alone.</hi> So theſe were another ſort of Elders. Then the Elders that governed over the people, as in the 24, 25. and 26, verſes. <hi>So Moyſes went out, and told the people the words of the Lord; and gathered ſeventy men of the Elders of the people, and ſet them round about the Tabernacle. There the Lord came downe in a cloud, and ſpake unto him, and tooke of the ſpirit that was upon</hi> Moyſes, <hi>and put upon the ſeventy antient men: and when the ſpirit reſted upon them, then they propheſied and did not ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here their ordination is of God, their indowment is of the Spirit, and their office and duty is to prophecie, and not to ceaſe; and the end why they were to prophecie, is to beare the burden of the people with <hi>Moyſes,</hi> for the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and often tempted and provoked the Lord to wrath. And though they received daily inſtruction, and publicke miniſtration of the word of God from <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet the ſeed of truth fell ſometimes among ſtony ground, and ſometime upon thorny ground, &amp; ſometime in the high way, and either took no deepe root, or it was choaked, or otherwiſe picked up and carryed away by the ſowles of the ayre, ſo that their murmurings, grudgings, and rebellions were ſuch a burthen to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and an inſupportable griefe that <hi>Moyſes</hi> wiſhed rather to die than to live. Therefore God ordained theſe kind of Elders to be an aſſiſtance in his publicke mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that as <hi>Moyſes</hi> among the Jewes, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the Church of God planted the Word in publicke. So theſe might be as <hi>Apollo's</hi> to water it in private, and that by their vigilancie and diligence in every place of the Congregation, they might be ready to ſuppreſſe by divine inſtruction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54411:33"/>
and admonition out of the word of God. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, grudgings, contentions, ſtrife, curſings, railings, and all ſorts of inordinate walkings. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17.</note>
This was the private and particular duty of theſe ſorts of Elders by the power of the Word to kill the Cockatrice in the egge, and to pull up the weeds of ſinne by the roots. For this cauſe they are deſcribed in the fourth of the Revelation to be the wings of the foure beaſts placed round about their bodyes, full of eyes within; for they are knit unto the Miniſters in a peculiar and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neereneſſe, and their diſcerning operation is not to extend beyond the bounds of the Profeſſors of the Church, for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, what have wee to doe with thoſe that are without?</p>

as <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſet before them in another place. 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 1. Rebuke not an Elder, but exhort him as a fathers and the younger men as brethren. The elder women as mothers, and the younger as ſiſters with all pureneſſe.</hi>

               <p>Now I come to the ſecond part of government, which conſiſteth alſo in theſe three functions.

The ſecond ſort is Deacons. The third is called by a generall name in common to them and the Paſtors, Teachers and Biſhops, which is the name of Elders, for that in their publicke execution of Diſcipline, they are joyntly united, ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54411:34"/>
that though the Paſtor have the leading voyce and preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">Biſhop our ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perintendent.</note>
yet he is not to execute, nor pronounce ſentence in the Churh <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>thout the Elders, nor yet to ordaine either Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Elders, or Paſtors, without their counſell, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conſent of the Church, ſo that the Paſtors, Teachers and Biſhops, are not to beare the burthen alone, it would bee too heavy for them, as it was for <hi>Moyſes,</hi> if they bore the like conſcience to God as <hi>Moyſes</hi> did; and if it were too heavy a burden for one man in thoſe dayes, when the Church was but one Nation, and but one Congregation, and had but one Tabernacle; How muſt it not now needs be a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight, when the Church is many Nations, farre and wide diſperſed, and many diſtinct Congregations.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Elders be joyned in one power with the Paſtors and Biſhops, ſo that nothing ought to bee done without them, the Paſtors have this preheminence, that the worke both of Diſcipline, cenſure, and ordination of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Paſtors and Deacons, is attributed unto them as moſt proper to their function; For this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Titus,</hi> in his Epiſtle, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that he left him in <hi>Crete:</hi> that hee ſhould continue to redreſſe things that remained, and ordaine Elders in every Citie, as (ſaith he) I appointed thee.

                  <hi>And when they ordained them Elders by election in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church, and prayed and faſted; they commended them to the Lord, in whom they beleeved.</hi> For neither divine cenſure, nor ordination could be done without them, neither would the Apoſtles nor Paſtors of the primitive times, for the ſpace of two hundred and fifty yeares, either cenſure or ordaine any Elders, Paſtors, or Deacons, without the Election, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Church and Elders. But a little after theſe times, when pride began to creepe into the hearts of the Paſtors, Teachers, and Biſhops, and that the zeale and care of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders grew cold and negligent, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage, lib.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of the cauſe of the then preſent perſecutions, among other things (ſaith) What plagues, what ſtripes, doe we not deſerve, when no not the Confeſſours and Elders doe keepe Diſcipline? And from this degree of luke-warmneſſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54411:34"/>
it came to be omitted, and after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell quite extinct, and wiped out of memory; So that no marvell if our age call it the new-brought-in diſcipline and government of Paſtors, Elders and People.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe of Diſcipline, I muſt have relation to that which is gone before, for that which is part of government in the theoricke is alſo a part of Diſcipline in the practicke, therefore though I have ſhewed that election and ordination are neceſſary relatives in the Church, that as proper to the Congregation, this other to the Paſtours, and how they were practiſed by the Apoſtles, yet it is needfull to reforme the Judgements and opinions of men, to ſhew how it is moſt proper for Congregations to chooſe their Paſtours and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deacons, and alſo their conſent and counſell in their ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Apoſtles practiſe is the beſt of pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns.</note>
To ſatisfie any indifferent judgement, it is beſt to make it a perpetuall rule and patterne, to follow the example of the Apoſtles, but it is an enforcing reaſon, that is neceſſary that the people, whoſe <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> doth inſtrumentally conſiſt in their Paſtor ſhould be well acquainted, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently experimented in his life and converſation, as alſo in his doctrine which they ought to taſte by their care, (for the earth taſteth words as the palate doth meat) before they make choyce of him, though it may bee they cannot, nor is it required at their hands to trie his ſchollarſhip, but their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities (if it be a Congregation that hath lived, and been nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed under a wholſome and ſtructifying miniſtery) may well judge and taſte the ſweetneſſe of the divine gift of Preaching by the care, and ſo trie his doctrine, as the men of <hi>Berea</hi> did the doctrine of <hi>Paul;</hi> and it may ſo happen in ſome Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, that are well edified in the Word of God, that they may have among themſelves ſome of their Deacons able and ſufficient to ſucceed their deceaſed Paſtor, and withall I doe not thinke it fit to exclude the choyce and preſentation of the Univerſities, nor to debarre their Letters of commendation; nor for one Congregation to ſupply the want of another, for all Congregations are members one of another, and every

Chriſtian Univerſity is a Congregation, and they all make but one Church to God.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall I ſay of Patrons preſentations? I know not, unleſſe I ſhould ſay they are too frequently the ſeed of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; For except the Nobles and Peeres of this Kingdome doe freely beſtow their preſentations. I feare there are not many that doe the like, and to ſpeake truly of their firſt donation, it was not done purely. For the Donors in reſerving a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to them, and their heires, they kept backe a part of the poſſeſſion they had dedicated to God, as did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> And ſo if they bee righty conſidered, they are are as unneceſſary evills in the Church, as Deanes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, which no man can tell to what uſe they ſerve in the Church. But if Patrons cannot be admitted by our law, let them preſent three or foure at the leaſt, that the Church may have her choyce, and as much as may be avoyd that horrid crime of Simony.</p>

               <p>But that which doth foſter and nouriſh men in a good opinion of this errour to attribute ſuch abſolute power to the Biſhops and Clergie, is that myſticall doctrine of Antichriſt, which in that ſmoakie darkneſſe thruſt upon the world for an undeniable truth, that the Church in her eſſence is to bee conceived to bee the Biſhops and Clergie, and that they onely have the unerrable Spirit of God, and that thereby they have power to doe all things, as much, and as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Chriſt himſelfe when he was on earth, as once a Romiſh Prieſt averred to me, that the Prieſts or Clergie were the ſoule of the Church.</p>
               <p>The nouriſhing and maintaining of this opinion is the cauſe why the world hath ſo long, and ſo madly doated after Epiſcopacie; But if we thinke it fit to caſt away the pride and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54411:35"/>
ambition of man, abhorre this opinion, and let the worke bee of God, and not of man.</p>

               <p>Now touching Excommunication, which is that ſupreme Diſcipline and divine power which purgeth and ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the droſſe from the pure gold in the temple of God. This part of Diſcipline is of ſo high and holy a nature and qualitie, as that of a Chriſtian, it ought to bee had in a moſt reverend eſtimation above all the powers of earth: for it is thunderbolt and lightning of God, that upon whom it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and pierceth, it doth conſume with a terrible flame, and grind him to powder with a direfull fall.</p>

This power is committed unto the Church, not to Biſhops alone, nor to the Paſtors or Clergie onely, neither have the Elders this power appropriate unto them, but the Church. As <hi>Mat. 18 17. If he will not heare, then tell it unto the Church.</hi> Now the Church is not properly to bee conceived to conſiſt in any one perſon, who is but a member of the whole, nor can ſhe be ſaid to be any one proper function in the Church, but the whole Church conſiſting of one head Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members indued with divers and many adminiſtrations and gifts of one and the ſame ſpirit, and in this ſence every particular publicke Congregation is an entire Church, and a member of the univerſall Church throughout the world, becauſe a Congregation containes in it ſelfe the whole Church of God, as ſhe hath one and the ſame head (Chriſt) one and the ſame Spirit, and one and the ſame miniſtration of the ſame Word and Sacrament, and one and the ſame God and Father of all, above all, in all, and through all, and one. And thus having the ſame Word and Doctrine, the ſame functions of Paſtors, Teachers, Deacons and Elders, the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Adminiſtration, Diſcipline and Government, ſo that hereby they are united one into another, and one in all, and all in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The private admonition by Elders.</note>
The private exerciſe of this part of Diſcipline I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <pb n="56" facs="tcp:54411:36"/>
of, which by degrees in private admonition, if it bring not forth the fruits of repentance and amendment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the firſt degree of publicke correction, <hi>(Tell the Church.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This information is made by the Elders, who have uſed the private diſcipline of exhortation, with much wiſedome and patience upon ſome particular perſons, who with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart have reſiſted the power of God through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>They declare the offence to the Paſtor, and the Paſtor in the publicke aſſembly acquainteth the people with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and if the delinquent be preſent, hee is cauſed to ſtand upbefore the Paſtor, who reproves him with the ſharpe Judgements of God againſt his ſinne, by the Word ſeeking to enlighten his mind, and mollifie his heart; Which if it prevaile with him, hee falleth upon his knees, and deſireth the Congregation to pray for him, which done, the Paſtor pronounceth unto him the remiſſion of ſinnes, if the Church judge him penitent, if they find him ſtill obſtinate and of an unrelenting heart. then they pronounce him debarred from the holy Communion of the Supper of the Lord and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue him upon the ſtoole of repentance with much exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, patience, and long forbearing, till they convince him, or otherwiſe ſeparate him from the Congregation, for a time; if after hee continue in his fouleneſſe of ſinne, then hee is againe called to the Congregation and admoniſhed, which if then it take no effect, her is excommunicated by laying on of the hands of all the Elders, after that hee is accounted as an enemie, or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Anathema to the Church, and wholly and finally given over to Satan, according to the words of our Saviour, the 18. <hi>Matth. 18. Whomſoever yee bind on earth, ſhall bee bound in heaven, and whom yee ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall bee looſed in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judge, I pray you, if all the politicke wits in the world could ever have deviſed ſuch a pure and ſubtile diſcipline, as ſhould ſpie into the inward ſecrets of the thoughts, and intentions of the heart, and ſhould purge the conſcience,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54411:36"/>
and ſhould cut off the conſuming cankers, and rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from the body of the Church. What Romiſh Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary could ever have compoſed ſuch a ſoule-ſaving me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine?</p>
               <p>Obſerve how the holy Spirit hath commanded this diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to bee alwayes practized in the Church. When <hi>Achans</hi> covetouſneſſe troubled the Congregation, by moving Gods wrath againſt them, a diligent ſearch was commanded to bee made, and being found out, <hi>Achan</hi> and his houſe were cut off. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. And alſo, if there bee a ſcorner or contentious perſon (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> caſt out the ſcorner, and ſo ſtrife will goe out, and ſo contention ſhall ceaſe. Alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. 18. Now ſaith <hi>Paul, I beſeech you brethren, marke them diligently which cauſe diviſion and offences, contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which yee have learned, and avoid them.</hi> And more plainly in the 2 <hi>Theſſ. 36. 10. Wee command you brethren, in the Name of Chriſt, that yee withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walkes inordinately, and not after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which yee received of us.</hi> And in the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe he ſaith; <hi>If any man obey not your ſaying, note him by a letter, and have no company with him, that hee may bee aſhamed, yet account him not as an enemy, but admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him as a brother.</hi> But if he come to the laſt degree Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, then ſaith our Lord Chriſt, let him be anathema.</p>
               <p>But if you would ſee the Apoſtles practice in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. chap. 4 and 5. verſes, <hi>Paul</hi> having certaine intelligence that there was odious fornication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, hee writ thus unto them; <hi>When yee are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and my ſpirit, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſuch a one, I ſay, by the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt bee delivered unto Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may bee ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And out of this text make a profitable obſervation, that <hi>Paul</hi> will not have Excommunication, (though but in the ſecond degree) executed in any private manner, but by the publicke aſſembly gathered together, neither doth hee allow
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54411:37"/>
it to be done in any name, but in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; Neither doth hee attribute the power, either to himſelfe or the Church, but onely to the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Now, and laſtly, I muſt conclude with the laſt part of Diſcipline, that is Synodicall aſſemblies, which are of three degrees. The firſt is particular to every Congregation, which conſiſts of the Paſtors the Deacons, and the Elders of that Church, whoſe cuſtomes is the beſt reformed Churches to meet once a weeke, or as need requires, to take an account of all things that concerne the duties of the Elders and the Church-revenues, the Paſtor being their chiefe guide; Thoſe things about which they chiefly buſie themſelves, are firſt to catalogue the Profeſſors of their Congregation, their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuminiſts diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are thought fit to be admitted to the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, their Baptized, their penitents, their Excommunicates, their number of Elders and Deacons, Paſtors and Teachers, one or two, as the place requires.</p>
               <p>In this their aſſembly they conſider the ſpirituall eſtate, and condition of the flocke, examine the revenues of the Church, and the neceſſities of the poore, and what things ſoever they find meet to edification. The Paſtor exhorting the Elders to diligence, care, and zeale in the worke of the Lord, the Deacons to honeſty, compaſſon, and a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Aſſembly or Synod of Presbyteries within a ſhire or Wapontake.</note>
The ſecond order of Synodes is in the reformed Churches, called the aſſemblies of the Presbyteries, held monethly, or quarterly, under which they comprehend the Paſtors and Church Elders, for every Paſtor brings with him two or three Elders, after the quantity of the Congregation, and this Synode is a company of Paſtors and Elders of a ſhire or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontake.</p>
               <p>In theſe Aſſemblies they examine the ſpirituall condition of every pariſh, take view of their order, diligence, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and manners, as well the doctrine and manners of the Paſtors and Elders, as of the younger people And there they proceed to ſuch further order and cenſure, as by the holy Scriptures they are taught. And in theſe Synodes all errours
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54411:37"/>
in opinion, hereſies and Schiſmes, that are found noyſome to the Congregation are reproved, and the parties exhorted and admoniſhed. In theſe their Synodes they alwayes from time to time chooſe one Preſident to guide the affaires, and thus they avoyd that preheminence, which Epiſcopacie greedily hunts after.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The generall Synode.</note>
The third degree is the ſuperlative aſſembly of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which is either Nationall or Provinciall, which in ſome Churches are held yearely, or otherwiſe as occaſions fit; over which the prince and Soveraigne is the Principall Elder, and the Presbyters and Elders appoint one Paſtor for the time Preſident of the aſſembly, who moderates and guides the affaires.</p>
               <p>The matters handled in this Synode are a generall review of both the former Synods, and ſpecially to take care of the preſervation of the puritie of Doctrine, and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heretickes, and errours, and all miſdemeanours, and Schiſmes in the Church.</p>
               <p>And whatſoever is done in any of theſe Synods is certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one to another, and through the Nationall Church of all their moſt materiall cenſures which may concerne them in generall, wherby the Church is preſerved in a ſweet and pleaſant decorum, unitie, puritie and peace.</p>
               <p>The unerrable patterne of theſe Synods is taken from the practiſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. ſhewing by what rules of temperance and wiſedome they ought to judge and give ſentence, taking the Scripture for their rule, the holy Ghoſt for their guide, not laying any burden on the Church by Lawes, Decrees, or Canons, as I have before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And this Divine rule and patterne was kept and obſerved throughout all the Primitive times, till the great Councell of Nice, as by the Chronography of <hi>Socrates. Scholaſt.</hi> may be obſerved, yet the earthly glory of <hi>Babel</hi> hath ſo long da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled the eyes of moſt men, that they call the truth novelty.</p>
               <p>But if men were of a free ſpirit and cleere judgement, not inthralled with prejudicate opinions, nor darkned with the more then Egyptian miſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> they might here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54411:38"/>
the virgin puritie of the Church of God, both in her Worſhip, Juriſdiction, Doctrine, Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, to have beene from the beginning of the world one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus have I adventured to preſent unto the eyes of men, the true face of the Chriſtian Church ſhining in her ſpirituall Iuſtre, and Chriſt Jeſus our Lord raigning and ruling over the ſoules and conſciences of man, not intrenching upon the temporall power of Kings and Princes.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord give unto us underſtanding in all things, and with the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> I will bow the knees of my ſoule, unto the Father of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom is named the whole Family in heaven and in earth, that he may grant us according to the riches of his glory, that wee may be ſtrengthened by his Spirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in our hearts by Faith, that wee being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth all knowledge, that we may be filled with all fulneſſe of God. Unto him therefore that is able to doe exceeding abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above all that we can aske or thinke, according to the power that worketh in us, be praiſe in the Church by Jeſus Chriſt thorough all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ever, Amen. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
