            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Man is subject, the Plague is one of
the most venemous and most infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
peculiarly opposite to the
heart, consuming the Vital Spirits,
destroying the natural heat, and
corrupting the humours, usually
attended with a Fever, and accompanied with variety

sent from God, as a just punishment for the
sins of Mankind; and this not onely Jewes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but even Heathens, Priests, Poets, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and Physicians, have acknowledged in their
Writings.</p>
               <p>Who can choose but with admiration adore his
Almighty Power, who if he will build, creates a
World; if he rewards, it is with Paradise; if he will
protect his People, there is a Pillar of Fire by Night,
and a Cloud by Day, to attend them; the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall feast them with Quails and Manna, the
Rocks remove their station, and give them drink, the
Sea opens to yield them passage, the Sun and Moon
stay their Courses to enlarge and end their Victories.</p>
               <p>But if he will punish, he sends a Deluge and
drowns the World, Fire and Brimstone descend from
Heaven, the Elements are the Marshals of his Camps,
all Creatures are his Host, the Angels march in the
Head of his Troops, whereof he hath thousand
thousands that stand before him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand that minister unto him; one
whereof slew the First born of every House in <hi>Egypt</hi>
in one Evening, threescore and ten thousand of the
<hi>Israelites</hi> in three dayes, and one hundred fourscore
and five thousand of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> in one Night.</p>
               <p>If he send the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> as when the <hi>Israelites</hi>
murmured, or <hi>David</hi> numbred the People, there
is no natural Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> of sufficient vertue to
preserve from it, or recover of it: If <hi>Solomon</hi> had
been then alive, and made an Antidote of all his
Gold that came from <hi>Ophyr,</hi> or extracted the quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence
of all those Herbs whereof he knew the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

the preserving the <hi>Israelites,</hi> than the fortification of
<hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Camp defended the <hi>Assyrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can any thing help Nature against the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Can man think to protect himself with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
fetcht from Vegetables, Minerals, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals?
would they not rather prove his Enemies, and
sooner do him hurt, than afford him help? Was not
one of the greatest, Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> kill'd with a flie?
One of the wittiest, <hi>Anacreon,</hi> choak'd with a raisin
stone? One of the proudest, <hi>Herod,</hi> devoured with
lice?</p>
               <p>But blessed be his glorious Name, his Clemency
hath not left us destitute, but revealed to us super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Remedies, Faith and Repentance, Prayer
and Patience; which though not prescribed by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
or <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> nor found out by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> nor
sold by Chymists or Apothecaries, are revealed by
God himself, approved by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and may be had for asking, and never fail'd
those that us'd them.</p>
               <p>Many Learned Physicians have written of the
Theory and Practise of Physick, and experienced
Doctors have publisht the Observations which they
have met with in the cure of Diseases, searcht into
the Secrets of Nature, discovered the Vertues of
Herbs, treated of the Preparations of Minerals, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
into the Operations of Animals, Merchants
have brought Druggs from the <hi>Indies,</hi> Rarities have
been sought in the Wilderness, Pearls have been
div'd for in the bottom of the Sea, the bowels of
the Earth have been digged out, the Universe hath
been rifled, the whole Creation ransackt; and yet
not one Medicine found out to preserve the Doctor,

or make one Patient Immortal. The Imperial
Crown cannot cure the Head-ach, nor the Golden
Garter keep away the Gowt. The best disciplin'd
and Victorious Armies, the most Invincible Navies,
the best fenced Cities, are not able to protect from
Ordinary, much less from Supernatural Maladies.</p>
               <p>But these Coelestial and Supernatural Medicines

and of <hi>Iepthah,</hi> of <hi>David</hi> also, and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of
the Prophets, who through Faith subdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
wrought Righteousness, obtained Promises,
stopped the Mouths of Lions, quenched the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Fire, escaped the Edge of the Sword, out
of Weakness were made Strong, waxed Valiant in
Fight, turn'd to Flight the Armies of the Aliens,
and raised the Dead to Life again.</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95311:6"/>Repentance purifieth the Soul of all corruption,
purgeth out the old Leaven, and cleanseth the filth
of Sin; the smiting of the heart driveth away, and
the breaking of it, will not let it hold Infection;
Poverty of Spirit makes it more couragious, Sighs
clear and cool the Ayre, Tears are the best <hi>Aquae
Vitae,</hi> and a better Antidote than <hi>Aqua Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acalis.</hi>

               <p>You have heard of the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> why, it
was a plaister of Patience which cur'd him of all his
sores. <hi>Moses</hi> Rod when thrown down, became a
Serpent, but patiently took up, was but a Rod: and
have you not deserv'd to be corrected, and to suffer
much more than is laid upon you? What is the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of a cold fit to the gnashing of Teeth? What
is a burning Fever to the Flames of Hell Fire? To
be shut up for a Moneth in your own Habitation, or
a Pest-House, and there to be vexed with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
of Nurses, the Directions of Doctors,
and Operation of Chirurgeons, for a few dayes, in
comparison of being imprisoned and tormented with
the Devil and his Angels in the Lake of Fire and
Brimstone for evermore? Is not the loss of Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
more than the lack of Trade, or separation of
Friends? Is not the Worm of Conscience more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than a Carbuncle? Is not the Death of the Soul
infinitely more grievous than the death of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
Why doth the living man complain that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
for his sin? Any thing on this side Hell is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Are you not kindly dealt with, when in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
you ought to lose your head, and in Mercy
you are censur'd onely to cut your hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95311:7"/>The wise King <hi>Solomon</hi> was a great Favourite, and
might have obtained any request in the Court of
Heaven, yet when he petition'd concerning the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,</hi>
that might be sent by God among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
never intreats that Medicines might have their
desired effect, to preserve the healthy and restore

Remedy of <hi>Prayer, 1 Kings 8. 37. If there be Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any
man, or by all thy People Israel, which shall know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man the plague of his own heart, and spread
forth his hands toward this House; then hear thou in
Heaven, and forgive, and do to every man according
to his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. Prayers, whether they be Gods
heavenly and sudden Inspirations, or our holy and
premeditated desires, are as so many Angels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
descending and ascending between God
and us; and it is one of the greatest favours Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
is capable of, at all times, and in all places,
and on all occasions, to have free access to the
Throne of Grace, and make our wants known, and
be relieved; for God being Universa! Goodness, and
willing to communicate and diffuse the same unto
his creatures, how can we fail in having our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
granted, when we concur with him in desiring
that help and pity, wherewith his very Nature doth
most delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95311:7"/>
Man was but a heap of dust, till the breath of
life was breath'd into him, and then he became a
living soul, and Prayer will keep him a living soul,
from returning unto dust again. Is wrath begun?
Prayer will make an Atonement; <hi>Phineas</hi> prayed, and
the Plague was stayed: It as it were dis-armes the
Almighty, and in some sort may be said to bind his
hands. It made him when angry, to entreat <hi>Moses</hi>
to let him alone. It holds the drawn sword of the
destroying Angel. It is an Incense, that being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
up with fervent zeal, perfumes the air above
all Arabian Odors, or the Spice of <hi>India.</hi> Hearty
prayer availeth much, and is the most effectual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial,
the best Preservative, the most excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative,
the most soveraign Antedote, the most
powerful Amulet. 'Tis best to be used fasting in the
morning, and last at Night, three times a day with
<hi>Daniel,</hi> seven times a day with <hi>David,</hi> alwayes, as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directs. As health is the salt of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blessings, without which they would be uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
so Prayer seasoneth and exalteth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of all Medicines; nay 'tis the Universal Medicine,
it cures all diseases, and makes all work for the best,
and like the Philosophers Stone turns every thing,
nay the iron rods into gold, and the dreadful marks
and purples into Gods Tokens.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Plague</hi> may be caused extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
by the Devil. That evil Spirit that by his
temptations enticeth men to wickedness, is most
ready upon all occasions to reward them with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
He that can poyson the minds of men, by
suggesting unto them most destructive and pestilent
notions, much more can poyson their bodies with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95311:8"/>
pernicious diseases. The Devil, though fallen, is
an Angel, and though he hath lost his happiness, yet
retains his power, neither did his knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes and their Effects, depart from him with
his innocence. He that being permitted to vex <hi>Iobs</hi>
body with biles and sores, that could drive Winds
and Tempests together to beat down his house, that
could bring down Fire from Heaven to destroy his
Cattel, can alter the disposition and healthy Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Air, whereof he is Prince and Ruler.
When <hi>Egypt</hi> was plagued, God sent evil Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and those Spirits that did corrupt the
Water, by turning it into Blood, and poyson the
Rivers with Froggs, and the Cattel with Murrain,
may also corrupt the Air and Water, and raise on
mens bodies botches and boils, and destroy them
with the <hi>Pestilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto may be referred that <hi>Pestilence,</hi> which in
some Countries followeth upon the death and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of certain Witches, which though it may seem
fabulous, yet being related out of <hi>Hercules Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
by that most candid Author the Learned <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi>
(whose honoured Name must never be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by me, without a particular respect and
grateful acknowledgement of his Learned Labours
in the Art of Physick) I shall mention it in <hi>Saxonia</hi>'s
own words.</p>
               <p>I had (<hi>saith he)</hi> a very strong argument to confirm
this thing; but because it did seem to exceed all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
I did not dare to publish it: Namely, that in
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> the Plague is sometimes caused
by certain Witches, when they are first dead and buried,
and doth not cease till the corps be found and taken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95311:8"/>
up; then it hath in the mouth of it, some pieces of
its own grave-cloths, or of some near adjacent carcass
(which it holds fast in the teeth, as if it were about to
devour and eat them) then they cut off the head of it,
and set it on a pole, and bury the corps again. Th
because it seem'd to pass my understanding, I did not
dare to write: but afterwards being confirm'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
testimonies, especially of the most learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>John Ursinus,</hi> I did not doubt to publish. <hi>The
said</hi> Vrsinus <hi>having seen it with his own eyes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
it thus,</hi> In the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1572. when a
certain woman of <hi>Rzesna</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> was buried near
the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the
Plague began to rage and spread extreamly, whereupon
the buriers with good reason suspecting that there was
a Witch there lately buried, dig up her carcass, and
find in her mouth some pieces of devoured grave-cloths;
they cut off her head, as the fashion is in such
cases, set it on a pole, and bury the corps again, and
the Plague ceased.</p>
               <p>For confirmation whereof, the said <hi>Saxonia</hi> brings
the testimony of several famous men. And though
the reason of it is not easily found out, yet it may
not be unpleasant for those that have more leasure
to make further enquiry. Perhaps these wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons being of the same malicious mind with
him, that wisht the destruction of the World
at his dissolution, and said, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
might indent with the Devil to do some
extraordinary mischief when they themselves could
do no more; and he, to draw others into the like cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
contract, might get leave to perform his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95311:9"/>
                  <hi>Martin Weinrichius</hi> hath written a large Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Tragedies and Troubles that a certain
Taylor of <hi>Silesia</hi> stirred up after his death; and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
relate strange stories done by Witches in those
places that are under the power of the Prince of
Darkness, and without the light of the Gospel. I
have heard of the Plague that hath followed upon
great Butcheries and Slaughters of men that have
been denied quarter, though their Corpses have
been all buried. If the body after death, neither
by it self, nor by good, or evil spirits, hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
how comes it to pass, that being taken out
of the grave, many weeks after it hath been buried,
it will bleed fresh blood at the presence of its Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer?
I have heard of many strange stories of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
that have attended on the death and burial of
Conjurers and Magitians; and it is probable there
was somewhat more than ordinary in that <hi>Wind</hi> on
the third of <hi>September,</hi> when that detestable Tyrant
and Traytor <hi>Cromwell</hi> died.</p>
               <p>However the Devil can go no further than his
Chain, nor exceed his Commission in afflicting <hi>Iob,</hi>
nay he could not enter into the <hi>Gadarens</hi> Swine
without leave. The <hi>Indians</hi> talk much of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
their <hi>Powowes</hi> can do, but yet have no power to
hurt the <hi>English;</hi> and the wise Wife of <hi>Keith</hi> at the
intreaty of Earl <hi>Bothwell,</hi> could not hurt King <hi>Iames</hi>
the <hi>Brittish Solomon.</hi> The Light of Religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Power of Darkness, and the Infernal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are subdued and overcome by the heavenly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Faith and Repentance, Prayer and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
these call in Angels to our guard, which will
take charge over us, that there be no Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95311:9"/>
against <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor Divination against <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Natural Causes of the <hi>Pestilence</hi>
are likewise two-fold,
<list>
                     <item>1. Such as generate and breed it.</item>
                     <item>2. Such as propagate and spread it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>One cause of breeding the <hi>Pestilence</hi> is the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Air, which is occasioned, sometimes by
the Influence of the Stars, by the Aspects, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
and Oppositions of the Planets, by the
Ecclipses of the Sun and Moon, by the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Comets, by immoderate heat, and excessive
moisture, whereby Vapours and Exhalations being
drawn up, and remaining unconsumed, do rot and
putrifie, and so corrupt and infect the Air with a
venenate, malignant, and pestilential quality.</p>
               <p>And though some may think it strange, that those
pure and coelestial Bodies, as the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, should produce any pernicious or hurtful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to Mankind, or Creatures here below; yet when
it shall be considered, that Individuals have no perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
in themselves, but in their Species, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a necessity of <hi>Corruption</hi> as well as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
it will not be difficult to answer, That the
Stars intending no evil, hurt, or mischief, produce
it onely by accident; of themselves they preserve,
but by accident destroy.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Effects that proceed from the
Coelestial Bodies, are not so much to be judged by
the Nature of the superior heavens, as by the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95311:10"/>
of the inferiour creatures: The same heat of
the Sun doth harden clay and soften wax; thesame
rain that washeth stones, makes miry places the more
dirty. Do you not see in the four Seasons of the
Year, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, which
are accompanied with Warmth, Drought, Cold, and
Moisture, which are in themselves good, though
many individual creatures receive damage thereby.
The warmth of the Spring is exceeding comfortable,
and tending to the good of the Universe, and yet
that heat meeting with a body full of vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
that had been stored there in the fore-going
Winter, stirs up Fevers, Plurisies, and other disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whereof many die. The Summer Season attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with its parching heat, serves for ripening of the
fruits of the earth, and yet in some persons it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Calentures and mortal maladies. The rains of
Autumn, the Cold and Frosts of Winter, though
good in themselves and seasonable to the Earth, yet
in some bodies, occasion Gowts, Palsies, Dropsies,
and Consumptions.</p>
               <p>And though these Stars, being as it were pestilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent against us, and have neither pity, sense, nor
power to change their influence, or alter their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet our most gracious God, who is the Lord
of the Host of Heaven, that made the Sun and
Moon stand still for <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the Sun to go back
ten degrees for <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> that God which <hi>Iob</hi>
speaks of, which removeth the Mountains, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Earth out of her place; He that sealeth up
the Stars, and treadeth on the waves of the Sea, <hi>Iob</hi>
5. Can disperse any hurtful Exhalations that are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the Air, and suppress any noxious vapours
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95311:10"/>
that arise from the Earth. He that can bind the
sweet influence of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> can also hinder the
malignant Aspects of the Planets; and he that can
loose the bands of <hi>Orion,</hi> can as well dissolve the
Conjunction of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> whom it is no
more difficult for him to over-rule, than to guide
<hi>Arcturus</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Iob 38. 31, 32. Astra regunt
homines, sed regit astra Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Corruption of the Air may be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
not onely by the influence of the Stars, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the Vapours and Exhalations that ascend from
Pools and standing waters, from Lakes that do not
run, from stinking sinks, and ditches that are not
cleansed, as also from holes and caverns of the
earth; they which dig in cole-pits, and work in
mines, oft-times, to the damage of their health and
hazard of their lives, are made sensible of the effect of
damps that thence arise. <hi>Guainerius</hi> relates, that
upon the opening of a pit in <hi>Campania,</hi> there rushed
forth such a poisonous breath, that presently kill'd
the by-standers. Physicians, out of <hi>Iulius Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
make mention of an exceeding old Chest, which
being found and opened in <hi>Babylon,</hi> there began a
most deadly Plague, that reacht as far as <hi>Parthia.</hi>
And <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> relates, that in the time
of <hi>Marcus Verus</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple was
sackt, and his Image brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> where some
of the Souldiers of <hi>Avidius Crassus</hi> espied a little
hole, which afterward they opened, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sallied out such a hurtful blast of Air, that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a most grievous <hi>Pestilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Air also may be corrupted by the Exhalations
and Vapours that ascend out of the bowels of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95311:11"/>
Earth, wherein are many poisonous Minerals, upon
the Eruption of Earthquakes, after which (as
Histories report) most grievous Plagues have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Air may be corrupted by the steams
and fumes that arise from Carcases not at all buried,
or not buried deep enough, or digged up to make
room for others before they have been quite consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
I have read of a great Plague that hath begun
upon the opening of a grave, and one might guesse
worse, if he should conceive this to be one reason
why the Parish of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields should be
more infected than other places; and those that
have ability and authority may do a worse deed than
cause the Church-yard to be covered over with fresh
earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Plague may be caused by corrupt
and superfluous humours, which being bred by ill
diet, unhealthy food, unwholesome meat and drink,
and being long detained in the body, at last arrive to
the highest degree of putrefaction, and become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
and pestilential: Hence came the Proverb
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>After Famine comes the Plague.</hi>
From this corruption of humours it is, that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Women and Children, that are of a hot and
moist temper, and of a soft and tender constitution;
and the meaner sort of people that keep little or no
order in diet, and have small regard to preserve their
health, but having foul bodies, and abounding with
peccant humours, become most subject to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
disease; from the danger whereof, others
that guide themselves more orderly, for the most part
live more secure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95311:11"/>
Secondly, As the Plague may be generated and
bred by the corruption of the Air and putrefaction
of the humours, so is it often propagated by Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
whereby the like venemous disposition and
diseased effect is produced in a healthy body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
that sickly person from whence it came, was first
afflicted; and it is most powerful if it be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a body, proportionable and of like constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to that wherein it was formerly kindled;
whence Kinsfolks and those of the same bloud, are
soonest infected by one another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are perswaded, that every ones fate is
written in his fore-head, and hath a fatal destiny
appointed by God, which it is impossible for any to
avoid; so that they believe, those that shall die by
the Plague, cannot be slain in War, nor drown'd in
Water, and those that shall die in battel, cannot be
kill'd by the Plague; by which credulity, they
slight and neglect all care of avoiding the infection,
conversing with one another, and buying the goods
out of infected houses, and wearing the apparel of
them that lately died. I shall not trouble my self to
confute this Opinion, since at <hi>Grand Cayre</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
there have been thousands that have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
death, and multitudes that have been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Plague for this Heresie.</p>
               <p>But would one think there should be any such in
<hi>England,</hi> that in opposition to the good Orders of
the Magistrates, and without any regard to their
own safety, or the lives of their Families, their
Children, Neighbours, Friends and Acquaintance,
and all with whom they have to do or come a-near,
should not refrain the Conversation of the Sick, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95311:12"/>
coming into infected places, when they have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
occasion, that calls them thereunto.</p>
               <p>I have seen some sit at the doors, where the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
have been shut up, and have heard them speak (I
cannot say) reason) as if there were no such thing at
all, as that which people fear and call <hi>Infection;</hi>
they say the Scripture doth not say the Plague is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious:
Why, neither doth it say that Whoredome
breeds the Pox. They will tell you, they and many
more have been with the sick and kept them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and eat, and dranke, and lay with them,
and yet themselves never ail'd any thing: They
may as well argue that many have had the
Plague, Botches, Blains, Carbuncles and the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
and recovered, and therefore the Sicknesse is
not mortal. When a Phylosopher came to a Heathen
Idols Temple, one of the Priests shewed him a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Names of such persons, that in extremity
of Tempests and other dangers, made Vows to their
deity, and escaping Shipwrack came safe to Land;
but quoth the Philosopher; <hi>Can you shew me how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
made their Vows and yet perished?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have observed that most of these people are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
ignorant: and who so bold as <hi>Blind Bayard?</hi>
It would be no great difficulty to perswade an <hi>Indian</hi>
that never saw a Gun shot off, to stand before a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
mouth when it is loaden and discharged: Or
else they have no good nature, or kindness for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
Or else they are exceeding covetous; or such
as care not much to be rid of some of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
or else such as have had the Plague formerly;
or else they are middle-witted persons and diseased
in the pate, and are as fit for a <hi>Pest-House</hi> as a mad
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95311:12"/>
man is for <hi>Bethlem;</hi> and the proper way to confute
them is not with discourse or reason, but with a Pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
and a Watch-man.</p>
               <p>Are there not some diseases that are infectious? Do
not some sick bodies send out fumes and steams from
them? Is not the Plague as infectious as the Itch or
Pox? Doth not the apparel of several persons smell
of such things as they daily use and handle in their
Trade? Things of a Homogeneous Nature contain
their whole essence in a little quantity; Every part
of Quicksilver is Quicksilver; the least drop of Oyl
is Oil; the least spark of Fire is Fire, and if it meet
with combustible matter, what a flame will it soon
beget and kindle!</p>
               <p>Any one that shall consider, what operation there
is in a few grains of <hi>Arsnick,</hi> or other deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
what dolorous effects, and most grievous sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
are caused by the biting of any venemous
beast, or stinging of such little creatures as Hornets,
Wasps, and Bees, that with their slender stings do
make a wound so small, that it is scarce discernable
by the sharpest sight; will soon be perswaded, that
a great force and efficacy of Contagion may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in a small quantity of room, and like
Leaven (a little whereof leaveneth the whole lump)
will soon dilate and spread it self throughout the
whole Body, and destroy the Vital Spirit.</p>
               <p>This Infection is of a hot Nature, that it may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse;
'tis subtil and thin, that it may enter; 'tis
viscous and tenacious, that it may stick; and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and pernicious, that it may destroy. It is not
conveyed after one manner, sometimes it is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by breathing, sometimes by the pores of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95311:13"/>
skin, sometimes by sweat, or in form of a vapour,
and divers other wayes; but it is then most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
when it comes from those that are in a dying
condition, in whom Nature is overcome by the
strength of the Disease; sometimes it lies hid, and
as it were dormant, and lurking for many dayes;
sometimes it quickly becomes rampant, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovers its devouring Nature; sometimes a man
may carry it about him in his apparel, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infected himself, may infect others.</p>
               <p>Hitherto may be referred the Infection that is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Powders, Ointments, Mixtures, and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
dispersed by mischievous persons, whereby
the <hi>Pestilence</hi> hath been strangely spread abroad,
and for which (as several credible Histories report)
many of them being discovered, have been deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
executed.</p>
               <p>And here a Question may be asked, How it comes
to pass, that such mischievous persons escape them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
and whence it is, that Nurses, Searchers,
Buriers, and such as minister about the Sick, are
free from Infection?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, that, perhaps this may not be
alwayes true, the pitcher indeed goes often to the
well, but at last may come home broken. There
have been some Chyrurgeons, that have had Plague
sores; some Nurses have died with their Patients,
nay have died, when their Patients have recovered;
and there have been Bearers and Buriers that have
stood in need of the same Office to be done for
them, which but very lately they did do for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95311:13"/>
Perhaps also, many of these persons have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had the Plague, and recovered, being like
some pieces that remain untoucht, when most of
the house hath been consumed with the fire; or like
some Souldiers, that have escaped with life, when
most part of the whole Army hath been cut to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>This their freedom from Infection, cannot be said
to proceed from better Antidotes which they take,
nor from healthier Constitutions that they are of,
nor better Diet and Order which they observe;
for many times such persons take little or nothing at
all, and are subject to several diseases which many
others are free from, and are often of disorderly
and dissolute lives, given to intemperance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of drink.</p>
               <p>But it proceeds from an undaunted courage, a
bold, ready, and present mind, not distracted with
fear, or terrified with any peril, whence they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
on and perform such actions, as others
having their minds distracted with danger, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
dismayed and dissipated with fear, could not
undertake without the apparent hazard of their
lives; as we see some that slide on Ice, that walk
on Precipices, that swim in deep waters, that climb
up tall trees, that dance on high ropes, do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great difficulty, because undaunted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others that should attempt to do the same actions
with fear would fail of their enterprise, and break
their necks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may arise from a <hi>Particular Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
they have, which is not easily subject to this
Contagion: Before any action can have its effect,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95311:14"/>
and make impression, the subject must be first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
thereunto, and made capable thereof. A
Salamander is said to live in the flame, though a flie
is consumed therewith. Gun-powder and Brimstone
will take fire presently, so doth not Chalk nor
Clay.</p>
               <p>It is from some particular Constitution, that some
persons can neither sing, nor distinguish any tune,
neither care they for any Musick, and yet others
there be which are even ravisht with it. I know one,
that playing at Gleek, for more than he is willing
to lose, cannot reckon his game aright, if he here
one sing; neither could he shake in the cold fit of an
ague, if he heard a merry tune on the bag-pipes;
his best remedy against any pain is to hear some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
harmony. There are many fine dames that love
to play with a Squirrel, and carry it in their pockets,
and yet I know a Lady that will sound if she come
neer one. How many are delighted with the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
smell of a Damask Rose, and yet it did
blister a Ladies cheek when laid upon it, though she
was a-sleep. There are some that will even sound and
be very faint, not only at the sight, but even at the
presence of a Cat, though lockt up and concealed
in a Chest; and yet how many are there that love
their melancholy company? I have seen some that
will put a Snake in their bosome, and let it wind it
self like a bracelet about their arm, and yet there
are others that will be put into strange fits, and be
extream sick at the sight of an Eel. It is needless
to tell how many hate Cheese, and yet others think
they have not din'd well without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95311:14"/>
Some persons there be which hardly any thing will
make them sweat, others that can hardly vomit,
some that nothing will purge; some there are whom
many drams of <hi>Scamony</hi> will not stir, and yet twelve
grains will purge others I know a Gentlewoman
now living, about sixty five years of age, and very
well, that about five years ago could not be made
to vomit with more than three ounces of the infusion
of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> taken three dayes together,
and yet would rid her stomach twice or thrice in a
morning with drinking a draught of plain Ale; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could she be purg'd with twenty grains of <hi>Resin</hi>
of <hi>Ialap,</hi> and twelve of <hi>Gambugia,</hi> and yet as much
swell'd as one that had the Dropsie, and withal so
feeble, that she could scarce hold a Card, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she delighted much to play; and yet was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the expectation of all her acquaintance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured, by being about five and twenty times
let blood, and is now living and very healthy. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I know a Knight that will be as much purged with
eating of one Egge, as if he had taken a full dose of
pills, or a churlish potion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This their freedom from Infection, may
proceed from some Custome. There have been some
that by using themselves to the taking of venemous
things and poyson, have made it as familiar and
innocent to themselves as ordinary nourishment.
There have been some that have eaten Spiders and
Hemlock, and great quantities of <hi>Opium,</hi> without
any hurt or prejudice. What Custome will do, one
may see by them that are great Drinkers, and smoke
and chew and snuff <hi>Tobacco,</hi> without distempering
either their brains or stomacks. They who work in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95311:15"/>
Glass-Houses, or near great fires, seldom complain
of that heat which would even melt or roast others.
Many of the poorer sort there be, that in the cold
North Countrey, go bare-foot and wet-shod with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
catching Cold or Ague. Some by using to dive
in the Sea for Pearls, can hold their breath the space
of almost half an hour. And those who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,
and make it their unhappy Trade to empty
Jakes and Privies, scarce perceive, neither are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with that smell, which is ready to poyson
others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Plague is propagated by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
so likewise is it spread by Fear and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>From the heart proceed the Vital Spirits, which
are its Life-guard, and if they by fear are dissipated,
or retire inwards, and leave the outward parts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
which in infectious times, are as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
and besieg'd with pestilential air, in comes
the Plague like a prevailing enemy, and easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Gates, scales the Walls, and surpriseth the
Heart, which like a Coward in extremity of danger,
is not able to help it self, or make resistance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Terror and Fear, there is not onely
an easie passage made for infectious air to enter in,
but also the Spirits retiring to the Center of the
Heart, do draw after them such noxious and noisom
vapours, which are about the Circumference of the
Body (as the Sun draws towards it the vapours of the
Earth) and these arriving at the Heart, make a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
motion in the Blood, and causing heaviness,
compression and contraction, unite that force of the
venome, which before was weak and scattered, and
makes it stronger and victorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95311:15"/>
Thirdly, When either by the influence of the
air, or disorder of diet, or corruption of humors,
there is begotten in the body, a disposition or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to, or as it were a seed of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi>
Fear and Terror do excite and stir it up, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring it into action; whence that which such ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
persons did most fear, doth unavoidably fall
upon them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As the humors of the body do oftentimes
work much upon the mind, in like manner the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the mind work no less upon the body.
There have been some, who by imagination have
been cured of those diseases, wherewith they have
been afflicted; and there have been others, who by
imagination have fallen into the same diseases they
have feared. <hi>Thomas a Vega</hi> a learned Physitian, tells
a story of one that was light-headed, and sick of a
burning feaver, and being in great heat, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
importunate, that he might have leave to
swim in that Pool there (pointing with his hand to
the floor of the Chamber, which he fancied to be
water) for said he, <hi>If I should but swim there, I
should be immediately well:</hi> At length the Physician
being overcome with his intreaty, gave him leave,
and presently with great content he gets out of the
bed, and cheerfully rowles himself upon the floor,
saying, <hi>The water was now as high as his knees, but he
could wish it deeper;</hi> by and by after he was more
pleas'd that it was up to his middle, and withall he
wisht it a little higher, and presently after he seem'd
to be over-joyed, for that the water came up to
his Chin, and then he said, <hi>He was very well;</hi> and
so it was indeed, for he presently recovered. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95311:16"/>
on the contrary there be other stories, that make
relation of some, that did but see one infected with
the <hi>Plague,</hi> and of some that did but behold a-far
off a Corps going to be buried; of others, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the House, did but hear the noise of the Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and presently after have caught the <hi>Sickness,</hi> and
died of the <hi>Plague</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p>'Tis not seldom seen, that the weeping of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will draw tears from the eyes of another. When
one begin to cough, many presently follow after.
'Tis very usual, that the laughing of one man, will
set another on laughing, that seeth him laugh,
though he doth not know the cause why the first
man laughed; and the like effect we see in yawning
and stretching, which breedeth the like gaping in
the lookers on; and this doth proceed out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Object upon the fancy of the Spectator,
which making as it were the picture, resemblance,
or image of it self in the others mind, sendeth his
spirits unto the same parts, where they produce the
same actions.</p>
               <p>How great the force of Imagination is, may be
seen not onely by the longing marks that are made
on Children, when their Mothers cannot obtain the
thing they so much fancy; thus some have had the
picture of a Cherry or Mulberry, or some such fruit,
imprinted on their body: but also by the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those things that are made on the Children,
wherewith their Mothers were affrighted; thus some
have had the resemblance of a bird, or mouse, or
blood, or some such thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which put the Mother in
a fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95311:16"/>
Did you never see some frantick, distracted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who imagining that they are bound, and tied,
and cannot stir from the place wherein they are, will
lie still, and make great complaints of their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
and not go one step to reach any meat or
drink, that should be laid and placed very near
them, although they were never so much pressed
with hunger, or with thirst; nay, they would not
rise up and run away, though an enemy came to
them with a drawn sword, or though thieves were
rifling all the room, because the apprehension of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tied and bound, is so strong in their fancy, that
it neither can nor will send any spirits into other
parts of the body to cause motion. So when any
persons being frighted with this grievous disease,
shall think of nothing but the <hi>Plague,</hi> and have
their thoughts and fancy fixed Night and Day upon
this <hi>Sickness,</hi> whereof they imagine they shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
die and not escape, it comes to passe that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the <hi>Pestilence</hi> is so strong in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
that they forget and neglect to send any
spirits unto the Heart, to bring it succour and relief,
against its mortal and pernicious enemy.</p>
               <p>Now for remedy against these Passions, Fears, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Frights and Imaginations, which are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discoursed of, than removed. When, nay and
before you are forsaken of Friends, and hear nothing
but complaints of Neighbours, the crying of Wives
and Children, the mourning of Husbands and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the sorrowing of Kinsfolks and Allies, the
<hi>Sickness</hi> spreading, the <hi>Pestilence</hi> raging, and the
<hi>Plague</hi> encreasing from Tens to Hundreds, from Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
to Thousands, and now ready to seize upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95311:17"/>
your self, as it hath done already upon others; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the Disciples prayed in
a Tempest: Call to mind what <hi>David</hi> did when he
was greatly distress'd at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> the Town taken,
sackt, and burnt, by the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> his Wives ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisoners, the Inhabitants carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and those few Souldiers that he had left, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to stone him, 1 <hi>Sam. 30. 6. He comforted himself
in the Lord his God:</hi> Cast off then the love of the
World, let the distrust of Gods mercy be far from
you, use the exercise of a holy Life and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and because it is Gods doing, repine not
at his Providence: use the aforesaid approved su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
remedies. <hi>Faith</hi> is the best fence against
<hi>Fear, Patience</hi> the best plaister against <hi>Sores, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
the best <hi>Restorative,</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> the best
<hi>Antidote.</hi>

               <head>Of the Signs of the Pestilence.</head>
               <p>Although after several evil Aspects and Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Conjunctions of the Planets after bad Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Air, and distemper of the Weather, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dearth of Corn and scarcity of Provision, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the humours of mens bodies have been corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and several Diseases have sprung up, yet no
<hi>Plague</hi> hath followed; and on the contrary, though
after the signs of healthy Seasons, plenty of good
and wholesome Diet, yea and after a most cold and
dry Winter, and in a dry and temperate Summer,
the <hi>Plague</hi> hath risen up and spread abroad; yet
most commonly there have been some Tokens, Signs,
and Fore-runners of it, which have given men an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95311:17"/>
Alarm to pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re for it, expect it, and provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
               <p>These Signs are of two sorts:
<list>
                     <item>1. The Signs of the <hi>Plague</hi> immanent, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</item>
                     <item>2. The Signs of it present and raging.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, The Signs of the <hi>Plague</hi> approaching, may
be observed,</p>
               <p>First, From the Causes producing it: Such as are
the Position of the Heavens, the Conjunction of
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> the appearance of Comets and
Blazing Stars (but what and how much may be from
thence fore-told, I leave to <hi>Astrologers)</hi> such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
are the alterations of the seasons of the year from
their usual temper, such are also the corruption of
the humours, discovered by the frequency of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Fevers and Epidemical Diseases, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moness
of the Small-Pox and Measils, which often
are Fore-runners of the <hi>Plague;</hi> such also are the
Eruptions of Earth-quakes, and digging up several
places of the Earth, especially old sinks and standing
pools that have been formerly stopped up; such is
also Contagion, for if the <hi>Plague</hi> is, or lately hath
been in any Neighbour Country, it doth not usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cease there, but travails from one Place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to another, as Physitians and Historians do at
large relate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Signs of the <hi>Plague</hi> approaching,
may be gathered from the Effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95311:18"/>
First, In the Earth: If Herbs, Plants and Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
do wither almost as soon as spring up, if
the Fruits and Flowers of it be blasted and devoured
by Caterpillars, Spiders, Moths, and such like Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
if there be more than ordinary encrease of
Mushromes, if there hath been a Murrain among
Sheep or Cattel; for though the same <hi>Plague</hi> that
destroys Man, doth not hurt Sheep, neither doth the
same Disease that kills Sheep, presently assault Men,
yet it may so come to pass, that by much and long eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of rotten Mutton, bad humors bred thereby may
arrive to so great a malignity as to kill men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Water: If there be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Frogs and Toads, if Fishes die in Ponds or
Lakes, if the Water of Springs, Pumps, Wells and
Conduits become muddy and troubled.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the Air: If there be more Flies, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs
and Insects than is usual, if Birds die, or forsake
their place, if Flesh sooner putrifie than ordinary,
and Bread sooner become mouldy.</p>
               <p>Simon Kelway <hi>in the third Chapter of his Treatise
of the</hi> Plague, <hi>printed at</hi> London 1593. <hi>hath these
words,</hi> When we see young Children flock themselves
together in Companies, and then will fain some of
their company to be dead amongst them, and so will so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
the Burial in a mournful sort, this is a token
which hath been well observed in our Age to fore-shew
great mortality at hand. <hi>And I have heard that One
did fore-tell our late unhappy Civil Wars, by seeing
Boys and Children make Officers, muster and imitate
the Train-Bands; saying, When he was in</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>before the Wars did there begin, the Children
there did do the like. I remember about twenty
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95311:18"/>
years ago, one of the Chaplains of his late Majesty
King</hi> Charles <hi>the First of ever blessed memory, did
preach at</hi> Bristol <hi>upon this Text out of</hi> Gen. 4. 15.
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain: <hi>And in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
did speak much against black-patches and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-spots,
and among other things, said that they
were fore-runners of other spots, and marks of the</hi>
Plague; <hi>and presently, within a very little while
after, the</hi> Plague <hi>brake out among them, and all
those persons that did wear them, fled the Town.
And when Saint</hi> Andrews <hi>Church-yard wall did break
or fall down this Winter, I heard some prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the coming of the</hi> Plague, <hi>saying,</hi> It fell in like
manner the last great Sickness <hi>in 1625. but what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
these had to say so, I do not fully understand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Signs of the <hi>Plague</hi> raging, are
two-fold:</p>
               <p>First, such as are common to other Diseases.</p>
               <p>Secondly, More proper and peculiar to it self.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Plague</hi> first seizeth upon any particular
person, before many have been infected, it is very
hard to discern it, because it hath divers symptomes
attending it that are common to other diseases, and
there is no one perfect proper, infallible, and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sign to distinguish it, and many excellent and
learned Physicians have disputed and differed much
about it; but when it hath continued a while, and
spread it self abroad among many, it is very easie
to be known.</p>
               <p>As man is called a <hi>Microcosme</hi> or little world, not
only because he partakes something of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ure of
all Creatures, he hath a simple being with things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95311:19"/>
without life; he hath vegetation and growth with
Plants, sense and motion with bruits, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
with the Angels; but also because he hath
in him the resemblance of all Creatures, his flesh
like the soft earth, his bones like the hard stones
and minerals, his hair like the grasse, the blood in
his veins and arteries distributed throughout the
whole body, and all meeting in the heart or liver,
like the rivers and waters dispersed in the earth, and
all meeting in the Sea and Ocean; his breath like
the wind, his head like the heavens, wherein are
seated his eyes, which some compare to the Sun and
Stars: so also is the <hi>Plague</hi> called the <hi>Great Sickness,</hi>
because it borroweth the Symptomes, and includes
and comprehends in it self something of the nature
of all diseases, whereof it is the Abridgement and
Epitome.</p>
               <p>It sometimes begins with a cold shivering like an
Ague, sometimes continues with a mild warmth like
a Hectick Fever or a Diary, and encreaseth with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
heat like a Burning Fever. It corrupteth the
<hi>Blood</hi> and all the humours, it afflicteth the <hi>Head</hi>
with pain, the <hi>Brain</hi> with giddiness, the <hi>Nerves</hi>
with Convulsions, the <hi>Eyes</hi> with dimness, making
them look as if they had wept, and depriving them
of their lively splendor, it makes the <hi>Countenance</hi>
look ghastly, troubling the <hi>Ears</hi> with noise and
deafness; it infecteth the <hi>Breath</hi> with stinking, the
<hi>Voice</hi> with hoarseness, the <hi>Throat</hi> with soreness, the
<hi>Mouth</hi> with drought, and the <hi>Tongue</hi> with thirst;
the <hi>Stomach</hi> with worms and want of appetite, with
hickhop, nauseousness, retching, and vomiting; the
<hi>Bowels</hi> with looseness and the bloody Flix, the <hi>Sides</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95311:19"/>
with stitches, the <hi>Back</hi> with pains, the <hi>Lungs</hi> with
flegme, the <hi>Skin</hi> with fainty and stinking Sweats;
Spots, Blains, Botches, Sores, and Carbuncles, the
<hi>Pulse</hi> with weakness, the <hi>Heart</hi> with sounding and
faintness. It makes feeble like the <hi>Palsie,</hi> it causeth
sleepiness like the <hi>Lethargy,</hi> watchfulness and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
like a <hi>Phrensie,</hi> and sudden death like the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy.</hi>
And these symptomes happen not alike to all,
but differ and vary according to the several constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the parties that are sick. And as in the times of
great Infection all Diseases turn to the <hi>Plague,</hi> so the
<hi>Plague</hi> discovers the symptomes of all those Diseases
whereof it had its beginning and original.</p>
               <p>And, though this grievous <hi>Sickness,</hi> most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comes in state, attended with a Fever, and
strengthened with other maladies, yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
so, for sometimes it comes stealing into the
heart, whereby many have died suddenly, without
the sense of fore-going pain or preceding distemper.
<hi>Iacob de Partibus</hi> tells us of some that in the <hi>Plague</hi>
time bronght him their Urine to look upon, and he
could perceive neither any symptome or grievous Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that they had, and yet they died either before,
or as soon as they went from him. <hi>Alex. Benedictus</hi>
tells of some that whilst they have been employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their business in the House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their trading in the
Market, their devotions in the Church, have died
suddenly; and sundry other Physitians relate the
like, and perhaps the same hath or might have been
observed here at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these Signs that the <hi>Plague</hi> hath in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with other Diseases, it hath some more proper
to it self, and doth incredibly destroy the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95311:20"/>
and weaken Nature, so that in a very short time,
without any manifest reason or fore-going cause, the
party is as weak and faint, as if he had endured
much pain without ease, as if he had watched long
without sleep, as if he had bled extreamly without
stopping it, or purged or vomited exceedingly,
without staying it. It is the most venemous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
of all Diseases, it seiseth upon many, and the
most of them it kills.</p>
               <p>What the event of the <hi>Sickness</hi> is like to be, one
may from hence conjecture and prognosticate:</p>
               <p>First, If the sick party in the very first beginning
of the Disease, and as soon as ever he felt himself
ill, did take some proper and effectual medicine,
and did not vomit or cast it up again; and if by
chance he did cast it up, if presently after he did
take some more of the same, or some other, which
did abide in his stomach, and was digested, and did
make him sweat, and if he grew lightsomer after
Sweat; if the Swellings, Botches, or Carbuncles
quickly arise to a place not dangerous, neither to
the Heart, Neck, Throat, nor about the Ears, and
thereupon the symptomes do abate, if the swellings
be great, or more than one, and quickly break and
run, and come to maturation: If the party hath an
honest careful Nurse, and but one Physitian (for two
Physitians, a wicked Nurse, and the <hi>Plague,</hi> are able
to make an end of any one sick Patient) there is great
probability and hope of his recovery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But if the party hath neglected to take
any approved Cordial or Medicine in the beginning
of the Disease, before he slept, if the swellings be
but small, and arise slowly and near about the heart,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95311:20"/>
if there be more Carbuncles than one, if the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
retire back, and quickly strike in again, if the
party continue light-headed, talke idle or hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions,
or a deep sleep, or be sick after sleep, or
hath no sleep at all, if he hath a great thirst, and
the Tongue be black and scorcht, if the Eyes look
ghastly, the Voice be hoarse, the Nostrils drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
if he say that all things stink; if he purge
or vomit, or bleed at the Nose, and is not better for
it, if he be outwardly cold, and inwardly burn, if
he doth often faint or swoune, for the most part death
follows.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is no Disease more treacherous
and deceitful, for sometimes, when one may think
the worst is past, death is at hand, and when death
seems to be at hand, the party sometimes recovers
beyond hope or expectation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Children are most in danger, Women
with Child next, and young Maids that are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable,
more than Elder or aged persons.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Those that die of the <hi>Plague,</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
to be seen upon them Spots, or Marks, or
Botches, Blains or Carbuncles, and though these
sometimes vanish or disappear, yet the flesh will be
quickly softer in one place than another, and the
whole body, by reason of the corruption of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
will grow limber, and become more soft than
ordinary, and worse coloured than other Corpses,
the Ears also, and the Nails and Nose will wax blew,
as if they had been beaten or bruis'd.</p>

               <head>Of the Preservation from the Pestilence.</head>
               <p>Death is not a greater enemy to Nature, than the
<hi>Pestilence</hi> is a friend to Death, and though it be so
grievous a Disease, against which there is yet known
no general nor infallible Medicine; yet sometimes,
either by the strength of Nature, or help of Physick,
it hath been heal'd and cured. We see there have
been some Houses set on fire, and yet have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
there have been Possessions that have been
enter'd by Adversaries, and yet have been recover'd
and restor'd again to the right and lawful Owners;
there have been Enemies, who have invaded Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and enter'd Towns, and yet have been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
driven out by the Valour of the Inhabitants;
but yet the Housholder could more easily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Fire, than extinguish it; the Farmer with
lesse trouble kept his Possession, than have regain'd
it; and the Citizens with lesse losse and hazard have
defended their Towns and Countries, than have
clear'd them of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> is a Fire that consumeth all before it,
and may quickly bring the body to dust and ashes;
it is an Adversary that riotously makes a forcible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and may assault, wound, and evilly entreat you,
so that it may be despaired of your life, against
whom yon cannot get your damages nor reparation;
it is an enemy that seldome gives Quarter, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys,
spoils, and lays all waste before it, and far more
wisdom it is to prevent the Malady, than to abide the
trouble, cost, and hazard of the Cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95311:21"/>
The way and means of <hi>Preservation</hi> (under Gods
assistance, as in all things, so especially now, we
ought to seek by Prayer and Devotion) consist in
two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. In avoiding all the Causes of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. In strengthening our Bodies against them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>One Cause of the <hi>Sickness,</hi> is the Corruption and
Infection of the Air; for when the <hi>Plague</hi> begins to
raign in any Place, and the <hi>Pestilence</hi> is as it were
sown among the People, the Sick continually not
onely breath out of their Mouths, but send out of
their Bodies infectious steams and vapours, which
being disperst and scattered in the Air, are soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
drawn in by the breath of others; and thence
whole Families are extinguisht, and the <hi>Plague</hi> not
onely creeps, but runs from one House to another:
and hence it is that the <hi>Plague</hi> destroyes more in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
than in Countries, and more in narrow Streets
and Lanes of those Cities, than in open places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
usually there are narrow and little rooms,
which are soonest fill'd with infectious vapours, and
longer keep them in; for though the Air be never so
corrupt, you must draw it in with your breath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
for without it you cannot live an hour. As
meat and drink is the food of our Bodies, so is the
air the nourishment of our Spirits; and therefore as
by unwholsome meat our Bodies are diseased, so by
corrupt air, our Spirits are easily infected, weakened,
and extinguished; and therefore we have good
cause to avoid it, and provide against it. Hence it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95311:22"/>
was that the Ancients (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Questions) did alwayes build the Temple of
<hi>Aesculapius</hi> the supposed God of their Health, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they judged the Country air
more wholesome than the City. And in this case the
Counsel of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in advising to change and flie
the corrupted air, is, and hath been receiv'd as an
Oracle, and as a Proverb generally approved by all,
The Antidote made of three Adverbs, <hi>Cito, Longe,
Tarde, Flie quickly, Go far,</hi> and <hi>Return slowly,</hi> hath
oft-times proved effectual.</p>
               <p>And if any of those that will strain at a Gnat, and
swallow a Camel, should pretend any scruple of
Conscience about the lawfulness of this Remedy, in
<hi>flying</hi> from Infected Places, and say, out of envy,
at the accommodation of others, or discontent that
they are not so well provided themselves, or some
secret design (as I have heard several expresse it)
<hi>The Lord can follow them and find them out;</hi> they
may also understand, that it is not their desire to flie
from his presence, but his Plague, not from their
gracious God, but from his punishing and fearful
rod. Do you not see this sort of people, if they
should be looking out at a window, and it should
chance to thunder and lighten in their faces, would
they not presently turn their backs, and shut the
Casement, and retire inwards? and yet they cannot
think that the Casement can resist Thunder, or the
Glasse keep out Lightning. Do they not in Winter,
Frost, and Snow, wear Muffes and Gloves, and put
on more Apparel? and yet the Psalmist saith, <hi>Who
can stand before his Cold?</hi> Psal. 147. But I shall leave
these people as diseas'd in the Pate, and as I have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95311:22"/>
advis'd all my friends (though much against my own
interest) if possible to remove and change their
dwelling; so I think it no more unlawful for any
persons, whose stay in infected places is not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
than their lives, to take the benefit of better
air, than for a great man that hath a large House, to
remove from one end or side of it, that is infected or
set on fire, to another part of it, that is free and safe
from burning; onely this I shall intreat of all that go
from infected neighbours, that they would thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
adore Gods bounty in providing for them places
of refuge, and part with some of their <hi>Finery,
Pride, Excesse, Prodigality, Superstuity,</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi>
for the <hi>Alms and Relief</hi> of those that are now
brought to great necessity, and send up their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the health of such places, upon which some of
their sins may have helpt to pull down Plagues.</p>
               <p>But as in taking of other Physick, it is necessary
to observe and follow the directions, otherwise you
would run into an Error, and make the Remedy
worse than the Disease; so when you fly from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
places, you must observe the rules to do it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Cito,</hi> Quickly; You must delay no time, but
remove with all speed, least you be arrested by
death, before you go, or carry the <hi>Infection</hi> with
you, either in your own body, which being stirred
and heated with motion, may occasion the humours
to putrefie, and destroy your self; or else in your
cloths, whereby those persons among whom you
come to dwell or sojourn, having not been accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to such evil air out of which you come, may
very easily be infected. <hi>Evagrius lib.</hi> 4. of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
relates that many sound persons coming out of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95311:23"/>
infected places, did infect the Inhabitants, and
brought the <hi>Plague</hi> among them; and the like may
be remembred to be done in later years.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Longe,</hi> Far; When there hath been a little
Cloud dissolved in the air, it hath been observed to
rain sometimes at one end of a Town, and not at all
at another; Mists have been at the tops of the Hill,
when there have been none in the Valley; there
hath been Sun-shine in one Field, and Rain in the
next; it hath snowed in some grounds, when it hath
hail'd in others; fearful Thunders have astonisht the
people in some places, and yet twenty miles off they
have not been heard; but in a great over-casting of
the Heavens, you must not think to get out of the
reach of the Rain or Storm in a little Journey. You
cannot smell Rosemary half a mile in <hi>England,</hi> but
from <hi>Spain</hi> you may smell it many leagues. If the
<hi>Infection</hi> be in a Country Village, a little way will
serve to flie from it, but if it be in a great and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
City, you must go further, and though you
fare worse, you will scape the better.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Tarde;</hi> As you must flie from the infected
place in hast, so you must return to it by leasure;
for you were better stay away a Moneth too long,
than return a day too soon. When a Fox is to passe
over any frozen River, he puts his Ear to the Ice, and
if he hear the Water run, the memory of being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
wet, and the unpleasantnesse of swimming
in the cold, coming to his mind, makes him retire
back. 'Tis no wisdom for you, having taken up a
good shelter, to come out of it into a Storm or
Tempest, till all be calm. Those who are to return
into their homes that have still remained clear from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95311:23"/>
the <hi>Infection,</hi> may do it sooner than those who are
to go into Houses that have been visited. <hi>Infection</hi>
as well as smells and perfumes, may last a long time in
a Garment or Apparel. <hi>Fracastorius</hi> tells of a Furre
Gown (sure it was a mourning Gown) that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
the death of five and twenty men that wore it,
one after another in <hi>Verona,</hi> and died of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
And <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> speaks of Feather-beds
that have held the <hi>Infection</hi> seven years; if you lie
in them too soon, the linnen may prove your Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sheet, and the Down-Bed your Death-bed,
where you may sleep your last, and instead of having
a Good-morrow, bid the World Good-night.</p>
               <p>But least any with over-much care should prejudice
their own private affairs, or the Trade of this <hi>Royal</hi>
City of <hi>London</hi> (whose Wealth and Prosperity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true English-man is oblig'd to seek) he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that in the ending of the last great <hi>Sicknesse</hi>
1625. the people went promiscuously one among a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and the Houses were quickly fill'd with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
and fresh comers out of the Country, and
yet no new <hi>Infection</hi> followed. And I remember
that in the <hi>Loyal</hi> City of <hi>Bristol</hi> (the place where I
was born) about twenty years ago, many Houses
were shut up, and hundreds died every week, of the
<hi>Plague,</hi> both before and during the Siege, whilst it
was kept for the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by
that most renowned and and valiant Commander his
Highnesse Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> but as soon as ever the
Enemies enter'd in, as if the lesser Plague vanisht,
and departed at the approach of a greater, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
made no great difference of quartering in any
Houses or coming into any company, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95311:24"/>
return'd to their forsaken Dwellings at one
Gate, whilst the <hi>Pestilence</hi> went out at the other, and
hath not hitherto return'd again.</p>
               <p>But now if through Poverty and lack of means to
maintain you, and want of friends to receive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you in better air, or having such Callings,
from the attendance whereon, you cannot with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
and good conscience absent your self, but are
enforced still to stay, and cannot possibly avoid the
occasions of the <hi>Sicknesse;</hi> you must then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Strengthen your Bodies against the
Causes of it.</p>
               <p>For which purpose you must look upon the <hi>Plague</hi>
as a most poysonous and pernicious Serpent, as a
most dangerous and deadly Dragon, whose venom
is increased by destroying, and you tied to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with him, where if he assault you, you must
either get the victory, or die upon the spot.</p>
               <p>If you were to defend your self against a thief, a
pistol would perhaps affright him; if to duel a
quarrelsome Hector, a sword or rapier would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you; a staffe will serve to beat a Dog, the
shewing of your self would chase a Fox, and make
him take his kennel; but the <hi>Plague</hi> is so venemous
and destructive an Enemy, that to defend your self,
and get the victory, you must be more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
armed and appointed.</p>
               <p>Imagine then your self to be a Garrison, whereof
you are the Governour, and which you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for to keep upon the hazard of your life,
and in this case do as a most discreet and valiant
Souldier would, to defend and maintain his trust,
and save his honour. He will remove or secure all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95311:24"/>
Traytors, and secret Enemies, cut down all Trees
and Hedges, and burn all Houses wherein the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
may take shelter and annoy him; and spoil all
provisions that may relieve and succour him; he
will repair all breaches and weak places, at which the
Enemy may make a Battery, and seek to enter by As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault;
he will lay in sufficient stores of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Provision; he will fortifie the place with
Trenches, Lines, and Out-works; he will raise and
muster up a sufficient number of Souldiers, and by
good Discipline have them ready at all Postures,
Marches, and Commands; he will furnish himself
with all manner of offensive and defensive Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
Engines, and Fire-works. He will be jealous,
and examine all strangers and unknown persons that
enter in. He will have his Spies abroad for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and never be secure, but alwayes on his
Guard.</p>
               <p>Now in the Body, bad corrupt humours are as
Traytors, which will soon take part with the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and let him in, if you do not suppresse the
breeding of them, and purge them out. All sloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or sluttish nastinesse, all disorder and excess, are
as so many shelters, wherein the Enemy may lurk and
lie in Ambush to assault you. The infirmity or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any part, is a breach, by which the <hi>Sicknesse</hi>
may enter, and which you must make up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to keep him out. Issues and Fontanels, are as
Trenches, Graffes and Ditches; Fumes as Fire-works
and Granadoes; Amulets as Fortifications and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
which you must make to keep him off: The
Natural Animal and Vital Spirits are the Souldiers,
which you must by all means maintain and cherish,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95311:25"/>
revive and comfort, and keep from fear and fainting.
Good Diet and Cordials are the Provision which you
must not want. Medicines are your offensive and
defensive Weapons, to preserve your self, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
your Enemy. Intelligence and knowledge with
whom you do converse, or have to do, are your
Spies, and Carefulness your Guard and Sentinel
that keeps you from being surpriz'd; and little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
you cannot be too careful; for there have
been places that have been betrayed by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
surpriz'd by Ambush, yielded up by Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
starved for scarcity of Provision, surrendred
for lack of Ammunition, could not be made tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Breaches, overcome for want of Souldiers,
taken by letting in unknown Persons, and surpriz'd
by being secure. The City of <hi>Troy</hi> was taken by
bringing in a Wooden Horse, whose Belly was full
of armed <hi>Greeks;</hi> some places have been surpriz'd
by Souldiers covered with a load of Hay; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by Enemies brought in with Houshold-stuffe.
But your life is in greater hazard, it may be lost by a
pair of Gloves, a Periwigge or a Muffe, or any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel;
your destruction may be brought upon you
by your Meat from the Shambles, by your Wine
from the Tavern, by your Bread from the Bakers,
by your Drink from the Brewers; it may come in a
Nose-gay from the Garden, in Herbs from the Fields,
in Fruit from the Market; it may be handed to you
by the Water you wash in, it may be drawn in by the
Air you breath in; and as at other times you are so
frail, that your breath (so in times of <hi>Infection</hi> your
Death) may be in your Nostrils.</p>

                  <head>Secondly, To strengthen our Bodies against
the Causes of Infection.</head>
                  <p>One Cause of <hi>Infection,</hi> is, the Corruption of the
Air; and the way to fortifie our selves against it, is,
to correct and purifie it.</p>
                  <p>And here the Air may be considered two wayes:
<list>
                        <item>First, In General.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, In Particular.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The General Air, is, that of all the Region and
Place where people live, which is, and may be
purged by cleansing and removing all filthy and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
things out of the Streets, and adjacent
places. Physitians, in the time of great and grievous
<hi>Plagues,</hi> have used several means, and tried divers
wayes to clear and purifie the Air. Some direct to
make great fires in the Streets, as <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> did in
the <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and burning among them
sweet Odors, Spices and Perfumes, Fragrant Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Compositions, whereby he freed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from <hi>Infection.</hi> Some would have Guns and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
discharged in the Streets, especially in hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and this makes a greater commotion, though
less heat and inflamation. <hi>Cardanus</hi> directs to burn
leather, and things that send out strong scents, though
they be never so odious and stinking. Others, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Benedictus,</hi> would have Dogs kill'd, and
left in the Streets unburied, that the Carrion smell
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95311:26"/>
might expel the venom of the putrid air; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for this reason, that poysons have not onely
an Antipathy to their Antidotes, but also sometimes
to one another, it being no more unusual for one
poyson, than for one heat, to drive out the other.
Moreover, seeing that everything doth work upon its
like, and there ought to be something agreeable and
suitable between the Agent and the Patient (as we see
that oylwill presently mixe &amp; incorporate with grease
or wax, but not with vinegar, and many gums will
dissolve in vinegar, that will not melt nor mix with
oil) it might be probable, that in an extraordinary
<hi>Infection,</hi> those odious scents being somewhat of
the same nature with those poysonous vapours that
caus'd the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> might incorporate with them,
and carry them away, whereas delightful and better
odors and perfumes, by reason of the contrariety
of their Nature, might have no effect upon them.
<hi>Rodericus a Castro</hi> would have Kine and Oxen driven
up and down the Streets, that the impurity of the
air might be cleansed by the sweet smell of their
breath; and I have heard the smell of Sheep very
much commended; and some have also suspected it,
least their flesh afterwards when they come to be
kill'd should poyson the eaters. But as the same
Plague and Murrain that kills Sheep and Beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will
not hurt men, so will not the Plague that kills men,
hurt Sheep or Cattel.</p>
                  <p>The particular air is that in our own private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and which we breath into us, and this is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Smells</hi> or <hi>Fumes,</hi> of both which, as well sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as compound, there are a very great number
prescribed by Physitians. I shall commend this.

it, and make it admirable: And if you cannot get
all the aforesaid roots, get as many as you can, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
a proportionable quantity of <hi>Vinegar.</hi>

Also, The <hi>Vrine</hi> of a <hi>Goat</hi> is much commended by
the Arabian Physitians, <hi>Avenzoar</hi> and <hi>Averroes,</hi> as
having in its smell a specifick and appropriate quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to help the infection of the ayre. And <hi>Mercuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
tells that he went to <hi>Vienna</hi> to medicine <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> one day when he
dined with the Chancellor of <hi>Hungary,</hi> he espied
a great <hi>Goat,</hi> and asking the reason why it was there
kept, they told him for an Antidote against the
<hi>Plague.</hi> And there is as good reason for it, as the
smell of a Fox should be a defensative against the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
and it is not for nothing that Physitians prescribe
the burning of <hi>Goats</hi> Horn, as a good Fume against
pestilential and infected Air.</p>
                     <p>For as the air is corrected by <hi>Smells,</hi> so is it also
by <hi>Fumes,</hi> of which there are multitudes prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and I shall commend this.</p>
                     <p>Take either some plain <hi>White-wine Vinegar,</hi> or
compounded as aforesaid, and put it into a perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
pot, either by it self or with <hi>Rose water,</hi> or any
other sweet water, or with any perfume, or put it on
a hot Fire-shovel, and let it smoke about the House.</p>
                     <p>Also, The <hi>American Silver-weed,</hi> or <hi>Tobacco,</hi> is
very excellent for this purpose, and an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against bad air, being smoked in a pipe, either
by it self, or with <hi>Nutmeg</hi> shred, and <hi>Rew Seeds</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it; especially if it be nosed; for it cleanseth
the air, and choaketh, suppresseth, and disperseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
venemous vapour; it hath singular and contrary
effects, it is good to warm one being cold, and will
cool one being hot. All Ages, all Sexes, all Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
Young and Old, Men and Women, the
Sanguine, the Cholerick, the Melancholy, the Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95311:27"/>
take it without any manifest inconvenience;
it quencheth thirst, and yet will make one more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and fit to drink; it abates hunger, and yet will
get one a good stomach; it is agreeable with mirth
or sadness, with feasting and with fasting; it will
make one rest that wants sleep, and will keep one
waking that is drowsie; it hath an offensive smell to
some, and is more desirable than any perfume to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
that it is a most excellent preservative, both
experience and reason do teach, it corrects the air
by <hi>Fumigation,</hi> and it avoids corrupt humours by
<hi>Salivation:</hi> for when one takes it either by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in the leaf, or smoaking it in the Pipe, the
humors are drawn and brought from all parts of the
body, to the stomach, and from thence rising up to
the mouth of the Tobacconist, as to the helme of a
Sublimatory, are voided and spitten out.</p>
                     <p>There is also a fume made of Brimstone and Saltpetor,
but of this in the latter end of the Book.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, To guard your self from the corrupted
air, you may do well, not to walk abroad till the
Sun hath drawn up and disperst all foggy vapours,
and to be within doors at Noon and the heat of the
day, when the pores being more open, are apter to
receive <hi>Infection,</hi> and not to be abroad in the Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine,
whose beams are hurtful; nor at Night, when noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
things may be thrown out of doors or windows
into the Streets; or when the diseased persons with
sores about them, either by their own craft or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of their Keepers, obtain liberty to go abroad.</p>
                     <p>The Second Cause of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> is the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Humors, which you must be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to defend your self from as against the Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95311:28"/>
of the Air: And how that may be done by
<hi>Bleeding, Purging, Vomiting, Sweating,</hi> and <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

not in my Practise been unfortunate therein; but
have seen Diseases that have been exasperated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and do think it most commonly so excellent a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that many Patients admitting thereof, would
much shorten the time, and lessen the cost and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their Sickness, and not stand-in need of one

yet none are yet known, that will safely
purge bloud or lessen it; yet I cannot in this case of

open a Vein, but rather disswade them from it.
And because it may take better from another of more

authority than my self, I have gotten <hi>Iacob Sylvius</hi>
in his Book of the <hi>Blague</hi> to deliver his opinion in
plain English. <hi>As for Blood-letting</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is
no way profitable for the preventing of this Disease,
because the bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being diminished, the body is made
more: open and lyable to external injuries, and the
strength decayes by the loss of blood, the food and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of life.</hi> Of the same mind also is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Physitian <hi>Sennertus,</hi> who though in the cure
of most other Diseases he begins with Phlebotomy,
yet in this forbids it; and the most learned <hi>Riverius</hi>
is of opinion, that bleeding causeth one to be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the more easily, as also to escape the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it being in this venemous Disease as in those that
have taken poyson, who by bleeding draw the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
inward, and very difficulty are recovered, and
therefore upon the very suspition of being poyson'd,
most skilful Physitians abstain from letting blood:
Nevertheless, they conclude, that if there be any
notable fulness of blood, or necessary evacuation
suppressed, a vein may be opened upon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

because foul bodies are more subject to <hi>Infection</hi>

he may be endangered as much as by the <hi>Plague.</hi>
There have been several purging medicines directed
by Physitians, and I shall prescribe these.</p>
                     <p>The Pills of <hi>Ruffus,</hi> otherwise called the Common
or <hi>Pestilential Pills,</hi> are very excellent, you may
take of them once or twice a week when you go to
bed; the dose of them is half a dram for an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
constitution, or a whole dram for a strong man.
You may have them at any Apothecaries, or else
make such like yourself.</p>
                     <p>Take fine <hi>Aloes</hi> two ounces, fine Myrrhe one
ounce, <hi>English Saffron</hi> half an ounce, make them
into powder, and with <hi>Venice Turpentine</hi> make them
into pills; and take half a dram, or a whole dram,
as aforesaid. The <hi>Aloes</hi> clears the Stomach from bad
humors, and the belly from worms, the <hi>Myrrhe</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the body from Putrefaction, the <hi>Saffron</hi> cheers
the Spirits, and the <hi>Turpentine</hi> is good against the
<hi>Pestilence.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>Or else take this.</head>
                     <p>Dissolve an ounce and a half of <hi>Manna</hi> in six
ounces or a little draught of spring water, and one
spoonful of vinegar warmed together on the fire,
then strain it, and take an ounce of <hi>Venice Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
and put to it the yolke of a new laid egge, and
stir it about, and mixe it, and it will look like cream,
then by little and little put to it the liquor, being first
quite cold, wherein the <hi>Manna</hi> was dissolved, and
stir it about, and drink it up, and keep warm, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your self as is usual in other purges or vomits,
when it works upwards you may take posset drink
and downwards broth: If it had a pleasant taste,
those that know the vertue of it, would never take
any other medicine: It is strong enough for any of
the strongest constitution, and for those that are
weaker, six drams, or half an ounce of Turpentine
is dose enough.</p>

                     <p>Although you defend your self never so safely
from the evil air, and retain your Blood as the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and maintain your Spirits as the guard of your
life; though you purge out vicious humors, and
sweat out bad vapours; yet if you by any neglect,
disorder, excess, or defect, do recruit those humors,
corrupt your blood, or spend your spirits, it will be
to no more purpose, than if you had washt your

tumble them in the dirt, or trample them in the

                     <p>By Observation of Diet, Physicians understand,
the well ordering of a mans self in those six things
which they call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Non-Natures,</hi> the Air, Sleep, and
Watching, the Passions of the Mind, Labour and
Rest, Repletion and Evacuation, Meat and Drink,
which some have called the six strings of <hi>Apollo's</hi>
Harp, wherein consists the harmony of health: If
these be in tune, the body is sound, but if any of
these be skrewed up too high by any excess, or
slackened too low by any defect, or intemperately u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
then is the body put out of tune, and made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to diseases.</p>
                     <p>1. For the <hi>Air,</hi> let it not be too cold nor too hot,
and choose rather to wear by day, and to be covered,
at night, with too many cloths, than too few; and
let your apparel be rather stuff then cloth, which will
soonest catch, and longest hold <hi>Infection:</hi> but take
heed of too great heat. <hi>Mercurialis</hi> tells of many
Smiths and Glass-men that died in the <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
who by the heat of fire had made their bodies
too open and apt to receive <hi>Infection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. As for <hi>Sleep,</hi> let it be moderate, and take heed
of too much watching.</p>
                     <p>3. Let your Passions be calm'd, and your mind
serene, and as much as possible refrain Anger and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Fear.</p>
                     <p>4. Let your Exercise be moderate, and forbear
over-heating your body, whereby you will be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to draw in more air; and it hath been observed
that many hard Labourers, have not onely been infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but died of the <hi>Plague.</hi>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95311:31"/>
5. For Repletion and Evacuation, take heed of
Excess, and keep your body neither too loose nor
costive: Look upon <hi>Venus</hi> to be as great a friend to
the <hi>Plague</hi> as <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the Venereal
Marks and Swellings no preservative against the
Spots and Botches of the <hi>Pestilence.</hi> It is no lesse
unfortunate and wretched, than devillish and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
advice, for any to get the <hi>Pox,</hi> to avoid the
<hi>Plague;</hi> for Experience, which is the Mistriss of
Fools, hath taught some, that have no care of their
souls, that it is as dangerous for the body to go into
some other Houses, as into a Pest-House.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, For <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> you are to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
not onely to the <hi>Quality,</hi> that it be good and
wholesome (and take heed of surfetting on any
Summer fruit) but also to the <hi>Quantity</hi> of what
you take. As the body is not to be weakened, nor
the Spirits spent with Fasting, so is it not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged
with Surfetting: They that will eat
till they can feel the meat with their fingers, and
drink till they can paddle with the liquor in their
throats, and be ready to shed it out of their mouths,
are in the way of cutting their throat with their
tongue, and digging their grave with their teeth.
<hi>Mercurialis</hi> saith of his own knowledge, <hi>They are
much deceiv'd, who think to preserve themselves by
eating and drinking;</hi> and tells of many great drinkers
both at <hi>Padua</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> that died of the <hi>Plague,</hi>
from which they thought to preserve themselves
by drinking Wine. It was the Saying of a Politician,
that, <hi>Maxima pars frugalitatis est bene domatus ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
so it may be the Aphorisme of a Physitian,
<hi>Maxima pars sanitatis est bene domatus venter.</hi>

As he that loveth pleasure, will not be quickly rich,
so he that is given to excess, will not be long well.
Temperance and Abstinence as they are not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
against most diseases, as <hi>Lessius</hi> treats at large
in his Spare Diet, and <hi>Cornaro</hi> made experiment, by
a little and very wholesom food, so are they also a
great corrector of any inconvenience that comes by
evil nourishment. When the impregnable City of
<hi>Carlile,</hi> under the government of the most invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and resolute Governour Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> in
the late Wars, was besieged by an Army of Warlike
<hi>English</hi> and hardy <hi>Scots,</hi> there was great scarcity of
Provision; the besieged did eat all the Dogs and
Cats, never Roast-beef was sold so dear as Horse-flesh;
of which when Horses were kill'd and sold in
the Market, no Family for their money, might have
above their allowance; the best provision that an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
wife could procure whil'st she lay in Child-bed,
was a young Colt: the Souldiers were allowed but
two meals a week, and that was a quantity of beans,
and the water they were boil'd in, and yet so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
as to say, <hi>Give us but a Bean a Day, and we
will keep the Town.</hi> Though the City was full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
and Garrison Souldiers, and many of the
Loyal Gentry, and divers Valiant Knights, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and tender Ladies came to live there, to defend,
and be defended in the place; yet during all that
Siege of above forty weeks, as I have been credibly
inform'd, there was not one person sick or died, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one Woman, who surfeited upon Bread made

the most grievous <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> described by

with your Diet something that is cordial, as Vinegar

                     <p>Seeing it may easily come to pass, that in unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
times, notwithstanding the most exact Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Diet, some bad humours may be bred in the
body, which may prove offensive to Nature, it will
be convenient to have recourse to issues, one in the
left arm, and the other in the right leg or thigh,
and by how much the greater is your danger, the
more issues you ought to make: the benefit will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the trouble, for they evacuate excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
humours, which might become a receptacle
for the <hi>Sickness;</hi> for the prevention whereof, they
have been found a sovereign and useful remedy.
<hi>Mercurialis</hi> in the 23. Chapter of his Book of the
<hi>Plague,</hi> saith, <hi>That he did not onely find these</hi> Issues
<hi>to be much commended by</hi> Nicholaus Florentinus, <hi>a
Physitian of great authority, but hath also proved
them to be excellent by his own experience, and that
he can testifie, that amongst almost an innumerable
company which he saw dead of the</hi> Plague, <hi>he never
saw but one that had an issue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and desirous to be further
satisfied, he made inquiry among other Physitians, who
testified the same, that they likewise never saw one dead
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95311:33"/>
that had an Issue.</hi> Which may be an argument that
they are very helpful, and there is good reason for it;
because like sinks they continually drain the body of
superfluous humours. And <hi>Skenkius</hi> in his Sixth
Book of his Observations concerning <hi>Epidemical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
relates, that many make Issues and raise Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
with prosperous and good successe of health
and safety, although they do converse with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of them that die. And for this purpose Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
forbid the drying up of running sores, the
healing of filthy ulcers, or striking in the itch.</p>
                     <p>And though some may say, <hi>It is good sleeping in a
whole skin,</hi> yet it is not good dying in one; and you
were better to have your skin broken with a Launce
or Cautery, than with a Botch or Blain; and you
will find it lesse cost, pain, or trouble, to go to a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
to make an Issue, than to have him come to
you to dress a Carbuncle: Or else you may make
one your self, for to handle a Launcet is as soon
learn'd as to sew with a Needle; and you may soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
grow expert to cut your skin, than to work
Cut-work: and though it may seem irksome to keep
them alwayes running, yet there is no more danger
of drying them up, when the Cause for which they
were made is removed, than there would be to
heal a cut in the arm, or broken shin, that hath been
sore, or run a quarter of a year: and though some
have died that have had Issues, and neglected other
helps, 'tis no more disparagement to the Medicine,
than that a Town having good ditches, should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by an Enemy that entred in at the Gates that lay
open and secure, and which ought to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by other helps and forces.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amulets</hi> are certain outward medicines most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
made of poysonous things, hung about the
Neck and worn upon the Breast, supposed to have
a hidden power and secret vertue to defend the
heart from the venom of the <hi>Pestilence.</hi> They are
worn upon the breast, because the heart is the place
principally affected in this Disease: but whence and
how they have their operation, the learned differ
and vary in opinion.</p>
                  <p>Some think that the heart becomes thereby some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more familiar and accustomed to poyson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
will not so easily be hurt and overcome by it.</p>
                  <p>Others are of opinion, That <hi>Arsnick,</hi> and such
like hot things, whereof <hi>Amulets</hi> are made, do dry
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95311:34"/>
up noxious humours, and disperse offensive vapours,
as we see the heat of fire drieth moisture, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>Others think that these <hi>Amulets</hi> being plac't neer
the Heart, the Vital Spirits do thereupon, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
aversenesse and antipathy unite themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and become the stronger; as we see Springs and
Fountains, by reason of the coldness of the ambient
Air in Winter time, do keep in all their heat, and
even smoke with warmth.</p>
                  <p>Others say it is done by Atraction, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
said, <hi>That hot Bread and Onions will draw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them all the Infection in the Room.</hi> And these <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets</hi>
by a kind of sympathy do intercept the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential
vapours before they can be receiv'd into the
body; or else presently draw them out before they can
settle there to do any mischief to the Heart, it being
in this case as with one that is stricken of a Viper or
Scorpion, who is best cured by applying and binding
to the place the bruised body of the beast that stung
him, and if they cannot get that, they apply some
other venemous creature, and the party will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be relieved, as if the venome had been drawn
out by a Cupping-Glasse; for one poyson having a
conformity with another, doth move and joyn it
self unto it, and affecteth union with it; even as
we see, that holding a burnt hand to the fire, draws
out the heat; and bathing a frozen member in
Spring-water, helps it of the cold and numbness.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever the cause be, they are much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
and <hi>Mercurialis</hi> that prescribes this, saith
that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth did wear one.</p>

Take of white Arsenick two ounces, white Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
and <hi>English</hi> Saffron, of each two drams, of

in Rose-water, make them into little Cakes about
the breadth of a Shilling, and the thickness of two

                  <p>Skenkius <hi>commends this:</hi> Take white Arsenick
two ounces, yellow Arsenick one ounce, powder
them, and with the white of an Egge, or Gum Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
dissolv'd in water, make them into Cakes, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.</p>
                  <p>Some there be, that would have onely a piece of
Arsenick sewed in Silk, and worn in the bosome, and
have little or nothing mixt with it, least it should
hinder its vertue and efficacy of operation; others
put in many things, that some of them might meet
with and resist the pestilential venom, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is not of the same, but of a different and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nature.</p>
                  <p>Sennertus <hi>directs this:</hi> Take of white Arsenick
two ounces, Zedoary two drams, Saffron one scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Camphire half a dram; beat all into powder,
and with <hi>Gum Arabick</hi> dissolv'd in Rose-water, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
make it into Cakes.</p>
                  <p>Rhenanus <hi>commends this as the most perfect Amulet,
which hath this property, to be moist, and as it were
sweat, at the approach or presence of the Pestilential
venom, and they are then to be dried at the fire, or
over a fume.</hi> Take (saith he) of white and yellow
Arsenick of each half an ounce, the powder of dried
Toads two ounces, <hi>Mercury</hi> sublimed, Wheat Flowre,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95311:35"/>
the Roots of Dittany, of each three drams, Saffron,
the Fragments of Jacynth and Emerald, of each one
scruple, make them all into powder, and with Gum
Dragon dissolved in Rose-water, make them into
Cakes, and dry them as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you that you must not eat them,
but sew them in a little silk bag, fastening it to a rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
and hanging it about your Neck, let it lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of your Breast. You are to avoid
all violent exercise and over-heating of your self, for
fear of growing fainty whilest you wear it.</p>
                  <p>I have known some of these worn in the City of
<hi>Bristol,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and the parties
sometimes would have little pimples like the Itch,
rise about the breadth of the Amulet in their Breast,
which they did rub and scratch, but never had the
<hi>Plague,</hi> and are alive till now.</p>
                  <p>There are also some Physitians that praise Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
as the best, and prefer it before any other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet.
Its vertue was found out thus, It is usual
with the <hi>Italian</hi> women to wear Quick-silver in
their bosomes, enclosed in a Quill or Nut-shell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the drying up of their Milk, because by atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
grosse humours, and rarifying thick blood
in the veins, which could not passe the kernels of the
Breast, the Milk is thereby increased: Now it so fell
out, that during the <hi>Plague</hi> all those women that wore
it, escaped <hi>Infection,</hi> and it hath since that grown
in request, and hath been fortunately tried seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times. And there be those which say they have
known the shell break, and the Quick-silver fall out
at the very instant that the ware was infected, and
this might be by the super-abundance of the force
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95311:35"/>
and matter of the Contagion, which so little Quick-silver
could no longer resist or contain.</p>
                  <p>It is made thus.</p>
                  <p>Bore a hole in a Filberd or Hazel-nut, and with a
Needle pick out the kernel, and fill the shell with
Quick-silver, and stop the hole with waxe, and wear
it in your bosome, sewed in a little purse or bag of
silk.</p>
                  <p>And whereas divers Physitians have not onely
spoke but writ against these Amulets, so likewise
there are many altogether as learned, that have us'd
them; and whereas some might question the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of any inward benefit by such external applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
one may also ask them if they did never hear
of pigeons applied to the feet, and compounded
mixtures to the wrists, and plaisters to the Stomachs
and Navels of sick Patients, to draw out such vapours
and humours which infest the body. 'Tis no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter for an Apothecary to make a little ball,
which being held in the hand, and smell'd to at the
nose, will extreamly purge his Patient. Many have
had their Bladder hurt, by having a blistering plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
put to the Neck. And <hi>Skenkius</hi> mentions some
that pist blood, by carrying <hi>Cantharides</hi> about them
in their purse or pocket. There be them that will
tell you that the liver of a Frog applied to the
heart will mitigate the fits of a burning Fever. A
ring made of an Elkes claw is good against the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Sicknesse, and some have been helpt by wearing
a Piony Root about their Neck. It is for some good
reason that Gold is given to those that are cured of
the Kings-Evil. Several restless and unquiet persons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95311:36"/>
have found ease by wearing of a spleen stone. The
<hi>Aetites</hi> or Stone found in an Eagles Nest, if worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the middle of a woman with-child, preserves
her from miscarrying; but if below the thigh, doth
hasten her delivery; and if not then taken away, her
death. A piece of a dried Toad sewed in silk, and
worn in the bosome, helps bleeding at the Nose, so
doth the <hi>Heliotropian</hi> and <hi>Cornelian</hi> Bloud-stone
worn in bracelets about the Wrists or Neck. Why
may not then such things whereof Amulets are made,
have operation against the <hi>Pestilence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you fear the danger of having them near
you, because they are esteemed venemous, it may
be said that Glass taken inwardly by its cutting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
quality may prove as deadly as Arsnick, which
being worn only outwardly, may be as innocent as
Glass; and Quick-silver worn before your bosome,
may be as harmlesse as that behind your Looking-glasse.
The <hi>Plague</hi> is a venemous Disease, and you
were better wear poyson on the out-side of your skin,
than the in-side of your heart; and though some
have died with Amulets about their Necks, so also
have there with my Lady <hi>Kents</hi> powder in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and the last liquor they have taken, hath been
<hi>Aqua Mirabilis,</hi> and yet both cordial and harmless.
You know Out-works may be useful for some Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though perhaps by carelessnesse they have been
surpriz'd by the Enemy, and have no way benefited
that Town which they were made for to defend.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95311:36"/>
in it something of the Nature of all other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
so we have hitherto already spoken of some
general helps that belong to the cure of other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
as well as of the <hi>Plague;</hi> but because it hath
in it something more than ordinarily opposite, and
pecullarly dstructive to the Vital Spirits, we come
now to speak of such Medicines which have a more
than ordinary, and especial vertue to resist its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome,
and preserve the heart; and these are <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes,</hi>
which are to encounter the Disease not onely
afar off, where we may chance to meet with it as we
go abroad, but also neer at hand, when it comes to
assault us at the doors and seize upon us in our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And here 'tis necessary to give direction,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>What is to be done, when there is one sick or
dead in the House wherein we live.</head>
                     <p>This question may well be askt, because the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is great, since you are more apt to draw in the
infected air, which the sick continually are breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out; yet if the sick recover, the venome of the
Disease is then conquered and dispersed, and seldom
any of that family fall desperately ill, after the first
hath escaped; but this danger is far more, when
there is one lies a dying, for it is observable, that
then many of the Family are infected; since Nature
in the sick doth by all means endeavour to drive out
the venome by the breath and pores. 'Tis in this
case as when a Lamp or Candle burns, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
some fume, that rises from the flame, which
would blacken any thing held neer or over it; but
this is very little offensive, because the stinking noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
vapour is consumed by the flame before it can
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95311:37"/>
reach to any considerable distance, but when it is
just burning or blown out, there comes from the
the week or cotton, a most noisom smell which
spreads it self over all the room. Now in this case
you must be as careful as you can to avoid the parties
breath, and some Physitians advise to put a piece of
hot bread before his mouth, to receive the <hi>Infection,</hi>
and afterwards be sure to burn it. Some counsel to
put a pail or two of hot water in the Chamber:
Some also put in a handful of green Copperas in the
water, and afterwards throw in three or four hot
burning bricks.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, you must be sure to take
<hi>Antidotes, Vinegar</hi> either simple or compound, as
you were before directed, against the infectious
Air.</p>
                     <p>Also for your preservation, this Antidote is very
excellent: Take <hi>Diascordium</hi> two ounces, <hi>Venice
Treacle</hi> three drams, Confection of <hi>Iacynth</hi> two
drams, Nutmeg, Seeds of <hi>Rew,</hi> Root of <hi>Angelica,
Zedoary</hi> and <hi>Elicampane</hi> of each two drams powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Vinegar two ounces, Oil of Sulphur twenty four
drops, Syrup of the Juice of Citron, or Gilly-flowers
enough to make it into a moist Electury; and very
often, or six or eight times a day, take of it as much
as a pease, and let it dissolve in your mouth, and
swallow it down.</p>
                     <p>Or else use the tincture of Roses hereafter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                     <p>Or if you are hot and drie, and have a desire to
drink, you may take as much Conduit or Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as you please, and drop into it as many drops of
Oyl of Sulphur or Oyl of Vitriol, or Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95311:37"/>
as will make it as sharp as you desire to drink
it, and the sharper it is, the better; then sweeten it
with Sugar, and drink it up. You will find the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertues of Vitriol in the directions how to make
Tincture of Roses.</p>
                     <p>If sometimes you cannot be without strong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
you may drink <hi>Aqua Petasitis Composita,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
or <hi>Imperial-water,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Mirabilis,</hi> or <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle-water</hi>
at the Apothecaries; or some of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that goes by the Name of the Lady <hi>Allens</hi>
Water.</p>
                     <p>If you must needs have Wine, you may put to a
quart of Wine a dram of <hi>Angelica</hi> root, or of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayerva</hi>
root, or <hi>Virginia Snakeweed,</hi> and one Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg
bruised.</p>
                     <p>You may sometimes eat this breakfast, sprinkle
Vinegar on toasted bread, then spread it with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and put on it the powder of a Nutmeg, and eat
it fasting.</p>
                     <p>Or else this, Toast a Nutmeg till it sweat, then
powder it, and put to it as much salt as you would
eat with one bit of meat, and mixe it with two spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls
of Vinegar, and eat it.</p>
                     <p>Or else this, Take twenty leaves of Rew, one
grain of Salt, two Figgs, and two Walnuts, eat
these sometimes in a morning fasting.</p>
                     <p>Wallnuts have a strange vertue against the <hi>Plague</hi>
and Worms, and <hi>Droetus</hi> tells of one that was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for spreading of the <hi>Plague,</hi> that confest he
took nothing to preserve himself, but a Wallnut roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and a little burnt. Women with-child, may

or preserved; or drink a little Zedoary and

Nutmeg, with Sugar, in a Glasse of Wine, Beer, or
Ale.</p>
                     <p>If there be any infants that can take nothing, wash
their bodies all over with Vinegar, at Night when
they go to Bed; once or twice a week you may do
so to elder children; and use it your self.</p>
                     <p>If you have neglected to make an Issue, you must
lay one or two blistering plaisters broader than a five
shilling piece, to the in-side of one of your arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Elbow and Shoulder, and when it hath
raised a great Blister, which will be in about twelve
hours, you may take it off, and lay on the place
some <hi>Melilot</hi> plaister, or else a Plantain or Colewort
Leaf, and change it twice a day; and when that
Blister is heal'd begin to make another in the other
arm or thigh, and keep one sore all the while you
fear the <hi>Infection.</hi> You may have plaisters at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries,
or else make one your self thus; Take
six <hi>Spanish</hi> Flies, shread them very small, and mixe

Dough, or Leaven moistened with a little Vinegar,
spread it on leather and apply it.</p>
                     <p>Let care be taken how Bread is brought home
from the Bakers, because it will draw to it any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

                     <p>Be careful that your victuals stand not neer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and if you want room, cover it with a cloth

Coolers, Consumptions with Restoratives, Poysons
with Antidotes; so Fear must be cured by its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hope. The Industrious Chymists in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
observe some resemblance and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Agent and Patient, the Disease and the
Remedy; <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> will melt Silver, but not
Brimstone; Myrrhe and Frankincense will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
in water, so will Gum Dragon and Arabick,
because they are of a watery Nature: Sulphureous
Diseases must be removed with Sulphur Medicines,
Salt Diseases dissolv'd with Salts, Mercurial Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with Mercurial Remedies, Tartareous pains
eas'd with Tartar, and the Stone is best cured
with Stones, such as are <hi>Lapis Lincis, Spongiae, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicus,</hi>
&amp;c. so Imagination must be cured with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,
one Fancy by another, and Conceit is
the best Receit for an Opinion. Thus <hi>Trallianus</hi> tells
of one that imagined he had a Snake in his Belly, who
was cured by conveying a Snake into the Bason,
when his vomit wrought. Another thought he had
Sparrows in his Head, and was cur'd by one that
brought some in his sleeve, who fumbling about his
Ears, made him believe he took them out from
thence. One fancied that he had so big a Nose,
that he could not go abroad for fear of peoples
treading on it in the Streets, and was cured by a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95311:39"/>
Physitian, who coming to the Chamber Door, seem'd
to be stopt for making further entrance, and being
askt why he came not in, desired the Patient to put
aside his Nose, that he might get by it, without
treading on it; the Patient did so with his hand,
the Doctor gravely enters by the wall, and seem'd
very careful of his staffe and steps; the Patient is
well pleased at the Doctors plain dealing with him,
in acknowledging he had that Disease which his
Friends and Family did deny, and said, <hi>He was sure
he was the man that of all others must do the Cure,
and desires his help.</hi> The Doctor scarifies his Nose,
and let's run upon and from it a great quantity of
bloud that he had brought with him enclosed in an
empty gut, and clapt a plaister to it; and in a few
dayes he grew well.</p>
               <p>Imagination directs and moves the spirits and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
to such parts the fancy runs upon; if one
mind eating, the spirits run to the Stomach, and help
digestion; if venereal things, the spirits are sent to
those parts that serve for generation; if one be stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
they have recourse to the brain, to help the
memory and further invention; in one that is a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
they descend to the feet, and help the legs in
running; in one that is quarrelsome they flie to his
hands, and his fingers itch to be a fighting; and in
the sick that think well of Cordials, the spirits passe
presently from the <hi>Speculum</hi> or <hi>Septum Lucidum,</hi>
which is the Seat of Fancy in the Head, by a Nerve
which Anatomists observe to reach to the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Heart, where it begets hope, and this
hope makes confidence, and confidence brings joy,
and joy excites heat, which reviveth the spirits,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95311:39"/>
whereby they better digest their Medicine, and as
it were joyn forces to overcome the Malady. This
hope makes them obey the Doctors precepts, and
think highly of his Medicines, and those Medicines
that conceited persons think well of, the Stomach
desires more earnestly, keeps them the more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and digests them perfectly, whereas the best Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
that they are averse to, doth do them little
good; and it is for nothing that people desire a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Physitian: Think well then of your Doctor,
and oblige him whilest you are in health, to venture
his life to preserve you when you are sick; and think
gold ill saved from Apothecaries, to procure you and
and your Houshold the richest Medicines, if it must
be laid out on Mercers and Taylors to provide your
Family mourning.</p>
               <p>This Electuary is very excellent both against Fear,
and a good preservative against the Plague; Take
Conserve of Roses, Gilly-flowers, Borage and Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss
Flowers of each two ounces, Candied Orange-flowers,
Candied Citron, of each two ounces, Powder
of <hi>Laetificans Galeni</hi> half an ounce, Cinnamon, <hi>Zedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Roman, Doronicum</hi> of each two drams, Saffron one
dram, make those things into powder that are to be
powdered, and with syrup of the rinds of Citron
make an Electuary, of which you are to take the
quantity of a great Nutmeg Morning and Evening.</p>

               <head>Of the Cure of the Pestilence.</head>
               <p>It was the direction of a wealthy Citizen, when
he took an Ingenious Youth an Apprentice into
his House, that by reason of the badnesse of the
times, he should think every one that he did not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95311:40"/>
know, which came into the Shop, to be a thief:
Now in these dangerous and contageous times,
when all Diseases are so apt to turn into the <hi>Plague,</hi>
you may do well to suspect every Disease to be
the same; and though it come like some old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomer,
disguised like the Head-ach, which you
have formerly had after too liberal drinking; or
like some pain about the Stomach which hath opprest
you after excessive feeding, or some old Fever or
Ague that you have formerly been acquainted with;
yet suspect it to be the <hi>Plague,</hi> and trust not to your
own strength, in hope that you shall grow better, for
fear you should grow worse; for he that delayes to
take Medicines before his strength fails, is almost in
as bad or worse case, than he that would not make
use of a ladder, till after he had broke his Neck. In
this case the opinion of the most judicious <hi>Sennertus</hi>
is very considerable, lib. 4 <hi>of Fevers</hi> cap. 6. <hi>I think</hi>
(saith he) <hi>so many men do die of the Plague, because
most of them take Antidotes too late; who might have
been recover'd, if they had took them sooner, before
the venome of the Disease had corrupted the humours
of the Body. I have sometimes observed in Pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Seasons, that some as soon as ever they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
themselves infected, have presently taken some
Antidote, and put themselves in a sweat, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after have recovered, and the day following have
gone about their wonted occasions: whereas if they did
delay 8. or 12. hours before they took some medicine,
scarce one of a hundred did escape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As that is a happy Nation, which provides in times
of Peace and Plenty, for things useful in War and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
and as it becomes good Souldiers to have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95311:40"/>
their arms ready, and fix'd, before the Enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Town, and not have them then to buy at
the Gun-smiths: so should you be furnished with
some Medicines ready made, and not lose so much
time, whilest you get a Physitian to prescribe, and
an Apothecary to compound them; and it were far
better, that the Medicine were lost for want of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
than you lost for want of a Medicine; and
it were far safer to cure any Disease, as the <hi>Plague,</hi>
than to neglect or cure the <hi>Plague,</hi> as any other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
               <p>First then, As soon as ever you feel your self ill,
without further staying for, or expecting the Signs
or Symptomes, the Spots, Botch, Blain, or Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

are Cordials and Antidotes, to defend the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               </p>
               <p>As soon then as ever you feel your self sick, take
some Antidote to make you sweat; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>This Contra-pestilential Vinegar is excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> the Roots of <hi>Virginia Snakeweed,
Contrayerva, Pestilence-wort, Angelica, Elicampane,

               <p>Or else, Take <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> the Roots of <hi>Contrayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,

Root of each one ounce, <hi>Sage</hi> and <hi>Rew</hi> washt in
Vinegar, of each one handful, put to them for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ounce half a pint of <hi>White-wine Vinegar,</hi> and
stop it close in a Bottle, and keep it for use.</p>
               <p>Or else, Take <hi>Tormentil</hi> and <hi>Celendine</hi> of each
four ounces, <hi>Scabius</hi> and <hi>Rew</hi> of each two handfuls:
Boil them in two quarts of <hi>White-wine Vinegar</hi> in an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95311:41"/>
earthen glased vessel, for a quarter of an hour, and
let it cool, and bottle it up.</p>
               <p>Note that the most compounded are the best. Now
take any of these Vinegars, or else (if you can get
no other) plain <hi>White-wine Vinegar</hi> twelve spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
more or less, but as much as you can well drink
down, and mixe with it two drams of <hi>London Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
or <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> or <hi>Mithridate,</hi> or <hi>Diascordium,</hi>
or <hi>Confection</hi> of <hi>Iacynth;</hi> stir it about and drink it
up, and go to Bed and sweat. Two drams of any
of these is a sufficient ordinary dose, or quantity, for
an ordinary person to take at once; they that are
stronger than ordinary, may take more; those that
are weaker, may take lesse.</p>
               <p>If you cast or vomit it up; take presently within
a quarter of an hour, another dose or quantity; and
if you cast or vomit up that also, take another and
less quantity; for it may well be that your stomach
being loaden with corrupt humors, being a little assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with the Medicine, may rise up and strive to
exclude them, and that with fortunate success and
hopes of future and more speedy recovery.</p>
               <p>Remember that the saving of your life consists in
sweating out the poyson of the Disease; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must endeavour to sweat as long as possibly
you can endure it, whether it be three, six, or
twelve hours, the longer the better, and avoid
sleeping, and let the sweat be wiped off with hot
cloths.</p>
               <p>All the time you sweat, and afterwards, you may
sustain Nature, and keep up your spirits, by eating
some preserv'd or candied <hi>Citron peel,</hi> or candied
<hi>Angelica</hi> stalks, or preserv'd <hi>Raspices,</hi> or Syrup of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95311:42"/>
                  <hi>Citron,</hi> or <hi>Clove-Gilly-flowers;</hi> now and then drinking
a spoonful or more of Vinegar, or taking some pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-drink
made with Vinegar, you may afterwards
eat some <hi>Harts-horn Gelly,</hi> or drink some <hi>Almond
Milk,</hi> made with distill'd waters, or <hi>Barley-water,</hi>
putting into it a few drops of Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> to make
it sharp.</p>
               <p>Remember also that you drink not any liquor
whatsoever, unless you first make water, though
never so little, and then you may drink without
danger.</p>
               <p>During the time of Sweating, the Sick should be
comforted with sweet perfumes and odors that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the spirits, and some Rose-water and Vinegar
is convenient to be cast on a hot shovel, or else
sprinkled on a Napkin and laid neer his Nose.</p>
               <p>Also whilest the Sick doth sweat, it would be
good to apply to the Navel a hot Loaf with a hole
made in it, and two drams of Treacle put therein, that
the bread may draw the venome: Some apply to the
heart the pith of a Manchet dipt in Vinegar, and
some apply onely a cloth dipt in Vinegar: Some
bruise radishes and lay them to the feet.</p>
               <p>When you have done Sweating, if you can be
perswaded, you are to forbear the <hi>changing</hi> of your
<hi>Linnen;</hi> but if you must needs change it, as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and regard your life, put on no fresh linnen,
though never so well dried and aired by the fire;
but put on some linnen that hath been worn by your
self or some body else: for if you put on fresh lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
whether it be by reason of the sope that hath
some malignity in it, or for some other cause, it
hath been often observed that the Sick have relaps'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95311:42"/>
into great anxiety, and bad symptomes, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of Death, have quickly return'd upon
them.</p>
               <p>Some do highly commends this, Take of <hi>Bezar-stone</hi>
and <hi>Emerald</hi> powdered, of each seven grains,
<hi>Iacynth</hi> powdered three grains; It is best to put
them in a spoonful of Vinegar, and swallow it down,
and drink some more Vinegar after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sennertus</hi> commends this, Take <hi>Bezar-stone</hi>
twelve grains, the bone of a Staggs heart one scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Emerald</hi> and <hi>Iacynth</hi> of each seven grains, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them very small, and take them with Vinegar:
But because true <hi>Bezar-stone</hi> is hard to be gotten, and
there be those in the World that have done as great
matters as counterfeit them, that you cannot know
the true from the false; and because the fragments
of those precious stones, which be commonly sold,
are but the spare and crust of them, I would be
loath to venture my life on their operation, neither
do I perswade others to relie upon them.</p>
               <p>The root of <hi>Virginia Snakeweed</hi> and <hi>Contrayerva</hi>
are most excellent, and you may take the weight of
half a dram of each of them in powder, or a dram
of any one of them in powder in a spoonful of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
drinking a draught of Vinegar after it.</p>
               <p>For young children that can take nothing, let
them be wrapped in a cloth that hath been used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and dipped in Vinegar, and put the child in
the cloth so wet, and let him sweat.</p>
               <p>Elder persons may sweat the same way also, being
wrapped in a sheet dipt in Vinegar.</p>
               <p>In the Works of several Physitians, there is often
mention of taking Vinegar, as it were by the By, in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95311:43"/>
a small inconsiderable quantity, not for its own sake,
but with other Medicines, as if it were onely a
thing to help them down the better, and make
them pallatable; they will tell you that Vinegar is
good with Cucumbers, and gives a pleasing relish to
a Sallet; whereas in truth neither one nor the other
are good, but onely with Vinegar. It is a thing,
which is not onely wholesome in it self, but also
makes other things wholsome, and takes away their
hurtfulnesse. When you speak of this singular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
away with cold commendations, which argue
rather a willingness to dispraise, than a readiness to
commend: If it did whet ones wit, as much as
sharpen ones stomach, there could nothing dull or
flat be spoken of it. It is Food and Physick, Meat
and Medicine, Drink and Julep, Cordial and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote:
Did you formerly taste it but as a common
Sawce? do you now eat it as a common Remedy.
When you are well, 'tis a Preservative from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
when you are sick 'tis a Restorative to Health.
'Tis like Apparel, which you put on, not onely for
comeliness, to hide shame, but also for warmth, to
keep out cold. 'Tis like the Swords which Gallants
wear, not onely for Ornament when they walk, but
also for defence, to fright a Thief when they travail,
and slay an Enemy when they fight. 'Tis Relish for
Sawce, 'tis Sawce for Meat, 'tis Medicine for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
'tis cordial for the heart, not onely a Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for the Spirits, but an Antidote against Poyson;
not onely an Antidote against Poyson, but against
the <hi>Plague,</hi> the chief of poysons: so Vinegar is the
chief of Antidotes, as the Sword is the King of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:95311:43"/>
If you look upon the <hi>Plague</hi> as caused by the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Air,</hi> you may take notice that the Air
which deadeneth and sowreth other liquors, doth
not hurt Vinegar, but rather exalt its vertue. 'Tis
something to preserve it self; but that's not all;
its vertue is communicated, and preserves others.
If Roots, Herbs, Flowers, and Fruits, be steeped in
Vinegar, they are kept thereby from withering,
moulding, and decay.</p>
               <p>If you consider the <hi>Plague,</hi> as arising from the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Humours</hi> (as indeed it is the supream &amp;
highest degree of Putrefaction) you may also take
notice there is nothing that resists it more. 'Tis Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
that keeps Fish, as Salmon and Oisters, and the
like (which otherwise would soon corrupt) from
rottennesse and stinking; and if it would not do the
like for flesh, why hath it been so much used for the
embalming of Dead Corpses; nay, it doth not onely
preserve, but recover Flesh from Corruption. Roast
stinking Meat, and baste it with Vinegar, and it shall
neither offend your Nose or Palate.</p>
               <p>If you look upon the <hi>Plague</hi> as a <hi>Poyson,</hi> Vinegar is
an Antidote against it. Hence 'tis that Physitians to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
&amp; take away the fiery venome of <hi>Spurge, Laurel,
Mezereon,</hi> and other plants, steep them in Vinegar, and
so give them safely to their Patients, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would kill &amp; be a worse Remedy than the
Disease. Some have been choakt by eating of poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mushromes, but had they taken a Draught of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,
they had been out of danger; but that's a small
matter, not to be choakt with a Mushrome. <hi>Hypoc.</hi> saith,
that, <hi>Those who are strangled and foam about the mouth,
though they be not quite dead, yet do never recover to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95311:44"/>
life again.</hi> Yet <hi>Christoph. a Vega</hi> tells of one that
was strangled with a rope, and did foam about the
mouth, and yet was recovered by drinking Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
The heart of a Viper being dexterously cut
out of the body, will live and move 24. hours after,
but cast a drop of Vinegar on it, and it dies present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Dioscorides</hi> tells you that it resists all poysons
hot and cold; and <hi>Celsus</hi> saith, it is the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
remedy against them; and tells of one that
was poysoned by the sting of an Asp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at such a place where there was no liquor, and
not being able to go to another, where any might be
had, by chance he found a flagon of Vinegar, and
drank it all off, and presently recovered.</p>
               <p>If you consider the <hi>Plague</hi> as bred by <hi>Ill Diet,</hi>
what is more commonly eaten with dangerous Meats
with Vinegar? If that go along with it, your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
is guarded from receiving hurt; How else
could you eat such viands, as Muscles, Oysters, and
Mushromes? Malt is a sad thing wherewith to make
Bread, and yet the Meal thereof temper'd with Ale
Vinegar (nothing to be compared for goodness to
Wine Vinegar) in a besieged Garrison hath been
hearty and wholesome.</p>
               <p>If you look upon the <hi>Plague</hi> spread by <hi>Contagion,</hi>
there is nothing that doth sooner choak and smother
it.</p>
               <p>Is the <hi>Plague</hi> attended with a Burning Fever? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth sooner extinguish fire. Let it not seem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
to consider a little how it preventeth or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suageth
its grievous symptomes. Have you not seen
when some sorts of liquor have been put into hot
Milk, how it all presently turns to Curds and Whey,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95311:44"/>
and upon stirring, the Curds go one way, and the
Whey another; in somewhat like manner it is, when
the <hi>Plague</hi> infects the bloud, the thin and watery
part sweats, and is as it were spewed out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
small veins into the skin, and becomes Spots,
where staying a little while, it loseth its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and appears various to the eye, according to
the humour that is mixed with it, as if it be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
they encline to a purple or dark yellow; if from
Flegme, they are paler; if from Humours, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dust,
they are blew and blackish; but the thicker
and grosser part goes to Botches and Carbuncles on
the top of the flesh or out-side of the Skin, even as
you see in boiling of the said Whey, the Curds will
rise to the top of the Vessel.</p>
               <p>Now Vinegar hindereth and preventeth both
these, the Spots, by resisting the Putrifaction; and
then the Carbuncles, by suppressing the Inflamation
of the Bloud. <hi>Vis est mirifica refrigerandi Sanguinis

               <p>Many Antidotes and Medicines, as well as some
Meats, may have some inconvenience, but that is
inconsiderable, in regard of the benefit by them.
Think you not, that it is a disquiet for Citizens to
make their Town a Carrison? and yet who would

other liquors in distillation, may well have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ordinary in operation: The Spirits

and flie away, and have nothing but flegme;
but when Vinegar is distill'd, the flegme rises first,
and the Spirits stay behind.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Galen</hi> saith of Poysons, the hundredth

fire burn to any purpose; so it is in Cordials, too

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:95311:46"/>
'Tis for the vertue of Vinegar that I wrote this
Book. I would be loath to present you a Glo-worm
instead of a Diamond, or put a Bulrush instead of a
Spear into your hand, when you are to fight with
such an Enemy. Imagine well, and think highly of
this Medicine. I value my own life, as much as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man doth his. I had rather take Vinegar by it self,
than many other, nay then any other single medicine
without it. Despise it not, because 'tis easie to be
had, neither let it be contemn'd, because familiar.
It is the more excellent, because common; the more
precious, because cheap; the vertues of it so many,
they will hardly be believed; and therefore the
greater, because incredible.</p>
               <p>But because the pestilent venome hath a power to
corrupt, putrifie, and inflame the humours, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
the Sicknesse is accompanied with a Fever,
which sometimes may be almost as dangerous as the
<hi>Plague,</hi> there must be care taken thereof; so that
as you may not by too cold things strike in the <hi>Plague,</hi>
so by too hot, you may not exasperate the Fever, but
have respect to both: for which purpose you may
take cordial and cooling Juleps, made of distill'd wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
of <hi>Sorrel, Endive, Cichory, Borage, Bugloss,
Meadow sweet, Angelica, Dragons Dandelyon, Betony,
Scabius, Balme, Fumitory,</hi> to which you may put as

you may put any Cordial Syrup to it, as <hi>Gilly-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
juice of <hi>Citron, Lemons, Poppies,</hi> or the like.</p>
               <p>Or else you may take some Spring-water, and put
it fresh into a Glass, and drop some Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or
<hi>Brimstone</hi> into it, to make it sharp, and sweeten it
with Sugar, and drink it, both as a Preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Fever or the <hi>Plague;</hi> and as a Medicine and
Julep in time of Sicknesse; and let me tell you that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95311:47"/>
plain Spring-water and Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Brimstone,</hi>
is a better Julep in the <hi>Plague, Pestilent, Malignant,</hi>
and other burning <hi>Fever,</hi> than almost any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd
water without it.</p>
               <p>Note that it is a vain and scrupulous error, to take
when you are dry and burning hot, but two or
three spoonfuls of Julep at a time. I never denied
my Patients drink in the heat of a Fever, but let
them drink Julep as much as they please, for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Julep doth but little good, and rather encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the heat, as the powring of a little Water on
a Smiths fire doth make it flame the more, and burn
the hotter, whereas a great deal doth quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
it and put it out.</p>
               <p>And because this Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is so excellent and
useful a remedy mixt with water, in this and all
hot Diseases, I should advise every ingenuous
person that lives in the Country, never to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
               <p>These Oils you must understand, cannot be taken
by themselves, but with spring or distilled waters;
and you must be careful of spilling any drop on your
cloths, for then it will fret and make a hole in them.
Now if you refuse to meddle with them, for fear of
receiving any hurt, you may as well do so by fire,
which you must not sit by, least a spark light on your
apron, neither must men take Tobacco for fear of
burning their faces. And yet I must tell you that 'tis
better to have a spot on your gown, or a hole in
your cloths, which the negligent slabbering of it
may occasion, than a Purple in your Skin, or a
Botch or Carbuncle in your Flesh, which the discreet
taking of it will hinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95311:47"/>
I have heard of a <hi>Norwegian,</hi> that coming out of
his frozen Country, into the South parts of the World,
saw some Damask Roses growing in a Garden, and
said, <hi>Well may the weather be so hot, when fire grows
upon the Trees;</hi> at which the hearers fell a-laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and told him they were most sweet and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
flowers, as pleasing to the smell as delightful
to the eye, and gather'd him one, and bid him smell
to it, but he refus'd, neither would he take it into
his hands for fear of burning his fingers, nor smell
to it least he should fire his beard, or singe his furr'd
cap.</p>
               <p>To perswade you not to fear, but use this Oil
of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> let me tell you what the most candid and
judicious <hi>Sennertus</hi> saith of it in his fourth Book and
11th Chapter of the cure of pestilent and malignant
Fevers. <hi>Great in this case is the use of Oil of Vitriol,
which hath a notable faculty to stay putrefaction, to
open obstructions, to cut, disperse, attenuate, cleanse,
and separate all corrupt humours, and further the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity,
and exalt the vertue of other medicines with
which it is most usefully mingled; for whereas the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups
of</hi> Succory, Endive, Violets, <hi>and the rest, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Sugar in them, are not sufficient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the heat nor thirst in a Fever, but are rather
turn'd into choler; yet if Oil of Vitriol be mixed with
them, so us to make them sharp, they most happily
slake the thirst and allay the heat, and with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
answer the expectation for which they were taken.</hi>
And <hi>Mindererus</hi> in his 15. chap. of his Book of the
Pestilence, where he treateth of the Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi>
and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> saith, <hi>There is no Putrefaction, whose
strength it doth not break, no infection which it doth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95311:48"/>
not overcome, no depravation of humours which they
do not rectifie. In truth, if I may speak freely, if
I should be hindred or forbid the use of</hi> Vitriol, I
<hi>would never come to the cure of the</hi> Plague, <hi>or if I
did come, I should come disarm'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, when you find your self at any time
of your Sicknesse, especially at the end of any
burning fit, inclinable to sweat, you are to follow
the conduct of Nature and endeavour to second it by
the use of Medicines.</p>
               <p>For which purpose, Take two drams of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Iacynth,</hi> or <hi>Diascordium,</hi> or one dram of
Electuary <hi>de Ovo,</hi> or of the Powder of <hi>Cantrayerva,</hi>
or <hi>Virginia Snakeweed,</hi> or of the Powder of <hi>Crabs
Eyes</hi> and <hi>Claws</hi> and burnt <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> as formerly
you were directed; or else two drams of <hi>Gascoyn</hi>
powder made without <hi>Bezar.</hi> And indeed consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the uncertainty of true <hi>Bezar,</hi> there may be
<hi>Gascoyne</hi> powder made as well without <hi>Bezar</hi> as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio
Alchermes</hi> made without Musk; for as some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure the smell of Musk, so many cannot go to
the price of <hi>Bezar.</hi> Or else you may take some of the
compounded Vinegars, ordering your self for sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as you were formerly directed.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Purging</hi> and <hi>Bleeding,</hi> there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned Physitians that have made diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into the Nature of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> and cure thereof,
who would have it wholly omitted, and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
rather timerousness than rashness in opening a
vein; for neither purging nor bleeding do oppose the
Disease, but weaken the party. In this case, the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Hypocrates</hi> is very considerable; <hi>Where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95311:48"/>
aimes its course, thither it behoves the Physitian
to direct his help.</hi> Now Nature labours by all means
to expel the venome of the Disease to the Superficies
and out side of the Body, and bleeding and purging
draw it inwards towards the heart, the Center and
Seat of Life. What is said of War (<hi>Non lioet his pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care</hi>
(for the first error will be your overthrow) is
true in the cure of the <hi>Plague,</hi> the first errour will
be your danger, and the second day of purging
or bleeding (if you live so long) the first day of
your repentance. In this Disease the blood is the life
of the party, which if you take away, you soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy.
<hi>Paraeus,</hi> a most expert Chyrurgeon, in his Book
of the <hi>Plague,</hi> relateth, that in the year 1566. when
there was a great mortality throughout all <hi>France,</hi>
by reason of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> he diligently enquired
of all the Physitians and Chyrurgeons of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
where he came, what successe their Patients had
after they were let bloud and purged? whereunto
they answered all alike, <hi>That all that were infected
with the</hi> Pestilence, <hi>and did bleed some quantity of
blood, or had their bodies somewhat strongly purged,
thenceforth waxed weaker and weaker, and so at length
died; but others which were not let bloud and purged,
but took Cordial Antidotes, for the most part escaped
and recovered their health.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Botch</hi> is a swelling about the bignesse of a

in manner aforesaid, until the venom doth not kill

the Oven, and clap it to the Sore. Also it is very
good to launce it; for though some pain do thence
arise, yet Nature doth not draw back from the
place pained, but sendeth humours thither after the
launcing. Also take <hi>Wheat Flower, Honey,</hi> and the

else you may burn the head of it with a small hot

            <p>THe <hi>Italians</hi> have a Saying, that, <hi>To speak ill of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is the fifth Element whereof every one is
made.</hi> Do not you then wonder that I give you this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
since some either out of envy or ignorance, may be
more ready to requite my pains with a hard censure, than
a kind acceptance. Well, in giving you civil language, I
for this time, follow the humour of a certain <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who being near
his death, and in despair, was encouraged to put his trust in God, and
defie the Devil; but he creepingly replied, <hi>That they would please to
pardon him, for he would defie no body, onely he prayed to God to
keep him &amp; his soul from—Monsieur the Devil;</hi> at which uncouth and
strange expression one of the By-standers being somewhat surpriz'd, ask'd
him what reason he had to give the evil spirit such a title, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>That it was convenient to give every one good words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew not well into whose hands he might chance to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being often requested, and almost tyred, to give directions for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Infectoon of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and being since much satisfied with the
good success to all that followed it, and considering the self-ended conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the geeat cost in buying several medicines, which many people
would, nay, must rather die, than be at the charge of; and knowing how
difficult it is for a Doctor, how diligent soever, to attend above twenty
sick Families, and how ignorant many sick people are, and how little they
can learn from Nurses, and what errors are committed in bleeding and
purging, and how hard a matter it is for those who are sick in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to procure speedy advice and remedy, since people are so far from visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sick, that they will hardly allow or permit those that are well to
visit one another, amongst many distractions, and setting aside my private
affairs, I endeavoured to publish this Treatise.</p>
            <p>If you think I have been too brief, upon request I shall be ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
it, if not, you may do it your self; if too tedious, you may do as at
feasts, where is variety of dishes, take what you please, and leave the
rest; if too plain, there are more sick-folks and Nurses that cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Latine and hard words, than Apothecaries and Chyrurgeons that
will not understand English. I should be a rich man, if I had five shillings
for every one that d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th not know the weight of a French Crown.</p>
            <p>I have heard of <hi>Elixir Vitae,</hi> the <hi>Grand Cordial,</hi> the <hi>Infallible Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95311:51"/>
against the <hi>Plague,</hi> and I remember a Story of a Friar, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have a plume of the Angel <hi>Gabriels</hi> feathers, which fell from
him at the Salutation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but when he came to shew it
after Sermon to the multitude, he perceived that his feathers had been
stoln out of the box, and a Charcoal put in their stead, and very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
laid the disappointment upon the indisposition of the people, who
were not fuly prepared for the fight of so heavenly a Relique: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
out of his own good will he would shew them one of the <hi>Coals</hi> that was
taken from under the Gridiron that Sai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

not much fancy <hi>quid proquo,</hi> neither do you greatly care at present for
<hi>Elixit Vitae Ae<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ae,</hi> neither would you have such a Cordial as should
cure you of all Diseases, though the Antidote may be infallible, yet he
that takes it may be deceiv'd: Many conceal'd Medicines are dear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
when they cost the taker his life; and many cried up s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>crets do
greater cures on the Purse of the Seller, than on the Body of the Buyer,
into whose handt, as soon as they chance to come, they lose their vertue.</p>
            <p>If things hard or impossible to be done, would have pleas'd you, I could
have given you directions extravagant enough; How for getting into a
better Air, you must ride on <hi>Pegasus</hi> every day in the <hi>Elizian Fields,</hi>
or else take one of the Planets Houses to dwell in; and get your Goods
sent thither in <hi>Charles's Wain:</hi> 'Tis very healthy, to walk a turn or two
in <hi>Via Lactaea,</hi> and when you are weary, sit down in <hi>Cassiopoeia's Chair.</hi>
For <hi>Dyet,</hi> you may have your <hi>Mutton</hi> at <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Beef</hi> at <hi>Taurus,</hi>
your <hi>Fish</hi> at <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Pisces;</hi> and let <hi>Ganymede</hi> fill you no <hi>Wine,</hi> but
what is fine, neat, and racy, with an excellent scent and flavour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also if things difficult or impossible to be gotten, would have gave content, I could
have told you, how handsome and warm a <hi>Colchos Mantle,</hi> made of <hi>Jasons Golden</hi>
Fieece would sit upon your shoulders; how to dress your hair with a <hi>Myrmaids Comb,</hi>
would cure the Head-ach, and help Perspiration; what an excellent Cordial a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
Draught of <hi>Nectar</hi> or <hi>Ambrosia</hi> would be, in a <hi>Unicorns-Horn;</hi> how two <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix
Eggs</hi> for Break fast would make a rare Cawdle; how excellent a <hi>Black Swan</hi>
would be roasted for Dinner, especially, if he sang before he was killed; how sweetly
you would sleep after you had supp'd upon a <hi>Manucodiata</hi> or <hi>Bird of Paradise;</hi> how
delightful a Dish of Fruit from the <hi>Hesperides</hi> or <hi>Pine Apples</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> would be in
the Afternoon.</p>
            <p>But my directions aye plain and familiar, and easie to be understood by an ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity;
they which know better, may be provoked by my example, to publish them,
with the method and direction how to use them; which I had rather communicate for the
good of the people of my Native Country, than to have gotten an Estate, by giving them
a hard Name, to keep them secret, and having them sold for my private advantage,
(as the Custome now is) at an Apothecaries or Stationers Shop: And so I hope that the
superlative excesse of my love, shall excuse the defect of my skill.</p>
