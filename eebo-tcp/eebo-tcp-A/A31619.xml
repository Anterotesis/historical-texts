         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in general; and the neceſſary, convenient, and various uſes and kinds thereof in
divers Kingdoms and States, as alſo here in <hi>England;</hi> and obſerving the great
Utility of ſound and good Credit, and the deplorable and many Miſchiefs
frequently reſulting from uncertain, miſtaken, perſonal, and precarious Credit;
to the utter Ruine of multitudes, and ſometimes to the indangering the
publick Safety.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And further, Conſidering that Lands, and Hands, are the Material and
Efficient cauſes of all true, genuine, and natural Riches;<note place="margin">Material and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> and that Money, as
ſuch (tho' very good and uſeful in its firſt intendment, however ſince Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Abuſes) is but imaginary, or at moſt but political, Wealth;<note place="margin">Money is but poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, not real Wealth.</note> and therefore
inferior to natural Riches; and conſequently as ſuch ought to attend the ſervice
of Land and Trade; and not prey upon, both the Lords of the Soil, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Merchants, by that corroding and deſtructive Canker, Uſury.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> alſo further reflecting, that Credit, rightly
founded upon Land, muſt evidently be more ſecure than any other ſort of
Credit:<note place="margin">Land Credit more Secure.</note> And that, ſince Gold and Silver, are not of the product of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin"> Inconveniencies of Gold and Silver for being the common Meaſure of Trade, where they are not the native product.</note>
they might by foreign Orders, by Edicts of Princes, or States, by a wrong
Ballance of Trade, or by other Artifices or Incidents thereof, or by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uncommon Accidents, become ſcarce and rare in this Kingdom; which
could not happen, but to the very great damage of the Publick; as being the
common Meaſure, Medium, Pledge, and Account of Trade.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <note place="margin">Ends and Motives of the Doctors pains.</note> 7. The ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> upon theſe and other ſuch Reflections, and
with an earneſt deſire, to ſerve his Native Country, in ſo great and general a
Good, applied himſelf, with the utmoſt intenſneſs of mind, to contrive a general
Credit, to be ſo founded upon Land, as to give it the greateſt Safety and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that in its own nature it is Capable of; and to make a Credit, that
ſhould not only be a <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to Money, but in divers reſpects, more noble
and uſeful, and indeed a Superior Species, indued with all the Uſes and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Metaline Money, and in ſeveral Regards, exceeding the ſame; and
particularly herein, that in its own Nature it ſhould be Local, without the
Reſtraint of Laws.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Doctor commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 8. And whereas the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> at divers times Communicated
theſe his Conceptions and Deſigns to divers perſons, and in particular to the
Lords and Gentlemen herein before mentioned, in order to Mature and Ripen
ſuch his Thoughts, and make them more Effectual for the Common Avail.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <note place="margin">The late Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Banks by this Nation, is the effect of the Doctor's Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</note> 9. And whereas the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> hath made ſeveral Attempts
and Eſſaies to bring his ſaid Thoughts and Intentions into Practice, for the
Common Good; but, by reaſon of the great and many Difficulties, that
generally Accompany all great and good Deſignes, hath not hitherto been able
to effect the ſame; but yet the long, many, repeated, and unwearied Attempts
and Endeavours of the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> and thoſe at Sundry times, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
wirh him therein, have ſo far awakened this Nation at firſt (and long,
by him Experienced to be wholly) averſe to thoughts of this ſort, that within
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97510:2"/>
the Reign of his preſent Majeſty, ſeveral Banks have been ſet up and attempted;
tho' all of them on a far leſs Baſis, both as to Extent and Benefit, than what
hath been divers times offered and Endeavoured by the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen:</hi>
And indeed all the ſaid Banks (as can well be made out) manifeſtly owing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Models, frequently propoſed and attempted, both in Print, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript,
and publickly, and privatly, and freely imparted by him, to all that
thought fit to Inform themſelves.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But for as much as Men Naturally Embrace the greater Good, rather
than the leſs, as ſoon as they diſtinguiſh them aright; and ſince the Land Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
Propoſed and Intended by the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> and his preſent
Friends, Aſſociates, and Joynt Undertakers therein, can be Demonſtrably
made out, to be far Superior to any other ſort of Credit, in being, or attempting
in the World: And ſince divers Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have been ſo far Senſible of the great and general good, of the hereby
intended Credit; of its great extent, and Advantage to Trade; of its manifeſt
Tendency to the immediate Raiſing the real Worth and Value of the Engliſh
Lands; to the preſervation of the Honours Eſtates and Families of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Nobility and Gentry; to the Increaſe and Perfection of all manner of Arts,
Sciences, and Manufactures among us; to the higheſt Improvement of all our
Poſſible produce; to the Extirpating of Poverty, Baggary, Vice, and Sloth;
and to the Great Encouragement of Virtue, Ingenuity, and Induſtry: <note place="margin">Tendency and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</note> The
ſaid Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, have already Actually Subſcribed
Land Eſtates, for the Annual Payment of about One hundred thouſand
pounds Rent Charges,<note place="margin">Divers have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to it.</note> to the hereby intended Office of Land Credit; which
ſubſcriptions will be further Continued to Two hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per
Annum,</hi> or more, as occaſion may require: And ſince the ſaid deſign is now
intirely perfected in its Idea, Scheme, and Model; and all Matters and Things
are now Framed, and Matured, for the Speedy and Actual reducing thereof to
Practice, with all the diſpatch that will well Conſiſt with the Safety, Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Honour of ſo great an Undertaking.</p>
            <p n="11">11.<note place="margin">Now for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Effecting this Matter;</note> Now for the better Effecting the good Ends and Purpoſes herein before
premiſed and intimated, and herein after to be further mentioned and explained,
Theſe Preſents Witneſs, and the ſaid <hi>Hugh Chamberlen,</hi> and the Lords and
Gentlemen aforeſaid, as joynt Undertakers and Managers of the Office of
Land Credit, hereby intended, Do hereby Declare, That foraſmuch as the
neceſſity of Credit in Trade, is evidently ſuch, that Men dayly venture upon
what is uncertain, rather than want the uſe of it; <note place="margin"> It is Declared that there is want of good Credit.</note> and when it is made ſecure
beyond poſſibility of Loſs to any, it is then Money under another Name, and
can equally with Money become the Meaſure, Pledge, and Account of Trade: <note place="margin"> Good Credit is Money under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name.</note>
And ſince it is moſt certain, That Credit, having all the Eſſentials of the
Uſual Money, and ſome other Additional Advantages, wants nothing but a
coercive Law, enforceing its currency, to enable it to aſſume the Name of
Money, being already in poſſeſſion of all its Nature, Uſes, and Qualifications:
Which Propoſition is Sufficiently Illuſtrated by rightly defining Money.
Money therefore is no more than a Legal ſecure and common Pledge, inſtituted
to ſupply the defects of Barter,<note place="margin">What Money is.</note> and to be the Meaſure, Medium, and Account of
Trade: Or in other terms, Money is only a ſecure Pledge, of a known Value,
that a Man ſhall be repayed in the ſame, or in ſome other Commodity, for the
Commodity that he parts with; and it ſerves but to Supply the Intervals of
time, between the ſelling of one Commodity, and the buying of another: All
which Offices, can be equally performed by ſound and good Credit, as by the
Uſual ſpecies of common Money.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And further, forasmuch as Credit, founded upon Land, and ſecured
by more than a double Value, muſt undeniably be ſafe in its ſelf, and good and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97510:3"/>
effectual to all the Intents of Trade and Dealing, to the great benefit of all in
general, and without Loſs or Damage to any by it. And ſince it is moſt
certain, that ſuch as are Poſſeſt of Eſtates, in Fee ſimple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Have already
by Law, an undoubted Right, of making whatever Settlements of ſuch their
Eſtates, they ſhall think fit, and to what ends and purpoſes they pleaſe;<note place="margin">Thoſe poſſeſſed of Eſtates in Fee Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can by Law ſettle them to what <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes they pleaſe: except in certain Caſes.</note> Except
where Criminal Deſigns, Superſtitious Uſes, or Illegal Mortmains, are thereby
purſuing, or ſome Invaſion thereby made of anothers Right. And ſince the
happineſs of this Nation is ſuch, that a Law cannot paſs in <hi>England,</hi> that can
prove a Violation of Property.<note place="margin">Property ſacred by Law.</note> This being ſo; and Land well conveyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Univerſally allowed to be the beſt Security;<note place="margin">Land the beſt Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> and being alſo the true Mother

that to aſſiſt the more ready Circulation of this Credit; eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and till Time and Experience ſhall have ſhown the true worth and ſolid

they the ſaid Undertakers are to have and employ, Ten Years Value of the ſaid

as aforeſaid on the Office or Undertaking hereby intended; the other Twenty

for Managing and Carrying on this Undertaking, during the whole term of the

            <p n="16">16. And it is hereby further declared, That this Undertaking Teaches, to
advance or anticipate One Hundred Years Revenue,<note place="margin">The Hundred Years.</note> and to call it back by equal
Portions in One Hundred Years; by which means, the Nation has the Uſe of
ſo great an Additional Treaſure <hi>pro interim,</hi> the Increaſe whereof cannot (by
Neceſſary Conſequence) but be great by Trade; and its Return, from whence
it iſſued, will be by ſlow and eaſie gradations.<note place="margin">Benefits thereby.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. From a due Conſideration of the whole of this Undertaking, and all its
parts, as contained in the Conſtitution thereof herein and hereby ſetled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
it will be moſt evident, That no Money Bank is or poſſibly can be either
ſo ſafe, or the Credit of it ſo well ſecured, as will be the Land Credit iſſued by
and from this Office or Undertaking.<note place="margin">Preference of this Credit to that of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Banks.</note> For Firſt, All Money Banks are far more
liable to Rapine and Seiſure; and next, It is apparent that Ten Thouſand
Pounds Credit, iſſued upon Ten Thouſand Pounds in Money, can have no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Value of Security than its Original Fund of Ten Thouſand Pounds in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
which yet (as is moſt Notorious) few (if any) Banks have, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pretend: But Ten Thouſand Pounds Credit, iſſuing by and from this
Office or Undertaking, is firmly ſecured by Twenty Two Thouſand Five
Hundred Pounds Value; every Rent-Charge of One Hundred Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
for One Hundred Years, being to be ſecured (above all Repriſes) by One
Hundred and Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> in Land, for One Hundred and Fifty
Years; and (ſince the Ten Thouſand Pounds Credit iſſued, upon thus ſecuring
the Payment of One Hundred Pounds Annuity or Rent-Charge for One Hundred
Years, is not to be called for at one Time, and in one Sum, but Annually, in
ſmall and equal Payments, for an Hundred Years) the Security is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
good, for ſuch Payments to be duly made in ſuch a term: The Bills there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have thus moſt evidently a more than double Real, Solid, and Intrinſick
Value, inſeparably adhering to them:<note place="margin">This Credit more than doubly ſecured.</note> The Land muſt Annually call for them,
till the Hundred Years be out:<note place="margin">The Land muſt Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call for theſe Bills.</note> The Office muſt Annually deſtroy them as they
come in for Rent:<note place="margin">And the Office muſt Annually deſtroy them.</note> At the end of the Hundred Years they will therefore be all
deſtroyed;<note place="margin">Theſe Bills will all be cancelled at the end of 100 Years.</note> their annexed Value making them (beyond all juſt Exception) ſafe
to all <hi>pro interim.</hi> Since therefore the Advantages accruing by the ſaid intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Bills of Credit, are ſo many, ſo great, and obvious; and ſince none can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
loſe by them, there can be no juſt cauſe of Doubt, but that Safety and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
muſt neceſſarily give them a general Eſteem and Currency.</p>
            <p n="18">18.<note place="margin">Why muſt this Credit continue no more nor leſs than 100 Year?</note> But to ſuch as enquire, why theſe Rent Charges are to continue for the
Term of One Hundred Years juſt, and not for Fifty Years, or Two Hundred
Years, or more, or leſs: It is hereby anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That One Hundred Years is
found requiſite and neceſſary to the good Ends intended by this Office of Land
Credit, and to the Support and Safety of it; ſo as to make all things bear, and
anſwer, not only the very great Expence and Charge abſolutely neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but alſo the Security, Profit, Advantages and Intentions of it; and therefore
a leſs Term were incompetent, and a greater Term (tho' poſſibly it might be
done yet) is not wanted now; and may (if thought fit) be done hereafter,
when time ſhall by Experience have ſhewn the Benefits of ſuch a Credit. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſhall wonder, how the ſame Land can ſecurely raiſe One Hundred Years Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
that may be Bought in Fee for Twenty Years Purchaſe:<note place="margin">How 100 Years Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue can be raiſed upon Land, that will ſell but for 20,</note> It is alſo anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97510:4"/>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That when a Sum of Money is to be repaid at once with Intereſt, then it
cannot ſecurely much exceed one half, or two thirds of the common Purchaſe of
the Land; but where the Money is to be repaid by equal Annual Payments only,
there a Year and half in Rent can well ſecure a Years Rent, and ſo in proportion
of Time and Value.</p>
            <p n="19">19.<note place="margin">How this Credit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</note> And whereas this Undertaking raiſes, by Advance or Anticipation, the
Value of One Hundred Years on the Land; it alſo firmly ſecures the Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment
of it in equal Portions, by one third more in Time or Term of Years,
and one third more in Rent or Value: And thus Ten Thouſand Pounds, raiſed
by advancing One Hundred Years Rent of One Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in
Land, is ſecured to be repaid in One Hundred equal Annual Payments,<note place="margin">10000 <hi>l.</hi> therein is ſecured,</note> by Land,
of One Hundred and Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> for One Hundred and Fifty Years,
which produces Twenty Two Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds,<note place="margin">By 22500 <hi>l.</hi> which is therefore a more than double Security, that ſuch Credit ſhall be duly Diſcharged.</note> and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without all peradventure, plainly and evidently, a more than double Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
that the Ten Thouſand Pounds ſo raiſed, muſt be recalled and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by equal Annual Payments in One Hundred Years, in Payment and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Credit ſo raiſed on ſuch Land by Anticipation as aforeſaid. Which
Point being thus firmly ſetled and ſecured, beyond any poſſibility of Reaſonable
Doubt, none that take this Credit can poſſibly loſe by it; which is all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the Uſual Species of Money, and from the beſt Security.</p>
            <p n="20">20.<note place="margin">The Premiſes illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an Example.</note> To illuſtrate this more clearly, what follows is a plain and full Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Validity and Security of the Bills of Land Credit hereby intended,
<hi>viz. A.</hi> ſettles One Hundred and Fifty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> on Truſtees for a Year
and half, to ſecure the Payment of One Hundred Pounds (above all Repriſes)
at the end of One Year. The Truſtees do thereupon iſſue their Bill of Credit,
for One Hundred Pound, chargeable on ſuch Land, and payable at a Year: This
Bill is paid out to One Hundred ſeveral Perſons within the Year; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
does the Office of ſo much Ready Money: At the end of the Year, the
Bill is either brought to the Truſtees, to be Exchanged for Money, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
or (which is the ſame thing) it comes to the Hands of one that Owes
One Hundred Pounds to the Truſtees, who therefore accept it in lieu of their
Debt, and cancel it. And none can reaſonably deny, but that this Settlement,
and the Bill of Credit ſo iſſued thereupon, were a great Convenience to the
Landed Man, and anſwered his Occaſions as well as Ready Money; and as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and greatly uſeful to all who received it. Now it is moſt certain, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Reaſon, that at leaſt an equal Service, Benefit, and Security, will attend
Bills of Credit ſecured by Land, tho' ſetled for One Hundred Years; and tho'
they ſhould all circulate for the whole Term:<note place="margin">Bills for 100 Years may be ſafely current the while, and as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as thoſe payable at a ſhort Term.</note> For they differ but as <hi>Majus</hi> and
<hi>Minus,</hi> ſave that the Bills iſſued for One Hundred Years, have thereby a further
Security and Advantage, by reaſon of the Joint ſtock in Trade; which will at
leaſt exonerate the Land from any Payment, and probably may beſides put dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Money Yearly into the Proprietor of the Lands Purſe; and is the reſult
of extending the Term of Years ſo long.</p>
            <p n="21">21.<note place="margin">The Security of theſe Bills grows ſtronger yearly.</note> But further, the Security of the Bills for One Hundred Years (tho' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
at firſt to the Security of the Bill for One Year, as is clearly made out)
grows ſtronger every Year as the Bills come in: For that all the ſame Lands
are ſtill tyed, as at firſt, to make good the Bills to the very end and expiration
of the whole Term of One Hundred Years. Had the inſtance of the Bill pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at one Year, been made to conſiſt of One Hundred Bills, payable in equal
Portions, and at equal Diſtances in that One Year, it had then been ſo for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
in Security with the Bills of One Hundred Years; becauſe both Securities
had then been alike ſtrengthened, by the gradual paying in of the Bills: But
ſtill, both the Security and Benefit of the Bills for One Hundred Years are far
ſuperior to the other, from the Neceſſary Conſequences of the great Benefits
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97510:4"/>
accruing by means of the Joint-ſtock in Trade; of which Advantages, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of Bills are wholly uncapable. And this (as is conceived) amounts to
a full Demonſtration, that the hereby intended Bills of Credit are not barely
equally ſecure with any other ſort of Bills, but are more ſecure, and more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable;
and that becauſe they are extended to One Hundred Years; which yet
ſome Ignorantly, and others Maliciouſly object as a fault in them. And thus,
tho' a part be not greater than its whole, nor a term than a perpetuity, yet a
part of one thing, may be greater than the whole of another; and a part of the
ſame thing has often, by Improvement, become more Valuable than its whole
was (either by Eſtimation, or in Reality) worth, without and before ſuch
Improvement.<note place="margin">A part may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a greater Value than the whole was before, or can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, ſuch Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Hence it is, that a Term of Years, as applied by this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
is really far more Valuable than the perpetuity of the ſame Eſtate,
without ſuch Application.<note place="margin">And a Term thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied is better than the Perpetuity not ſo appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. And that, tho' it is acknowledged, that indeed common Mortgages are
a very Ancient ſort of Credit upon Land;<note place="margin">Mortgages a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſort of Credit; But troubleſome;</note> but yet becauſe they cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
without Trouble, Hazard, Charge, and Loſs of Time; and becauſe
they are generally in Sums not ſo well ſuited to common or frequent occaſions,<note place="margin">And not well ſuited to general Occaſions.</note>
they are ſtill (as their Name imports) but dead Pledges, and a very lame and
imperfect Credit;<note place="margin">Dead Pledges, and but an imperfect Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</note> and therefore Intereſt is juſtly required upon them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate
for thoſe Defects and Inconveniences.<note place="margin">Intereſt neceſſary upon Mortgages, and why. But not upon theſe Bills, and why.</note> Whereas the Bills of Credit to
iſſue by and from this Office or Undertaking, are ſo many living Pledges, and
readily, and ſecurely circulating Mortgages, qualified with all the Eſſentials of
Current Money; they are alſo transferrable as Money it ſelf, by the bare Act
of Payment, Tale, or Delivery; and being in their Values and Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
well ſuited to the general Uſes of Trade and Buſineſs, it follows by plain
and evident Deduction, that no Demand of Intereſt can fairly be made upon
them; and that they do well and perfectly anſwer all that is pretended of them
by the Undertakers; which is, the whole advantage of ſound and ſafe Credit.
Were this Undertaking Calculated purely for little, narrow, ſelfiſh, ſiniſter,
and by-ends,<note place="margin">This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking not calculated for narrow or ſiniſter Ends.</note> then indeed the Undertakers would contrive (under pretences
ſpecious enough) to allure Men to load their Eſtates to a Debt of three fourths
of the full Value, principal Sum, leaving them ſubjected to a deſign'd Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure
and Sale, which in ſuch caſe would no doubt be the neceſſary and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
Conſequence. But ſuch are the Benefits tendered and intended by this
Office of Land Credit, that it will intirely free the Eſtates of thoſe concerned in
it; and lead them beſides into a gainful Trade.<note place="margin">The Noble and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this Office.</note>
