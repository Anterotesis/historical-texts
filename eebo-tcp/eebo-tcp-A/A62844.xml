            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Believe all Men will readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that none should speak with more Freedom and Assurance than he that defends or illustrates the Truth. But if we credit the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of former Time, or duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what passes in the present, we shall find none more backward to speak their Minds in publick than such as have Right on their side. Indeed the Goodness of their Cause and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign should fortify 'em, one would think, against all the Attacks of their Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor are there wanting fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examples of Persons, who with unshaken Constancy suffer'd the
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:55936:3"/>
most disgraceful and violent things for love of the Truth. Yet if we make a just Computation, and take in the Primitive Martyrs with the Prophets and Apostles themselves, the profess'd Defenders of Truth, only for Truth's sake, will be found to be a small hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with respect to the numerous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of Error.</p>
            <p>And such is the deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Age, that a Man dares not openly and directly own what he thinks of Divine Matters, tho it be never so true and beneficial, if it but very slightly differs from what is receiv'd by any Party, or that is establish'd by Law; but he is either forc'd to keep perpetual Silence, or to propose his Sentiments to the World, by way of Paradox, under a borrow'd or fictitious Name. To mention the least part of the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences they expose themselves to, who
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:55936:3"/>
have the Courage to act more above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, is too melancholy a Theme, and visible enough to be lamented by all that are truly generous and vertuous.</p>
            <p>The Pravity of most Mens Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and the Ambition of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons makes this Matter seem less strange in Politick and Secular Affairs; and yet a Man may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make new Discoveries and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in Law or Physick, and in the other Arts and Sciences impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibly, but also for so doing be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly encourag'd and rewarded. But wonderful! That the sacred Name of <hi>Religion</hi> which sounds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sanctity, Peace, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, should be so universally abus'd to patronize Ambition, Impiety, and Contention! And that what is our bighest Interest perfectly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, should (for Reasons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be laid open) both be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:55936:4"/>
to be obscure, and very industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously made so! Nay, it is come to this, that Truth meets no where with stronger Opposition, than from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those that raise the loudest Cry about it, and would be taken for no less than the only Dispensers of the Favours and Oracles of Heaven. If any has the Firmness to touch the minutest thing that brings them Gain or Credit, he's presently pursu'd with the Hue and Cry of Heresy: And, if he values their Censures, compell'd to make honourable Amends; or if he proves contumacious, he falls a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, at least in his Reputation, to their implacable Hatred.</p>
            <p>Nor is he like, we may be sure, to receive fairer Quarter from the declar'd Antagonists of Religion, whose Principles, as they trample upon all Equity and Truth, so they oblige 'em to hate and molest the strenuous Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:55936:4"/>
of these and all other Vertues. But of such depressing Considerations enough! Notwithstanding which, I have ventur'd to publish this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, designing thereby to rectify, as much as I'm able, the narrow bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tenets of the One, and the most impious Maxims of the Other.</p>
            <p>No Atheist or Infidel of any kind can justly be angry with me for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring Swords with them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them only with the Weapons they prescribe me. The true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can no more be offended when he finds me imploy Reason, not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate or perplex, but to confirm and elucidate Revelation; unless he is apprehensive I should render it too clear to my self, or too familiar to others, which are Absurdities no Body will own. I hope to make it appear, that the Use of Reason is not so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in Religion as it is commonly
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:55936:5"/>
represented, and that too by such as mightily extol it when it seems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour 'em, yet vouchsafe it not a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it makes against them, but oppose its own Authority to it self. These are high Privileges indeed, and the surest Means of having always the better of the Dispute that could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be devis'd.</p>
            <p>That the mistaken Unbeliever may not say I serve a Hypothesis in the Defence of my Faith, like some who first imagine or receive an Opinion, and then study Proofs to establish it, I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare the thing is much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and that I hold nothing as an Article of my Religion, but what the highest Evidence forc'd me to embrace. For being educated, from my Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, in the grossest Superstition and Idolatry, God was pleas'd to make my own Reason, and such as made use of theirs, the happy Instruments
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:55936:5"/>
of my Conversion. Thus I have been very early accustom'd to Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Enquiry, and taught not to captivate my Understanding, no more than my Senses to any Man or Society whatsoever. Now the best Method, I think, of communicating to others the Truth, is that by which a Man has learnt it himself.</p>
            <p>That the well-meaning Christian may not suspect, as it falls out very ordinarily, that I aim at more than I declare, and cunningly disguise some bad Principles under the fair Pretence of defending the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; I assure him that I write with all the Sincerity and Simplicity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, being as throughly convinc'd of what I maintain, as I can be of any thing. If any good Man should after this Protestation persist to think hard of me, it must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from violent Prepossessions: for
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:55936:6"/>
very few can be found that are not deeply engag'd in some of one sort or another, for which a due Allowance must be made. How fond are we all apt to be of what we learn'd in our Youth, as the Sight or Remembrance of the Places where we past that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time, does strangely affect us! A Mother is more charm'd with the lisping half-form'd Words of her prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Infant, than with the best Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and most solid Discourses. That any Upstart, but of Yesterday, should pretend to overthrow what cost the Antients so much Time and Breath to establish, and themselves so great Pains and Charges to learn, is of hard Digestion to some. And when others are but pray'd to explain their Terms, which commonly signify nothing, or what they must be asham'd to own that would never be thought in an Error, they are uneasy, as an extravagant
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:55936:6"/>
Merchant to examine his Accompts; and 'tis well if they can restrain their Passions. Not only a few Men, but oftentimes whole Societies, whilst they consider Things but very superficially, set such a Value upon certain Sounds, as if they were the real Essence of all Religion. To question or reject any of these, tho never so false and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, is dangerous Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy: And yet, as I hinted now, they either signify nothing, or have been invented by some leading Men to make plain things obscure, and not seldom to cover their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. What is unpardonable, the holy Scripture is put to the Torture to countenance this Scholastick Jargon, and all the metaphysical Chimeras of its Authors. But the Weakness of the greatest part of these Prejudices is so notorious, that to mention them is sufficient Confutation: Nor shall
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:55936:7"/>
I be otherwise mov'd with any thing of this Nature, than a prudent Man would be at the Declamations of such as have recourse to Railing when Reason fails them.</p>
            <p>As for those Gentlemen who sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest that the Credulity of Popery has frighted me to an unwarrantable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from it; I have nothing to say for their Satisfaction, but that I don't envy them the cheap an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious <hi>Mean</hi> they boast of, while I think Truth and Error to be the two Extreams. Religion is not to be modell'd according to our Fancies, nor to be judg'd of as it relates to our private Designs; else there would be full as many Creeds as Persons: But how little soever our Notions agree, and let our worldly Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences be what they will, Religion is always the same, like God its Author, <hi>with whom there is no
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:55936:7"/>
Variableness, nor Shadow of changing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any should ask me whether I have so good an Opinion of my own Abilities, as to imagine that I can prove a rational Account may be given of all those jarring Doctrines, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms, and puzling Distinctions which have for so many Centuries sufficiently exercis'd the Learn'd of all sorts: I answer, that I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (as the Title. Page can testify) that we are able to explain the Terms or Doctrines of this or that Age, Council, or Nation, (most of which are impervious Mysteries with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) but the Terms and Doctrines of the Gospel. They are not the Articles of the East or West, Orthodox or Arian, Protestant or Papist, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as such, that I trouble my self about, but those of Jesus Christ and his Apostles. And in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:55936:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Argument, with every other good Action, I don't meerly rely upon my own poor Attainments, but also upon the Grace of God, who, I hope, will enable me to vindicate his reveal'd Will from the most unjust Imputations of Contradiction and Obscurity.</p>
            <p>I may probably differ in many tbings from Persons deserve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their Learning, and Piety; but that ought to be no Advantage against me if Truth is evidently for me. Since Religion is calculated for reasonable Creatures, 'tis Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not Authority that should bear Weight with them. A wise and good Man will judg of the Merits of a Cause consider'd only in it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Times, Places, or Persons. No Numbers, no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no Interests can ever biass his solid Judgment, or corrupt his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. He knows no Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:55936:8"/>
Popish Infallibility, and being oblig'd blindly to acquiesce in the Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fallible Protestants. And for my own part, as I would have none by false or unfair Consequences make me say what I never thought of; so I would not be told I contradict any thing but Scripture or Reason, which, I'm sure, agree very well together. Nor can it appear strange that I should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon these Terms, since I most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily submit my slef to them, and give all the World the same Right over me. I am not therefore to be put out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by venerable Names, and pompous Citations, that have no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue but such as an ugly Rust and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour give antient Coins. God alone, and such as are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>pir'd by him, can prescribe Injunctions relating to the World to come, whilst human Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers regulate the Affairs of this. Now, to speak more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:55936:9"/>
the following Performance, I don't expect any Deference should be paid me by the World, that spares no body; much less am I desirous of Abettors out of Singularity: but rather if the Reasons I offer be not cogent, I shall take in good part a modest and pertinent Animadversion. And if I am not so happy in rendring things perspicuous to others, as they seem to my self, yet I have fairly aim'd at it, and spoke what I think to be Truth without Fear or Favour; wherefore my good Intentions will need no other Apology.</p>
            <p>Some Passages in the first Section or preliminary Dissertation of Reason, which, in the former Edition, I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected would prove a little obscure to ordinary Readers, are now rendr'd more familiar. And tho I then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that the understanding of those Passages was of no Consequence to any

that would reason fairly, being only inserted to prevent the foreseen Wranglings of certain Men, who stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rather to protract and perplex than to terminate a Controversy; yet I could not but readily comply at this time with the Desires of those, who wish'd 'em more clearly express'd, tho it should cost me a few Words more, whereof I shall always be as sparing as I can. I have likewise every where else en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to speak very intelligibly, and am not without hope that my Assertions do carry their own Light along with them. I have in many Places made explanatory Repetitions of difficult Words, by synonymous Terms of a more general and known Use. This Labour, I grant, is of no Benefit to Philosophers, but it is of considerable Advantage to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, which I'm far from neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like those who in every Preface
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:55936:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tell us they neither court nor care for them. I wonder how any can speak at this rate, especially of those whose very Business it is to serve the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and spare them the Labour of long and painful Study, which their ordinary Occupations will not allow them. Lay-men pay for the Books and Maintenance of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for this very end: but I'm afraid some of the latter will no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, than that Magistrates too are made for the People.</p>
            <p>Nor can any from this Office of the Clergy infer, that the Vulgar are implicitly to receive their Arbitrary Dictates, no more than I am to make over my Reason to him I employ to read, transcribe, or collect for me. The Learn'd will not, contrary to the Experience of their own Taste, take the Brewer's or the Baker's Word for the Goodness of Bread or Drink, tho
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:55936:10"/>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orant of their Craft. And why may not the Vulgar likewise be Judges of the true Sense of Things, tho they understand nothing of the Tongues from whence they are translated for their use? Truth is always and every where the same; and an unintelligible or absurd Proposition is to be never the more respected for being antient or strange, for being originally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew. Besides, a Divinity only intelligible to such as live by it, is, in humane Language, a Trade; and I see not how they can be angry at the Name, that are so passionately in love with the Thing. But of this in due place.</p>
            <p>The Poor, who are not suppos'd to understand Philosophical Systems, soon apprehended the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the plain convincing Instructions of Christ, and the intricate ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Declamations of the Scribes. For
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:55936:11"/>
the Jewish Rabbies, divided at that time into Stoick, Platonick, and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean Sects, &amp;c. did by a mad Liberty of Allegory, accommodate the Scriptures to the wild Speculations of their several Masters. They made the People, who comprehended nothing of their Cabalistick Observations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'em to be all profound Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and so taught 'em Subjection to Heathenish Rites, whilst they set the Law of God at nought by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. No wonder then if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested common sort, and the more ingenuous among the Rulers, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject these nonsensical Superstitions, tho impudently father'd upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> for a Religion suted to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of all, delineated, and foretold by their own Prophets.</p>
            <p>I wish no Application of this could be made, in the following Discourse, to the Case of any Christians; much
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:55936:11"/>
less to the purer and better sort. Whoever considers with what Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Rigour some Men press Obedience to their own Constitutions and Discipline, (conniving in the mean while at all Nonconformity to the Divine Law) bow strictly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the Observation of unreasonable, unscriptural Ceremonies, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of those unfathomable Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what they stiffly hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be incomprehensible; I say, who considers all this, is vehemently tempted to suspect they drive a more selfish Design than that of instructing the Ignorant, or converting the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That any should be hated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd, and molested; nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be charitably burn'd and damn'd, for rejecting those Fooleries superadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in many Cases substituted to the most blessed, pure, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Religion that Men could wish or
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:55936:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enjoy, is Matter of Astonishment and Grief to such as prefer the Precepts of God to the Inventions of Men, the plain Paths of Reason to the insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Labyrinths of the Fathers, and true Christian Liberty to Diabolical and Antichristian Tyranny.</p>

<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:55936:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find his Sentiments in the <hi>Bible,</hi> tho the holy Penmen never thought of them, and you never read that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Book since you were a School-Boy. But a Distrust of your own Reason, a blind Veneration for those that liv'd before you, and a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of adhering to all the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of your Party, will do any thing. Believe only, as a sure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for all your Allegories, that the Words of Scripture, tho never so equivocal and ambiguous without the Context, may signify every where whatever they can signify: And, if this be not enough, believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth is a true Sense of every Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Scripture; that is, that any thing may be made of every thing: And you'll not only find all the New Testament in the Old, and all the Old in the New; but, I promise you, there's no Explication, tho never so
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:55936:13"/>
violent, tho never so contradictory or perplex'd, but you may as easily esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish as admit.</p>
            <p>But I will not repeat what I have expresly written of this Matter in an Epistolary Dissertation, now lying by me, entitul'd, <hi>Systems of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exploded.</hi> In the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which is the first of three, and wherein I prove my Subject in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Divinity of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is taken for granted; so that it regards only Christians immediately, and others but remotely, who are pray'd to weigh my Arguments by the said Supposition. In the next Discourse, equally concerning Christians and others, I attempt a particular and rational Explanation of the reputed <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel. And in the third, I demonstrate the Verity of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation against <hi>Atheists,</hi> and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of reveal'd Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:55936:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This seems to me to be the best Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; for the Order of Nature is in your Systems of Divinity quite invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They prove the Authority and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, before they teach the Contents of Scripture; whereas the first is in great measure known by the last. How can any be sure that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains all things necessary to Salvation, till he first reads it over? Nay, how can he conclude it to be Scripture, or the Word of God, till he exactly studies it, to speak now of no other Means he must use? This Confusion then I have carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for I prove first, that the true Religion must necessarily be reasonable and intelligible. Next I shew, that these requisite Conditions are found in Christianity. But seeing a Man of good Parts and Knowledg may easily frame a clear and coherent System, I demonstrate, Thirdly, that the
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:55936:14"/>
Christian Religion was not form'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a manner, but was divinely reveal'd from Heaven. These three Subjects I handle in as many Books; whereof, as I said before, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Discourse</hi> is the first.</p>
            <p>Before I finish, I must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those Gentlemen who love to call Names in Religion: for what are all Party-Distinctions, but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, so many sorts of Hereticks, or Schismaticks, or worse? But I assure them, that I am neither of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor of <hi>Cephas,</hi> nor of <hi>Apollos,</hi> but of the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who is <hi>the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher of my Faith.</hi> I have as much Right to have others cal'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Name, as they to give me a Denomination, and that is no Right at all. I say not this to prevent being invidiously represented, according to a very common Artifice, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:55936:14"/>
of any Sect in the World that is justly or unjustly hated by others. This would be a poor Consideration indeed! but it is my settl'd Judgment, that the thing is unlawful in it self to a good Christian. Leaving others nevertheless their Liberty in this Point, it must, at least, be granted inconvenient: for if you go under the Name of a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> for instance, tho you agree with those of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion but in the main Articles, yet their Adversaries will not fail, upon occasion, to charge you with those other Matters wherein you dissent: And should you then declare your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the rest of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will not only be much offended, but be apt also to call your Sincerity in ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about every thing besides; which is the known Temper of most Sects. The only religious Title therefore that I shall ever own, for my part, is
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:55936:15"/>
that most glorious one of being a <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Word or two more I must add in answer to the Malice or Mistake of some, who will needs have it that I'm a declar'd Enemy to all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and consequently (say they) to all Religion, because I make 'em the sole Contrivers of those inconceivable or mysterious Doctrines, which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so maintain are as advantageous to themselves, as they are prejudicial to the Laity. Indeed there are those, who, easily overlooking all Contempt of the true Religion, are very ready to treat'em as pernicious Hereticks, or unsufferable Atheists, that shew the least Dislike of what are acknowledg'd Additions to Christianity, whatever Convenience or Necessity may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their Establishment. If any such understand by Religion the mysterious Part of it, then truly it
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:55936:15"/>
will be no hard matter to prove me as little favourable to this Religion, as I'm far from making any Apologies for my self to the Professors of it.</p>
            <p>As for charging Church-men with being the Authors and Introducers of the Christian Mysteries, they must be my Enemies for telling the Truth, who are displeas'd at it: for there is no matter of Fact more evident from every Page both of the Civil, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Histories. Nor had the Laity ever any hand in that Business, otherwise than as confirming by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sanctions what they were first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to by the preaching of their Priests; as they do now sometimes, at their Sollicitation, imprison excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and prosecute erroneous Persons, after the Excommunication is first pronounc'd, and the Heresy decreed or declar'd by the Clergy. Now as all Church-men are not
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:55936:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their Opinions for these Practices, so I see no better Reason they have to be angry with any Body for writing against them that are, than a good Prince can pretend for punishing the Historian of a Tyrant's Vices, only because the Tyrant had been likewise a Prince.</p>
            <p>To all corrupt Clergy-men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who make a meer Trade of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and build an unjust Authority upon the abus'd Consciences of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I'm a profest Adversary; as I hope every good and wise Man already is, or will be. But as I shall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a hearty Friend to pure and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Religion, so I shall preserve the highest Veneration for the sincere Teachers thereof, than whom there is not a more useful Order of Men, and without whom there could not be any happy Society or well constituted Government in this World, to speak
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:55936:16"/>
nothing of their Relation to the World to come, nor of the double Esteem which they deserve for keeping Proof against the general Infection of their Profession. But I have no Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions from the sincere; and if the designing Party discover their Concern by their Displeasure, it may well serve for a Mark to distinguish them, but will not be thought an Injury by me.</p>

               <head>The State of the Question.</head>
               <p n="1">N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. THERE is nothing that Men make a greater Noise about, in our Time especially, than what they generally profess least of all to understand. It may be easily concluded, I mean <hi>the Mysteries of the Christian Religion.</hi> The <hi>Divines,</hi> whose peculiar Province it is to explain them to others, almost unanimously own their Ignorance concerning them. They gravely tell us, <hi>we must adore what we cannot comprehend:</hi> And yet some of 'em press their dubious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the rest of Mankind with more Assurance and Heat, than could be tolerably justify'd, tho we should grant them to be absolutely infallible.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55936:18"/>
The worst on't is, they are not all of a Mind. If you be <hi>Orthodox</hi> to those, you are a <hi>Heretick</hi> to these. He that sides with a Party is adjudg'd to Hell by the Rest; and if he declares for none, he receives no milder Sentence from all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of 'em say the <hi>Mysteries of the Gospel</hi> are to be understood only in the Sense of the <hi>Antient Fathers.</hi> But that is so multifarious, and inconsistent with it self, as to make it impossible for any Body to believe so many Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions at once. They themselves did caution their Readers from leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Authority, without the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Reason:</hi> And thought as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of becoming a Rule of Faith to their Posterity, as we do to ours. Moreover, as all the <hi>Fathers</hi> were not Authors, so we cannot properly be said to have their genuine Sense. <hi>The Works of those that have written are wonderfully corrupted and adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or not entirely extant: And if they were, their Meaning</hi> is much <hi>more obscure, and subject</hi> to Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, than that of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55936:18"/>
3. Others tell us we must be of the Mind of some <hi>particular Doctors,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd Orthodox by the Authority of the <hi>Church.</hi> But as we are not a whit satisfy'd with any Authority of that Nature, so we see these same <hi>particular Doctors</hi> could no more agree than the whole Herd of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically declaim'd against one another's Practices and Errors: That they were as injudicious, violent, and factious as other Men: That they were for the greatest part very credulous and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious in Religion, as well as pitifully ignorant and superficial in the minutest Punctilios of Literature. In a word, that they were of the same Nature and Make with our selves; and that we know of no Privilege above us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon them by Heaven, except Priority of Birth, if that be one, as it's likely few will allow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some give a decisive Voice in the Unravelling of <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to a <hi>General Council;</hi> and others to <hi>one Man</hi> whom they hold to be the Head of the <hi>Church</hi> Universal upon Earth, and the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judg of all Controversies. But we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55936:19"/>
do not think such <hi>Councils</hi> possible, nor (if they were) to be of more Weight than the <hi>Fathers;</hi> for they consist of such, and others as obnoxious altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Mistakes and Passions: And besides, we cannot have Recourse, as to a standing Rule, for the Solution of our Difficulties, to a wonder by God's Mercy now more rarely seen than the secular Games of old. As for the <hi>one Judg of all Controversies,</hi> we suppose none but such as are strongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd by Interest or Educat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>on can in good earnest digest those chimerical supreme Headships, and Monsters of Infallibility. We read no where in the <hi>Bible</hi> of such delegate Judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Christ</hi> to supply his Office: And <hi>Reason</hi> manifestly proclaims them frontless Usurpers. Nor is their Power finally distinguish'd from that of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> to this Hour, by the miserable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They come nearest the thing who affirm, that we are to keep to what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> determine about these Matters: and there is nothing more true, if rightly understood. But ordinarily 'tis an equivocal Way of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55936:19"/>
speaking, and nothing less than the proper Meaning of it is intended by many of those that use it: For they make the <hi>Scriptures</hi> speak either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to some spurious <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or they conform them right or wrong to the bulky Systems and Formularies of their several Communions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some will have us always believé <hi>what the literal Sense imports,</hi> with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Consideration for <hi>Reason,</hi> which they reject as not fit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the reveal'd Part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Others assert, that we may use <hi>Reason</hi> as the Instrument, but not the Rule of our Belief. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, some <hi>Mysteries</hi> may be, or at least seem to be <hi>contrary to Reason,</hi> and yet be receiv'd by Faith. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that no <hi>Mystery</hi> is contrary to <hi>Reason,</hi> but that all are <hi>above</hi> it. Both of 'em from different Principles agree, that several Doctrines of the <hi>New Testament</hi> belong no farther to the Enquiries of <hi>Reason</hi> than to prove 'em divinely reveal'd, and that they are properly <hi>Mysteries</hi> still.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55936:20"/>
7. On the contrary, we hold that <hi>Reason</hi> is the only Foundation of all Certitude; and that nothing reveal'd, whether as to its <hi>Manner</hi> or <hi>Existence,</hi> is more exempted from its Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than the ordinary Phenomena of Nature. Wherefore, we likewise maintain, according to the Title of this Discourse, that <hi>there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to Reason, nor above it; and that no Christian Doctrine can be properly call'd a Mystery.</hi>

But as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and brief Explanation of the Terms is of indispensable use in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing all Controversies; so an easy and natural Method is not less pleasing than profitable. It happily falls out that the Terms of the present Question are dispos'd according to the Order I design to observe; which is, First, to shew what is meant by <hi>Reason,</hi> and its Properties: Then to prove there's no Doctrine of the Gospel contrary to <hi>Reason:</hi> After that, to evince that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any of them above <hi>Reason;</hi> and by consequence, that none is a <hi>Mystery.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>What REASON is not.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="2">2. TO begin with the first, <hi>viz. Reason.</hi> It appears to me very odd, that Men should need Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Explanations of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they define and explain all other things: Or that they cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what they all pretend, in some measure at least, to possess; and is the only Privilege they claim over Brutes and Inanimates. But we find by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that the word <hi>Reason</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as equivocal and ambiguous as any other; though all that are not tickl'd with the Vanity of Singularity, or Itch of Dispute, are at bottom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about the Thing. I'll handle it here with what Brevity I can.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are mistaken who take the <hi>Soul, abstractedly consider'd,</hi> for <hi>Reason:</hi> For as the general Idea of Gold is not a Guinea, but a piece determin'd to a particular Stamp and Value; so not the Soul it self, but the Soul acti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

certain and peculiar Manner, is <hi>Reason.</hi> They err likewise, who affirm <hi>Reason</hi> to be <hi>that Order, Report, or Relation which is naturally between all things:</hi> For not this, but the Thoughts which the Soul forms of things according to it, may properly claim that Title. They speed no better who call <hi>their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> or the <hi>Authority of others,</hi> by that Name. But it will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what it is from the following Considerations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Every one experiences in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Power or Faculty of forming various Ideas or Perceptions of Things: Of affirming or denying, according as he sees them to agree or disagree: And so of loving and desiring what seems good unto him; and of hating and avoiding what he thinks evil. The right Use of all these Faculties is what we call Common Sense, or <hi>Reason</hi> in general. But the bare Act of receiving Ideas into the Mind, whether <hi>by the Intromission of the Senses,</hi> as Colours, Figures, Sounds, Smells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those Ideas be <hi>the simple Operations of the Soul</hi> about what it thus gets from without, as meer <hi>Consciousness</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55936:22"/>
for Example, <hi>Knowing, Affirming,</hi> or <hi>Denying,</hi> without any farther Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: This bare Act, I say, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving such Ideas into the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd, is not strictly <hi>Reason,</hi> because the Soul herein is purely passive. When a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Object is conveniently presented to the Eye, Ear, or any other Sense right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispos'd, it necessarily makes those Impressions which the Mind at the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> time cannot refuse to lodg. And we find it can as little forbear being conscious of its own Thoughts or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> concerning this Object: Thus when my Eyes are sound and open, as at this time, I have not only an Idea of the Picture that is before me, but I likewise know, I perceive, and affirm that I see it, I consider it, it pleases me, I wish it were mine: And thus I form, or rather after this manner I have first form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d, the Ideas of <hi>Knowing, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Affirming, Denying, Considering, Willing, Desiring,</hi> and the Ideas of all the other Operations of the Mind, which are thus occasion'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Impressions of sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55936:22"/>
5. By the word IDEA which I make so much use of here, and shall more frequently in the following Discourse, I understand <hi>the immediate Object of the Mind when it thinks,</hi> or <hi>any Thought that the Mind imploys about any thing,</hi> whether such a Thought be the <hi>Image</hi> or Representation of a Body, as is the Idea of a <hi>Tree;</hi> or whether it be some <hi>Sensation</hi> occasion'd by any Body, such as are the Ideas of <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> of <hi>Smells</hi> and <hi>Tastes;</hi> or whether, lastly, it be a <hi>meerly intellectual</hi> or <hi>abstracted Thought,</hi> such as are the Ideas of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>created Spirits,</hi> of <hi>Arguing,</hi> of <hi>Suspension,</hi> of <hi>Thinking</hi> in general, or the like.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="6">6. BUT altho these simple and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ideas, thus laid up in the great Repository of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Be not, as was observ'd, what we call strictly <hi>Reason,</hi> yet they are the sole Matter and Foundation of all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55936:23"/>
our <hi>Reasoning:</hi> For the Mind does upon occasion compare them together, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them into complex Ideas, and enlarge, contract, or separate them, as it discovers their Circumstances capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or not. So that all our Knowledg is, in effect, nothing else but <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Ideas in a greater or lesser Number, whereinsoever this Agreement or Disagreement may consist.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Perception is immediate or mediate, our Knowledg is twofold.</p>
               <p n="7">7. First, <hi>When the Mind, without the Assistance of any other Idea, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceives the Agreement or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of two or more Ideas, as that Two and Two is Four, that Red is not Blew; it cannot be call'd Reason, tho it be the highest Degree of Evidence:</hi> For here's no need of Discourse or Probation, <hi>Self-evidence</hi> excluding all manner of Doubt and Darkness. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions so clear of themselves as to want no Proofs, their Terms being once understood, are commonly known by the Names of <hi>Axioms</hi> and <hi>Maxims.</hi> And it is visible that their Number is indefinite, and not confin'd only to two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55936:23"/>
or three abstracted Propositions made (as all <hi>Axioms</hi> are) from the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particular Instances; as, that <hi>the Whole is greater than any Part,</hi> that <hi>Nothing can have no Properties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. But, Secondly, <hi>when the Mind cannot immediately perceive the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Disagreement of any Ideas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot be brought near enough together, and so compar'd, it applies one or more intermediate Ideas to discover it:</hi> as, when by the successive Application of a Line to two distant Houses, I find how far they agree or disagree in Length, which I could not effect with my Eye. Thus from the Force of the Air, and the Room it takes up, I know it has Solidity and Extension; and that therefore it is as much a Body (tho I cannot see it) as Wood, or Stone, with which it agrees in the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. Here <hi>Solidity</hi> and <hi>Extension</hi> are the Line by which I find <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are equal, or that Air is a Body; because Solidity and Extension agree to both. We prove the least imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Particle of Matter divisible, by shewing all Bodies to be divisible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Particle of Matter is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55936:24"/>
a Body: and after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is the <hi>Mortality</hi> of all living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies inferr'd from their <hi>Divisibility.</hi> This Method of Knowledg is properly call'd <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Demonstration,</hi> (as the former <hi>Self-evidence</hi> or <hi>Intuition);</hi> and it may be defin'd, <hi>That Faculty of the Soul which discovers the Certainty of any thing dubious or obscure, by comparing it with something evidently known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. From this Definition it is plain, that <hi>the intermediate Idea can be no Proof where its Agreement with both the Ideas of the Question is not evident; and that if more than one Idea be necessary to make it appear, the same Evidence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in each of them.</hi> For if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of all the Parts of a <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> were not indubitable, we could never be certain of the Inference or Conclusion whereby we join the two Extreams: So tho <hi>Self-evidence</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>Reason,</hi> yet all <hi>Demonstration</hi> becomes at length <hi>self-evident.</hi> It is yet plainer, that <hi>when we have no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Ideas of a thing, we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son about it at all; and where we have Ideas, if intermediate ones, to shew their constant and necessary Agreement or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55936:24"/>
fail us, we can never go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond</hi> Probability. Tho we have an Idea of <hi>inhabited,</hi> and an Idea of the <hi>Moon,</hi> yet we have no intermediate Idea to shew such a necessary Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as to make us certainly conclude that <hi>this Planet is inhabited,</hi> however likely it may seem. Now, <hi>since PROBABILITY is not KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDG, I banish all HYPOTHESES from my PHILOSOPHY;</hi> because if I admit never so many, yet <hi>my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is not a jot increas'd:</hi> for no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Connection appearing between my Ideas, I may possibly take the wrong side of the Question to be the right, which is equal to knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Matter. When I have arriv'd at <hi>Knowledg,</hi> I enjoy all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that attends it; where I have only <hi>Probability,</hi> there I suspend my Judgment, or, if it be worth the Pains, I search after Certainty.</p>

all our Knowledg; nor can we possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have Ideas any other way without new Organs or Faculties.</p>

Thus <hi>all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matters of Fact, duly attested by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evous Persons as known to them, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively related by others of different Times, Nations, or Interests, who could neither be impos'd upon themselves, nor be justly suspected of combining together to deceive others, ought to be receiv'd by us for as certain and indubitable as if we had seen them with our own Eyes, or heard them with our own Ears.</hi> By this means it is, I believe there was such a City as <hi>Carthage,</hi> such a Reformer as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and that there is such a Kingdom as <hi>Poland.</hi> When all these Rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in any Matter of Fact, I take it then for <hi>Demonstration,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <hi>Irresistible Evidence from

Not that I think every Idea has a perfect Pattern to represent, as the Ideas of <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in my Mind are like the <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the Pen I handle; for <hi>some Ideas are but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of certain Powers in the Particles of Bodies to OCCASION particular Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations in us;</hi> as the <hi>Sweetness</hi> of Sugar and the <hi>Cold</hi> of Ice, are no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them than <hi>Pain</hi> in the Knife that cuts me, or <hi>Sickness</hi> in the Fruit that surfeits me. But tho such <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ideas</hi> have no Existence out of our Imagination, yet the Pleasure, Pain, and other Qualities they excite, shew us the Good or Harm their Subjects may do us; which renders the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them as useful as that of the Properties which <hi>really</hi> exist in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55936:27"/>
Things themselves. Without the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of Fire, what should its <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> and <hi>Quantity</hi> serve for? And what sets a Price upon Amber-greece, but the <hi>Perfume?</hi> The Reason then why I believe the Idea of a Rose to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is the true Representation it gives me of that Flower. I know it is true, because the Rose must contain all the Properties which its Idea exhibits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>really,</hi> as the Bulk and Form, or <hi>occasionally,</hi> as the Colour, Taste and Smell. And I cannot doubt of this, because the Properties must belong to the exemplary Cause, or to Nothing, or be the Figments of my own Brain: But <hi>Nothing can have no Properties;</hi> and <hi>I cannot make one single Idea at my Pleasure,</hi> nor <hi>avoid receiving Ideas when Objects work on my Senses:</hi> Therefore I conclude the Properties of the Rose are not the Creatures of my Fancy, but belong to the exemplary Cause, that is, the Object.</p>

But <hi>God</hi> the wife Creator of all, (ever to be nam'd and thought upon with Reverence) who has enabl'd us to perceive Things, and form Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them, has also endu'd us with the Power of <hi>suspending our Judgments about whatever is uncertain, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver assenting but to clear Perceptions.</hi> He is so far from putting us upon any Necessity of erring, that as he has thus privileg'd us on the one hand with a Faculty of guarding our selves against Prepossession, or Precipitation, by <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Liberty only in what is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or dubious and obscure;</hi> so he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides on the other hand, that we should discern and embrace the Truth, by <hi>taking it out of our Power to dissent from an evident Proposition.</hi> We must necessarily believe, that <hi>it is impossible the same thing should be and not be at once:</hi> Nor can all the World perswade us to doubt of it. But we need not admit that there's no <hi>Void</hi> in Nature, or that the Earth absolves an annual Course about the Sun, till we get <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations</hi> to that Effect.</p>

But it is as true, that if we could not suspend our Assent to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious or obscure Propositions, <hi>Almighty Goodness</hi> (which is impossible) <hi>should be the real Cause of all our Errors.</hi>
               </p>

I answer, <hi>'tis because they are not made evident:</hi> For Perspicuity and Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are relative Terms, and what is either to me may be the quite contrary

to another. If Things be deliver'd in Words not understood by the Hearer, nor demonstrated to agree with other Truths already very clear, or now so made to him, he cannot conceive'em. Likewise if the Order of Nature and due Simplicity be not observ'd, he cannot see them evidently true or false; and so suspends his Judgment, (if no Affection sways him) where another, it may be, receives perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Hence it is that we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, with Indignation and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, attribute that to the Stupidity and Obstinacy of others, which is the Fruit of our own confus'd Ratiocination, sor want of having throughly digested our Thoughts; or by affecting ambiguous Expressions, and using such as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has no Ideas to at all, or different ones from ours.</p>

This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I must remark it too, does high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern us of the <hi>Laity;</hi> for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came to be first establish'd, the <hi>Clergy</hi> (always excepting such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it) have not been since wanting to themselves, but improv'd it so far as not only to make the plainest, but the most trifling things in the World <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> that we might constantly depend upon them for the Explication. And nevertheless, they must not, if they could, explain them to us, without ruining their own Design, let them never so fairly pretend it. But, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking all Observations proper for this Place, let us enter upon the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Examen of the Opinion it self.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The first thing I shall insist upon is, that if any Doctrine of the <hi>New
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55936:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Testament</hi> be contrary to Reason, we have no manner of Idea of it. To say, for instance, that <hi>a Ball is white and black at once,</hi> is to say just nothing; for these Colours are so incompatible in the same Subject, as to exclude all Possibility of a real positive Idea or Conception. So to say, as the <hi>Papists,</hi> that <hi>Children dying before Baptism are damn'd without Pain,</hi> signifies nothing at all: For if they be intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the other World, to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally excluded God's Presence, and the Society of the Blessed, must prove ineffable Torment to them: But if they think they have no Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then they are not capable of Damnation in their Sense; and so they should not say they are in <hi>Limbo-</hi>Dungeon, but that either they had no Souls, or were annihilated; which (had it been true, as they can never shew) would be reasonable enough, and easily conceiv'd. Now if we have no Ideas of a thing, it is certainly but lost Labour for us to trouble our selves about it: For what I don't conceive, can no more give me right Notions of God, or influence my Actions, than
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55936:32"/>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If any should think to evade the Difficulty by saying, that the Ideas of certain Doctrines may be contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to common Notions, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with themselves, and I know not what supra-intellectual Truths, he's but just where he was. But supposing a little that the thing were so; it still follows, that none can understand these Doctrines except their Perceptions be communicated to him in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, as by new Powers and Organs. And then too, others cannot be edifi'd by what is discours'd of 'em, unless they enjoy the same Favour. So that if I would go preach the Gospel to the <hi>Wild Indians,</hi> I must expect the Ideas of my Words should be, I know
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55936:32"/>
not how, infus'd into their Souls in order to apprehend me: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Hypothesis, they could no more, without a Miracle, understand my Speech than the chirping of Birds; and <hi>if they knew not the Meaning of my</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Spirit.</hi> But what do they mean by consisting with themselves, yet not with our common Notions? <hi>Four</hi> may be call'd <hi>Five</hi> in Heaven; but so the Name only is chang'd, the Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains still the same. And since we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this World know any thing but by our common Notions, how shall we be sure of this pretended Consistency between our present seeming Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and the Theology of the World to come? For as 'tis by <hi>Reason</hi> we arrive at the Certainty of God's own Existence, so we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise discern his <hi>Revelations</hi> but by their Conformity with our natural Notices of him, which is in so many words, to agree with our common Notions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The next thing I shall remark is, That those, who stick not to say <hi>they could believe a downright Contradiction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55936:33"/>
to Reason, did they find it contain'd in the Scripture,</hi> do justify all Absurdities whatsoever; and, by opposing one Light to another, undeniably make God the Author of all Incertitude. The very Supposition, that Reason might authorize one thing, and the Spirit of God another, throws us into inevitable <hi>Scepticism;</hi> for we shall be at a perpetual Uncertainty which to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: Nay, we can never be sure which is which. For the Proof of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of <hi>Scripture</hi> depending upon Reason, if the clear Light of the one might be any way contradicted, how shall we be convinc'd of the Infallibility of the other? Reason may err in this Point as well as in any thing else; and we have no particular Promise it shall not, no more than the <hi>Papists</hi> that their Senses may not deceive them in every thing as well as in <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> To say it bears witness to it self, is equally to establish the <hi>Alcoran</hi> or the <hi>Poran.</hi> And 'twere a notable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to tell a <hi>Heathen,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> has declar'd it, when all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties will say as much for themselves, if we take their word for it. Besides,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55936:33"/>
it may be, he would ask whence the <hi>Church</hi> had Authority to decide this Matter? And if it should be answer'd from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> a thousand to one but he would divert himself with this Circle. You must believe that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is Divine, because the <hi>Church</hi> has so determin'd it, and the <hi>Church</hi> has this deciding Authority from the <hi>Scripture.</hi> 'Tis doubted if this Power of the <hi>Church</hi> can be prov'd from the Passages alledg'd to that purpose; but the <hi>Church</hi> it self (a Party concern'd) affirms it. Hey-day! are not these eternal Rounds very exquisite Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to giddy and entangle the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking and the Weak?</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if we believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be Divine, not upon its own bare Assertion, but from a real Testimony consisting in the Evidence of the things contain'd therein; from undoubted Effects, and not from Words and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; what is this but to prove it by <hi>Reason?</hi> It has in it self, I grant, the brightest Characters of <hi>Divinity:</hi> But 'tis <hi>Reason</hi> finds them out, examines them, and by its Principles approves and pronounces them sufficient; which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55936:34"/>
orderly begets in us an Acquiescence of <hi>Faith</hi> or Perswasion. Now if Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars be thus severely sifted; if not only the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> be consider'd, but also their Lives, Predictions, Miracles, and Deaths; surely all this Labour would be in vain, might we upon any account dispense with Contradictions. O! blessed and commodious System, that dischargest at one stroak those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Remarks about History, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, figurative and literal Senses, Scope of the Writer, Circumstances, and other Helps of Interpretation! We judg of a Man's Wisdom and Learning by his Actions, and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; but God, who we are assur'd <hi>has not left himself without a Witness,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14. 17.</note> must have no Privileges above the maddest Enthusiast, or the <hi>Devil</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, at this rate.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But a Veneration for the very Words of God will be pretended: This we are pleas'd with; for we know <hi>that God is not a Man that he should lie.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Num. 23. 19.</note> But the Question is not about the Words, but their Sense, which must be ever worthy of their Author, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55936:34"/>
therefore according to the Genius of all Speech, figuratively interpreted, when occasion requires it. Otherwise, under pretence of <hi>Faith in the Word of God,</hi> the highest Follies and Blasphemies may be deduc'd from the Letter of <hi>Scripture;</hi> as, that God is subject to Passions, is the Author of Sin, that <hi>Christ</hi> is a Rock, was actually guilty of and defil'd with our Transgressions, that we are Worms or Sheep, and no Men. And if a Figure be admitted in these Passages, why not, I pray, in all Expressions of the like Nature, when there appears an equal Necessity for it?</p>
               <p n="9">9. It may be demanded why I have so long insisted upon this Article, since that none expresly makes <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> contradictory, was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd before? But in the same place mention is made of some who hold, that <hi>they may seem directly to clash;</hi> and that tho we cannot reconcile them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet that we are bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the Decisions of the former. A <hi>seeming</hi> Contradiction is to us as much as a <hi>real</hi> one; and our Respect for the <hi>Scripture</hi> does not require us to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55936:35"/>
grant any such in it, but rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we are ignorant of the right Meaning when a Difficulty occurs; and so <hi>to suspend our Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, till with sutable Helps and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry we discover the Truth.</hi> As for acquiescing in what a Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not, or cannot reconcile to his Reason, they know best the fruits of it that practise it. For my part, I'm a Stranger to it, and cannot reconcile my self to such a Principle. On the contrary, I am pretty sure <hi>he pretends in vain to convince the Judgment, who explains not the Nature of the Thing.</hi> A Man may give his verbal Assent to he knows not what, out of <hi>Fear, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Indifference, Interest,</hi> and the like feeble and unfair Motives: but as long as he conceives not what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, he cannot sincerely acquiesce in it, and remains depriv'd of all solid Satisfaction.

               <p n="10">10. The natural Result of what has been said is, That to believe the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the Sense of any Passage thereof, without rational Proofs, and an evident Consistency, is a blameable Credulity, and a temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Opinion, ordinarily grounded upon an ignorant and wilful Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but more generally maintain'd out of a gainful Prospect. For we frequently embrace certain Doctrines not from any convincing Evidence in them, but because they serve our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs better than the Truth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause other Contradictions we are not willing to quit, are better defended by their means.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Authority of REVELATION, as it regards this Controversy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="11">11. AGainst all that we have been establishing in this Section, <hi>the Authority of Revelation</hi> will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd with great shew, as if without a Right of silencing or extingu shing REASON, it were altogether useless and impertinent. But if the Distinction I made in the precedent Section, N. 9. be well consider'd, the Weakness of the present Objection will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and this Controversy be better understood hereaster. There I said REVELATION was not a necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Motive of Assent, but a <hi>Mean of Information.</hi> We should not confound the Way whereby we come to the knowledg of a thing, with the Grounds we have to believe it. A Man may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me concerning a thousand Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I never heard of before, and of which I should not as much as think if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55936:36"/>
I were not told; yet I believe nothing purely upon his word without <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the things themselves. Not the bare Authority of him that speaks, but the clear Conception I form of what he says, is the <hi>Ground of my Perswasion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. If the sincerest Person on Earth should assure me he saw a Cane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two ends, I neither should nor could believe him; because this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plainly contradicts the Idea of a Cane. But if he told me he saw a Staff that, being by chance laid in the Earth, did after some time put forth Sprigs and Branches, I could easily rely upon his Veracity; because this no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Idea of a Staff, nor tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends Possibility.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I say <hi>Possibility;</hi> for <hi>Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> it self can do no more. They impose upon themselves and others, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Assent to things contradictory, because <hi>God,</hi> say they, <hi>can do all things, and it were limiting of his Power to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the contrary.</hi> Very good! we heartily believe God can do all things: But that meer NOTHING should be the Object of his Power, the very <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency</hi> alledg'd will not permit us to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55936:37"/>
conceive. And that every <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which is a Synonym for <hi>Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> is <hi>pure nothing,</hi> we have already sufficiently demonstrated. To say, for example, that <hi>a thing is extended and not extended, is round and square at once,</hi> is to say <hi>nothing;</hi> for these Ideas destroy one another, and cannot subsist together in the same Subject. But when we clearly perceive a perfect Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Connection between the Terms of any Proposition, we then conclude it possible because intelligible: So I understand God may render im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately solid, what has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fluid; make present Beings cease to exist or change their Forms; and <hi>call those things that are not, as tho they were.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 17.</note> When we say then, <hi>that nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible with God,</hi> or that he can do all things, we mean whatever is possible in it self, however far above the Power of Creatures to effect.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now, such is the Nature of a Matter of Fact, that tho it may be conceiv'd possible enough, yet he only can with Assurance assert its Existence who is himself the Author, or by some <hi>Means of Information</hi> comes first to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55936:37"/>
the certain knowledg of it. That there was such an Island as <hi>Jamaica,</hi> no <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> could ever reasonably deny: And yet that it was precisely situated in such a Latitude, was water'd with those Rivers, cloth'd with these Woods, bore this Grain, produc'd that Plant, no <hi>English-man</hi> before the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>America,</hi> could positively affirm.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Thus God is pleas'd to reveal to us in <hi>Scripture</hi> several wonderful Matters of Fact, as <hi>the Creation of the World, the last Judgment,</hi> and many other important Truths, which no Man left to himself could ever imagine, no more than any of my fellow-Creatures can be sure of my private Thoughts: <hi>For who knoweth the things of a Man</hi>

                  <hi>save the Spirit of a Man that is in him? even so the things of God knoweth none but the Spirit of God.</hi> But as <hi>secret things belong unto the Lord;</hi> so <hi>those things</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>which are reveal'd, belong unto us and to our Children.</hi> Yet, as we discours'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we do not receive them only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are reveal'd: For <hi>besides the infallible Testimony of the Revelation from all requisite Circumstances, we must

               <p n="16">16. <hi>Whoever reveals any thing,</hi> that is, whoever tells us something we did not know before, <hi>his Words must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and the Matter possible.</hi> This RULE holds good, let <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> be the Revealer. If we count that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a Fool who requires our Assent to what is manifestly incredible, how dare we blasphemously attribute to <hi>the most perfect Being,</hi> what is an acknowledg'd Defect in one of our selves? As for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible Relations, we can no more believe them from the Revelation of God, than from that of Man; for the conceiv'd Ideas of things are the only Subjects of Believing, Denying, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and every other Act of the Understanding: Therefore <hi>all Matters reveal'd by God or Man, must be equally intelligible and possible;</hi> so far both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations agree. But in this they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that tho the Revelation of Man should be thus qualifi'd, yet <hi>he may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55936:38"/>
impose upon me as to the Truth of the thing;</hi> whereas what God is pleas'd to discover to me is not only clear to my Reason, (without which his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could make me no wiser) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>it is always true.</hi> A Man, for Example, acquaints me that he has found a Treasure: This is plain and possible, but he may easily deceive me. God assures me, that he has form'd Man of Earth: This is not only possible to God, and to me very intelligible; but the thing is also most certain, <hi>God not being capable to deceive me, as Man is.</hi> We are then to expect the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Perspicuity</hi> from God as from Man, tho more of <hi>Certitude</hi> from the first than the last.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This Reason perswades, and the Scriptures expresly speakit.

it upon Distance of Time, and the want of more Books in the same Tongue, than to attribute it to the Nature of the thing, or the Ignorance of the Author, who might be easily understood by his Country-men and Contemporaries.

From what has been said it is clear, that they understood by <hi>Mystery</hi> in those Days <hi>a thing intelligible of it self, but so vail'd by others, that it could not be known without special Revelation.</hi> I need not add, that in all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors it is constantly put, as a very vulgar Expression, for any thing sacred or profane that is design'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept secret, or accidentally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. And this is the common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of it still: for when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see clearly into a Business, we say it is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to us; and that an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure or perplex'd Discourse is very <hi>mysterious.

think a long Prescription will argue it Folly in any to appear against them, and indeed Custom has made it dangerous. But, slighting so mean Considerations, if I can demonstrate that in the New Testament <hi>Mystery</hi> is always us'd in the first Sense of the Word, or that of the <hi>Gentiles, viz.</hi> for <hi>things naturally very intelligible, but so cover'd by figurative Words or Rites, that Reason could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them without special Revelation;</hi> and that the Vail is actually taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; then it will manifestly follow that the Doctrines so reveal'd cannot now be properly call'd <hi>Mysteries.</hi>

I'm perswaded there's no Motion which does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite some Sound in Ears dispos'd to be affected with proportionable Degrees of Force from the Air; and, it may be, the small Animals concern'd can hear the Steps of the <hi>Spider,</hi> as we do those of Men and Cattel.

They trifle then exceedingly, and discover a mighty Scarcity of better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, who defend their <hi>Mysteries</hi> by this pitiful Shift of drawing Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from what is unknown to what is known, or of insisting upon adequate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas; except they will agree, as some do, to call every Spire of Grass, Sitting and Standing, Fish or Flesh, profound <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi> And if out of a pertinacious or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55936:57"/>
worse Humour they will be still fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and call these things <hi>Mysteries,</hi> I'm willing to admit as many as they please in <hi>Religion,</hi> if they will allow me likewise to make mine as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others as these are to me.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But to finish this Point, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that neither GOD himself, nor any of his Attributes, are <hi>Mysteries</hi> to us for want of an adequate Idea: No, not <hi>Eternity.</hi> The <hi>mysterious Wits</hi> do never more expose themselves than when they treat of <hi>Eternity</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Then they think themselves in their impregnable Fortress, and strangely insult over those dull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that cannot find a thing where it is not. For if any Bounds (as Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or End) could be assign'd to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> it ceases immediately to be what it should; and you frame only a finite, or rather <hi>a negative Idea,</hi> which is the Nature of all Limitation. Nor can it be said, that therefore <hi>Eternity is above Reason</hi> in this Respect, or that it is any Defect in us not to exhaust its Idea; for what greater Perfection can be ascrib'd to <hi>Reason</hi> than to know precisely the Nature of things? And
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55936:57"/>
does not all its Errors lie in attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Properties to a thing which it has not, or taking any away that it contains? <hi>Eternity</hi> therefore is no more above Reason <hi>because it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,</hi> than a Circle, <hi>because it may;</hi> for in both Cases <hi>Reason</hi> performs its Part acording to the different Natures of the Objects, whereof the one is essentially imaginable, the other not.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Now it appears that the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mysteriousness</hi> of <hi>Eternity</hi> do's not consist in the want of an adequate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is all that we consider in it at present. The Difficulties rais'd from its Duration, as, that <hi>Succession seems to make it finite,</hi> and that <hi>all things must exist together if it be instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous,</hi> I despair not of solving very easily; and rendring <hi>Infinity</hi> also (which is inseparable from it, or rather a different Consideration of the same thing) as little <hi>mysterious</hi> as that <hi>three and two make five.</hi> But this falls natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into my <hi>second Discourse,</hi> where I give a particular Explication of the <hi>Christian</hi> Tenets, according to the general Principles I am establishing in this.</p>

16. As we know not all the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things, so we can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Essence</hi> of any Substance in the World. To avoid Ambiguity, I distinguish, after an excellent modern Philosopher, the <hi>Nominal</hi> from the <hi>Real Essence</hi> of a thing. <hi>The nominal Essence is a Collection of those Properties or Modes which we principally observe in any thing, and to which we give one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Denomination or Name.</hi> Thus <hi>the nominal Essence</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> is a bright, hot, and round Body, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Distance from us, and that has a constant regular Motion. Whoever hears the Word <hi>Sun</hi> pronounc'd, this is the Idea he has of it. He may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more of its Properties, or not all these; but it is still a Collection of Modes or Properties that makes his Idea. So the <hi>Nominal Essence</hi> of <hi>Honey</hi> consists in its Colour, Taste, and other known Attributes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But <hi>the real Essence is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Constitution of a thing which is the Ground or Support of all its Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and from which they naturally flow or result.</hi> Now tho we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Modes of things must
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55936:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Nor is it undeserving our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Notice, that <hi>Mystery</hi> is here made the distinguishing Mark of the false or <hi>Antichristian</hi> Church. <hi>Mystery is a Name written on her Forehead;</hi> that is, all her Religion consists in <hi>Mystery,</hi> she openly owns, she enjoins the Belief of <hi>Mysteries.</hi> And, no doubt on't, <hi>as far as any Church allows of Mysteries, so far it is ANTICHRISTIAN,</hi> and may with a great deal of Justice, tho little Honour, claim Kindred with the <hi>scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore.</hi> The only remaining Text is in <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>And the Angel which I saw stand upon the Sea and upon the Earth, lifted up his Hand to Heaven, and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created Heaven and the things that therein are, and the Earth and the things that therein are, and the Sea and the things which are therein, that there should be Time no longer; but that in the Days of the Voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the MYSTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY of God should be finish'd:</hi> that is, that all the things figuratively deliver'd in this Prophecy concerning the <hi>Gospel</hi>

                  <hi>God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> But if these Words be spoken of <hi>Reason,</hi> there can be nothing more false; because <hi>Reason</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55936:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do's and ought to subject it self to the Divine Law: yet this Submission ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no Imperfection in <hi>Reason,</hi> as our Obedience to just Laws cannot be said to destroy our Liberty. <hi>Reason</hi> must first understand the Law of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>carnal Mind</hi> then in this Place is not <hi>Reason,</hi> but the carnal Desires of lewd and wicked Men; whose Practices, as they are contrary to the reveal'd Law of God, so they are to that of sound <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> too.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55936:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
because this Reasoning might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, and to leave no plausible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Cavillers or Deceivers, I have punctually answer'd the strongest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections I have observ'd in the most celebrated Pieces of <hi>Divinity;</hi> I say <hi>which I have observ'd,</hi> for I should read the <hi>Gospel</hi> a Million of Times over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vulgar Notion of <hi>Mystery</hi> could ever enter into my Head, or any Passage in that Book could suggest to me that the Sense of it was above Reason or Enquiry. Nor do I find my self yet inchn'd to envy those who entertain other Thoughts of it, when all the while they openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it to be a Divine Revelation. But seeing the most material Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made to me by a Friend, is that my Opinion destroys the Nature of <hi>FAITH,</hi> I shall with all the Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I can deliver my Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Subject.</p>
               <p n="52">52. I will spend no time upon the ordinary Divisions of <hi>Faith</hi> into Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical, Temporary, or Justifying, Lively or Dead, Weak or Strong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most of these are not so much <hi>Faith</hi> it self, as different Effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55936:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The word imports <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,</hi> as when we give Credit to any thing which is told us by God or Man; whence <hi>Faith</hi> is properly divided into <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> Again, <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is either when God speaks to us immediately himself, or when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the Words or Writings of those to whom we believe he has spoken. All <hi>Faith</hi> now in the World is of this last sort, and by consequence entirely built upon <hi>Ratiocination.</hi> For we must first be convinc'd that those Writings are theirs whose Names they bear, we then examine the outward State and Actions of those Persons, and lastly understand what is contain'd in their Works; otherwise we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether they be worthy of God or not, much less firmly believe them.</p>
               <p n="53">53. To be confident of any thing without conceiving it, is no real <hi>Faith</hi> or Perswasion, but a rash Presumption, and an obstinate Prejudice, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Enthusiasts or Impostors than the taught of God, who has no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to delude his Creatures, nor wants Ability to inform them rightly. I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55936:81"/>
prov'd before, <hi>(Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) that the Difference between <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> did not consist in degrees of Perspicuity, but in Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. So many Circumstances fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently concur in History as render it equal to Intuition: Thus I can as soon deny my own Being as the Murder of <hi>Cicero,</hi> or the Story of <hi>William the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;</hi> yet this happens only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: But God speaks always Truth and Certainty.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Now since by <hi>Revelation</hi> Men are not endu'd with any new Faculties, it follows that God should lose his end in speaking to them, if what he said did not agree with their common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Could that Person justly value himself upon being wiser than his Neighbours, who having infallible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that something call'd <hi>Blictri</hi> had a Being in Nature, in the mean time knew not what this <hi>Blictri</hi> was? And seeing the Case stands really thus, all <hi>Faith</hi> or Perswasion must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consist of two Parts, <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Assent.</hi> 'Tis the last indeed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes the formal Act of <hi>Faith,</hi> but not without the Evidence of the first: And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55936:81"/>
this is the true Account we have of it all over the <hi>New Testament.</hi> There we read that <hi>without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>

                  <hi>to please God;</hi> but <hi>he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> So the firm Perswasion of a pious Man that his Requests will be granted, is grounded upon his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Being, Goodness, and Power of God. It was reckon'd no Crime not to believe in <hi>Christ</hi> before he was reveal'd; <hi>for how could they believe in him of whom they had not heard?</hi> But <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> with what better Reason could any be condemn'd for not believing what he said, if they might not understand it? for, as far as I can see, these Cases are parallel. <hi>Faith</hi> is likewise said <hi>to come by hearing;</hi> but without Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ver. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>things hop'd for, and the Demonstration

But to all this will be objected that remarkable Instance of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith, who was ready to sacrifice his only Son, notwithstanding God had promis'd that Kings should descend of him, and his Seed be numerous as the Stars of Heaven, or the Sand upon the Sea-shore. Did <hi>Abraham</hi> blindly obey then, without reconciling the apparent Contradiction between God's present Command and his former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises?

God was able to revive <hi>Isaac</hi> by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as he was miraculously born, according to another Promise, after his Parents were past having Children, and so <hi>as good as dead:</hi> therefore it is elsewhere written of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note>

               <p n="58">58. Now what is there in all this, but very strict Reasoning from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, from the Possibility of the thing, and from the Power, Justice, and Immutability of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd it? Nor can any Man stew me in all the <hi>New Testament</hi> another Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>Faith</hi> but a most firm Perswasion built upon substantial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. In this Sense all <hi>Christianity</hi> is not seldom stil'd <hi>the Faith;</hi> as now we usually say that we are of this or that PERSWASION, meaning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of some Religion. But surely
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55936:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing can better <hi>root</hi> and <hi>establish</hi> our Perswasion than a thorow Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Trial of what we believe; whereas the Weakness and Instability of our <hi>Faith</hi> proceed from want of sufficient Reasons for it, whereupon Incredulity always follows; then fails Obedience, which is the constant Sign and Fruit of genuine <hi>Faith;</hi> and hence spring all the Irregularities of Mens Lives. <hi>He that saith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2. 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>is a Liar—</hi>For <hi>he that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk as he walk'd.</hi> Nor can it possibly fall out otherwise, but that he who believes without Understanding must <hi>be tost and carri'd about with every Wind of</hi>

                  <hi>Doctrine, by the Slight and Cunning of Men ready to deceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="59">59. Tho the Authority of the New Testament be so clear in this Matter, yet I shall further confirm it by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Observations. First, <hi>if Faith were not a Perswasion resulting from the previous Knowledg and Comprehension of the thing believ'd, there could be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees nor Differences in it;</hi> for these are evident Tokens that Men know more
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55936:84"/>
or less of a thing, as they have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires or Opportunities to learn it. But that there are such Degrees appears by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> where those that have only an imperfect and perfunctory Knowledg of Religion are compar'd to <hi>Infants</hi> who feed only upon Milk; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 2.</note> but they who arrive at a more full and accurate Certainty are liken'd to <hi>grown Men</hi> that can digest stronger <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12, 13, 14.</note> Food.</p>
               <p n="60">60. My next Observation is, That <hi>the Subject of Faith must be intelligible to all, since the Belief thereof is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under no less a Penalty than Damnation:</hi> He that believet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> not, <note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> shall be damn'd. But shall any be damn'd for the Non-performance of Impossibilities? Obligations to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>elieve do therefore suppose a Possibility to understand. I shew'd before that <hi>Contradiction</hi> and <hi>Nothing</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible Terms; and I may now say as much of <hi>Mystery</hi> in the Theological Sense: for, to speak freely, <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> and <hi>Mystery</hi> are but two empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ways of saying Nothing. <hi>Contradiction</hi> expresses Nothing by a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ideas that destroy one another,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55936:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Mystery</hi> expresses Nothing by Words that have no Ideas at all.</p>
               <p n="61">61. The third Observation shall be, That <hi>if any part of Scripture were unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, it could never be rightly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,</hi> except the Sound of the Words, and not their Sense, be look'd upon as the Revelation of God. Terms can by no means be understood, unless the things they denote be understood also. I may well understand Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Names, but never Names without knowing their Subjects. And, in good earnest, to what sort of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can any Man pretend, that he has made a right Version of what he openly professes not to conceive? It cannot be imagin'd how much the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mystery</hi> contributes to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity of <hi>Scripture</hi> in most Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When an able Linguist meets with a difficult Passage, he presently takes it for a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and concludes it is to no purpose to be at more Pains about what is in it self inexplicable. But an uncapable Translator lays his own blundring Nonsense, and all the <hi>mysterious</hi> Fruits of his Ignorance to God Almighty's Charge. These are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55936:85"/>
the Wretches who plentifully furnish the <hi>Atheistical</hi> and <hi>Profane</hi> with all the Matter of their Objections against <hi>Scripture.</hi> But I hope in Time we may see a Remedy to these Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p n="62">62. The fourth Observation is, That <hi>except Faith signifies an intelligible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, we cannot give others a Reason of our Hope,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> directs us. To say that what we believe is the Word <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> of God, will be to no end, except we prove it to be so by Reason; and I need not add, that if we may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and understand our <hi>Faith,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man will be oblig'd implicitely to continue of that Religion where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Or Priest.</note> 
                  <hi>Talapoin</hi> should tell a <hi>Christian</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that <note n="†" place="bottom">The God of the Siameses.</note> 
                  <hi>Sommonocodom</hi> forbad the Goodness of his Religion to be tri'd by the Light of Reason; how could the <hi>Christian</hi> confute him, if he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should maintain that certain Points of Christianity were above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? The Question would not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hen,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55936:85"/>
whether <hi>Mysteries</hi> might be allow'd in the true Religion, but who had more Right to institute them, <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monocodom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="63">63. My last Observation shall be, That <hi>either the Apostles could not write more intelligibly of the reputed Mysteries, or they would not.</hi> If they would not, then 'tis no longer our Fault if we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understand nor believe them, for <hi>nothing</hi> cannot be the Object of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: And if they could not write more clearly themselves (which our Adversaries will not suppose) they were so much the less to expect Credit from others.</p>
               <p n="64">64. But 'tis affirm'd, that GOD <hi>has a Right to require the Assent of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to what they cannot comprehend:</hi> and questionless, he may command whatever is just and reasonable, for to act Tyrannically do's only become the <hi>Devil.</hi> But I demand to what end should God require us to believe what we cannot understand? <hi>To exercise,</hi> some say, <hi>our Diligence.</hi> But this at first sight looks ridiculous, as if the plain Duties of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Occupations, were not sufficient
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55936:86"/>
to employ all our time. But how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our Diligence? Is it possible for us to understand those <hi>Mysteries</hi> at last, or not? If it be, then all I contend for is gain'd; for I never pretended that the <hi>Gospel</hi> could be understood without due Pains and Application, no more than any other Book. But if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible after all to understand them, this is such a piece of Folly and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence as no sober Man would be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, to puzzle Peoples Heads with what they could never conceive, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort to, and command the Study of them; and all this to keep 'em from Idleness, when they can scarce find leisure enough for what is on all hands granted to be intelligible.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Others say that <hi>GOD has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the Belief of MYSTERIES to make us more humble.</hi> But how? By letting us see the small Extent of our Knowledg. But this extraordinary Method is quite needless, for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acquaints us with that every day; and I have spent a whole Chapter in the second Section of this Book, to prove that we have not an adequate Idea of all the Properties, and no Idea
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55936:86"/>
of the real Essence of any Substance in the World. It had been a much better Answer, that God would thus abridg our Speculations, to gain us the more time for the practice of what we understand. But many <hi>cover a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sins</hi> by their Noise and Heat on the behalf of such foolish, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Speculations.</p>
               <p n="66">66. From all these Observations, and what went before, it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that <hi>Faith</hi> is so far from being an implicite Assent to any thing above Reason, that this Notion directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Ends of Religion, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and the Goodness and Wisdom of God. But at this rate, some will be apt to say, <hi>Faith</hi> is no longer <hi>Faith</hi> but <hi>Knowledg.</hi> I answer, that if <hi>Knowledg</hi> be taken for a present and immediate View of things, I have no where affirm'd any thing like it, but the contrary in many Places. But if by <hi>Knowledg</hi> be meant understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is believ'd, then I stand by it that <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Knowledg:</hi> I have all along maintain'd it, and the very Words are promiscuously us'd for one another in the <hi>Gospel. We know,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55936:87"/>
we believe, <hi>that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the World. I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 42. Rom. 14. 14. 1 Cor. 15. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>there is nothing unclean of it self. You know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="67">67. Others will say that this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Faith</hi> makes <hi>Revelation</hi> useless. But, pray, how so? for the Question not, whether we could discover all the Objects of our <hi>Faith</hi> by Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I have prov'd on the contrary, that no Matter of Fact can be known without <hi>Revelation.</hi> But I assert, that what is once reveal'd we must as well understand as any other Matter in the World, <hi>Revelation</hi> being only of use to inform us whilst the Evidence of its Subject perswades us. Then, reply they, <hi>Reason</hi> is of more Dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ity than <hi>Revelation.</hi> I answer, Just as much as a <hi>Greek Grammar</hi> is superiour to the <hi>New Testament;</hi> for we make use of <hi>Grammar</hi> to understand the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and of <hi>Reason</hi> to comprehend the Sense of that Book. But in a word, I see no need of Comparisons in this Case, for <hi>Reason</hi> is not less from God than <hi>Revelation;</hi> 'tis the Candle,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55936:87"/>
the Guide, the Judg he has lodg'd within every Man that cometh into this World.</p>
               <p n="68">68. Lastly, It may be objected, That the Poor and Illiterate cannot have such a <hi>Faith</hi> as I maintain. Truly if this can be made out, it may pass for a greater <hi>Mystery</hi> than any System of <hi>Divinity</hi> in <hi>Christendom</hi> can afford: for what can seem more strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, than that the common People will sooner believe what is unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, incomprehensible, and above their Reasons, than what is easy, plain, and suted to their Capacities? But the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are more oblig'd to <hi>Christ,</hi> who had a better Opinion of them than these Men; for he preach'd his <hi>Gospel</hi> to them in a special manner; and they, on the other hand, <hi>heard him gladly;</hi> because, no doubt, they understood <note place="margin">Mark 12. 37.</note> his Instructions better than the <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Lectures of their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Scribes.</hi> The uncorrupted Doctrines of <hi>Christianity</hi> are not above their Reach or Comprehension, but the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berish of your <hi>Divinity Schools</hi> they understand not. It is to them <hi>the Language of the Beast,</hi> and is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55936:88"/>
with their Condition in this World, when their very Teachers must serve above an Apprenticeship to master it, before they begin the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Bible.</hi> How slowly must the <hi>Gospel</hi> have mov'd at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if such as were call'd to preach it had been oblig'd to qualify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves after this manner! And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it has such little Effects now upon Mens Lives, after it is so inise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deform'd and almost ruin'd by those unintelligible and extravagant Terms, Notions, and Rites of <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Jewish</hi> Original.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Thus I have distinctly answer'd the several Objections made to me, and I shall add no more on this Subject of <hi>Faith,</hi> when I have consider'd a Passage in the first Epistle to <hi>Peter,</hi> where it is written, that <hi>the Angels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see into certain things; yet those things are not inconceivable <hi>Mysteries,</hi> but the Coming of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-state of Salvation,</hi> which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely foretold to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which they carefully reason'd then; tho, now those things are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd, we are not permitted that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

WHen all other shifts prove ineffectual, the Partizans of <hi>MYSTERY</hi> fly to <hi>MIRACLES</hi> as their last Refuge: but this is too weak a Place to make any long Resistance, and we doubt not of beating 'em quickly thence with Ease and Safety. But seeing, for the most part, the State of this Controversy is never distinctly laid, I shall first endeavour to give a clear Notion of the Nature of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and then leave it to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd whether I have much Reason to apprehend any Danger from this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. <hi>A MIRACLE</hi> then <hi>is some Action exceeding all humane Power, and which the Laws of NATURE cannot perform by their ordinary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

71. Now whatever is contrary to <hi>Reason</hi> can be no <hi>Miracle,</hi> for it has been sufficiently prov'd already, that <hi>Contradiction</hi> is only another word for <hi>Impossible</hi> or <hi>Nothing.</hi> The <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> Action therefore must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it self intelligible and possible, tho the manner of doing it be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. So for a Man to walk safe in the midst of Fire is conceivable, and possible too, should any thing capable of repelling the Heat and Flames sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him: but when such a Security is not provided by Art or Chance, but is the immediate Effect of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power, then it makes a <hi>Miracle.</hi> An able <hi>Physician</hi> do's sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Sight to the Blind; and a Hand or Foot must dry up, when the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood and Humours is too much excluded from it: but if without the ordinary Time and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications those Members be cur'd in an Instant, at the Command or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of any Person, such an Action is truly <hi>miraculous,</hi> as well as the sudden Restoration of a sick Body to Health, which Art or Nature must spend a great deal of Time and Pains upon.</p>
               <p n="72">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:55936:90"/>
72. No <hi>Miracle</hi> then is contrary to Reason, for the Action must be intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and the Performance of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most easy to the Author of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> who may command all its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at his Pleasure. Therefore all those <hi>Miracles</hi> are fictitious, wherein there occur any Contradictions, as that <hi>Christ</hi> was born without opening any Passage out of the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Body; that a Head spoke some Days after it was sever'd from the Body, and the Tongue cut out; with Multitudes of this kind that may be met with among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Bramins,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> and in all Places where the Credulity of the People makes 'em a Merchandize to their Priests.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Let us next consider, that God is not so prodigal of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as to work any at random. The Order of Nature is not alter'd, stopp'd, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, unless for some weighty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign becoming the Divine Wisdom and Majesty. And, indeed, we learn from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> that no <hi>Miracle</hi> is ever wrought without some special and important End, which is either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by those for whom the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

is made, or intended and declar'd by him that works it. If the <hi>Apostles</hi> had barely cur'd the blind, the deaf, the lame, the diseas'd, this would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly procure 'em an extraordinary Esteem; and in some Places too Divine VVorship, as it happen'd to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After what has been already observ'd, I need not add, that all <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> secretly perform'd, or among that Party only to whose Profit and Advantage the Belief of them turns, must be rejected as counterfeit and false; for as such cannot bear the Test of moral Certitude, so they contradict the very Design of Miracles, which are always wrought in favour of the Unbelieving. But the <hi>Papists</hi> alone must be the VVitnesses of their own <hi>Miracles,</hi> and never the <hi>Hereticks</hi> they would convert by them: nor is their Practice less ridiculous in confirming one Miracle by another, as that of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> by several more.</p>
               <p n="76">76. From all this laid together, it follows, that nothing contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whether you consider the Action or Design, is <hi>miraculous.</hi> But there's a good old Distinction that serves all turns: Tho <hi>Miracles</hi> are not contrary to Reason, says one, yet they are surely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. In what Sense pray? Which is above Reason, the Thing, or the Manner of it? If it be answer'd, the

last, I suppose the Objector thinks I mean by <hi>Miracle</hi> some Philosophical Experiment, or some <hi>Phenomenon</hi> that surprizes only by its Rarity. Could I tell how a <hi>Miracle</hi> was wrought. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I might do as much my self; but what may be said to have been this or that way perform'd, is no <hi>Miracle</hi> at all. It suffices therefore, that the Truth of the Action be demonstrated, and the Possibility of it, to any <hi>Being</hi> able to govern Nature by instanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="77">77. But finally, it will be said, that in <hi>the State of the Question,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my Book, I maintain'd the Manner as well as the Thing was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable.

                  <hi>Now when catechising is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hears'd, if a Catechumen should ask you what the Teachers said, tell it by no means to any that is not initiated: for we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust you with a Mystery, and the hope of the Life to come. Keep this Mystery then to him that rewardeth: and if any should say unto you, What harm is it, if I also learn? Answer him, that so sick Persons desire Wine: But if it be given to any unseasonably, it makes him fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and so two Evils happen; both the sick Man is destroy'd, and the Physician is disparag'd. Thus if a Catechumen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55936:97"/>
hears those things from any of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he grows likewise frantick; for not understanding what he heard, he argues against the thing, and laughs at what is said: so the Believer that told it him is condemn'd as a Betrayer of Secrets. Now you being one of us, see that you blab out nothing: not that what we say are not worthy to be spoken, but that others are not worthy to hear them. When you were a Catechumen your self, we never told you what was propos'd. But when you have learnt by experience the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of those things which are taught, you will then be convinc'd that the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens are unworthy to hear them.</hi>

               <p>Notwithstanding all Pretences that may be made to the contrary, it is evident that no particular <hi>Instances</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> of any sort can serve for a proper Answer to this DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COURSE; for, as long as the Reasons of it hold good, whatever <hi>Instance</hi> can be alledg'd must either be found not <hi>mysterious,</hi> or, if it prove a

And tho by convincing People that <hi>all the Parts of their RELIGION must not only be in themselves, but to them also must appear, sound and intelligible,</hi> I might justly leave every one to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to himself the Reasonableness or Unreasonableness of his Religion (which is no difficult Business, when once Men are perswaded that they have a right to do it;) yet the Duties I ow GOD and the World oblige me to proceed further according as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Health or Leisure, without limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self as to any time, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing in no Man's Power to command at his Pleasure.</p>

My next Task therefore is (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to prove the Doctrines of the <hi>New Testament</hi> perspicuous, possible, and most worthy of God, as well as all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the highest Benefits of Man. Some will not thank me, it's probable, for so useful an Undertaking; and others will make me a <hi>Heretick</hi> in grain for what I have perform'd already. But as it is Duty, and no Body's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pláuse, which is the Rule of my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so, God knows, I no more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue this cheap and ridiculous Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of a <hi>Heretick</hi> than <hi>Paul</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore <note place="margin">Act. 24. 14.</note> me: for I acknowledg no <hi>OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODOXY</hi> but the <hi>TRVTH;</hi> and, I'm sure, where-ever the <hi>TRVTH</hi> is, there must be also the <hi>CHVRCH,</hi> of God I mean, and not any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faction or Policy. Besides, the Imputation of <hi>Heterodoxy</hi> being now as liberal upon the slightest Occasions, out of Ignorance, Passion, or Malice, as in the Days of <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> it is many times instead of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the greatest Honour imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

Some good Men may be apt to say, that, supposing my Opinion never so true, it may notwithstanding occasion much harm; because when People find themselves impos'd upon in any part of <hi>Religion,</hi> they are ready to call the whole in question. This Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is plainly taken, not given; and my Design is nothing the less good, if ill-dispos'd Persons abuse it, as they frequently do <hi>Learning, Reason, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the best things in the World. But it is visible to every one that they are the <hi>Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly charg'd upon <hi>Religion,</hi> which occasion so many to become <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Atheists.</hi> And it should be consider'd likewise that when any, not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, are dazl'd by the sudden Splendor of the <hi>Truth,</hi> their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not comparable to theirs who see clearly by its Light. Because se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral turn'd <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> when <hi>PRIEST-CRAFT</hi> was laid so open at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> were <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Zwinglius</hi> to be blam'd for it? or which should weigh most with them, these few prejudic'd <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>

or those thousands they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the Superstitions of <hi>Rome?</hi> I'm therefore for giving no Quarter to <hi>ERROR</hi> under any pretence; and will be sure, where-ever I have Ability or Opportunity, to expose it in its true Colours, without rendring my Labour ineffectual, by weakly mincing or soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any thing.</p>
