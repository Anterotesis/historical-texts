            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:89:6"/>
of tho thre. By this I suppose he that hath grace to co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me to the fyrst may by goddes helpe come to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde / &amp; so with a feruent desyre &amp; good perseueraun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce he may come to the thyrde. Shortely I wyll shewe here these degrees of loue / for by cause all men and women that sholde rede this haue not knowynge of theym / ne neuer herde speke of suche degrees of loue before tyme. ¶Degrees of hyghe loue. .i. ¶The fyrste loue is so feruent that no thynge whiche is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to goddes wyll may ouercome that loue / welth ne wo helthe ne sykenes. Also he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath this loue wyl not make god ones angry for all the worlde withoute ende / but rather suffre all the payne that myght come to ony creature than ones wylfully dysplease his god in thought or dede. .ii. ¶The seconde loue is mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re feruent for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is so stronge / that what man loueth in that degre all his thought herte &amp; myght is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyerly so besely &amp; so perfyghtly stablysshed in Ihesu cryste that his thought cometh neuer from hym but whan he slepeth. .iii. ¶The thyrde degre of loue is hyghest and moost wonderfull / for what man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to that loue / all comforte and all solace is closed oute of his herte / but onely the Ioye of Ihesu cryste / Other Ioye may his herte not receyue for swetnesse that he hath of the Ioye euermore lastynge. This loue is so brennynge &amp; so gladynge that who so hath that loue may as well fele the fyer of bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nynge loue in his soule / as an other man may fele his fynger brenne in erthely fyre. This loue may well be called a brennyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge loue. And yf men had suche swetnesse in the loue of god of so late tyme I suppose wel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same we may haue now by the gyfte of god yf we were as feruent
<pb facs="tcp:89:6"/>
in loue as they were. But these degrees of loue ben set vpon so hyghe loue to god / that what man sholde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the fyrst of these thre / behoued that he were a sad contemplatyf man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And by cause mankyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de is now &amp; euermore the lenger the febler or peraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more vnstable / therfore vnethes sholde we fynde now a sad contemplatyfe man or woman. Men of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lygyon haue taken dyuerse habytes of contemplatyf lyfe. Men &amp; wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also that ben enclosed as it semeth lyuen a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyfe lyfe / &amp; so w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> goddes grace they do so for the more partye. But for to speke of hyghe contemplatyfe lyfe as holy men lyued before this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it semeth there ben ryght fewe. Therfore I trowe that I may sykerly say that fewe there ben now that wyl or may trauayle now to haue suche hyghe degrees of loue as I haue reherced before. Neuertheles what so euer thou be that redest or herest this / be neuer to slower to trauayll. For yf thy desyre be sette feruent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; louyngly holdynge the vnworthy to haue so hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe a ghoostly gyfte before an other man / &amp; puttest thy desyre to goddes dysposycyon trustyngly he wyll dyspose that is best for the / whether thou haste thy desyre or haue it not. But it is fyrst nedefull to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that thou haue other thre degrees of loue that the same holy men wrote in theyr treatyse / whiche be not of so hyghe a degree as tho that be reherced before. .i. ¶The fyrst degree of these is / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man or a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holdeth the commaundementes of god &amp; kepeth hym selfe out of dedely synne / &amp; is stable in the fayth of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly chyrche. Also whan a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wolde not for none erthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thynge dysplease god / but truly standeth in his de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree whether he be religyous or seculer. In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:89:7"/>
euery man behoueth to loue his god that wyll be saued / therfore I counseyll the to haue &amp; kepe this lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue or thou clymbe to ony hyer degree. .ii. ¶The se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conde degree is whan a man forsaketh all the worlde for the loue of god / that is for to saye his fader his mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der &amp; all his kynred &amp; foloweth cryst impouerte. Also standeth nyght &amp; daye / how clene he may be in herte howe chaste in body / how meke &amp; buxom / howe clene in all vertues / &amp; hate all vyces / so o that all his lyfe be ghoostly &amp; none thynge flesshely. iii. ¶The thyrde degree is hyghest / for that is a ful contemplatyfe lyfe as whan a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loueth for to be alone from all maner noyse. And whan that he is saddely sette in this lyfe and in this loue with his ghoostly eyen than may he se in to the blysse of heuen. And than his eyen be soo enlumyned and so clere lyghted with grace of ghoostly loue and also thrugh kyndeled with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyous fyre of crystes loue that he shall haue a maner of brennynge loue in his herte euermore lastynge and his thought euermore vpwarde to god. ¶Thus as I haue reherced god hath vysyted his seruauntes gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge theym a specyall sauour lo toue hym by theyr holy lyuynge. Many other men and women there be whiche please god full well standynge truely in theyr degree as men &amp; women of the worlde / both lordes &amp; ladyes &amp; other husbonde men women &amp; wyues. For al be it they may not come to suche hye conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platyfe lyfe it suffyseth them to haue the fyrst degree of these thre whiche I reherced last / for that euery man is bounde to kepe. ¶Yf thou desyre to haue an hygher degre of loue in to the worshyp of god / trauayle as other men dyde &amp; aske helpe and grace with good perseuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

               <p>THe fourth degree of loue is called a parfyte lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue. An other loue there is all be it I make noo mencyon but of foure / whiche is called moost parfyte loue. Of that loue speketh saynt Austyn &amp; sayth.

Of the same moost parfyte loue speketh the same clerke thus. In the ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyllynge of the countre of charyte / that is to saye / in fulfyllynge of heuen where that all is loue and chary<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te.

herte / with all thy mynde / and with all thy soule. For whyle ony flesshely desyre is in man god may not be loued with all the herte and fnll mynde. And by this thou mayst knowe that there is a passynge loue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che may not be fulfylled in this worlde / and that may well be called moost parfyte loue. But here perauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture some man wyll aske / why it is commaundeth / but it myght be performed in this worlde. To that the same clerke answereth and sayth / that it is skyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that suche a perfeccyon sholde be commaunded / and this he sheweth by ensample in this wyse. Ryght as no man may renne euen and sykerly but he knowe whether he shall renne. In the same maner noo man sholde knowe his moost parfyte loue / but it hadde be shewed in the commaundementes of god. Yf noo man hadde knowen it no man wolde haue laboured hym to come therto. ¶Now sythen it is so we knowe it well that it is moost parfyte loue we must nedeful loue it and sette vs in a redy waye whyle we be here that wyll brynge vs euen to that moost parfyte loue. A more syker waye is there none in this worlde than the waye of parfyte loue. Wherfore I counsell the to haue this fourth degree of loue whiche is called a par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte loue that we may come the more sykerly to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte loue. ¶Of parfyte loue speketh Saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styn and sayth.

hym to do good dede. But for as moche as he wolde good I may not saye but he hath a good wyll. So eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry man that wyll well be it strongly or feyntly / lytell or grete / and in as moche as he wolde good he hath a good wyll. Neuertheles though this be a good wyll it is worthy lytell or no mede / for it is no feruent ne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy wyll. for he desyreth to be good without ony trauay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le / &amp; so he suffreth that good wyl passe &amp; chargeth not gretly to be good ne to do good dede. But what tyme he besyeth hym to performe that good wyll in dede / in that he desyreth to be good &amp; besyeth hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do good though he haue not fully his purpose ne may not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forme his wyll in dede / yet there is a feruent wyll &amp; a besy wyll &amp; I hope a medeful wyll. So that what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desyreth to be good &amp; to do good dede &amp; therto besyeth hym to performe that wyll in dede of hym it may wel be sayd that he hath a feruent wyll / yet is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyll but lytell acounted &amp; feble hauynge rewarde to a grete &amp; stronge wyll.

To this acor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth saynt Austyn &amp; sayth hus. He that wyl do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes of god &amp; sayth he may not but he hath a good wyll / but that wyll is but lytell &amp; feble / for he may do &amp; kepe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes whan he hath a grete &amp; astronge wyll.

Yf thou wylt thou mayst kepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes
<pb facs="tcp:89:23"/>
of god / yf thou kepe them thou shalt be good &amp; do good / so yf thou wylt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mayst do good &amp; be good. But yet somtyme &amp; ofte it talleth that by the grace of the holy ghoost we wyl do somwhat w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al our herte to the worshyp of god that is not in our myght ne power to performe in dede / whan our wyll is sette in this maner the goodnes of god is so moche that he receyueth that wyll as for dede. Of this say<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Austyn bereth wytnes &amp; sayth. What thou wylt &amp; mayst not do god acou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth for dede. Thus mayst thou knowe with in thy selfe whan thou hast a lytell or a feble wyl / a gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te or a stronge wyll / &amp; how acceptable a good wyll is to almyghty god / where thou doost thy besynes to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forme it in dede. But se now more openly &amp; in specyal poyntes how thou shalt knowe wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast a good wyl. Saynt Gregory sayth. We haue a good wyl wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we drede the harme of our neyghboure as our owne dysease / &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be Ioyfull of the prosperyte of our neyghboure as of our owne proufyte. Also whan we trowe other mennes harmes as by waye of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / &amp; whan we acounten other mennes wynnynges our wynnynges as by waye of charyte. Also wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we loue our frende not for the worlde but for god / &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we loue &amp; suffre our enemye for the loue of god.

These poyntes stande moche by the wyll withoute dede / but who so wylleth these fully in his herte to be do hath a good wyll. And as I sayd before his good wyll shall be acounted before god as for dede. Thus than haue I shewed whiche is good &amp; feruent wyll though it be
<pb facs="tcp:89:24"/>
not performed in dede whiche is a grete and a stronge wyll / and how good wyll in some poyntes is acou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for dede before god all be it that it be not performed / so that the wyller do his besynes to his power. ¶Ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke hede now ferthermore and beware for though thou haue all these maners of good wyll to thy felynge / it may be so that yet thy wyll is not rygtfull / se how. Be thou neuer so full of wertues but thou conforme thy wyll to goddes wyll in all maner thynges bodely and ghoostly thy wyll is not ryghtfull. ¶To this purpose saynt Austyn sayth thus. The ryghtwysnes of god is that thou be somtyme hole of body &amp; somtyme syke / and perauenture whan thou art hole and in prospery<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te / than the wyll of god pleaseth the moche and thou sayst that he is a good god and a curteys / yf thou say so or thynke so onely / for thou hast helth or welth of body thou hast no ryghtful wyl for as moche as thou conformest not thy wyll to goddes wyll / but onely in helth and welth. For yf he sente the sykenesse or other dysease perauenture thou woldest be sory and grutch ayenst the wyll and the sendynge of god / &amp; soo in thy wyll thou woldest make the wyll of god / the whiche may not be but euermore ryght and euen bowe dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to thy wyll / whiche boweth and is full crocked and in this thou hast neuer ryghtfull herte ne ryghtfull wyll. But what tyme thou dressest thy wyll that is so croked and makest it stande ryght with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyll of god whiche may not be croked / but euer standeth euen / that is to saye noo thynge wylleth helth ne sykenesse / welth ne wo / but euer holdest the pleased with the wyl of god than thou hast a ryghtfull wyll. Also it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defull to a good wyll that it encreace in vertues and
<pb facs="tcp:89:24"/>
come to the loue of god that it be stable and resonable What tyme thou art trauayled sore with temptaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns and grutchest not ayenst goddes wyl but with a glad herte thou thankest god &amp; suffrest hym lowely &amp; thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kest well it is chastysynge to the for thy synnes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is thy wyll stable. And whan thou desyrest not hygh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in blysse for thy good lyuynge or ghoostly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle whiche thou hast here in erthe but onely at god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des wyll what he wyll dyspose for the &amp; no thynge at thy wyll than thou hast a resonable wyll. Thus I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue shewed the dyuerse kyndes of good wyl whiche be full spedefull &amp; nedefull the for to knowe yf thou be in good wyll to loue god / &amp; yf thou haue a stable &amp; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable wyll y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shalt soone come to parfyte loue. Now ꝑauenture thou y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauaylest in ghoostly werkes wylt thynke or say thus / somtyme it happed that thou wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest do some ghoostly trauayle &amp; thou may not perfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me it in dede / &amp; all be it so thou do it in dede it is full oft with so grete heuynesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou grutche somwhat for defaute of ghoostly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort To this I may answere as I sayd before / yf y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> grutche y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> hast no stable wyll &amp; yf thy wyll be stable y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shalt not drede in this case &amp; se why. Thou shalt vnderstande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the flesshe is euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:89:25"/>
Nay but moche the more his mede was encreaced for two causes. Fyrst for the trauaylous werkynge of his body that he suffred whan the flesshe stryued soo sore ayenst the goodnes of the spyryte. The seconde cause is for the heuynes &amp; trauayle whiche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spyryte suffred whan he had no ghoostly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte. In the same maner what euer grutchynge thou hast of thy flesshe ayenst good dedes or what heuynesse thou suffrest for defau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of ghoostly conforte / be not therfore abasshed so thy wyll be stable but suffre &amp; abyde lowely the grace of god for thy more mede. Be than stable in wyll &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyll ne thy flesshe shall neuer haue maystrye of the for all the deuyls in hell may not make the to synne but y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> put therto thy wyll.
