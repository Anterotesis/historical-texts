            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the name of God Almightie King of Kings: Be it manifeſt to all men, that the Realme of France hauing bin troubled and afflicted theſe foure and twentie yeres, with a peſtilent ſedition mooued and ſtirred to ſubuert the auncient Religion of our forefathers, which is the ſtrongeſt bande of the Eſtate, there haue bene remedies applied, the which contrary to the hope of their Maieſties, haue fallen out to be more apt to nouriſh the euill, then to quench the ſame, the which had nothyng of peace but the bare name, and haue not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the quiet and weale of the Realme, but for their behoofe who troubled the ſame, leauing the honeſter ſort offended in their conſciences, and intereſſed in their goods.</p>
                  <p>And in ſtead of remedie, the which in tyme was hoped and looked for againſt theſe miſchiefs, ſuch hath bene the will of God, that our kings of latter time haue deceaſed in their yong yeeres, without leauing any children able to ſucceede to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20467:2"/>
the crowne. And hitherto it hath not pleaſed him (to the great griefe of all good men) to graunt any iſſue to the king now raigning: although his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes haue not omitted (neither hereafter at any time will ceaſe) their moſt earneſt prayers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that fauour of the goodneſſe of God: In ſuch ſort, as remaining the laſt of ſo many children that God had giuen to the late King Henry, it is greatly to be feared (which God forbid) that this royall race through our euill happe, ſhall be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed without any hope of iſſue: And that in the eſtabliſhing of a ſucceſſour in the royall eſtate, there will fall out great troubles throughout all Chriſtendome, and it may be the whole ſubuerſion of the Catholique and Apoſtolike religion in this moſt Chriſtian Realme, where an heretike ſhall neuer be ſuffered to beare rule, in ſo much as the ſubiects are not bound to acknowledge and ſuffer a Prince that is ſwarued and fallen from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith: for that the firſt othe which our kings doe make when they are crowned, is to maintaine the Catholike, Apoſtolike, &amp; Romaine Religion, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which othe they receiue that which their ſubiects doe make of fidelitie and allegiance, and not otherwiſe. Notwithſtanding, ſithence the death of my Lord the Kings brother, the purpoſes of thoſe which by open profeſſion haue ſhewed themſelues alwayes perſecuters of the Catholike Church, haue bene ſo bolſtered and fauoured, that it is very needefull to thinke of ſome ſpeedie and ſound remedy, thereby to auoide the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt apparant, whereof the calamities are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready knowne to all men, the remedy to fewe, and the way how to apply the ſame almoſt to no man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:20467:2"/>
And ſo much the rather, that a man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily iudge by the great preparations and practiſes which they make to leuie ſouldiers as well within as without the realme, &amp; the detainyng of townes and ſtrong holdes, which long agoe they ſhould haue reſtored and yeelded vp into the Kinges handes, that we are very neere the effect of their euill intentions, beyng very certaine that they haue of late ſent to practiſe the Princes Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of Germanie, that they might haue forces in a readineſſe to ſuppreſſe at their pleaſure all good men, as it is very apparant that they entend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to aſſure themſelues, and ſeaſe of all neceſſary meanes to ouerthrow the Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wherein euery man hath intereſt, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the noble men and great perſonages which haue the honour to hold the firſt and principall charges in this common wealth, whom they doe goe about to vndermine and ouerthrowe, during the kings life and vnder his authoritie, to the ende that leauing no man which hereafter may be able to oppoſe himſelfe to their will, it may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for them to bring to paſſe that change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Catholike religion which they doe pretend, thereby to enrich themſelues with the patrimonie of the Church, following the example which was begun to them in England, eſpecially in that euery man doeth know ſufficiently, and ſeeth (as it were) with open eyes the behauiour &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome, which being crept into the fauour of the King our Soueraigne Lord (whoſe Maieſtie hath bene and alwayes ſhall be ſacred &amp; redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs) they haue in a maner ſeaſed vpon his authoritie, to maintaine the greatneſſe which they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20467:3"/>
haue vſurped, fauouring and aduauncing by all meanes the purpoſes of the aforeſayd. And ſuch hath bene their audacitie, to baniſh from about the King, not onely the Princes and the Nobilitie, but alſo thoſe that are moſt neereſt and deereſt vnto him, giuing acceſſe to none but to ſuch as depend vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Wherein they are alreadie ſo farre foorth, that there is no man which hath any part or doing in the adminiſtration of the gouernement of the Eſtate, or that is ſuffered to exerciſe entirely his charge: Some are bereft of the title of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, other of the authoritie and execution of their offices, though they are ſuffered to enioy the vaine and fruiteles name.</p>
                  <p>In like maner, the like hath bene done in the behalfe of diuers Gouernours of Prouinces, and Captaines of ſtrong places, and to their Officers, who haue bene conſtrained to forgoe and yeelde vp their charges in reſpect of ſome recompence of money, which they haue receiued againſt their owne will and deſire, becauſe they durſt not ſay nay vnto them which haue power to compell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: A newe example, and neuer heretofore practiſed within this Realme, for ſome peece of money to take away the offices and charges from thoſe to whom the ſame were giuen for recompence of their vertue and fidelitie. And by this meanes they are become maſters, and haue poſſeſſed them ſelues of the forces of the Realme, as well by ſea as by land, and doe goe about dayly to doe the like to others that are in office, ſo that there is no man can be aſſured, and that ſtandeth not in feare, and looketh that his office ſhall be taken from him:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20467:3"/>
Howbeit the ſame hauing bene giuen him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and ſeruice, hee ought not to bee depriued thereof by the auncient lawes of the Realme, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be for ſome iuſt and reaſonable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or that he hath committed ſome fault in the execution of his charge. In like maner they haue emptied the Kings Cofers of his treaſure, where they cauſe the readie money of the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts to be brought, and to be conuerted to their particular vſe, and hold at their deuotion all the chiefe reuenues, the which are the very wayes to diſpoſe of this Crowne, and to place the ſame on whoſe head they ſhall thinke good.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, through their couetouſneſſe it is come to paſſe, that abuſing the gentleneſſe of the Subiects, they haue enhanced by litle and litle to moſt grieuous exactions, not only matching thoſe which the calamitie of warre had brought in (whereof in tyme of peace nothing was euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and abated) but other infinite oppreſſions growen from day to day, at the appetite of their vnbrideled wils.</p>
                  <p>There was ſome hope, when through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complaints and exclamations of the whole Realme, the conuocation of the generall Eſtates was publiſhed at Blois, which is the auncient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to heale theſe domeſticall woundes, and as it were a conference betweene the Princes and their ſubiectes, to enter into a reckoning together of the due obedience of the one part, and due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the other, which is the groundworke and foundation of the ſtate of Fraunce: But of this troubleſome and great aſſembly, there ſprung nothing but the authorizing of the miſchieuous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20467:4"/>
counſell of ſome, who fainyng themſelues to bee good Politikes, ſhewed themſelues in effect to bee euill affected to the ſeruice of God and of the weale publike, who were not contented to remoue the King (of his owne nature moſt enclined to godlineſſe) from that holy and moſt holeſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, which at the moſt humble requeſt of all the States he had made, to reunite all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to one Catholike, Apoſtolike, and Romane religion, to the ende that they might liue together in the auncient faith wherein the Realme was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and tooke encreaſe to become the moſt flouriſhing of all Chriſtendome, which then might haue bene executed without any daunger, and in a maner without reſiſtance. Notwithſtanding, they to the contrary did perſwade him, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his ſeruice to abate and diminiſh the authoritie of the Princes and Catholike Lordes, which with great zeale had oftentimes put their liues in hazard vnder his enſigne for the defence of the ſayd Catholike religion, as though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which they had gotten by their vertue &amp; fidelitie, in ſtead of honour ſhould bring them in ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the abuſe which by litle and litle had taken hold and encreaſe, afterwardes is come vpon vs like a floud and downefall, with ſo violent a fall, that the poore Realme is euen at the point to be ouerwhelmed without any hope of helpe: For, the Eccleſiaſtical order, notwithſtanding the declarations and petitions which they haue exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, is at this day oppreſſed with tenthes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exactions, to the deſpiſing and contempt of holy orders, and of the Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20467:4"/>
now all things are polde and pilde: The Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is greatly aggrieued, driuen to pay exactions in deſpite of their priuiledge, if that they will bee contented to liue, that is to ſay, if they will either eate, drinke, or apparell themſelues. The townes, Officers of the Crowne, and common people, ſhorne ſo neere by the daily paying of new impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which they doe terme inuention of <hi>Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)</hi> that there remayneth nothing els, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſome good way how to remedy this miſchief.</p>

                  <p>The pretenſes which the autors of the ſaid troubles do alleadge, are chiefly founded vpon The reſtoring of the Catholike, Apoſtolike &amp; Romiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this land: The diſtributing of the offices and dignities therof, to thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom iuſtly they may appertaine: &amp; The wealth, honor, and reliefe of the Clergy, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Commons.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer although after the example of the late king his brother with diuers other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, whoſe Empires &amp; dominions haue ben afflicted with ſondry opinions of the ſaid religion, his Maieſty by the prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the Quéene his Mother, my Lord the Cardinall of Bourbon, with other the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Officers of the Crowne, and Lords of his Counſaile who then were about him, hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified ſuch troubles as were amonge his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes by reaſon of the ſaide religion, vntill it might pleaſe God to revnite them into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the church: It doth not neuertheleſſe therefore follow that his zeale and deuotion ſo farre as concerneth the glory of God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſtoration of the Catholike, Apoſtolike &amp; Romiſh Church ſhould bee any whit changed or diminiſhed rather now then he ſhewed it to be during the ſaid troubles: Yea ſo farre is he

induced through feruent zeale to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion) they could deſire him vtterly to prohibite the exerciſe of the ſaid Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reformed, whereof did enſue the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution there taken and ſworne vnto, which ſince his Maieſty did endeuour to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: nether ſhould they now haue any pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence to complaine, no not they who neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles do publiſh abroad that euery man was ſone depriued of that gliſtering beame of good hope which before by reaſon of the reſolution taken in the ſaid eſtates did ſhine vpon them: Beſides that it is vnſéemely and not lawfull for the ſubiect to iudge of his kinges actions, were it but in reſpecte that many times he is ignorant of the motiue cauſes of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, which for the moſt parte are more pregnant then thoſe that are apparant &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all men: neither is it for any to doe but onely God, the ſearcher and cleanſer of the harts and dealings of Princes, who knoweth the cauſes that did moſt enforce his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty to the concluſion of the ſaid peace: As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine that if he had any longer deferred the doing thereof, this realme had bene reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with forreine power and diuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities and new diuiſions which would haue bene very preiuditiall to the eſtate.</p>
                  <p>His Maieſty did therefore graunt the ſayde peace to the end to withſtand all the aforeſaide

                  <p>Herevnto hath his Maieſty continually e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince entended as is euident by the edictes and rules therevpon made, which he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored to put in effect and cauſe to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and although his entent hath not béene executed according to this deſire, the ſame hath redounded to his greater grief, and hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened peraduenture aſmuch by the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſome of his officers and ſleightes of his euill willers as alſo by ſuch footing and aduantage as impiety, corruption and diſobedience haue ſet in this realme during the ſaid warres.</p>
                  <p>Through this peace, diuers townes reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb facs="tcp:20467:11"/>
with Catholike Citizens &amp; inhabitants are deliuered from the ſouldiers that had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vpon them. The exerciſe of the Catholike, Apoſtolicall and Romane religion is renewed in the ſame, as likewiſe through his Maieſties diligence and care it is in moſt townes of this realme, yea euen in thoſe wherein the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the ſaide religion pretended reformed, haue euer ſince the troubles beene and yet are the ſtronger, and from whence both before and euer ſince his comming to the Crowne, the ſaid exerciſe hath beene baniſhed.</p>
                  <p>The face of iuſtice alſo hath thereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red though not altogether ſo fully and wholy as were to be wiſhed, yet at the leaſt in ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate as for the moſt part it hath ſhewed force ſufficient to comfort the good and make the bad afraide. The Prelates &amp; clergy are reentred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Churches &amp; the enioying of their goods whereof they had béene ſpoiled. The Nobilitie and Gentlemen might liue ſafe in their houſes and not be ſubiect to ſuch expenſes as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of war they were forced to be at for preſeruing them ſelues from being ſurpriſed. The Citizen depriued of his owne and wandring ouer the countrey with his familie is by meanes of the ſaid peace reentred into his poſſeſſions. The Marchant likewiſe hath againe begunne his trade of trafficke which by the ſaide troubles was wholy interrupted. The poore huſbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20467:12"/>
groning vnder the weight of the ſupportable burden a riſing of the vnbridled licence of the ſouldier hath meanes to breath &amp; haue recourſe to his ordinarie labor, for the ſuſtentation of his poore life. To be briefe there is no eſtate or perſon but doth effectually participate in the benefits of the ſaide pacification.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer as his Maieſtie hath alwaies béene moſt ielous of the honor of God, &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the common wealth of his ſaid ſubiects, as much as in a Prince moſt Chriſtian &amp; truly good, can, by acknowledging all euils and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of any eſtate to ariſe principally throgh want and default of true godlineſſe and iuſtice hath ſince the ſaid peace continually labored to raiſe vp two pillers, which the violence of the ſaide troubles had almoſt ſubuerted and laide along. For the compaſſing whereof, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by naming méet &amp; capable perſons ſuch as the holy decrees do appoint to eccleſiaſticall promotions, hauing charge of ſoules. He hath alſo by his owne example inuited his ſubiects to reformation of their manners, and to haue recourſe to the grace &amp; mercy of God through prayer and auſteritie of life, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Catholikes in the duetie to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, and moued ſome of thoſe that were ſeperated from Gods Church to reconſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>He hath likewiſe entended greatly to giue
<pb facs="tcp:20467:12"/>
eare to the declaration and complaintes of the Clergie, giuing them libertie to aſſemble them ſelues to that effect, and hauing largely &amp; fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably prouided for them, hath rather diſcharged then ouercharged them with extraordinarie tenthes, without reſpect to the neceſſitie of his owne affaires, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer is publiſhed to the contrarie: and is ſorie that hee can not likewiſe relieue them of the payment of their ordinarie, becauſe he found them at his comming to the crowne morgaged for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rents of the towne of Paris.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Prelates and Clergie haue alſo through his ſaid Maieſties permiſſion had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to call &amp; hold their prouincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, whereby they haue conſulted &amp; prouided for the reformation of abuſes brought into the Church during the ſaide troubles, &amp; made good and holy rules to the welth of the ſame, which his ſaide Maieſtie hath confirmed and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Theſe are the fruites and common and generall commodities which Gods Church, &amp; the Catholike, Apoſtoliike &amp; Romiſh religion haue reaped of the ſaid pacification, beſides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other priuate &amp; perticuler benefits which would be too long to rehearſe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning iuſtice euery man knoweth what paines his ſaid Maieſtie hath taken to withdraw the ſame out of darkneſſe wherein the troubles had plunged, to the end to reſtore
<pb facs="tcp:20467:13"/>
the light thereof to his former force and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent brightneſſe, hauing by death ſuppreſſed all ſuperfluous offices, and withall prohibited and ceaſed the ſale of the ſaid offices which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> want of money had forced his predeceſſors to bring in, nothing regarding his owne neede, which is nothing inferiour to his predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this his Maieſtie hath excluded all remiſſions and euocations which aforetune were diſpatched of his proper motion, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that he perceaueth how great hope to attaine the ſame did autorize euil deedes, and the ſmall difficultie that was made in graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others did bring confuſion into Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer ſince the ſaid pacification he hath had opportunitie to ſend into ſundry prouinces of his realme, ſundry chambers compoſed of officers of the parliament of Paris to miniſter iuſtice vnto his ſaid ſubiectes euen in the ſaide place, whereof is growne ſuch fruit as all men haue taſted, which yet would increaſe to the contentation of the good, if his good meaning had bene better aſſiſted by thoſe who naturally and by eſpeciall bond of their vocations were bound thereto. But as the iniquitie of the time hath emboldened ſome to burden his Maieſtie with other mens faultes, and that corruption &amp; malice are ſo repleniſhed with boldnes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie that many haue euen taken pleaſure in defacing his moſt holy &amp; beſt actions, wherby
<pb facs="tcp:20467:13"/>
to cauſe his ſubiectes to miſlike of them and ſo to get to them ſelues their good wils with the expenſe of his reputation: yea ſo farre as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to dare enterprete the moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble zeale that he hath had to cauſe the decrees and ſentences of the ſaid chambers againſt euil doers to be executed, vnto ouer great rigor and ſeueritie.</p>
                  <p>His ſaid Maieſtie had therfore begun by the meanes aforeſaid to prouide for the erecting of theſe two true pillers, the onely foundations &amp; preſeruation of euery Monarchy and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued ſome aſſurance wholy to ſet them vp &amp; reſtore them to their perfection through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the peace if it had pleaſed God to haue giuen his grace to make his realme &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes worthy therof. This alſo it ſéemeth thoſe men which ſéeke to moue the ſubiects to take armes and yet vnder coulor of prouiding for both the one and the other, did as ſoone feare as foreſée.</p>
                  <p>They do alſo giue out that they take armes to the end to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the troubles which they ſay they feare ſhould happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his Maieſties deceaſe in the eſtabliſhing of a Royall ſucceſſor to the diſaduantage of the ſaid Catholique, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique, and Romiſh religion. Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, or at the leaſt ſo giuing forth that his ſaid Maieſtie, or they that are about him do fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor the pretences of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:20467:14"/>
perſecuters of the ſaid religion.</p>
                  <p>A matter whereof his Maieſtie deſireth and warneth his ſubiects to beléeue that hee neuer thought, as being, thanks be to God, in the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſtrength of his age and likewiſe the Queene his wife, and ſo hopeth that God will graunt them iſſue to the generall contentation of his good and loyal ſubiects: beſides it ſéemeth to him that they ſéeke to force both nature and time and withall doe to much miſtruſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and goodnes of God, the health and life of his Maieſty, and the faithfulnes of the ſaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Quéene his wife in motioning at this time any ſuch queſtion, but much more in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deciſion therof by force of armes. For in liew of warranting and deliuering y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> realme for the miſchiefe which they ſay they feare will one day enſue hereof, the entry into warre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for that cauſe is properly as much as to haſten the griefes of the ſame: as being aſſured ſhortly to repleniſh the realme with forraine power, partialities, and innumerable diſcords, beſides bloud, murther and infinite robberies &amp; oppreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Here may you ſée how the Catholike religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall be reſtored, the Clergie diſcharged of their tenthes, the Gentlemen liue quietly and ſafe in his houſe and enioy his rightes &amp; prerogatiues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citizens inhabitants of townes exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> garriſons, and the poore townes eaſed of ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:20467:14"/>
and impoſitions that it now beareth.</p>
                  <p>His maieſtie therefore warneth and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſubiectes in this caſe to look about them and not to perſwade themſelues that this war can be finiſhed ſo ſoone and eaſily as is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, but rather to weigh and déepely to conſider the euent and ineuitable conſequence thereof: and not to ſuffer their reputations to be ſtained, &amp; their weapons to ſeeme as an inſtrument to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction of their countrie and to the increaſe of the power of the enimies fherof, who onely wil triumph and reape benefite by the miſeries &amp; calamities of the ſame. For while we, blinded in our own benefit ſhall warre one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and be ſuccoured in outward appearance, but in effect fed on by their aſſiſtaunce, they ſhall raigne proſperouſly and eſtabliſh their power.</p>
                  <p>They complaine alſo of the diuiſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and houſes of this ſaid realme, ſaying that ſuch are put from them as haue better deſerued of the eſtate and his Maieſties ſeruice. A weak foundation and of no great honor to build the ruine and ſaluation of ſo floriſhing a realme whoſe kings were neuer bound to vſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of one more then of an other. For there is no law that bindeth him therto except as the benefite of his ſeruice requireth. Neuertheleſſe his ſaid Maieſtie hath at all times greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored and cheriſhed the princes of his bloud, as
<pb facs="tcp:20467:15"/>
much as any of his predeceſſors, and hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a will to preferre others into credit, honor and reputation by vſing their ſeruice: for ſo oft as his ſaid Maieſtie hath leuied any power or army, he hath ſtil by preferring them commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted the charge and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct of the ſame vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and if we do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider who at this preſent haue the greateſt and moſt honorable roomes in the realme, we ſhal find that they ar ſaid to be the authors of ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints &amp; haue cauſe rather to commend his maieſties goodneſſe and fauor then any way to complaine &amp; depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</p>
                  <p>But ſay they, they haue but the name, and in effecte are depriued of the prerogatiues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon their ſaide offices, which other men do vſurpe. Before we iudge of the merite of ſuch complainant it were good to ſée &amp; déepe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to looke into the rightes and preheminences to euery office attributed, and then to conſider how and by whome they haue bene admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the time of the kinges predeceſſors.</p>
                  <p>A matter which his Maieſty hath often pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded, when he hath endeuored to ſet order in euery mans office, and had long ſince bene determined and decided if thoſe that haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein had accordinge to their dueties aided and aſſiſted him as they ought. But ſhal it therefore be now ſaide and ſo left to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity that priuate intereſts and diſcontenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be the cauſe of troubling a whole
<pb facs="tcp:20467:15"/>
eſtate, and repleniſhing the ſame with bloud and deſolation?</p>
                  <p>This is not the way that ſhould bee taken in ſéeking to redreſſe thoſe abuſes which they complaine of, ſith they haue to do with ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull a Prince, who ſtill would preuente the inconuenience, and willingly would accept of all méete and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient remedies which may be offered to him for the redreſſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Let therfore the weapons be laide downe, forrein power countermanded &amp; this Realme deliuered out of that daunger which now it is like to incur by this riſing &amp; taking of armes, and in lieu of proceeding in this way which is full of ſtumblinge blockes, miſeries and both priuate and publike calamities, let the path of reaſon duely be ſought out, vndertaken &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, whereby Gods holy Church, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of all violence may more eaſily be reſtored to her power and beauty, and the Nobility ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed and contented as it ought to be. For which of the kings his Maieſties predeceſſors haue in effect ſhewed any token of more loue or cheriſhing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order thereof then his Maieſty hath done? as not being contented with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it before the aunciente and principall honors and degrées of this realme, but hath expreſly erected and made others new, which he hath conſecrated to the illuſtration of true nobility, as hauing excluded and depriued all
<pb facs="tcp:20467:16"/>
other eſtates from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>His Maieſty will alſo effectually prouide with al ſpeede for the eaſe of his people, like as he hath already very well begon, and wiſheth to his power to continue.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer notwithſtanding the Captaines of this warre do promiſe that their power and forces ſhall liue ſo orderlye that all men ſhall like thereof, and withall that they exhorte the cities and towns not to admit any garriſons, yet doe wee ſée that the ſouldiours when they haue gathered together do already commit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite oppreſſions and exceſſe, alſo that they haue placed forces in thoſe townes and holdes which they haue ſeiſed vpon, to the end to rule and keepe them in their obedience. Beſides al this it is euident that many vagabonds &amp; idle perſons will as hath bene accuſtomed riſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name &amp; coulor of either part who will commit infinite ſacrileges and miſchiefes. In ſuch ſort that in lieu of ſtopping the daunger which threatneth the deſtruction of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and all good men as by this warre they do promiſe, it will repleniſh the whole realme withall impiety and vngodlines.</p>
                  <p>They doe alſo geue out that their liues are in daunger, and that that is one of the cauſes that moueth them to riſe, No man can thinke that this complaint any whit concerneth hys Maieſty, aſwell in reſpecte of the good and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable
<pb facs="tcp:20467:16"/>
vſage that at all times they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, as alſo in that his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty is naturally ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſort of reueng that the perſon is yet vnborne, that can iuſtly complaine of him for the ſame, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whatſoeuer offence againſt him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wheras contrarywiſe there are many that hauing proued his clemency may ſerue for a perpetuall remembrance to the poſterity.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration her of his ſaid Maieſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth and exhorteth the Captaines of the ſayd riſings ſpéedely to diſperſe their bandes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaund the ſtraungers, and depart from al factions, and as his kinſmen and ſeruants, to repoſe aſſured confidence in his loue and good will, which in ſo doing he offereth to continue vnto them, by honoring them with his fauour and making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> partakers of ſuch honours as he is accuſtomed to beſtow vpon men of theyr calling: to ioyne and revnite themſelues vnto him, to the ende duely and effectually to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the reſtoring of Gods ſeruice, and the common wealth of his ſaid ſubiectes in ſuche order as ſhal be thought méete and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, whereto his Maieſty is willing to herken.</p>
                  <p>He alſo warneth all Eccleſiaſticall perſons and gentlemen his ſubiectes wel to weigh the conſequence of theſe ſtirres, ſincerely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his entent, and to beleue that his minde alwayes hath and ſtill ſhall tend to do good to
<pb facs="tcp:20467:17"/>
all, and harme and diſpleaſure to none.</p>
                  <p>He doth therfore moſt ſtraightly command them and all other his ſubiectes to depart and withdraw themſelues from all leagues &amp; aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, and to revnite themſelues vnto him, as nature, duety, and their owne wealth and health doth bind them, to the ende that if theſe commotions do procede any farther (which he beſeecheth the goodneſſe of allmighty God not to permit) he may haue aſſiſtaunce and ſuccor in their counſaile, weapons and commodities to the preſeruation of the Realme, wherevnto is linked the Catholike Apoſtolike &amp; Romiſh Church therein, their honor, reputation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, famelies, and goods.</p>
                  <p>Offering and promiſinge vnto them in ſo doing the continuance of his fauor with reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their fidelity and ſeruice.</p>
