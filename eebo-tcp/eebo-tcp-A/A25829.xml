            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and ſweetly. His ſtile was even,

Labourer in the
Goſpel; for the Spirit of God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
much on his heart and Miniſtry:
His life alſo held pace with his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
for as his Doctrine was live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo his life was doctrinal: He was
beloved both of God and man. Our
only grief is, we had ſuch a Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:43429:3"/>
whom now we have not: But in the
midſt of our ſorrows for the loſs of

you, in its native innocency, as it
was midwived from his mouth by
the finger of a ready Pen-man: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as to diminiſh or add any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
leſt, inſtead of his endeavours,
we ſhould give forth our own conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.
His intention was not to print
them in paper, but to imprint them in
the hearts of his Auditory. This
Writing is like Milk in a Bottle,
which though it wanteth the natural
warmth of the Breaſt, yet being well
digeſted, will afford wholſome nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment

David;</hi> Oh Lord, <hi>thou ſon of David,</hi> have mercy
on me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ſhe doth acknowledge him to
be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed to come out of
the loins of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a declaration of her faith by
her <hi>prayer</hi> ſhe poures out before the Lord; her
prayer was an effect of her faith, ſhe calls upon
him with a great deal of earneſtneſs; and her peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, that Chriſt would caſt out the unclean
ſpirit that had taken poſſeſſion of her daughter,
therefore ſhe ſpread it before the Lord, <hi>My
daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Argument ſhe uſes to move Chriſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
her own neceſſity and the miſery of her child)
it was his own <hi>free-grace and mercy:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument this woman u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to move Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Have mercy

is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have mercy upon me;</hi> the affliction of her child
was upon her; ſhe does not ſay, have mercy upon
my child, but upon <hi>me;</hi> and ſhe pleads mercy and
free-grace, have <hi>mercy</hi> upon <hi>me,</hi> not her own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs;
no, but have <hi>mercy</hi> upon me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>tryal</hi> of her faith; her
faith is tryed three ſeveral times, and three ſeveral
wayes the Lord Chriſt doth try her faith, that ſo it
may appear more ſhining.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43429:6"/>
Firſt,<note place="margin">How Chriſt tryed the womans faith.</note> Chriſt doth try her faith by <hi>keeping ſilent,</hi>
giving her no anſwer; ſhe cries aloud, <hi>Lord have
mercy on me,</hi> but Chriſt doth not ſo much as open
his lips to give her any incouragement, but he is
ſilent; and that was a mighty tryall, that when ſhe
ſhould cry ſo loud, that Chriſt ſhould ſay nothing
to her, it was a mighty tryall to this womans
faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt tryes her faith by <hi>giving of her
a ſeeming denial,</hi> in the 24. verſe, He anſwered and
ſaid, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe
of Iſrael;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it is beſide my arrant
to have any thing to do with this woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
I am ſent to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the firſt place; it
was a ſeeming denial of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And it was the greater tryall, becauſe Chriſt
did not only ſeem to deny her requeſt, but to deny
the requeſt of the Diſciples, for in the 23. ver. <hi>The
Diſciples of Chriſt came and beſought him:</hi> Oh this
was a tryal of her faith; ſhe might have ſaid, I
have cryed, and there is no hope, and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
they have beſought him for me; but Chriſt
doth not anſwer, but deny her requeſt, and deny
the Diſciples requeſt, what hope was left
then?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The faith of this woman is tried in
the 26. verſe, where Chriſt doth <hi>object</hi> to her, <hi>her
own unworthineſs and vnfitneſs that</hi> he ſhould have
any thing to do with her; <hi>he anſwered and ſaid, it
is not meet that</hi> I <hi>ſhould caſt the childrens bread to
dogs:</hi> And oh! what a tryall of faith was this?
Chriſt doth not only deny her, but ſeems to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
her with her unworthineſs; ſhe was of the
Nation of the Canaanites, and they were of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43429:7"/>
Jews accounted as Dogs; they were caſt out, and
were without the Covenant, and without God in
the world; <hi>it is not meet,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, I cannot do
it, <hi>to take the childrens bread, and give it to dogs;</hi>
this was a mighty tryal.</p>
               <p>Now in the third place let us conſider the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of this woman under theſe tryals,<note place="margin">The beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> under her tryals.</note> how did
her faith bear up under theſe tryals? That is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto us,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all; when Chriſt gives her no anſwer,
yet ſtill ſhe continues crying after him; there is
the behaviour of this womans faith under that
tryal. Though Chriſt give her no anſwer, ſhe gives
not over her requeſt; though Chriſt was ſilent
and would not open his mouth to give her one
word, yet ſhe continues crying, the Diſciples ſay
as much, <hi>Lord ſend her away,</hi> ſay they, <hi>for ſhe
crieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, And for her deportment under her
<hi>ſecond tryal;</hi> ſhe came and <hi>worſhipped,</hi> and ſaid,
<hi>Lord help;</hi> and ſo ſhe continues ſtill in duty, and is
found waiting upon the Lord in an humble po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
ſhe falls down and worſhips, ſhe worſhips
Chriſt and continues in prayer, <hi>Lord help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The behaviour of this woman under
the <hi>third tryal</hi> ſhe meets withall is in the 27. verſ.
and ſhe ſaid, <hi>Truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the
crumbs which fall from their Maſters table.</hi> When
Chriſt tells her, that he muſt not take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bread and caſt it to dogs, ſee how her faith
now works, and though this ſeem the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
yet her faith doth make an excellent
improvement of it, and from this diſcouragement
her faith takes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtronger; <hi>Truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the
crumbs that fall from their Maſters table;</hi> ſhe
grants all that Chriſt ſaid, ſhe grants the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and application of it, ſhe grants that ſhe was
no better then a dog, and yet her faith makes an
improvement of that which ſeems to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſcouragement, ſhe fetcheth an argument from
thence, if I be a dog let me have the crumbs, if a
dog, <hi>thy dog,</hi> and I will not away from thy feet, but
let me have crumbs that fall from the childrens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So you have the carriage of this woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her ſeveral tryals.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The victory of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans faith.</note> You have the victory of her faith in
the 28. verſe; <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it
unto thee as thou wilt; and her daughter was made
whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heart of Chriſt ſeems to be taken mightily
with the faith of this woman; and therefore Chriſt
ſtands and wonders, that there ſhould be ſuch a
faith in a Canaanitiſh woman: <hi>O woman, great
is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt:</hi> I do
not only grant the mercy thou askeſt, but even
what thou wilt; thou haſt overcome me with thy

                  </gap>ened to you:
I ſhall not enter into it now, but (as I ſaid before)
dwell upon the borders of it.</p>
               <p>And at this time I ſhall conſider what is written
in the 21.<note place="margin">21. Verſe ſpoken to: three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> verſe; <hi>Jeſus went thence and departed
into the coaſt of Tyre and Sidon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. We ſhall conſider from whence Chriſt
went when he came into theſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43429:8"/>
2. And what was the occaſion of Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away.</p>
               <p>3. And then conſider what this place was that
Chriſt came to, where Chriſt wrought this wonder,
this miracle.</p>
               <p>1. He went from thence, from the parts of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi>
which were near to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Chapter you read, that Chriſt was
there in ſome place, where many of the Scribes
from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> came to him, as in the firſt verſe.</p>
               <p>2. What was the occaſion of Chriſts depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from theſe parts of <hi>Judea</hi> that were near to
<hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Why did Chriſt leave theſe parts, and
leave that people? The occaſion is intimated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they oppoſed Chriſt, they cavelled againſt
him; againſt the perſon of Chriſt, againſt the truths
of Chriſt, againſt the diſciples of Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the way of Chriſt; the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
were filled with enmity againſt Chriſt, and the
way of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt departs from
them, and goes into the coaſt of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more particularly, that which was the cauſe
of Chriſts removing from this people; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſet up their own traditions; they ſet
up their own inventions, and made them equal
with the Command of God, nay, they made their
own inventions and traditions above the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God, which was a mighty provocation
to Jeſus Chriſt; if you read the beginning of
the Chapter, you ſhall ſee how they ſet up their
own rules above Gods Rules, which is a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Chriſt, and he will not bear with ſuch; you
may read the ſecond and third verſes, and ſo to the
end of the ſeventh verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43429:8"/>
In vain <hi>(ſayes Chriſt)</hi> do you worſhip me,
teaching for doctrine the commandements of men.</p>
               <p>So that the occaſion of Chriſts removing from
theſe parts of <hi>Judea</hi> which were near to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
was the exalting their own traditions, and
making them equall with Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>It affords ſomething to us for our inſtruction,
which is this,
<q>That when a people,<note place="margin">Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> or any ſoul, ſhall exalt their
own traditions, their own inventions, and make
them equal, or ſet them above the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Rules that Chriſt hath given his
people to walk by, Chriſt will not afford his
preſence to ſuch a people, Chriſt will certainly
depart from ſuch a ſoul, or people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the truth is; there is little hope that there
ſhould be any good done by ſuch a people, when
they decline the Rule, and ſet up ſomething of
their own, there is little hope that the word of
Chriſt ſhould do good among ſuch a people.
Therefore Chriſt will withdraw from them, as he
did from theſe Scribes and Phariſees; and ſo will
Chriſt withdraw his ſpecial preſence from a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that ſhall ſet up their own inventions. For it
is a mighty provocation to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, when a people ſhall exalt their own
inventions above the Rule that Chriſt hath given
his people to walk by; the minds of ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are blinded and darkened, and their hearts
are hardened againſt the Truths of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is little hope of ſuch a people: I ſay;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43429:9"/>
mens own inventions thus exalted and lift up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Gods Rule, it blinds the mind, and hardens
the heart againſt Chriſt and the things of Chriſt;
it is a making to a mans ſelf a graven Image: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
a man ſhall bring in of his own, as a rule to
walk by, and to worſhip by, he makes that an image
to himſelf; now they that make graven Images are
like to them, ſayes the Pſalmiſt, <hi>They have eyes and
ſee not;</hi> God gives them up to blindneſs; decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Gods Rule, and Chriſts Inſtitution, it will blind
them and harden them againſt the Truths of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When as men ſhall exalt their own
inventions, the heart is ſo filled with them, that
there is no room for Chriſt, and for the moſt part
there is in ſuch a ſoul a kind of loathing the Truths
of Chriſt. Whereever you find mens inventions
exalted, there you ſhall find a kind of loathing, in
ſuch a ſoul, of the pure and ſincere truths of the
Goſpel, the bread of life is no longer ſweet with
them, and the water of life hath no relliſh with
them; and when it comes to this, Chriſt will not
ſtay, but withdraws his ſpiritual preſence from
them, as he did his bodily preſence from the
Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt will withdraw from ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
becauſe for the moſt part they are deſperate
enemies and perſecutors of Chriſt, and of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and of his Truths: So it was with the
Scribes and Phariſees, Chriſt had not ſuch
enemies in all the world as they were, becauſe
they were moſt zealous for their own inventio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they declined the Rule, and ſet up their
own rule, and therefore they prove deſperate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> makes an acknowledgement
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43429:9"/>
of it when Chriſt came to open his eyes, and doth
tell you, that that was the cauſe of his driving on
that trade of perſecuting the Saints with ſo much
earneſtneſs, becauſe he was ſo zealous for the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men; in <hi>Phil. 3. 6.</hi> You may ſee there
what he ſayes was the cauſe of his perſecuting the
Saints: <hi>Concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church,
touching the righteouſneſs which is in the law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:</hi>
And ſo in <hi>Gal. 1. 13, 14. For ye have heard
of my converſation in time paſt, in the Jews Religion,
how that beyond meaſure I perſecuted the Church of
God and waſted it.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>And profited in the
Jews religion above many my equals in mine own
nation, being more zealous of the traditions of my
fathers:</hi> The zeal which he had for the traditions
of men was that which carried him on to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Chriſtians with ſo much violence; and
many times it is ſo, that they which do moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
their own traditions, they become very zealous
in perſecuting the Saints and Truths of Chriſt, for
it is natural for a man to become zealous for that
which is his own; that which is of the fleſh, that
which is a kin to the fleſh, the fleſh will be zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for: Now all traditions they are born of the
fleſh, they are the off-ſpring of mans own brain,
and therefore upon that account men are many
times very zealous for them to the perſecuting of
the Saints of God. Now upon this account the
Lord Chriſt will not afford his preſence with ſuch
as lay aſide his Rule, for they many times prove
the greateſt perſecuters of Chriſt and his
people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt will not continue and afford his
preſence with ſuch a people, as ſet up their own
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43429:10"/>
inventions and traditions in the place of God's
Rule, becauſe they do arrogate that to themſelves
which is Chriſts due; he is the great Prophet,
and given to inſtruct his people, to make known
the way of life and ſalvation, and it belongs to
Chriſt to give a rule for his people to walk by:
And therefore when men ſhall ſet up their rule in
the place of Chriſts Rule; what do they but take
the place of Chriſt, the office of Chriſt, and turn
Chriſt out of his office, and ſet themſelves in
Chriſts chair. Now this is a great provocation to
Chriſt, and that which Chriſt will not endure, but
depart from ſuch a people.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They that do exalt their own inventions
and traditions in the place of Chriſts Rule, for the
moſt part they place their righteouſneſs in thoſe
very traditions of their own; which is a great
provocation unto Chriſt; for you may obſerve
this in the Phariſees, they that were ſo zealous for
their own inventions, and would not ſubmit to the
Rule of Chriſt, they would not ſubmit to the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but they placed their
righteouſneſs in their traditions, in their inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
a kind of volluntary humility they had, and
willingly ſubmitted to their traditions, and by ſo
doing did overturn the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,
placing their righteouſneſs in their own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
it was that which made them not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the righteouſneſs of God. Let a man do
never ſo much, let him walk never ſo ſtrictly, let
him ſet up the ſtraiteſt rule to himſelf to walk by,
though a man do never ſo much, though he afflict
his body never ſo much, if this tend to draw off the
ſoul from the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that a man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43429:10"/>
ſhould look upon this as his commendation before
God, and place this in the room of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
as all do that ſet up their own traditions,
they do greatly provoke the Lord Chriſt, and looſe
all they do; though men could walk as exactly as
the very Angels, yet if that exactneſs ſhould draw
them to place any truſt, any confidence in their
obſervations and humility, they looſe all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
for Chriſt tells his Diſciples in <hi>Matth. 5.
20. That except your righteouſneſs exceed the
righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall
in no wiſe enter into the kingdome of heaven:</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs
of the Scribes and Phariſees: they went a great
way in ſelf righteouſneſs, they walked very ſtrictly
and very preciſely; ah but you muſt have another
kind of righteouſneſs, a righteouſneſs that muſt be
beyond theirs; they placed their righteouſneſs in
their doings, in their obſervations and inventions;
but except your righteouſneſs exceed theirs,
you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdome of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Devil he will allow men to go a great way
in ſuch paths of ſelf-righteouſneſs, to do a great
deal, to ſuffer a great deal, to carry it very humbly,
and very ſtrictly, and ſeem to be the moſt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men living; if the Devil can but draw them
off from Chriſts righteouſneſs thereby, and place
their righteouſneſs in this, he care not how far they
go; for the Devil knows that this will never mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the fleſh, whatſoever is of mans
ſetting up will never mortifie the deeds of the
fleſh; but as I ſaid before, men may live very
ſtrictly, faſt and pray, and yet be far from mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43429:11"/>
the deeds of the fleſh; it may be ſo far from
mortifying the deeds of the fleſh, that it may
ſtrengthen the fleſh and corruption, get ſtrength
while men ſeem to walk in ſuch a way of ſeeming
mortification; yea the ſtrength of the body may
be ſpent in ſeeming mortification, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unmortified.</p>
               <p>But to reflect a little by way of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Application</note>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that this might be a warning piece to us to
take heed that we do not exalt any thing of man in
the room of Chriſt; take heed we do not exalt
our rule above Chriſts Rule, that we do not form
rules to our ſelves to walk by, and to worſhip by,
and decline the Rule, and Inſtitutions, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

               <p>There are two ſorts of people that are and will

preſence of the Lord, for Chriſt will depart from
ſuch a people.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such as ſet up outward formes of their

been ſuch a generation of men in this Land, and
ſtill there are, who hath ſuch Idols in their hearts
who ſet up their form above Chriſts Form; Chriſt
hath left a Rule, and Chriſt hath given his Form,
and his Inſtitutions, which muſt be obſerved till his
coming; but now when men ſhall bring in their
own inventions and traditions, their own ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
ceremonies into the worſhip of Chriſt,
which Chriſt hath not commanded, this is a great
provocation to the Lord, and ſuch a people cannot
injoy the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both theſe ſorts of men will be found to ſet up

dangerous is it? and as I ſaid before, ſo again, and
oh that it might be remembred! It is a pulling
Chriſt out of his Throne; for men to decline his
Rule, the rule of his Word, which he hath given
them to walk by, and decline his Ordinances, and

               <p>To whom,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I ſay, it is a great miſtake, that the
Spirit of the Lord in us ſhould be a rule for us to
walk by; the Spirit is not the rule, the Spirit is
given to open the rule, the Spirit is given to ſhine
upon the rule, to declare the rule, but the Spirit of
the Lord is not the rule. It is true indeed, we
cannot know the rule, at leaſt in the ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, till the Spirit of the Lord doth open it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as a man cannot ſee what time of day it is by the

while men think that the Spirit is the rule, when
as the Word of the Lord is the rule, <hi>to the Law
and to the teſtimony, if any man walk not according
to this rule.</hi> And ſo Chriſt tells his Diſciples,
that the Spirit is not given to manifeſt and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any new thing, but what Chriſt hath laid dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
in his Word: look into <hi>John 16. 13. Howbeit
when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you
into all truth; for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43429:12"/>
but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak,
and he will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Mark how
clear it is, that the Spirit is not given to diſcover
any thing that is beſide the rule that Chriſt hath
left; he ſhall guide you into truth; ah but how?
he ſhall lead you to the rule and guide you
into truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf,
but what Chriſt hath ſpoken, and what is written
in the Word of the Lord; and the Spirit is given
to ſpeak it with power, and life, and efficacy;
<hi>He ſhall take of mine and ſhew it to you,</hi> no new
thing, but what is mine; my Truth, my Goſpel; he
ſhall take of mine and ſhew it to you.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> If the Spirit of the
Lord be in me, ſurely the Spirit need no rule to walk
by; but the Spirit of the Lord is in all the Saints,
what need have they of any other rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: The Spirit needs no rule, ah
but the Lord ſaw that we needed a rule to walk by,
we were apt to be deceived, to call darkneſs light,
and light darkneſs; the Lord ſaw we had need of a
rule, and that rule is the Word of the Lord, which
is given us as our rule, and no other rule but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Word of the Lord: And therefore be not
deceived upon any pretence whatſoever; take
heed you be not drawn off from the Inſtitutions
of Chriſt, from the Word of Chriſt, the rule that
Chriſt hath left all his people to walk by, for if you
be, you will exalt ſomething of your own, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that you will place your Righteouſneſs in;
and oh how provoking is that to Chriſt? for a
people that do ſo, they cannot and ſhall not injoy
the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt; ſuch as forſake
Chriſts Rule, and ſet up their own rule that Chriſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43429:13"/>
never made a rule, they ſhall not injoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt, no more then Chriſt afforded his
preſence with the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
               <p>And therefore doe but wait upon the Lord,
cleave to the Lord, and hold faſt his Rule, and you
ſhall ſee that the Lord will make it evident to all
the world, that he hath left them, though they are
never ſo ſeemingly high and ſpiritual, yet it will
appear, that ſuch as forſake him, Chriſt will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them, they are left of Chriſt in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
already, and wait upon the Lord, and you
ſhall ſee that the Lord will leave them to corrupt
themſelves by a corrupt converſation; for what
way of Chriſt will not men only forſake, but blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme?
and what ſins ſo great will not ſuch a man,
as leaves the rule, be drawn to the commiſſion of?
For if the Word be not the rule, but a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of Spirit, what impulſes may not a man have?
he may have the ſtrongeſt impulſe to the greateſt
evil whatſoever; if the Lord hath not yet left, yet
he will leave ſuch a people to the commiſſion of
great evil: As I remember the hiſtory of ſome
of the low Countries, they had ſuch a pretence,
that the Word was not to be their rule, but they
were led by the impulſe of the Spirit of God;
and I remember in that hiſtory it is recorded, that
many grievous wickedneſſes they did commit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they came to marry many wives, and one of the
chief of them cuts off one of his wives heads. And
another upon a time, he calls his kindred together,
and he in the preſence of them all takes away the
life of one of his brethren, and ſaid, <hi>now the will of
the Lord is done:</hi> And what wickedneſs is it that
men may not fall into by a ſtrong impulſe?</p>
               <p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold, a woman came out of the
ſame coaſts.</hi> The Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi>
does take notice, that when Chriſt
came into theſe coaſts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Sidon</hi> he entred into a private
houſe, and would have hid himſelf
there, <hi>Mark 7. 24, 25.</hi> And <hi>from
thence he aroſe and went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon, and entred into an houſe, and would have no

of <hi>Canaan</hi> comes and finds him out, and falls

               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43429:16"/>
So then we may obſerve this briefly:</p>
               <p>That where there is a ſeed of faith in any ſoul,<note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
where the work of faith is begun, it will find out
Chriſt whereever he is.</p>
               <p>This woman had a ſeed of faith, ſhe heares
of Chriſt, and though Chriſt goes about to hide
himſelf, he could not be hid. Whereever faith is
begun in any ſoul, it will find out Chriſt, never reſt
till it find out Chriſt, it will come to him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is: Chriſt cannot alwayes be hid to the
eye of faith; <hi>Where the body is, there will the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
be gathered together,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: The Eagles
will find out the dead body, though it be never ſo
remote, though it lay in a ſecret cave of the earth,
and ſo where there is faith, the ſoul will find out
Chriſt, Chriſt cannot alwayes lie hid from the
ſoul.</p>
               <p>For the eye of faith it hath ſome reſemblance
like the eye of God: There is nothing can be hid
from the eye of God, <hi>Pſal. 139. 7, 8, 9. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall I go from thy preſence; if</hi> I <hi>go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thou art there, and if</hi> I <hi>make my bed in hell thou
art there, if I take the wings of the morning, and
dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the ſea, thou art
there.</hi> And ſo the eye of faith hath reſemblance
to the eye of God, though indeed the eye of faith
cannot alwayes ſee God, yet where there is faith
the ſoul will be purſuing after God and Chriſt:
<hi>My ſoul followeth hard after God,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,
Pſal. 63. 8. David</hi> had faith, and his ſoul preſſed
after God, made hard after God: Faith will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt whereever he is, if in heaven, faith
will follow him there, if he go down to hell, even
in dark diſpenſations, faith will follow him there,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43429:16"/>
if he flie to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, and
ſeem to be at a great diſtance, faith will follow
him there: Chriſt cannot be hid alwayes from the
eye of Faith, it will follow him when he hides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when Chriſt
hid himſelf from her, yet ſhe follows him, and
ſeeks him at home and abroad, and leaves no place
unſought, and ſhe never gives over till ſhe finds
him, ſeeks till ſhe finds, and at laſt ſhe found him
whom her ſoul loveth.</p>
               <p>Nay, I may ſay, faith will ſee ſomething of
Chriſt whereever he is, not only follow after him,
but ſee ſome glimpſe of him whereever he is,
though he go down into hell, the ſoul will ſee
ſomething of Chriſt in ſuch a dark diſpenſation;
in the hardeſt ſaying of Chriſt faith will find
ſomething of Chriſt, as the Lord calls this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a <hi>dog,</hi> and yet ſhe finds out ſomething of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore to apply this,<note place="margin">Application</note> briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Brethren: O that we might take this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for our pattern, to follow after Chriſt, and find
him out, when he hides himſelf: You that walk in
darkneſs and ſee no light, oh that you would look
upon this woman, and make her your pattern:
Chriſt hid himſelf from her; ah, but ſhe finds
him out, and Chriſt could not be hid: One would
have thought it had been a bold part of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when Chriſt retired himſelf into a private
houſe, that ſhe ſhould find him out and preſs in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; ah, but the Lord did not reprove her for
her boldneſs, it pleaſed Chriſt well enough. And
oh that we might ſeek after Chriſt, and preſſe in
upon Chriſt, even then when Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43429:17"/>
ſeems to hide himſelf that he might not be found!</p>
               <p>And for your incouragement,<note place="margin">Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeek Chriſt.</note> does Chriſt ſeem
to be hid from you as from this woman of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan?</hi>
never leave till you find him, go where
he is, wait upon him in an Ordinance, look to him
in a promiſe, and preſs in upon him; and let me
ſay for your incouragement, Jeſus Chriſt doth not
hide himſelf from you that you might never find
him; no, the end of Chriſts hiding himſelf is,
that you might ſeek him, that you may ſeek him
earneſtly, diligently, as the <hi>Wiſe men</hi> did: Chriſt
did not hide himſelf from this woman, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
ſhe ſhould not find him; no, if Chriſt had
intended that, Chriſt would never have come into
thoſe coaſts, and therefore his intent was not that
ſhe might not have found him, he might have gone
into the wilderneſs, and gone where ſhe might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have heard of him; no, that ſhe might ſeek
him, and exerciſe faith, and preſſe in upon him.
And oh that this might give incouragement to you
poor ſouls, who are looking after Chriſt, who hath
hid himſelf from you: O conſider, that if Jeſus
Chriſt had intended ſo to hide himſelf as you
ſhould never find him, Chriſt would never have
come upon your coaſts, Chriſt would have gone
ſome where elſe, he would never have come ſo
nigh to you as he hath done, he would never have
come ſo nigh to your ſouls, and never have drawn
nigh to you in ſuch a word of grace and promiſe;
no, he hides himſelf that you might ſeek him, and
not with an intent you might not find him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider what an ingagement this
doth lay upon all our ſouls, this example of the
woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> in finding out Chriſt, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43429:17"/>
in upon Chriſt, when ſhe had no invitation:
Oh what an ingagement is this for our ſouls to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt? What an ingagement to come to
Chriſt, to come in faith? ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt doth
not hide himſelf in a private houſe as he did then,
no, Chriſt he draws nigh to us, and ſtands, as it
were, upon the houſe top. Wiſdome ſtands in the
open ſtreet, and there ſhe cries and makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<hi>O ye fools, how long will you love folly?
ye ſimple ones, how long will you love ſimplicity?</hi>
So then if ſhe came to Chriſt when Chriſt hid
himſelf, what an ingagement have we to come to
Chriſt when Chriſt ſtands upon the houſe top? If
ſhe preſs'd in to Chriſt when ſhe had no invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
O what an ingagement lies upon us in the day
of grace to come to Chriſt? We have many a
word of incouragement; He ſayes, <hi>Look to me
and be you ſaved:</hi> And he ſayes, <hi>Behold me, to a
nation that was not called by his name.</hi> O the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
invitations that we hear from Chriſt from
day to day! Chriſt ſets the door of Grace wide
open; let him come, and whoever will let him
come; and he doth ingage, that whoſoever comes
ſhall not be ſhut out, ſhall not find the door of
Grace ſhut againſt him; whoever comes to Chriſt
by faith ſhall find that all their ſins and iniquities
ſhall not ſhut the door againſt them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to conclude this, if this woman came when
ſhe had no invitation to come, O what an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is it for us to come to Chriſt, now Chriſt
ſtands ſo as he may be ſeen afar off? O that God
would perſwade the heart of ſome poor ſinner to
come to Chriſt by faith! But to paſſe by this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:43429:18"/>
We ſhall now conſider who this woman was,<note place="margin">Who this woman was that come to Chriſt.</note>
                  <hi>A woman of Canaan came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Deſcribed firſt, by <hi>a woman;</hi> a woman is
the weaker veſſel, more weak ordinarily then
men; ſtronger paſſions, greater fears, ſubject to
doubts; and yet here is a woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Behold, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, She is deſcribed to be a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> a
woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhe was of the ſtock of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi>
a curſed Nation, caſt out of the Land for
their abominations, and their Land given to <hi>Iſrael</hi>
for a poſſeſſion; and yet this woman, though a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite,</hi>
comes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, She being a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> it follows, that
before the Lord revealed himſelf to her, ſhe was a
<hi>very ſinful</hi> woman; ſo the reſt of the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
were, not only vile in reſpect of kindred, but vile
in reſpect of actual tranſgreſſion; and yet <hi>behold,
this woman of Canaan here coming to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then the Doctrine is this:
<q>That the Lord many times is pleaſed to make
choice of the moſt weak,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and the moſt unworthy,
and the moſt ſinfull, and cauſeth them to
come to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>She was a woman,
there is her</hi> weakneſſe; <hi>a</hi> Canaanite, <hi>there is
her</hi> unworthineſs; ſinful <hi>in reſpect of actual
tranſgreſſion, even as the reſt of the</hi> Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall clear this Point to you from the Word
of God, and give you Inſtances that the Lord
makes choiſe many times of the weakeſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthieſt,

Firſt of all for Gods chuſing thoſe that are

the Lord makes choice of ſuch: <hi>Go and tell John</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 11.) that which you have

and the poor receive the Goſpel:</hi> And in <hi>James 2.
Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God choſen
the poor of this world to be rich in faith, and heires
of the Kingdom?</hi> Some rich, ſome of great eſtates
are choſen; but for the moſt part the vein of Gods
election runs thorough the loins of thoſe that are
poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>

26, 27. For you ſee your calling brethren, how that
not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty,
not many noble are called; but God hath choſen the

God hath choſen the weak things of the world to

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Weak in age many times cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> If we conſider thoſe that are weak in

makes choice of <hi>young men,</hi> bringing them in, and

revealing more of himſelf to them then he doth
to old men; youth is weak, young men are weak,
though not in natural ſtrength, yet in morral
ſtrength; for youth is accompanied with ſtrong
paſſions and luſts that weaken the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
young men for the moſt part are moſt
raſh and inconſiderate. Arguments of weakneſſe:
Young <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> his young Counſel, what raſh

him his life? And young men are moſt apt to be

<hi>A Biſhop muſt not be a novice:</hi> and yet many
times, notwithſtanding young men are accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſo many weakneſſes, yet the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to make choice of them: There are many
Inſtances of it, that the Lord hath made choice of

God then <hi>Joſiah</hi> was; <hi>Joſiah</hi> was brought home to
God when he was a young man, <hi>2 Chron. 34. In

to the Lord: O what heavenly muſick is it? The
Lord Chriſt will take it well at your hand, if you
that are young will begin in tender years to look
after Chriſt, and lift up the name of Chriſt. Chriſt
took the part of thoſe children; the Phariſees
were offended that the Children ſhould cry <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi>
but Chriſt he took it well, and he pleaded for
them; this is that which is written, ſaith Chriſt,

to.</p>
               <p>O remember the women that miniſtred to

Apoſtles to the rivers ſide; remember <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe
heart the Lord opened, and the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:43429:22"/>
and this woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and oh that this
might be an incouragement to women! be not
diſcouraged becauſe of your weakneſs, and do not
ſay, I know not how to come to Chriſt: Why the
Lord makes choice of the weakeſt, and they are
brought home ſooner then the ſtrong: And O
that it might be an incouragement for you to come
to Chriſt! And let me ſay to all women that hear
me this day, <hi>The woman was firſt in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
O that that might provoke women to look
after Chriſt; the woman was the firſt that ſinned,
and the woman was the firſt that was deceived;
and therefore oh that women would be the firſt in
coming to Chriſt!</p>
               <p>And let me tell you, that if there be any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that hear me this day, and hear the Word of

not leave you for the refuſal of the tender of

women the Lord hath left them many times to

And therefore women take heed how you de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worſe then the vileſt of men.</p>
               <p>And let me ſpeak alſo unto thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
in reſpect of parentage. If there be any
here that with a ſad heart look upon their kindred
and fathers houſe, as being ſuch as know not God,
but are contrary to God; O let not that be any
block in your way, you may be accepted of Chriſt,
though you come of the vileſt kindred, your kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
cannot be worſe then the kindred of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Canaan</hi> was, they were caſt out of the
Land, a curſed Generation; and therefore all the
ſins of your parents ſhall not be any block in your
way, the child ſhall not bear the ſin of the parents,
if the child be coming to Chriſt, and taking hold
of his Covenant, all the ſins of your parents ſhall
not be any block in your way, but you ſhall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo for thoſe that are ſenſible of perſonal
tranſgreſſion; O let not that be any block in your
way to hinder you from coming to Chriſt! though
you have ſinned greatly with a high hand, yet do
not go on to eſtrange your ſelves from the Lord,
by keeping at a diſtance from Chriſt, and by adding
unbelief to all your ſin, which will ſet home all
your ſin, and bind them all upon your back: O that
thoſe that have committed great offences might
ſee what a door the Goſpel to Chriſt opens to them
to come in to Chriſt!</p>
               <p>And let me ſay for your incouragement, that the
Grace of the Lord ſhall appear the more towards
you: the more ſinful you are, the more rich, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and excellent ſhall the Grace of the Lord
appear to you; and know that Grace is never
more glorious, then when it triumphs over great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43429:23"/>
iniquities, when Grace doth triumph over great
tranſgreſſions: O then the Grace of God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
grace towards you ſhal be exceeding glorious.</p>
               <p>And it ſhall be for the Lords honour to receive
you, to paſſe by and to forgive ſeventy times ſeven.
It is the honour of a man, a mans glory; why it is
the glory of the great God to forgive many and
great tranſgreſſions, and there ſhall be the more
joy in heaven for your return; the greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
you have been, the more glad ſhall the
heart of Chriſt be: When the <hi>Prodigall</hi> ſon
came home, what joy was there at his return?</p>
               <p>And let me ſay to you, that all your tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall not be mentioned, though he or ſhe hath
been never ſo vile, yet if the Lord doth give any
ſinner a heart to come to Chriſt, the Word of the
Lord ſhall be made good; That <hi>all their ſins ſhall
not be mentioned,</hi> Ezek. 18. 21, 22. <hi>If the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his way all his tranſgreſſions ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:</hi>
Oh that this might incourage unworthy
ones to look to Chriſt!</p>
               <p>And truly if unworthy ones ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by this to come to Chriſt, know that this
example of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> will riſe up in
judgement againſt you; ſhe was as unworthy and
ſinful as you; and oh what a cutting thing will it
be when ſinners ſhall ſee <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the <hi>woman of Samaria,</hi> and
this <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> to ſit down with Chriſt, and
they themſelves ſhut out? O that God would help
you to imbrace the Goſpel! and know, that all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
and ſinfulneſs ſhall be no block in your
way, if the Lord now perſwade your heart to make
a cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43429:23"/>
And to draw to a concluſion, let us labour to
help forward Gods deſign: Doth God make choice
of ſuch? O then we ſhould help forward Gods
work, eſpecially where any ſtand related to us;
weakneſs ſhall not hinder, they may come to
Chriſt; and therefore be in the uſe of the means,
pray for them, and ſpeak to them, and improve
every talent that God hath given you, even for the
weakeſt and unworthieſt.</p>
               <p>And again, take heed that we do not murmur
againſt any of the diſpenſations of the Lord; take
heed we do not envy this diſpenſation, and that our
hearts do not riſe up againſt it; that we do not
murmur when we ſee ſuch and ſuch profeſs the
name of Chriſt, and they are very forward, and
ſuch as were young children, and ſuch poor weak
women; Now what a high profeſſion do they
make? The Phariſees they were offended when
as the rude people (as they called them that knew
not the Law) they followed after Chriſt. Oh this
made the Goſpel and Chriſt a ſtumbling block to
them! And ſo when as the children did confeſs
Chriſt, and ſung <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the
Phariſees were offended, it troubled them at the
heart that the children ſhould cry out ſo, it was a
trouble to them. Take heed that we be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
when the Lord makes choice of young
ones, and they are too forward as ſome think; why
this is no more then what the Lord hath promiſed,
to pour out his Spirit upon young men, take heed
we be not offended at it; we ſhould rather rejoyce
in it, when you ſee young ones, weak ones, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ones come in to Chriſt, and are high in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
oh you ſhould rejoyce in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43429:24"/>
And let your ſouls wonder at this diſpenſation,
do not envy it, but do you wonder at it. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
<hi>Matthew</hi> he placeth a note of wonder,
<hi>behold,</hi> a woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was a wonder, and we
ſhould ſtand and wonder at Gods ſecret diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
O here is the myſterie of the Goſpel, that
weak ones and ſinful ones are brought in to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And rejoyce in it as Chriſt did, and bleſs the
Lord for it, though they have more then we have,
yet do not envy it, but know that this pleaſeth the
Lord, and the Lord will ſo have it; <hi>I thank thee,
O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good in thy ſight.</hi> Chriſts ſoul was taken with it.
O here is a wonder indeed, for which God is to be
bleſſed and praiſed: And ſo if God be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when you ſee this, do not envy it, but rejoyce
in it as Chriſt did; though I have little, I thank
thee that thou art pleaſed to give out ſo much of
thy ſelf to ſuch and ſuch, that weak ones and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
ones are brought in to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all: You that are weak in reſpect
of parts and gifts; and poor, and unworthy, and
weak, in reſpect of ſex, or of vile parentage, and yet
the Lord hath pluckt you out; and vile and great
ſinners, and yet the Lord hath brought you home
to himſelf; O bleſs the Lord for this his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
toward you. If the Evangeliſt look upon the
woman and ſay, <hi>Behold, the woman of Canaan,</hi> O
look upon your ſelves with admiration, <hi>Behold</hi> the
Grace of God which is revealed to you though
poor wretches. O know that you are ingaged to
the Lord for this mercy, that God ſhould chuſe
you, the weakeſt, the unworthieſt, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43429:24"/>
And do you labour to walk worthy of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Oh if the Lord hath choſen you that vvere the
ſinfulleſt, O labour to bring much honour unto
God, as you have brought much diſhonour, and to
hold forth the contrary graces to thoſe great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
               <p>And if the Lord hath brought you in that are
vveak ones, <hi>women;</hi> is there ever a vveak vvoman
that the Lord hath made choice of? O admire vvith
fear this diſpenſation of God, and bleſs him for his
Grace to you, and labour to adorn the Doctrine of
God and your Saviour vvith a gracious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſtudy the Graces the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to you, that you ſhould be much in the

<hi>meek</hi> and <hi>quiet ſpirit.</hi> O this meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
this ſober and this modeſt converſation and
obedience to Husbands, theſe Graces Chriſt by the
Apoſtle doth commend to you, and you are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to do all this and more for Chriſt, becauſe he
hath had reſpect to the vveakeſt.</p>

               <p>Obſerve, here is a declaration of

<hi>faith</hi> is declared by a notable confeſſion that ſhe
makes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Her confeſſion: <hi>O Lord, thou ſon of David;</hi>
it is ſhort, but a great deal is in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, ſhe doth acknowledge him to be
<hi>Lord,</hi> Lord of all, to be infinite in power, the Lord
of Heaven and Earth, one that was able to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he pleaſeth, one that was able to caſt out
the Devil by ſpeaking one word; for ſhe comes in
the behalf of her Daughter and cloſeth with Chriſt
as <hi>Lord;</hi> where ſhe doth acknowledge his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43429:25"/>
that he was Lord over all, God bleſſed for
ever, and had power in his hand, and abillity to do
whatſoever he pleaſed. That is the firſt part
of her confeſſion, ſhe confeſſed that Chriſt was
<hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, She confeſſes that he was the <hi>ſon of
David, O Lord, thou ſon of David,</hi> and therein ſhe
doth acknowledge his <hi>Humanity;</hi> as ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that he was <hi>Lord,</hi> ſo ſhe acknowledged that
he was true <hi>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. She doth acknowledge that he was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> that is comprehended in that title,
<hi>Thou ſon of David:</hi> She doth acknowledge that
he was that <hi>Meſſias</hi> that was promiſed ſhould ariſe
out of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that ſhould come of
the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> that
was promiſed to be the deliverer of his people; ſo
ſhe doth acknowledge, for ſhe calls him the <hi>ſon of
David,</hi> he that was promiſed ſhould come of the
houſe of <hi>David,</hi> whom God had promiſed to raiſe
up to be a horn of ſalvation. So you ſee her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
ſhe confeſſes his <hi>Divinity,</hi> comes to him
as <hi>God;</hi> confeſſes his <hi>Humanity,</hi> comes to him as
<hi>Man,</hi> and ſhe comes to him as the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> one
that was appointed of God to be a Saviour, and
one of the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> Here is as full and as
large a confeſſion as any of the Diſciples make of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But it may be queried,<note place="margin">Why this woman cals Chriſt the <hi>ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
                  </note> Why ſhe calls
him <hi>the ſon of David?</hi> ſhe might have expreſt him
to have been true man, and called him the <hi>ſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
why not <hi>the ſon of Adam?</hi> or <hi>the ſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham?</hi>
why does ſhe call him the ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43429:26"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer in general: Chriſt was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that name among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for ſo he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
and propheſied of, that he ſhould be the ſon
of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But again, he is called the <hi>ſon of David,</hi> becauſe
the promiſe was in a ſpecial manner unto <hi>David,</hi>
in a gracious way, God did confirm the promiſe of
the <hi>Meſſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> unto <hi>David:</hi> Notwithſtanding <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
imperfection, and the ſin that was in <hi>David,</hi>
yet the promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to <hi>David</hi> and
his houſe, <hi>though his houſe was not ſo with God,</hi> yet
God confirmed the Covenant with David, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it in a remarkable way unto <hi>David;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his unworthineſs, yet the <hi>Meſſias</hi>
ſhould ſpring out of his loins; and therefore in
reſpect of that gracious Promiſe he was called the
<hi>ſon of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This woman gives him the title of
<hi>the ſon of David,</hi> becauſe it is the moſt honourable
title; where there is true faith it will put all the
honour it can upon Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> was an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
King in Iſrael: <hi>David</hi> was the firſt godly
King that ever God ſet over his own people; ſo
he was honourable, being the firſt godly King that
reigned over the people; and therefore became
<hi>David</hi> was moſt honourable among the Kings,
the firſt godly King, therefore this woman
put honour upon Chriſt, calls him <hi>the ſon of
David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> was a very remarkable type of
Chriſt, and as he was known by <hi>David,</hi> ſo Chriſt
was known by this name, and called by this name;
Chriſt he was very like in many things to <hi>David;</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:43429:26"/>
as Chriſt came of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> ſo in many
things Jeſus Chriſt was like to <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi>
Kingdome it was a type of Chriſts Kingdome;
and therefore it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Luke 1.</hi> That
<hi>God ſhould give him the throne of David his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
But in theſe particulars I ſhall inſtance to
you that <hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt, and Chriſt
like to <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">How <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a type of Chriſt, and how Chriſt like to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
                  </note> In thoſe manifold victories and conqueſts
that <hi>David</hi> obtained over his enemies and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God; why <hi>David</hi> was a very victorious
Prince, he ſubdued the enemies of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
time, many of the Lords battels were fought
by <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> returned a Conquerour, he
ſmote the great <hi>Goliah</hi> that defied the Armies of
the God of Iſrael, <hi>David</hi> went forth and ſmote
him, and he fell, and in thoſe remarkable victories
<hi>David</hi> obtained over the enemies of the Church,
he was a type of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>the ſon of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, And then again, <hi>David</hi> was a type of
Chriſt, in that he brought back again the Ark of
God that was taken captive by the Philiſtines;
<hi>David</hi> reſtored the Ark and brought it back again;
ſo Chriſt reſtored the Ordinances, and will reſtore
them to their perfect purity, even all the veſſels of
the Lords Houſe that hath been taken captive by
the Philiſtines, Chriſt will reſtore them, they ſhall
all be brought again into their own place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to their firſt purity, Chriſt will fulfill it,
there is a promiſe of it, and he will fulfil it; in this
<hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt in that
he waited long for the Kingdom, after the Promiſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43429:27"/>
was given to him, yea, after the Lord by <hi>Samuel</hi> had
anointed <hi>David</hi> to be King over Iſrael, after he
was anointed he was driven out, and he waited
long for the fulfilling of the Promiſe, a type of
Chriſt in that; and ſo it is with <hi>David</hi>'s Son, the
Lord Jeſus, though anointed, though the Spirit was
poured out upon him without meaſure, though
anointed to be King, yet we ſee not all his enemies
put under his feet; there is a promiſe that it ſhall
be ſo, but we ſee it not, yet he waits for it; and
therefore he compares himſelf to a man that went
into a far country to receive a kingdome for him
ſelf; and ſo Chriſt is in Heaven, he ſits and waits for
it, till the time come that his Father ſhall give him
the kingdom, and he is to rule over all, his enemies
to be made his footſtool.</p>
               <p>Nay fourthly, <hi>David</hi> was a type of Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his enemies. <hi>Davids</hi> enemies were many,
and great, mighty, and potent, and ſo are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Saul</hi> and all his forces roſe
up againſt <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> he had many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in his own houſe afterwards, and <hi>they that did
eat bread with him at his table;</hi> and his enemies
were a type of Chriſts enemies; <hi>Saul</hi> and all his
forces againſt <hi>David,</hi> the Devil, and all his Angels,
and wicked men againſt Chriſt. Chriſts enemies
they were ſuch as were his near companions, one
that dipt his hand in the diſh with him he betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: And thus you ſee <hi>David</hi> was a type
of Chriſt, his Kingdome a type of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to add no more but this; <hi>Davids</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
you know was very ſmall at firſt, but it grew
great; when <hi>David</hi> came firſt to the Kingdome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43429:27"/>
there were but few that took his part; ah, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there had been war for a while betwixt the
houſe of <hi>David</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it ſo, that firſt one of the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> fell
off, and then another, and the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> waxed
weaker and weaker, and <hi>Davids</hi> houſe ſtronger and
ſtronger: So the Kingdome of Chriſt, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was a little Kingdome, the ſervants that
owned him and his cauſe, they are but a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
party at firſt, <hi>a little ſtone cut out of the
mountain without hands,</hi> a type and ſhaddow of
Chriſts Kingdome, but that ſtone it waxed bigger
and bigger, and became a mountain that filled the
whole earth.</p>
               <p>You ſee why Chriſt, both here by this woman,
and alſo in divers other places, is ſo frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſon of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the obſervation, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

this:

which doth declare him to be the ſame God, the
ſame being with his Father, for he had the ſame
<hi>power <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> True faith doth acknowledge, that all the
mighty works of Creation and Providence, and
that the world was made by him, and upheld by
him, and governed by him; according to that
place, <hi>Heb. 1. 10. And thou Lord in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
haſt laid the foundations of the earth, and the
heavens are the works of thy hands.</hi> So that
faith that doth confeſs Chriſt to be <hi>Lord,</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him to be <hi>infinite in power,</hi> and that he
by his fingers made the heavens, and by his hands
laid the foundation of the earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That faith that doth acknowledge
Chriſt to be <hi>Lord,</hi> doth confeſs that he is infinite in
<hi>knowledge,</hi> and that he is <hi>omnipreſent,</hi> every where;
as God he is in all places, though as man he ſits in
heaven, yet as God he is every where, according
to that Scripture, the <hi>Son of God hath eyes like a
flame of fire,</hi> he ſees all things, a flame of fire
diſcovers all things in the room, ſo the Son of God
he knows all the corners of the heart, and ſees all
things, and needs not that any ſhould teſtifie of
man; and that Chriſt according to his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fills heaven and earth, and with his gracious
preſence is with his people alwayes, <hi>Loe I am with
you to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That faith that confeſſeth Chriſt to
be <hi>Lord,</hi> doth confeſs that he is the object of
<hi>faith,</hi> and of <hi>divine worſhip,</hi> and that he is worthy
to be <hi>believed</hi> on, and worthy to be <hi>worſhipped,</hi> and
worthy to be <hi>praiſed,</hi> worthy that all the redeemed
of the Lord ſhould ſing unto him; that he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all divine <hi>honour,</hi> the ſame honour that is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43429:29"/>
due to the Father, the Scripture doth witneſs as
much, and therefore the very Angels are called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to worſhip him, <hi>Heb. 1. 6. When he bringeth
in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, and let
all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Now if Chriſt
had not been eternal God, it had been idolatry to
have given divine worſhip to him; but you ſee
what that faith doth that acknowledges Chriſt to
be <hi>Lord,</hi> it doth acknowledge him to be eternal
God, and acknowledge him to be <hi>infinite in power,</hi>
and in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and that he is <hi>preſent in all places,</hi>
and the object of <hi>divine honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt as Lord.</note> Now let me ſhew you in the ſecond
place, that it is neceſſary that every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that doth expect help and ſalvation by Chriſt,
ſhould come to him as the <hi>Lord:</hi> Faith ſhould
pitch upon him as omnipotent and omniſcient: I
ſay, it is neceſſary that they ſhould thus come to
him that believe, for elſe the foundation of our
faith is overthrown: There is no man that doth
deny this, can lay a right foundation of faith: no
man that doth not believe this, that he is <hi>Lord,</hi>
eternal God, can lay a right foundation, he doth not
lay that foundation which God hath laid; the
foundation which God hath laid is his Son, the
eternal God, he with whom he entred into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and made a Covenant with from eternity 
and therefore if there be any other foundation, the
foundation will not hold.</p>
               <p>And indeed Chriſt cannot be a foundation to
bear up faith, if he be not eternal God, and Lord
equal with his Father, he were not fit to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And <hi>curſed is he that truſts in man and make
fleſh his arme:</hi> And if Chriſt had not been eternal
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43429:29"/>
God, he could not be a fit foundation, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that every ſoul that comes to Chriſt ſhould
believe in him as <hi>Lord,</hi> in reſpect of that divine
<hi>worſhip</hi> that is to be given to Chriſt, elſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
worſhip Chriſt aright, nor give Chriſt that
honour that is due to him, and ſo all his worſhip is
loſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is needful in reſpect of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Chriſts <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> that men that come to
Chriſt muſt believe that he is eternal God, and one
with the Father, or elſe he cannot expect the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Chriſts ſatisfaction; for if Chriſt were
not infinite God, he could not have given ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to infinite Juſtice; if Chriſt were not God,
our ſins are not purged away, the righteouſneſs of
Chriſt is not infinite, then no covering for our
tranſgreſſions, no price then of an infinite value for
the ſaving ſouls; no vertue in his blood for the
taking away of ſin; therefore they that do blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly
deny Chriſt to be eternal God, they
muſt deny the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, and then all
men are in their ſins, and ſo like to be loſt for
ever.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, True faith muſt come to Chriſt as
<hi>Lord,</hi> or elſe we cannot have any aſſurance that he

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat it is neceſſary, that when any ſoul comes to
Chriſt, it ſhould come to him as <hi>Lord;</hi> ſo this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did look upon him, and cloſe with him, as

                  <hi>Lord over all,</hi> as he is <hi>eternal God,</hi> having the ſame

due the ſame divine honour, and who is the object

               <p>And therefore I beſeech you, Brethren, look to
it, that your faith be rightly grounded; if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

This is a groſſe miſtake,<note place="margin">A groſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the body of Chriſt.</note> a dangerous error, that
overthrows the foundation: If Chriſt did aſſume
a body, then he was not man; but the Scripture
ſaith, <hi>He took our nature,</hi> he took not the nature of
Angels, but he took the nature of man; to take
up a body is not to take up the nature of man, but
he took our nature, a ſoul and body together, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſoul and body that is the nature of man; he
took a body into union with the ſecond Perſon,
for ſo it was not only a body that Chriſt took up,
but a ſoul too, <hi>My ſoul is heavy to death,</hi> and <hi>the
ſoul of Chriſt was made an offering for ſin.</hi> So
that remember this, how true faith muſt look upon
Chriſt; firſt as <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſecondly as <hi>Man,</hi> as
one that took our nature, ſoul and body, into union
with himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:43429:32"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">The neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man and woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt as man.</note> I ſhall ſhew you, that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
that every man and woman that expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chriſt, ſhould believe that he took our
nature upon him, and then that he died in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and roſe in our nature, and ſits now in heaven
in our nature, it is neceſſary to be believed to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for</p>
               <p>Firſt of all; if this be not believed, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have any aſſurance that any man or woman
ſhall have the benefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that ſome confeſs, that he is eternal God, and
did give ſatisfaction as he was eternal God, yee
that body that he took up for a time, if he took
not the nature of man, could not ſatisfie for the
ſin of man, for juſtice muſt be ſatisfied in the
ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſt did not really take our nature,
and ſuffer in our nature, there is no ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and we can have no benefit thereby, for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
muſt be done in the ſame nature it offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is neceſſary that you ſhould <hi>believe</hi>
that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>roſe again in the ſame nature;</hi>
for your juſtification depends upon it, for if the
ſame perſon that ſuffered were not reſtored, the
ſame that was caſt into priſon, were not delivered
in a legal way, then there was no Juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now our Juſtification doth depend upon this;
when Chriſt was delivered out of priſon, then did
God abſolve him, and when Chriſt roſe again, then
did Chriſt virtually juſtifie all his elect; if the
ſame body did not riſe again, there is no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
no man hath any aſſurance, that he ſhall be
juſtified: Therefore ſee how neceſſary it is,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43429:32"/>
that you hold faſt this truth, that as the Lord
Jeſus took our nature, ſo he retaines our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Yea it is neceſſary, that you believe Chriſt
retaines our nature <hi>now in heaven;</hi> for if you doe
not, why then he hath not perfected his office as
High Prieſt, he hath done but part of his work, and
ſo his people be but imperfectly ſaved: The high
Prieſt he firſt killed the ſacrifice, and the ſame
perſon that offered ſacrifice went into the <hi>holy
place,</hi> to make interceſſion, and to preſent the
blood of ſprinkling: Now if Chriſt did offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and did not aſcend in the ſame nature in
which he offered the ſacrifice, he did not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfill his work as high Prieſt.</p>
               <p>And know this, that if Chriſt be not in heaven
in our nature, there is no coming for us, there is no
way for our coming to God, no way for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with God, for it is not poſſible that creatures
in this ſtate ſhould have immediate communion
with God, without a middle perſon, a Mediator:
Now if Chriſt be not in heaven in our nature, and
ſo we might go to God in and by him, there is no
way of coming to God, and no way of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, to ſpeak a word to the next
particular.</p>
               <p>There are two things in that confeſſion, that
Chriſt is <hi>the ſon of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, To cloſe with his humility, and that is an
incouragement to come to Chriſt: So</p>
               <p>Secondly, She looks to his office, and cloſes
with his office; when ſhe ſayes, he is the ſon of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
ſhe acknowledges, that</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:43429:33"/>
Firſt of all, that he is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> deſigned and

his people: O Lord, thou ſon of <hi>David,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

art he that art deſigned, and appointed, and ſet a
part by God, as <hi>David</hi> was, to be a Prieſt, and to
be a Prophet; and thus faith muſt look upon
Chriſt, him that the Father hath ſealed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be a Mediator, or elſe he can never
cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then ſhe does not only look upon him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
one that is appointed by God the Father, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned

               <p>Secondly, But as one that was <hi>fitted</hi> for this
work, he was appointed by the Father to ſave his
people, and as he was appointed, ſo he was fitted
every way for this work;<note place="margin">Something to be read in that name, <hi>thou ſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
                  </note> for ſurely there was

Chriſt: As</p>
               <p>Firſt of all; this is held forth when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

a mighty Prince, a mighty Saviour, able to ſave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
the uttermoſt, that he is even like to <hi>David,</hi>

<hi>David,</hi> whom the Lord gave a great deal of
ſtrength and courage, he purſued after the Lion
and after the Bear, and pulled the Sheep out of
the Lions mouth; ſhe eyed the ſtrength of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
if <hi>David</hi> do ſo great things, Jeſus Chriſt
the ſon of <hi>David</hi> he can do greater things, he can
ſlay the Lion, and kill the Bear, and ſmite the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>
the Devil, and his inſtruments.</p>
               <p>And then in that name of Chriſt <hi>[thou ſon of
David]</hi> there was this that might incourage her,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43429:33"/>
the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
it her ſelf, <hi>David</hi> was a merciful man, full of
compaſſion towards his enemies, full of patience,
full of long-ſuffering; he ſpared <hi>Shimei</hi> when he
curſed him; and how did he carry himſelf towards
<hi>Saul,</hi> when God put him into his hand, and when
his ſervants would have had him taken away his
life? God forbid, (ſaith he) ſo Chriſt is full of
compaſſion, ſurely ſhe ſaw a great deal of the
compaſſion of Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> a merciful man, and
ſo is Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then ſhe might ſee, and ſo may we, the
<hi>meekneſs</hi> of Chriſt, not only mercy, but abundance
of meekneſs in Chriſt: <hi>David</hi> was a great
Prince, and yet <hi>Davids</hi> heart was not lift up with
his condition, though his condition was lift up,
yet his heart was not lift up, no, he carried it very
lowly and meekly with his people, he dealt with
them as gently as a tender ſhepheard, <hi>1 Chron.
28. 2. Then David the King ſtood up upon his
feet, and ſaid, hear me my brethren, and my people.</hi>
Now ſurely this woman could not but ſee the
<hi>meekneſs</hi> that was in Chriſt, <hi>David</hi> was well known
to be a merciful and meek Prince, and if ſo much
meekneſs in <hi>David,</hi> O then what meekneſs in
the ſon of <hi>David?</hi> Surely he deals gently with his
people, this was her incouragement.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Now therefore to ſhut up all, Brethren,
let us take notice, how little true faith there is in
the world; if true faith comes thus to Chriſt, as
<hi>Lord,</hi> and as the <hi>ſon of David,</hi> looks to the <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>humanity</hi> of Chriſt, and cloſeth with
both, looks to the <hi>offices</hi> of Chriſt, and as one that
is <hi>appointed</hi> of God, and <hi>fitted</hi> for this work; if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43429:34"/>
this be required to true faith, O how little true
faith is in the world? How many are there that
doe confeſs Chriſt to be true Man? Ah, but they
deny him to be true God, deny him to be the ſame
Eſſence with the Father, and Subſtance with the
Father, the ſame Power with the Father.</p>
               <p>Nay truly, ſuch a confeſſion of Chriſt, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the confeſſion of the Devil, whatever ſuch
men may pretend to have the name of Chriſtians,
it is below the confeſſion of Devils, and will
leave men as low as the Devils; the Devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Chriſt to be the Son of God, and therefore
where that is denied, ſuch men go not ſo far as the
Devils.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others that ſay, he is true God, but
either deny that he <hi>took our nature,</hi> or that he doth
<hi>retain our nature:</hi> Now how contrary is that to
the Scripture? And how deſtructive is it to the
faith of Gods people, and all the comforts of
Gods people? There is no hope of juſtification,
if Chriſt be not riſen, and no hope of coming to
Heaven, if Chriſt be not there in our nature; and
no poſſibility for poor creatures to go to God; if
the Mediator be not now in Heaven, there is no
coming there: The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt,
<hi>1 Tim. 2. 5. For there is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi>
There is one Mediator, he does not ſay, there was
one Mediator that laid down his life, but there is
<hi>one Mediator, the man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He does not
ſay, that <hi>was the man,</hi> but <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus is
now the Mediator;</hi> and therefore ſuch as do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny that Chriſt did take our nature, or that
he doth <hi>retain our nature,</hi> and <hi>roſe in our nature,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:43429:34"/>
and <hi>aſCended in our nature,</hi> doth mightily help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the deſign of the Devil; he alwayes had a
deſign to overthrow this foundation of faith, and
ſuch men are the Devils chief Inſtruments, he
knows, that if Chriſt did not riſe in that body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if he can take away that, he knows that all
preaching is in vain, and faith is in vain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Phariſees, when put on by the Devil, they
gave the Souldiers money to ſay, that <hi>his Diſciples
ſtole him away:</hi> Surely the Devil he knew that
doctrine was of great concernment, and therefore
they were put upon to ſay, his <hi>Diſciples ſtole him
away;</hi> and ſuch men as deny Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they take the Devils hire, and their faith will
be but the faith of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and will leave
them ſhort of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And in the third and laſt place: How
may are there that many confeſs both theſe? that
may confeſs. Chriſt is <hi>God,</hi> that he is <hi>Lord,</hi> and that
he is <hi>Man,</hi> true man, and yet not look unto Chriſt,
as he is fit every way for that work, as fitted with
<hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> for that great
work of perfecting his peoples ſalvation?</p>
               <p>As you deſire to have faith that is of the right
ſtamp; would you have it rightly grounded, and
have it laid upon ſuch a foundation as God hath
laid, and on ſuch a foundation as will hold? O
then look to this womans confeſſion; look up to
the Lord to make ſuch a diſcovery of Chriſt to
your ſouls, that Chriſt may be diſcovered to you
<hi>as Lord,</hi> and that you may cloſe with him <hi>as man;
God in our nature,</hi> ſatisfied in <hi>our nature,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>interceſſion in our nature;</hi> and look upon him
as one <hi>appointed</hi> by God the Father; for therein
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43429:35"/>
lay a great deal of a Chriſtians comfort, when the
ſoul comes to eye this Mediator as one appointed
by God, and one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itted every way for it, full of
<hi>mercy,</hi> and full of <hi>power;</hi> if the Lord ſhall make
ſuch a diſcovery of Chriſt to your ſouls, ſo as to
cauſe you to lean your ſouls upon him for life and
ſalvation, this will be found to be faith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built, this is the faith of Gods Elect.</p>

my complaints before him, and ſhewed him my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
And when was it? It was in a time of great
diſtreſs: Ver. 3. <hi>When my ſpirit was overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within me:</hi> I went to God, and made my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
known to him, I went not to the creature,
but to God. And <hi>Jonah,</hi> he was in a ſad diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
condition, and yet faith brought him to apply
himſelf to the Lord, when as he was in that ſad
eſtate, <hi>Jonah 2. 1, 2. Then Jonah prayed to the
Lord his God out of the fiſhes belly, and ſaid, I cryed
by reaſon of mine affliction unto the Lord, out of the
belly of hell cryed I, and thou heardeſt my voice.</hi> He
was ſo low in his own apprehenſion as was poſſible
for him to be; <hi>in the belly of hell:</hi> And what did
he do? <hi>I cried to the Lord;</hi> he applied himſelf to
the Lord, and ſpread his ſad condition before the
Lord, and he did not looſe his labour, Thou Lord
heardeſt me.</p>
               <p>Now for the grounds of the Point,<note place="margin">The grounds of the Point.</note> That faith
will teach a ſoul to go to Chriſt, and make his
complaint to Chriſt in all his affliction, for faith
diſcovers to a ſoul, that <hi>all afflictions are from God,</hi>
the Lords hand is in all the croſſes and troubles,
and whatſoever is matter of complaint, the hand
of God is in it, <hi>Is there any evil in the city and</hi> I
<hi>have not done it?</hi> ſaith the Lord by the Prophet
<hi>Amos:</hi> Is there any evil of affliction that I have
not brought upon a people? As to the evil of ſin,
that is not from God, for that is no being; that is a
privation, but as for affliction, all the affliction that
doth berall the children of men, it is from the
hand of God; and upon this ground <hi>Eliphaz</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth
<hi>Job</hi> to apply himſelf to God, <hi>Job 5. 6,
8. Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43429:37"/>
does trouble ſpring out of the ground; <hi>I</hi> would ſpeak
unto God, and unto God would <hi>I</hi> commit my cauſe.</hi>
Trouble doth not ſpring from the ground, it is not
from ſecond cauſes, whatſoever trouble the people
of God meet withall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>any of the ſons of men,
it ſprings not from the duſt: Whence then? It
is from the hand of God, there is a ſecret wheel,
a great wheel of providence, that ſets all on work,
ſecond cauſes cannot move if that great wheel
does not move; ſo then when this comes to be
reallized to the ſoul, as faith doth diſcover it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God hath ſpoken it, that trouble is from
God, whether inward or outward; therefore it
will carry the ſoul unto God, and make the ſoul
apply it ſelf to God and Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith doth diſcover, that as all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are from God, and makes the ſoul ſee the
hand of God in every ſtroke, ſo it doth diſcover,
that the end of all afflictions is to <hi>carry the ſoul
to God;</hi> that is the end of all afflictions, to bring
God and the ſoul nigher together; God doth not
love to have any of his people at a diſtance from
him, and therefore he ſends forth affliction to
bring them nigher to himſelf: And therefore in
<hi>Hoſea 5. 15.</hi> I <hi>will go and return to my place, till
they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face;
in their affliction they will ſeek me early:</hi> He
brings affliction for this very end, that they may
draw nigh to him: And in chap. 6. 1. you may
ſee the fruit of their affliction, <hi>Come and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal
us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up.</hi> This
is the fruit of their affliction, they were brought
nigher to God. God will have his people injoy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43429:38"/>
more communion with him, dwell with him, and
make them more conformable to him, more like to
himſelf; and therefore many times he layes great
and ſore afflictions upon them: For when the
Saints ſhall be in ſuch a ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and ſuch a condition,
as nothing ſhall come betwixt God and them,
when they ſhall ſo dwell in God, as never to goe
out from God, when there ſhall come no ſin, no
corruption betwixt God and them, then there
ſhall be no more affliction, then the Lord God
ſhall wipe away teares from the faces of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
no more ſorrow and ſighing, now the end is
attained, when they are gotten ſo nigh to God, as
nothing can come betwixt God and them: Now
when faith diſcovers this, that it is the end of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to bring the ſoul nigher to God, it puts the
ſoul upon it, in its affliction, to return and apply it
ſelf to God alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faith will make a ſoul come to Chriſt,
and Chriſt alone, in diſtreſs; for faith doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that the help of the creature is in vain in time
of diſtreſs; it is faith that doth reallize to the
ſoul the <hi>vanity</hi> of the creature, and that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot help in the day of diſtreſs: And
therefore the Pſalmiſt cries out, <hi>Pſal 60. 11.
Help Lord, for vain is the help of man.</hi> Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help, and therefore he applies himſelf to God
alone; <hi>Help Lord, for vain is the help of man.</hi>
Till the ſoul ſees that vain is the help of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it will not in good earneſt cry, <hi>Help Lord;</hi>
faith ſhews the ſoul, that in vain is ſalvation hoped
for from the hils, and from the multitude of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
in vain is ſalvation hoped for from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
from great men, the higheſt of all: There is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43429:38"/>
many a poor ſoul can tell you by ſad experience,
and ſay it by ſad experience, in vain have I ſought
help from men, and cried to men, and ſpread my
complaints before men, and therefore it is good
for me to draw nigh to God; for if you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the ſons of men, you ſhall ſee how fruitleſs
a thing it is, for a poor ſoul in diſtreſs to apply it
ſelf to man, and to go and pour out his complaints
to man; he may ſpeak to ſuch men as are not at
all ſenſible of what he ſpeaks; he may tell a ſad
relation of his ſufferings and burdens, and yet not
at all affect the heart of him that he ſpeaks to:
There are ſome ſuch men in the world, nay very
many, that regard not the affliction of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that
are altogether inſenſible of the burden that lay
upon other poor creatures, that hath no compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and cannot be affected. It is ſaid of <hi>Gallio,</hi>
that <hi>he cared for none of thoſe things;</hi> when as
they made complaints of things of Religion, he
cared for none of thoſe things; and ſo when ſome
come and make complaints of their burdens, they
care for none of thoſe things: And thus it was
with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that lay at the rich mans gate, it is
very like he made many complaints, ſhewed him
his ſorrow and ſores, but his heart was not at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the very dogs had more pitty upon him,
they came and licked his ſores: And ſo it is many
times, when we make our complaints to men, they
regard not.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, Sometimes when we make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to men, though there be ſome pitty, and
ſome compaſſion in them, and they will expreſſe it
in good words, yet very little help and aſſiſtance
will many men afford; they will ſeem to pitty and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43429:39"/>
have compaſſion, but there are ſome men that will
do very little to the relief of a poor creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
diſtreſs, that comes and makes complaints of
his burdens: The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of ſome
ſuch, chap. 2. 15, 16. <hi>If a brother or ſiſter be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and deſtitute of daily food, and one of you ſay
unto him, depart in peace, be you warmed, and filled;
notwithſtanding you give him not thoſe things that
are needful for the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Alas,
it is in vain to make complaints to ſuch, what doth
it avail? It may be ſome will pitty with good
words, be you warmed, and filled, but they give
them not thoſe things which are needful for
the body; thus many a poor creature looſes his
labour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When a poor creature makes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to man, and cries to man, it may be he ſhall
make complaints to thoſe that do pitty him, and
would relieve him with all their heart, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their power to relieve; and ſo if a poor
man that wants the things of this life, it may be
he goes and makes his complaints to another, he
pitties him, and would help him, but he that hath a
will hath not power many times, and it is not in
his hand to do it, and he cannot uphold anothers
eſtate but he muſt break his own; many times it
is ſo. And ſo when they come and make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the weakneſs and infirmities of their
bodies, it may be they are affected, and they would
help; ah, but it is beyond their power: And ſo
when a poor ſoul comes and complains of diſtreſs
of mind, and ſhew the wounds of his ſpirit, and
lay them open, it may be godly friends may pitty
you, and deſire to help you, but their hand is to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:43429:39"/>
ſhort to carry the plaiſter to your heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and to cauſe it to ſtick there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after all it will go away unſatisfied; in all
theſe cauſes they that would help you if they
could, they may ſay as the King of <hi>Iſrael, 2 King.
6. 26, 27.</hi> the woman there comes and makes a
ſad complaint in the time of famine, at verſe 26.
<hi>And as the King of Iſrael was paſſing by upon the
wall, there cried a woman unto him, ſaying help, my
Lord, O King.</hi> And what ſayes the King to her?
verſe 27. <hi>And he ſaid, if the Lord do not help
thee, whence ſhall</hi> I <hi>help thee?</hi> Alas, my bowels are
towards thee, but if the Lord does not help thee,
in vain is the help of man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When you make your complaints to
men, ſometimes it falls out ſo, that inſtead of eaſe
from under your burdens, your burdens are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
ſometimes men may add to the burdens
of the afflicted through unskilfulneſs, not knowing
how to ſpeak to them, and how to carry it towards
them; yea ſometimes men may aggravate the
burdens of the afflicted, when they make their
complaints, wilfully, through pride, and diſdain,
and covetouſneſs: And thus it was when <hi>David</hi>
ſent to <hi>Nabal,</hi> he was in a great ſtrait for proviſion,
and he ſent to <hi>Nabal</hi> in his ſtrait for relief, and he
ſent him a churliſh anſwer; <hi>Who is David, and
the ſon of Jeſſe?</hi> I <hi>know him not; ſhall</hi> I <hi>ſend
my corn and my oxen that</hi> I <hi>have killed for my
ſhearers, and give it to him,</hi> I <hi>know him not.</hi> And
you know what <hi>Judas</hi> did meet withall, when he
went to the Phariſees, and ſaid, I <hi>have ſinned in
betraying the innocent bloud: What is that to us?</hi>
a bargain is a bargain, <hi>if you have ſinned look you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43429:40"/>
to that:</hi> Whereas if he had gone to Chriſt with that
complaint, he might have had comfort, but he went
to them, and they ſpake that which aggravated his
ſorrow, and he goes and makes away himſelf. So
that, I ſay, in time of affliction faith cauſeth a ſoul
to go to Chriſt, for it doth diſcover what man
is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is this ground of the Point,
Faith will make a ſoul go to Chriſt alone, for it
diſcovers to the ſoul, that in Chriſt there is <hi>all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi>
to help it, there is all in Chriſt that may
pitty him, and for the helping of him; it is not
in the creature, but it is to be found in Chriſt, for
Chriſt is furniſhed with compaſſion, there are bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of compaſſion towards his poor creatures in
diſtreſſe; it is an impoſſible thing that Chriſt
ſhould be inſenſible as men are; you may ſpread
your complaints before ſome men, and they never
be moved no more then the ſtones in the ſtreet, but
the Lord Jeſus he is not without compaſſion, great
bowels of compaſſion towards his people, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be inſenſible of any burden that lay upon a
poor creature that comes to him, <hi>In all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
he is afflicted,</hi> he bears our ſickneſs, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
our ſorrows; Chriſt he feels the weight of all
affliction, and ſorrow, and burdens that do at any
time lie upon his people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As Chriſt hath <hi>compaſſion,</hi> ſo he hath a
<hi>will;</hi> he is alwayes willing to do good to poor
creatures that come to him: Men (as you have
heard) they are not alwayes willing, they may give
you a parcel of good words, but give you not thoſe
things that are needful: Now Chriſt he never puts
off his people with good words, though one good
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43429:40"/>
word from Chriſt be more worth then all that
men can do for you; but Chriſt he will not give
you good words alone, but as he opens his mouth
in grace, ſo he opens his hand in mercy; he opens
his mouth and his hand at the ſame time, and he is
very willing to relieve, and therefore it is, that he
calls poor creatures to him; you may ſee his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
by the invitation that he gives to all poor
creatures that are under any diſtreſs; <hi>Come to me
all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and</hi> I <hi>will
give you reſt:</hi> Whatever the burden be, whether
the burden of ſin or ſorrow. Chriſt makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
you have his invitation; <hi>Come to me
and I will give you reſt;</hi> and <hi>call upon me in the
time of trouble, and</hi> I <hi>will deliver.</hi> How doth this
teſtifie the willingneſs of Chriſt to relieve his
poor creatures?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He hath not only compaſſion, but he
alſo hath <hi>power</hi> in his hand, Chriſt can do it, he is
<hi>able</hi> to do what he pleaſeth; <hi>Thou haſt done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou pleaſeſt in heaven, and earth, and in all
deep places:</hi> The deepeſt affliction and ſorrow
that any of his people may ſink into, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
is able to ſtretch forth his hand and help them,
he hath all ſtore of proviſion in his houſe, there is
an infinite treaſure of mercy, all mercies are laid
up in Chriſt, it ſhall not break his eſtate to uphold
your eſtates, for all the creatures in heaven and
earth are the Lords, the heavens and the earth are
the Lords, and the fulneſs that are in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is power in Chriſts hand to relieve his
people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt cannot aggravate ſorrow and
affliction; he will not aggravate the ſorrow and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43429:41"/>
affliction of any of his people that come to him;
Chriſt will never ſay to a poor ſoul, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
to <hi>Judas, ſee thou to that:</hi> When a ſoul comes
and ſayes, Lord I have ſinned, Chriſt never gave
ſuch an anſwer, <hi>ſee thou to that;</hi> he never did, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can he, aggravate the ſorrows and burdens of
poor creatures that come to him. Now when
faith diſcovers this to the ſoul, and ſhews that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are from the Lord, and ſhews, that all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are for that end, to carry the ſoul higher
unto God, and ſhews, that all the help of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is vain, and ſhews, that there is an infinite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of grace and mercy, all-ſufficiency of grace
in God and Chriſt to relieve at all times, and in
all ſtraits; theſe diſcoveries that faith makes,
will carry the ſoul to Chriſt, and make the ſoul
apply it ſelf to Chriſt, and cry to him, and ſpread
his complaints before him in time of great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>A word or two by way of Application.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all:<note place="margin">Application.</note> If it be ſo that faith carry the ſoul
to God and Chriſt alone in time of diſtreſ, what
ſhall we think then, when men by their affliction,
and in their affliction, are carried further off from
God? And yet ſo it is with many, their afflictions
ſet them at a greater diſtance from Chriſt, many a
man is hardened by his affliction, and ſo ſet at a
greater diſtance from God by that trouble and
diſtreſſe he hath upon him, afflictions drive many
a man from God, make him run away from God,
run any where then unto God; there is many
will run to the creature, and their eye is not to the
Lord the holy One of Iſrael, they run to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to comfort them, run to the world, and run
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43429:41"/>
into the way of their luſt, but apply not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Lord in the day of their diſtreſs:
You know that <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ran to the Devil when
he was in diſtreſs, ſo far was he from running nigh
to God in diſtreſs, that he run to the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſends to the gods of the Nations, to know
whether he ſhould recover or not; This is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
that there is no ſeed of faith in ſuch a ſoul,
for where there is faith but in the ſeed of it, the
leaſt ſeed of faith, it will make a ſoul at leaſt to
be looking to Chriſt, and crying after Chriſt in the
day of diſtreſs, it will at leaſt cry unto Chriſt,
though there may be many workings of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and temptations, and many diſtempers of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may be bubling up in time of affliction, yet
faith will carry the ſoul to look towards Chriſt,
and cry after him, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did when he was in
the belly of hell, I <hi>ſaid</hi> I <hi>am caſt out of thy ſight,
yet will I look toward thy holy temple:</hi> He applies
himſelf to Chriſt: And ſo a gracious heart will
be looking to Chriſt, and the more faith, the more
it will look, and the louder it will-cry.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Let it be a word of exhortation,
O that it might provoke us all to deal more with
God and Chriſt in the time of our affliction and
diſtreſs!, O that we might cry more to him,
and pour out our complaints more to him! as
this poor woman did; ſhe comes and cries, <hi>O
Lord, thou ſon of David:</hi> Poor ſouls are apt to
look to the creature in the day of diſtreſs, and
think ſuch and ſuch creatures can comfort;
<hi>Surely my bed ſhall comfort me, and my couch
give me eaſe,</hi> ſayes <hi>Job;</hi> but he found no ſuch

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43429:43"/>
creature, I will go and make my complaint to him,
he will give me ſome refreſhment; poor ſouls are
very apt under their burdens to go up &amp; down and
ſcatter their complaints: Ah, but they take not
the right courſe of going to Chriſt, and crying to
him, and pouring out the complaints of their ſouls
before him; and therefore it is, that when they
goe to men they meet with little ſatisfaction, and
little relief and comfort, and their ſpirits are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with diſcontent and diſſatisfaction, when as
they meet with ſuch men ſometimes as have no
compaſſion at all in them, and ſometimes meet
with good words and no more, and ſometimes
meet with ſuch as pitty them, but have no power,
and ſometimes meet with ſome that will aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the affliction; and juſt it is with God it
ſhould be ſo, when we will not look to the Rock:
O that ſuch diſappointments might reach us to
look to the Lord, we have thought that this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might eaſe, but we have met with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
O that theſe diſappointments might teach
us to go to Chriſt! as this woman: And thus the
poor man did for his ſon, that he would caſt out
the unclean ſpirit; <hi>I went,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to thy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and they tryed to caſt out the unclean ſpirit, but
could not;</hi> and then he comes to Chriſt, I <hi>have
been with thy Diſciples, and they could not caſt out
the unclean ſpirit, but thou canſt do it,</hi> and Chriſt
did do it: And O that theſe diſappointments
might teach us to goe more to Chriſt, and make
our complaints more to him in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, What? may we not
go to our friends, is it not lawful to go to men when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43429:43"/>
we are under preſſures and burdens, either of the
outward or inward man? and to ſuch and ſuch
as may relieve us, may we not apply our ſelves to
them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer yes; We may apply our
ſelves to men, but take heed we do it in Gods

do it in Gods way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, firſt of all, when you do it as
an Ordinance of God, when we make uſe of the
advice and help of others, and go to others as to
an Ordinance of God, then we are not out of
Gods way, when we do it in obedience to the
Will and Commandement of God and Chriſt;
when one that is wounded in ſpirit ſhall apply
himſelf to thoſe that are godly, that hath the
mind of Chriſt, in obedience to the command
of Chriſt, <hi>Confeſs your ſins one to another, and
pray one for another:</hi> Now if out of obedience
to Chriſt I go and confeſs my ſins to one that is
godly, and deſire him to pray for me, when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our ſelves to men, as an Ordinance of God,
then we are in Gods way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When we ſhall keep the eye of our
ſouls upon God alone for help; when we apply our
ſelves to men for any help, and yet ſhall keep our
eye upon God, and look upon God as the great
moving cauſe, look upon God as the fountain of
all relief and comfort, and ſhall look upon the
creature only as Gods Inſtrument, this is but a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43429:44"/>
pipe, and an empty one too, if God do not fill it,
when as the eye is thus upon God, and eye God
as principal in all that comfort and relief that we
expect, and look upon the creature as the means,
then we may apply our ſelves to the creature, and
not out of Gods way.</p>
               <p>And a man may know whether he keeps his eye
upon God,<note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we keep our eye upon God.</note> when as he does apply himſelf to the
creature (thus) Are your expectations from the
creature or from God? If a mans eye be upon God,
then he will not expect much from the creature,
and applies himſelf to the creatures, becauſe they
are means, and becauſe it is an Ordinance, but dare
not expect much.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a man doe meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and he do apply himſelf to the creature
in Gods way, diſappointments will not add any
great trouble or vexation to that man or woman,
though he meet with little refreſhment; nay,
though inſtead of help and refreſhment, he
ſhould meet with an addition of his ſorrow and
trouble, yet if in Gods way he will not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
becauſe his eye is upon God, and I ſee
it is not the will of the Lord I ſhould yet have
comfort, and why ſhould I fret my ſelf, ſeeing
the Inſtrument is but an empty pipe, and no
creature can refreſh me if the Lord doe not
refreſh me? And thus you have ſeen when
we are in Gods way, and when out of
Gods way, in applying our ſelves to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and looking to the creature for help, and for
relief.</p>
               <p>And O that this might teach us to go more to
God, and apply our ſelves more to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:43429:44"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſome poor ſoul will ſay,
Well, <hi>I</hi> have not only gone to the creature, but <hi>I</hi>
have applyed my ſelf to God, and yet truly <hi>I</hi> meet
with little refreſhment, <hi>I</hi> have cryed to Chriſt in the
time of my affliction, and yet my burden doth
continue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, To this I anſwer: It may be when thou
haſt come to Chriſt, thou haſt complained of thy
burden, and of thy affliction, but thou haſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of thy ſin, thou haſt not complained of
that which is the greateſt matter of complaint;
and if thou haſt at any time looked more to
thy burden and affliction, and haſt not complained
of that which is the greateſt matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
no wonder then though thou haſt met
with no eaſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let me ſay, it may be thou haſt
brought thy complaints and ſpread them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, yet thou haſt not left thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with the Lord; many a ſoul comes with
a great burden, ah, but it carries it away, and
does not leave it with the Lord; and if the
burden be not left with the Lord, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that we have no eaſe: Chriſt is willing
we ſhould leave our burdens with him,
and in ſo doing we ſhall finde refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And let me ſay further, that it may
be the Lord hath heard thy cry, and thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
but thou art not aware of it, thou haſt
not taken notice of it, through unthankfulneſſe
thou haſt not obſerved that which the Lord hath
done; the Lord at leaſt, he hath thus farre heard
thee, that he hath ſupported thy ſpirit under
thy burden, and thou haſt been kept up, ſo
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43429:45"/>
that thy ſoul hath not failed, and thy ſpirit hath
not fainted under thy burden; and truly this
is a great mercy and worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of: And this is the difference between your
going to God and the creature. Oh that
we might be invited by this to apply our ſelves
more to Chriſt in time of diſtreſſe, and ſpread
our complaints before Chriſt, for in going to the
creature many times the ſpirit is wounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ah, but in going to God the ſpirit ſhall be
ſupported, though Chriſt doe not give out a
preſent anſwer, yet the heart ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
under all its burdens, but now in going to
man, many times the heart and the ſpirit it is
wounded, by thoſe diſappointments that we meet
withall, while we expect that from the creature
which it cannot do.</p>
               <p>Two things only I ſhall propound to urge this
duty upon you, to make us more in going to
Chriſt, and leſs to the creature.</p>
               <p>It is a great ſin and folly, when as we leave
Chriſt and goe to the creature in the day of our
diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a great ſin; for what do we then,
but ſet up the creature in the room of Chriſt?
You know how ſenſible <hi>Jacob</hi> was of this evil, he
lookt upon it as a great evil, when as <hi>Rachel</hi> came
to him, ſhe wanted children, ſhe comes to her
Husband, <hi>Give me children or</hi> I <hi>die:</hi> O what ſayes
he? <hi>Am</hi> I <hi>in Gods ſtead? Can</hi> I <hi>give thee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</hi>
When as ſhe came and made her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and murmured becauſe ſhe had
not the mercy of children, ſhe goes to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
ſets up <hi>Jacob</hi> in Gods ſtead; and ſo when we are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43429:45"/>
under our burdens, and make our complaints to
the creature and not to God, why the creature
may ſay as <hi>Jacob,</hi> am I in Gods ſtead?</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a world of <hi>folly</hi> in it, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God in time of diſtreſs to the creature.
It is a piece of gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> folly for a man to go from
the fountain to the broken ciſtern, to leave the
fountain and think a broken ciſtern ſhould ſupply
him: It is a great deal of folly for a man to go to
a deaf man, one that cannot hear, pour out his
complaints, &amp; expect that he ſhould ſpeak a word
of refreſhment; ſo much folly there is when we
go to the creature, and do not apply our ſelves to
God. If a man ſhould go to a begger, one that
hath no food or rayment, and a man ſhould ſpend
a deal of time in asking food and rayment; and if
he do not give it go away railing, what a deal of
folly were it? And ſo a great deal of Folly there
is, when we do go to the creature, and do not go
to God; we go to them that are poor and naked,
and forſake God, that hath all ſtore of proviſion
and mercy laid up in himſelf: O that the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of our ſin and folly, in going to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
might cauſe us at all times in our diſtreſſe to
go to God, as this poor woman did, and cry to him
that is the Lord.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:43429:46"/>
The Doctrine was this:
<q>That whereever there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſeed of faith in any

ſoul cry unto him and take hold of his mercy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We divided it into three Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That faith will carry the ſoul to Chriſt in
time of affliction, and make it ſeek to Chriſt, and
Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Afflictions when they are great and
ſtrong, will raiſe ſtrong cries.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A gracious heart pleads only mercy
and free grace, only takes hold of mercy, and
looks not at all to his own worthineſs.</p>
               <p>I ſpake to the firſt of theſe the laſt day.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſpeak to the ſecond Propoſition;
this woman was in great afflictions and diſtreſſe,
her daughter was poſſeſſed with a devil, and that
was a ſore burden to her ſpirit: Now this great
affliction makes her cry loud, for the Text doth
not ſay, ſhe came &amp; intreated, and beſought him,
but the Text ſayes, ſhe came and <hi>cryed</hi> unto him,
ſaying, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then obſerve this:
Strong afflictions will raiſe ſtrong cries,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> even in
Gods own people.</p>
               <p>In the opening of the Point, I ſhall ſhew you
two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a cry of the fleſh, and a cry
of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43429:47"/>
Secondly, That great and ſore afflictions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
continuance may raiſe both theſe cries, it will
make both the fleſh to cry, and the Spirit to cry.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The cry of the fleſh what it is.</note> There is a cry of the fleſh, and that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p>It is either a natural cry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſenſe which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath of the burden and affliction which is
upon it: Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a ſinful cry, which is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with diſorder: I ſay, the cry of the fleſh it is
either meerly natural, or ſinful; the fleſh is weak,
it is an emblem of weakneſs, and is weak indeed,
and a little affliction will make the fleſh to cry,
the Lord remembred that man is but as duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wind.<note place="margin">The firſt cry of the fleſh.</note> Now the fleſh may cry out, and
may complain, and yet may not ſin in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
it is true indeed, when a man or woman
ſhall cry out of a little affliction, when the hand
of God doth but touch him, and then cry out with
great cries &amp; ſtrong cries, when as the affliction is
but little, that diſcovers want of wiſdom, and want
of ſtrength; but now when the affliction is very
great, ſore and urgent, and the fleſh doth cry out
through the frailty, there may be an expreſſion of
complaint, and yet not ſinful. <hi>Job</hi> in his great
afflictions made many complaints, poured out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrong cries, and yet in many of his complaints
he ſinned not, <hi>Job 6. 1, 2, 3. O that my grief
were thoroughly weighed! it would appear heavier
then the ſand of the ſea.</hi> Yea you ſhall find
that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, having taken
our fleſh, and the frailties of our fleſh, (for he
took our humane frailties, but no ſinful frailtie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and in the dayes of his fleſh he <hi>cryed,</hi> his great
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43429:47"/>
affliction made him cry out, he put <hi>up his cries
with tears and ſupplications in the dayes of his
fleſh;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb. 5. 7.</hi> And in
<hi>Pſalm 22.</hi> (which Pſalm is a Prophecy of Chriſt)
he cryes out bitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>My God, my God; why haſt
thou forſaken me? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hy art thou ſo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> Strong
cries, and yet no ſin in Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that the
fleſh may cry and yet not ſin; for grace when it
comes into the ſoul, doth not deſtroy nature, it
doth not make man inſenſible, and the ſpirit
inſenſible, but it allows the fleſh to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to cry out of his burdens, ſo it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond cry of the fleſh.</note> There is another cry of the fleſh
that is raiſed by ſore afflictions, and that is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cry; now this ſinful cry you ſhall know it
thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">How to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cry of the fleſh be ſinful.</note> It ſprings from pride, it will make a
man cry out through pride of heart, he cannot
bear his burden, nor ſubmit to the hand of God
through pride of heart: When a creature ſtands
upon it, to juſtifie himſelf and accuſe God, calls
God to an account, Why am I thus? And what
am I worſe then others? And why ſhould God
take me out from all others to make me an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to all others? What have I done? And what
is my ſin more then others? When a creature
will not ſubmit to God in his afflictions, but
charge God fooliſhly; and when as he quarrels
with his affliction, if any affliction but this I could
have born it, but as for this affliction, my ſpirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear it. O here is a cry that is raiſed by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but it is a ſinful cry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43429:48"/>
Secondly, There is a cry in affliction that doth
ſpring from impatiency, and that is a ſinful cry,
when a man or woman ſhall cry out with a great
cry, and make a great lamentation, and yet their
burden but an ordinary bur<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> only they make it
great through impatiency, no<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that the affliction is
ſo in it ſelf, if the Lord had given a heart to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
patiently under it; but there is many a poor
creature ſtruggles with his affliction, as a young
beaſt unaccuſtomed to the yoak, the yoak is eaſie,
but by ſtruggling and ſtriving it pinches and makes
it cry out; and ſo a man by ſtriving under the yoak
of the Lord, though it be <hi>Jobs</hi> counſel, that it is
good to bear the yoak, yet it throught impatience
cryes out; this is a ſinful cry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That is a ſinful cry that ſprings from
unbelief, and is accompanied with unbelief; when
as a man or woman in time of affliction ſhall give
way to hard thoughts of God; whatever cry is
accompanied with unbelief, is a ſinful cry: Yet
this is the caſe of many, they cannot perſwade
themſelves that there is any love in the heart of
God towards them, and any love in ſuch an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I cannot believe it, that there ſhould be love in
ſuch an affliction, that God ſhould lay ſuch a heavy
burden upon me, and have any love to me; when it
cries out thus with unbelieving cries, this is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cry: And ſo when a man cannot be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Lord ſhould make a good end with
him in affliction: O ſure I ſhall periſh one day,
and fall by the hand of this affliction, I ſhall be
broken all to pieces, and never be able to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my burden; when as the ſoul is thus filled with
unbelieving diſpairing thoughts, concerning God
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43429:48"/>
and concerning the end of his affliction, and ſo
cry out in unbelief,<note place="margin">Grounds why there are ſinful cries in Gods own people.</note> this is a ſinful cry.</p>
               <p>Firſt, And again, great and ſore afflictions may
occaſion ſuch cries, even ſinful cries, as the cry of
unbelief and impatiencies, and that upon this
ground; there are remainders of corruption in
the beſt heart, there is ſinful fleſh as well as ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Great afflictions do expoſe Gods own
people to great temptations; many times they
go together, great afflictions and great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for the Devil ſeeks his opportunity to doe
miſchief, as the Lord waits to be gracious, ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
waits to doe miſchief: Many times in great
afflictions, when the waters are high, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will aſſault; God makes uſe of affliction to
make his people ſeek him early; but now the
Devil he waits to make the ſoul cry out with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cry, and many times the Lord ſuffers him to
prevail: But this cry of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>
was not the cry of pride, impatience, and
unbelief, but her cry was the cry of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us examine what that cry of
the ſpirit is,<note place="margin">What the cry of the Spirit is.</note> which the Lord doth raiſe in the
hearts of his people in he day of great afflictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It carries the heart to God thorough
Chriſt, and makes its complaint unto him, it doth
not cry out againſt God, but as it cries unto God,
ſo it runs unto the Lord thorough Chriſt, and
pours out his complaints before him: So <hi>David,
Pſal. 142. 1, 2. I cryed unto the Lord with my
voice, unto the Lord did I make my ſupplication, I
poured out my complaint before him:</hi> The fleſh
cries out of his burden, yea, ſinful fleſh it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
many times, not only of his burden, but of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43429:49"/>
God himſelf: Ah, but the ſpirit that cries unted
God, <hi>Job 35. 9. By reaſon of the multitude of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
they make the oppreſſed to cry.</hi> They cry
out by reaſon of the arme of the mighty, v. 10.
<hi>But none ſaith, where is God n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>maker? he reproves
the ſons of men.</hi> They are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>to cry, but it is the
cry of the fleſh, they cry out of the arme of the
mighty, but they do not go to God, <hi>None ſay,
where is God that giveth ſongs in the night ſeaſon?</hi>
The ſpirit in the ſaddeſt condition goes to God
through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The cry of the ſpirit it doth make a
man to cry out as well of ſin as of affliction, it
will make a man to cry out more of ſin then of
affliction; the fleſh is not ſenſible of the burden of
ſin; Ah, but where the ſpirit of the Lord is, it will
make a man cry out moſt of all of the burden of ſin;
if God ſhould take away affliction, and not take a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
way corruption, this would be little refreſhment
to him; <hi>O miſerable man that I am!</hi> as you have
the Apoſtle cry, which was the cry of the ſpirit,
<hi>Rom. 7.</hi> the latter end, <hi>O wretched man that I am,
who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?
I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> He
was more ſenſible of the body of ſin, then of any
affliction that lay upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The cry of the Spirit it will make the
ſoul cry more after God himſelf, then after any
mercy or deliverance, that it may injoy God, that
it may have the preſence of God, and communion
with God, that it may be made like to God; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart it cries thus after God, yea, in the day
of affliction when the burden is heavy, a gracious
heart deſires more to injoy God, then to be free
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43429:49"/>
from his affliction: See how the Pſalmiſt doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
himſelf in <hi>Pſal. 63. 1. O God, thou art my God,
early will I ſeek thee; my ſoul thirſteth for thee
in a dry and thirſty land, where no water is:</hi> David
was now in a ſtate of baniſhment, it is like he met
with ſore afflictions, ah, but the cry of his ſoul was
after God, my ſoul thirſteth for thee, and longeth
for thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The cry of the ſpirit it is a cry of
faith, it cries in faith, and cries in hope; the fleſh
cries in deſpair many times, but the ſpirit cries,
and believes when it cries, it takes hold of God,
and follows after him, follows God crying, though
God go away. See what is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 89. 26.</hi>
the promiſe is made to <hi>Davids</hi> ſon, Chriſt; <hi>He
ſhall cry unto me, thou art my father, my God, and

ſay, <hi>Thou art my Father, and my rock:</hi> And ſo the
Church, <hi>Iſaiah 26.</hi> ſhe cries out with a great cry,
and it is in faith, <hi>doubtleſs thou art our Father:</hi>
And ſo <hi>Pſal. 119.</hi> when as <hi>David</hi> cryed, he
truſted, he took hold of God, and hoped in his
mercy, 145, 146, 147. ver. though he was in
a great affliction, and there was great cauſe to cry,
yet his cry was the cry of faith, and he hoped in
the Word of the Lord, for the accompliſhment
of the Word of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As the cry of the ſpirit is the cry of
faith, ſo it is a fervent cry; that cry that the Lord
doth raiſe up by his ſpirit in the day of affliction,
it is a fervent cry, it is no cold nor lazy cry, but a
ſtrong cry: Jeſus Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh
put up ſtrong cries; and the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43429:50"/>
ſpeaks of the fervent prayer of Gods people. <hi>I am.

                  </gap>hen it takes hold of
God, and will not let him go, and cry out as the
Church, <hi>Awake thou arme of the Lord, as in the
dayes of old;</hi> when it will take no reſt it ſelf, and
give God no reſt, till the Lord comes in a way
of grace, that is the prayer that is ſpoken of <hi>Iſai.
62. 6, 7, 8.</hi> that prayer that is accompanied with
holy fervency is the cry of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, The cry of the ſpirit is ſuch
a cry as will not eaſily be ſilent, though it meet
with no anſwer from the Lord; though it meet
with a denial, as this <hi>woman of Canaan</hi> ſhe meets
with many diſcouragements, he gave her no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
at firſt, ſtill ſhe goes on to cry, her cry was
a cry that was raiſed by the ſpirit of the Lord:
the fleſh may put a man upon it to cry to the
Lord for a ſeaſon, but if the Lord does not come
in, the fleſh grows weary; now the cry of the
ſpirit is a conſtant cry, that will not give over, but
will wait upon the Lord till ſuch time as he ſhall
ſend from heaven to ſave. Thus you ſee what the
cry of the fleſh is, and what the cry of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Now the Saints in all Ages in the
dayes of their affliction, have been ſtirred up to
cry with their ſpirits unto the Lord, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their afflictions have been, the more they have
cried unto the Lord: So it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> he
was in a great ſtrait when as he was before the
<hi>red Sea,</hi> and then <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed in ſpirit, God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43429:50"/>
made uſe of that ſtrait to ſtir up the cry of the
Spirit in <hi>Moſes:</hi> And ſo when <hi>Jacob</hi> was in a
great ſtrait, he cryed more earneſtly then ever he
had done, when as his brother came to meet him
with an Army of men, he ſaw nothing but death
and deſtruction, he applied himſelf to the Lord,
and cried mightily: It is ſaid in <hi>Hoſea. 12. 4.</hi>
ſpeaking of <hi>Jacob, He wept and he made ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And ſo you know <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
cryed, and it was when his ſpirit was over whelmed
and no man to pity him;</hi> then he cryed unto the
Lord. And you know our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> (to give you
no more inſtances) in the dayes of his affliction
he cried louder then ever: That place <hi>Heb. 7. 7.
In the dayes of his fleſh he offered up prayers and
ſupplications with ſtrong cries and teares, unto him
that was able to ſave him from death, and was
heard in that he feared:</hi> And the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi>
doth take notice, that as Chriſts affliction and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
did increaſe, ſo he cried the louder to his
Father, <hi>Luke 22. 44. And being in an agony, he
prayed more earneſtly;</hi> he prayed the more when
his affliction increaſed, when he was in the midſt
of his <hi>agony</hi> then he cried more earneſtly.</p>
               <p>To make ſome ſhort application of the Point.<note place="margin">Application</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all; Let it be a word of examination,
there is none of us but at one time or other are
pouring out our cries and complaints, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in our affliction we are full of cries: Now
let us examine whether it be the cry of the fleſh
or the cry of the ſpirit; whether it be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with pride of heart, and with impatiency
and unbelief, with murmuring and repining; O
that is the cry of the fleſh, and the ſinful cry
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43429:51"/>
of the fleſh, which is far from the cry of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>But to give you two or three things that you
may make uſe of by way of tryall.<note place="margin">Tryals to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our cry be the cry of the fleſh, or the cry of the ſpirit.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all, would you know whether your cry
be the cry of the fleſh, or the cry of the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
why then examine whether or no your cry and
your complaint be not above your burden: many
a mans cry is greater then his bruden that God
layes upon him, it may be he makes his burden
heavy by his ſtrugling. <hi>Jobs</hi> burden was not ſo,
it was heavy: Now when a man ſhall cry out and
ſay, no affliction like to mine, and no burden like
to mine, O this is a ſinful cry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When our cry is ſo great as to take
us off from our duty either to God or man, that
cry is not a gracious, but a ſinful cry; the cry of
the ſpirit makes a ſoul wait upon God in a way of
duty; but now if a man in time of affliction is
taken off from his duty, ſurely that cry is a ſinful
cry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When a man in the day of affliction
cries ſo loud that he cannot hear what the Lord
ſpeaks to him, God comes and ſpeaks graciouſly,
offers comfort, but the cry of the ſoul is ſo loud,
that it cannot hear what God ſpeaks; that a man
ſhall be taken up with complaints as to refuſe all
the comfort that God ſends him, this is a ſinful
cry; this was the cry of that afflicted man, <hi>Pſal.
77. 2. In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord,
my ſore ran and ceaſed not, my ſoul refuſed to be
comforted.</hi> Nay, when as a man or woman in the
time of affliction, ſhall not only refuſe his comfort,
but juſtifie his complaint, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, he juſtified
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43429:51"/>
his anger, when God asked him, <hi>Doſt thou well to
be angry? Yea,</hi> ſaid he, I <hi>do well to be angry:</hi> This
was a ſinful paſſion: And ſo when a man ſhall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
any other paſſion, his ſorrow and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſay, I do well to complain, and in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of my ſpirit I complain, this is a ſinful
cry.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſecondly, Let me deſire in the
name of the Lord, that we would take heed how
we give way to theſe ſinful cries and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
theſe cryings out, which ſpring from pride,
impatiencie and unbelief. O, I pray, take heed
of giving way to theſe ſinful complaints.</p>
               <p>For firſt, I pray, conſider a little, that the hand
of the Lord is in every affliction that is upon you:
O that that were ſeen, that the hand of the Lord
is in it: <hi>Thou Lord didſt is,</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) I <hi>was
dumb, and opened not my mouth, for thou Lord didſt
it.</hi> O that would ſilence the ſinful cries of the
fleſh, if the heart were ſenſible that the Lord did
it; and if the Lord did it, then infinite wiſdome
hath done it; and if infinite wiſdome order this
or that affliction, why ſhould we cry out of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider whatever your affliction be,
though you ſay none like mine, it might have been
ſeven times heavier, infinite power could have
heated the furnace ſeven times hotter, and made
his flery tryals ſeven times more ſharp: O then
there is no cauſe why we ſhould complain, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the</p>
               <p>Third place, If we conſider what we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
at the Lords hand; and O that when we
pore ſo much upon our affliction, we would look
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43429:52"/>
with one eye upon that which may help to ſilence
our ſinful complaints! We have deſerved that
and a thouſand times more at the hand of God.
<hi>Why ſhould the living man complain, man for the
puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> O there is ſin enough;
though it be true, it is not alwayes for that God,
afflicts, yet he may ſee enough, for which he may
afflict ſeven times more. Now let our eye be
upon this; this was that which ſilenced <hi>Jeremiah,
Jer. 8. 14. Why do we ſit ſtill? Aſſemble your
ſelves, and let us enter into the defenced Cities, and
let us be ſilent there, for the Lord our God hath put
us to ſilence, and hath given us waters of gall to
drink, becauſe we have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi>
Take heed how we open our mouth in the day of
our affliction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Let it ſtir up all our ſouls
to go to God through Chriſt, and to cry more in
the ſpirit; and the greater our afflictions are, ſo
much the more let our cry be to Chriſt: The
time of affliction is no time to give over praying
and crying; but <hi>being in an agony he cryed more
earneſtly;</hi> and ſo we in time of affliction, we
ſhould cry more earneſtly. O that we might
learn thus to cry, with this gracious, holy, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and ſervent cry: The Lord Jeſus hath given
great incouragement to his ſervants to go and
cry thus. O what incouragement doth Chriſt
give in <hi>Luke 11. 8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> by a parable there, of a
man being in bed? he hath no mind to riſe, but
through importunity be is overcome: And ſo by
that Chriſt ſtirs up his Diſciples to go and cry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
to God their Father. And ſo in <hi>Luke
18.</hi> there is another parable of the <hi>unjuſt Judge;</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:43429:52"/>
who neither feared God nor man, yet becauſe of
the Widdows <hi>importunity,</hi> he would judge her
cauſe; And ſhall not the Judge of all do right?
I <hi>tell you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he will avenge the elect
that cry to him day and night.</hi> And therefore
Chriſt gives incouragement to you to go and cry
earneſtly, and to wait upon the Lord, and not to
give over crying, for the Lord hath the bowels of
a father, <hi>as the father pitties the child, ſo the Lord
pitties thoſe that fear him.</hi> Now the tender
hearted parent is filled with compaſſion to the
child, if the child be under a heavie burden, the
bowels of a father is filled with compaſſion, and
will not let him lie under that burden; and ſo the
Lord, when the ſpirit is even gone, and the ſoul
ready to ſaint, and the Lord ſee that their ſtrength
is gone, then the Lord will come in, and exerciſe
the bowels of a tender hearted father.</p>
               <p>And know, that many times the Lord doth hide
himſelf, and withdraw, and ſeems to be far off
from the requeſts of his people, that ſo he may
ſtir them up to cry the more earneſtly after him;
he ſees that they begin to flag in their prayers, and
do not cry ſo loud as they have done, the Lord he
will withdraw, that ſo he may ſtir up a ſpirit of
prayer, bring them into ſuch an affliction, that ſo
they may cry the more earneſtly; the ſtorm was
raiſed, when Chriſt was upon the ſea with his
Diſciples, to make them cry the more earneſtly:
The Lord ſeems to ſleep many times at the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his people, that ſo by the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
he may be awakened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, What need we cry thus
earneſtly to the Lord? for he is found of them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43429:53"/>
that ſeek him not; we cannot find God by our ſeeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

him, he muſt ſeek us, he is found of them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, It is true, God is found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
them that ſeek him not; that is when God comes
firſt into a poor ſoul, he breaks in upon it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
it with grace and mercy, and he ſeeks us, and
brings home grace and mercy to the ſoul before
the ſoul ſought the Lord.</p>
               <p>But now when the Lord hath found a ſoul, and
brought home a ſoul to the knowledge of himſelf
through Chriſt, O then he expects that that ſoul
ſhould continually wait upon him, and be ſeeking
of him, in that way which is of the Lords own
appointment: It is true, he is found many times
of thoſe that ſeek him not, but the Lord is not
found of thoſe that ſeek him lazily; he hears not
cold prayers, no, it is the cry of the ſpirit the Lord
heareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Ah, but ſome will ſay, I cannot cry and
pray, <hi>I</hi> cannot continue in prayer, my ſpirit is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed,

cried to the Lord, <hi>Job 16. 20.</hi> My friends ſcorn

When he knew not how to ſpeak a word, his
eye looked to the Lord, if he cannot poure
out his prayer, his eye ſhall ſpeak, and his

prayer.</p>

dare not beg any mercy, nor ſtand in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<hi>I</hi> am filled with the ſence of my own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I tell thee; though thou beeſt filled
with the ſenſe of thy unworthineſſe, yet thou
mayeſt, and ought to cry to the Lord, and
poure out thy ſoul in ſupplication: The <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
that went up to the Temple, he durſt not
draw nigh, he looked upon himſelf as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
ſinner, and yet poured out his prayer to
the Lord: the ſence of thy unworthineſſe ſhould
not hinder thee in the pouring out of thy prayer
to the Lord; the more unvorthy, the more
need of going to the Lord; and the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of thy unworthineſſe, the ſooner the Lord
declares his acceptance. Oh that the Lord
would make us all mindful of this our duty!
we are apt to cry with the cry of the fleſh, but
O that in the day of our diſtreſſe we did cry
with the cry of the ſpirit: Let the crie that
ſprings from pride, impatiencie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
be ſilent, laid low, and let it not
open its mouth; but crie with the cry of
faith, with the crie of the ſpirit, this will be a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43429:54"/>
good evidence, that affliction hath wrought the
right way, and that the Lord hath done us good
by our affliction: Till the fleſh be ſilent, and
the ſpirit raiſed up to cry in faith, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any evidence, that we have received
benefit by our affliction; but when the ſoul
ſhall be in affliction, and the ſpirit up and cry, it
will be a good evidence, that the ſoul hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
good by the affliction.</p>
               <p>And to ſay no more, the Lord will ſoon draw
nigh to that ſoul that ſhall thus be found wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him; when the fleſh ſhall be ſilent, and
the ſpirit cry, the Lord will ſoon hear that
crie. You know the Lord is a tender hearted
Father, and he will not ſuffer any of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to be tempted above what they are able
to beare; he will not ſuffer them to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their burden, but will come in with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
mercie; for the Lord doth ſometimes
hear the crie of the fleſh, ſo he hath heard the
crie of the fleſh, though not the ſinful crie;
yet the crie of nature, the Lord hath heard
that crie: He heard the crie of <hi>Iſhamel,</hi> when
as he was ready to periſh for thirſt: The Lad
cried, and he heard the crie of the Lad, and
the Lord opened the eyes of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and ſhe
ſaw a well of water: He heard the crie of the
fleſh, ſo gracious is the Lord, yea, he heares
she crie of the young Ravens, of the young
Lions, and the Lord he opens his hand and
ſatisfies them. O that this might be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to goe to God in all times of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
let it be never ſo great, the Lord is a
God of compaſſion, and if he does hear the

crie of the unreaſonable Creatures, and the
crie of the fleſh, O ſurely the Lord will much
more hear the crie of the ſpirit; when his

ſhews mercie to his very enemies; <hi>David</hi> ſpared
the life of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had him at a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and ſpared the life of <hi>Shimei,</hi> though he
had provoked <hi>David</hi> by his curſes. Now thus
ſhe reaſons with her ſelf, the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> was but a <hi>type,</hi> he hath
more mercie and compaſſion then <hi>David,</hi> ſurely
his bowels are infinite, and therefore though ſhe
be a vile ſinner, an unworthy wretch, yet ſhe comes
and takes hold of his mercie, and there is nothing
elſe that ſhe pleads with Chriſt, nothing elſe ſhe
reſts upon, only upon <hi>mercy,</hi> no other Argument
ſhe uſeth, only preſents her great miſerie; her
daughter <hi>is grievouſly vexed with a devil:</hi> She
takes hold of mercie.</p>
               <p>So then the Obſervation is this.
That where there is true faith,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> it will teach a
ſoul to deny it ſelf, to look beyond it ſelf, its
own worthineſs and righteouſneſs, and to take
hold of mercie, and of the free grace of God
through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall open the point to you.</p>
               <p>And firſt I ſhall give you Inſtances, that the
Saints in all Ages in their coming to God, hath
looked at nothing in themſelves, but hath only
pleaded <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>free grace</hi> in all their
ſtraits.</p>
               <p>You know that Inſtance of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was
in a great ſtrait he applied himſelf to the Lord, he
pleaded only <hi>mercy,</hi> he doth not look to any
worthineſs in himſelf, he doth not preſent that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord as any motive, <hi>Gen. 32. 10.</hi> he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43429:56"/>
pleads no worthineſs, but looks to his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs,
<hi>O Lord,</hi> I <hi>am leſſe then the leaſt of all thy
mercies;</hi> he doth not tell God, that he had lived
without blame, that he had walked juſtly, and had
not defrauded, but he had been a faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
that he had walked religiouſly, and eyed God
in his wayes, that he had ſet up a pillar, and vowed
a vow, he pleads none of this, but <hi>O Lord,</hi> I <hi>am leſſe
then the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he had done as much as
moſt men that ever lived, <hi>Deut. 3. 25.</hi> I <hi>pray thee
let me go and ſee the good Land.</hi> Here is not a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of any of the ſervices that he had done for
God that he doth mention; he does not ſay, Lord,
I have taken a great deal of paines with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I have followed thy Commandements, and
ſuffered a great deal of hardſhip with them for thy
ſake; no, he only pleads mercie, <hi>Thou haſt begun
to ſhew thy ſervant thy greatneſs and thy mighty
hand,</hi> I <hi>pray thee let me go over and ſee the good
Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>David</hi> often in the Pſalmes, you ſhall
find he is pleading with God, and he makes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
his refuge, he pleads only mercie and free
grace, <hi>Pſal. 4. 1.</hi> he pleads that God would bear
him in his mercie: And you ſhall find, that when
the Servants of God hath pleaded for others, they
have urged nothing but mercie and free grace in
all their ſupplications. So the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
when he was pleading for the Church, <hi>Jer. 14. 7.
O Lord, though our iniquities teſtifie againſt us, do
thou it for thy names ſake, for our back-ſliding
are many, we have ſinned againſt thee:</hi> No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any righteouſneſs, no, be mentions their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43429:56"/>
iniquities, <hi>Our back-ſlidings are many, but do thou
it for thy names ſake.</hi> And ſo the Prophet, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
when he was pleading for the Lords people, he
looks beyond all righteouſneſs of their own, and
pleads mercie, <hi>Dan. 9. 17. Now therefore, O our
God, hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
that is deſolate, for the Lords ſake:</hi> He had
before in verſe 8. confeſſed all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and now, <hi>O Lord,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>do it for the Lords
ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if you look into the new Teſtament, from
the beginning to the end of the Hiſtory of Chriſt,
you ſhall never find any that were accepted of
Chriſt that pleaded any thing, but <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>free
grace, Matth. 9. 27.</hi> And when Jeſus departed
thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and
ſaying, <hi>Thou ſon of David haue mercy on us.</hi> And
ſo in <hi>Matth. 17. 14, 15.</hi> another comes to Chriſt,
and he uſeth only that Argument, <hi>mercie, Lord
have mercy on my ſon, for he is lunatick.</hi> And in
<hi>Matth. 20. 30.</hi> there is mention of two blind men
ſitting by the way ſide, and they cried out, <hi>Have
mercy on us.</hi> And in verſe 13. the multitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
them, but they cried the more, ſaying, <hi>Have
mercy on us, O Lord, thou ſon of David.</hi> And ſo
the ſame Argument the Lepers uſed, verſ 17. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
Maſter have mercy on us.</hi> Indeed we read of
ſome of the Elders of the Jews, that came to
Chriſt in the behalf of the Centurion, and they
plead his worthineſs, <hi>Luke 7. 4.</hi> And <hi>when they
came to Jeſus, they beſought him inſtantly, ſaying,
that he was worthy for whom he ſhould do this:</hi> But
now the good man himſelf he had no ſuch thought
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43429:57"/>
of himſelf, but he utterly denies it, look into verſe
6, 7. <hi>Then Jeſus went with them, and when he was
now not far from the houſe, the Centurion ſent friends
to him, ſaying unto him, Lord trouble not thy ſelf, for</hi>
I <hi>am not worthy thou ſhouldeſt enter under my roof;</hi>
verſe 7. <hi>Wherefore neither thought</hi> I <hi>my ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to come unto thee, but ſay in a word, and my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ſhall be healed.</hi> Neither thought I my ſelf
worthy to come unto thee, ſuch a mean and low
account had this man of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, But I ſhall clear the Doctrine to you, and
make it out, that a gracious heart, where there is
faith, looks beyond all his own worthineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and comes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Shew you, that the ſame gracious ſoul
cloſes only with <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>free grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, a gracious ſoul in its coming to
Chriſt, looks beyond all that is in himſelf, and that
both in its firſt coming and afterward in any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
cloſeth with the Lord, and looks beyond his
own worthineſs, and pleads only mercie.</p>
               <p>In the ſouls firſt coming to Chriſt, a gracious
heart doth not not cannot look to any worthineſs
in it ſelf, for where the Spirit of the Lord is, it
doth diſcover to man what his vileneſs and miſerie
is; now where there is a ſaving diſcovery to a ſoul
of his own vileneſs, it is not poſſible that that
ſoul ſhould plead any thing of his own before
God. For</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, The Spirit teacheth a man that he
is empty, deſtitute of all that which is good, the
ſoul is naked of all that which is good, and is as a
poor beggar, that hath neither bread to eat, nor
clothes to put on, but in a ſad condition, utterly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43429:57"/>
bereaved of the Image of God: <hi>In my fleſh dwels
no good thing,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, though through
grace he had received much from God, yet <hi>in me,
in my fleſh dwels no good things.</hi> Now where there
is a diſcoverie made to a ſoul, that he is full of
wants, poor and naked, ſurely ſuch a ſoul can plead
nothing but free grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit of the Lord diſcovers to a
ſoul, that it is not only full of wants, but full of ſin,
full of all manner of unrighteouſneſs, not only loſt
the Image of God, but is filled with the image of
the Devil, and diſcovers that <hi>all the imaginations
of mans heart are evil, and only evil, and that from
his youth upward:</hi> Now when the Spirit of the
Lord comes to make this diſcoverie to a man, that
he is thus filled with ſin, and lets a man ſee what a
filthie thing ſin is, how diſpleaſing to God, how
contrary to his Holineſs, that ſoul that hath this
diſcovery can plead nothing of his own when he
comes to God, but mercie and free grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit of the Lord doth diſcover
to man, that he is a poor weak creature, that he is
one that can do nothing to help himſelf out of this
miſerable ſtate, that he can do nothing to procure
a better condition for himſelf, that he can make no
ſatisfaction to God for the leaſt of his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
full of ſin, ah, but he cannot make ſatisfaction
for the leaſt tranſgreſſion, he cannot lay down a
price to redeem his own ſoul, he cannot change
his own heart, and he cannot work up his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to believe in Chriſt, he cannot ſubdue any luſt
in his own heart; a poor weak creature that can do
nothing, cannot think a good thought, nor move
toward God: Now when the Spirit of the Lord
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43429:58"/>
diſcovers this to a man, O then he ſees there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to plead but mercie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirit of the Lord doth diſcover
to a ſoul, that his natural eſtate is a ſtate of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
the Lord rips open a mans heart at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
and ſhews him what enmities is in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
how full he is of contrary workings in his
heart and ſpirit to the Lord, he ſees that ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
that he never ſaw before: Now when this
comes to be diſcovered to a man or woman, that
they are in a ſtare of enmitie to God, and the
workings of that enmitie cannot ceaſe, if the Lord
doth not put forth the mightie power of the death
of Chriſt; I ſay, that ſoul that hath all theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
made to it, firſt ſees that it hath no worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
pleads nothing of his own, eſpecially ſuch a
creature, ſo full of wants, ſo full of ſin, and ſo full
of weakneſs, and ſo full of enmitie, ſuch a creature
can plead nothing of his own when he comes to the
great God.</p>
               <p>Nay, as it ſees that it hath no deſerts to plead,
ſo it ſees that there are contrary deſerts, I ſay,
theſe diſcoveries will make a ſoul ſenſible of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
deſerts, that it deſerves nothing but hell and
wrath, and confuſion, rejection from the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
for ever and ever: The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was
ſenſible of theſe contrary deſerts of the people,
<hi>Dan. 9. 8. To us belongs nothing but ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion:</hi>
So that you ſee when the Lord by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
comes to diſcover to man, what a vile creature
he is, ſuch a ſoul ſees that it hath nothing to plead
as matter of merit, but mercie.</p>
               <p>And as in its firſt coming, ſo whenever a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart goes to God, after it is brought home,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43429:58"/>
reconciled, made one with God through Chriſt,
after it hath walked with God, yet even then no
gracious heart that can plead any worthineſs, any
righteouſneſs of his own; when he goes before
God, he cannot plead any of his graces, nor any of
his own ſervices, non any of his own ſufferings;
and if ſo, then there is nothing to plead.</p>
               <p>I ſay, a gracious heart cannot plead his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it cannot plead his faith, not holineſs, it cannot
preſent that to the Lord, that the Lord for ſuch
and ſuch graces ſhould beſtow mercie; for the
very faith of the Saints is imperfect; now that
which is imperfect cannot merit any thing, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of unbelief mixed with the ſtrongeſt faith,
<hi>Lord help my unbelief:</hi> It is true indeed, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
in ſome of his Pſalmes, deſires God to look
upon his faith, <hi>Pſal. 25. 20. Deliver me, for I put
my truſt in thee:</hi> But he doth not look upon his
faith as merriting any thing at Gods hand, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſires that God would look upon his Covenant,
the Lord had promiſed grace to his people in
truſting upon him; ſo that he doth not deſire the
Lord to look upon it as any act of his, for faith is
little worth as an act of ours, but he puts the Lord
in mind of his Covenant, of the Promiſe that he
made with his people.</p>
               <p>And the Saints, as they cannot plead faith, ſo
they cannot plead holineſs, for as their faith, ſo
their holineſs is imperfect; they have many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
manyfold corruptions are found in the moſt
gracious heart, therefore they cannot plead holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before the Lord.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in <hi>Iſai. 38. 3.</hi> and ſo <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
ſpread before the Lord what they had
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43429:59"/>
done, and how they had walked; but that can be
no Argument that we ſhould make uſe of that as
an Argument, no Argument that that was the beſt
Argument; but I ſay, they only did deſire the
Lord to look upon his own work in them, they
were far from pleading any merit, any deſert. And
therefore you ſhall find the beſt of the Saints, when
in the beſt temper, have been found diſowning
their own righteouſneſs, and their own worthineſs.
<hi>Paul</hi> he had as much to plead, and to truſt too, as
any man living, and yet he looks upon all as <hi>droſſe
and dung</hi> in compariſon of Chriſt; in reſpect of
pleading righteouſneſs all is droſſe and dung,
though it is good in its place, yet to lay it as a
foundation, it is droſſe and dung. And ſee what
is ſaid <hi>Job 9. 20. If</hi> I <hi>juſtifie my ſelf, mine own
mouth ſhall condemn me, if</hi> I <hi>ſay</hi> I <hi>am perfect, it
ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> O that they would
mind this that boaſt of perfection! <hi>Job</hi> was as
perfect as any, yet <hi>if</hi> I <hi>juſtifie my ſelf, mine own
mouth ſhall condemn me, if</hi> I <hi>ſay</hi> I <hi>am perfect, it ſhall
alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> The very ſaying I <hi>am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
would condemn me, it would declare that I
am lying againſt the truth, and I ſhould declare my
imperfection, while I am pleading perfection:
Thus a gracious ſoul dare not plead faith nor holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It dare not plead any ſervices; when
it hath done its utmoſt for God, it dare not plead
what it hath done, no work, no ſervices, no tears,
no faſtings, it dare not plead theſe before the Lord.
Indeed you ſhall find many unſound hearts, that
have pleaded theſe things, and truſted to them,
many unſound hearts and hypocrites, that have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43429:59"/>
looked much to their righteouſneſs, to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and faſtings, and their good works and ſervices
that they have done for God, they have pleaded
theſe before God, <hi>Iſai. 58. Wherefore have we
faſted, and thou haſt not ſeen, and afflicted our ſoul,
and thou regardeſt not.</hi> And ſo you know the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican</hi> that went up
to the Temple to pray, the <hi>Phariſee</hi> he ſtood upon
it to juſtifie himſelf, <hi>Luke 18. 11, 12.</hi> he ſtood
much upon his own juſtification, what he was not,
and what he was, I <hi>am not as other men are, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican:
I faſt twice a week,</hi> I <hi>give tithes of all</hi> I <hi>poſſeſs: But
the Publican he ſmote upon his breſt, ſaying, God be
merciful to me a ſinner; and the Publican he went
away juſtified rather then the Phariſee.</hi> Though
hypocrites look at their ſervices, yet a gracious
heart dare not look at any thing it hath done:
<hi>Matth. 25.</hi> When Chriſt takes notice what the
Saints hath done, and ſayes, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my
Father;</hi> I <hi>was hungry, and you gave me meat,
thirſty, and you gave me drink, naked, and you cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
me. Why Lord, ſay they, when ſaw we thee
a hungry, thirſty, and naked, when did we theſe things
to thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What did the Saints do good works ignorantly?
did good and did not know? No, that which is
done out of ignorance is ſinful, no, they knew what
they did, and that they did but according to the
mind of Chriſt; ah, but when done, they take no
notice of it, their right hand ſhall not know what
their left hand doth, for they dare not plead
their ſervices and their duties upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43429:60"/>
For they know whatever is good is not theirs,
but Chriſts, whatever in them that is good, and
whatever good they have done, is by the Lords
Spirit, and therefore they know there is nothing
for them to plead by way of merit; no, the more
they are inabled and aſſiſted to do for Chriſt, the
more they are ingaged unto Chriſt, Chriſt is not
ingaged to them, but they ingaged to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And beſides, whatever they have done in the
ſervice of the Lord as theirs, it is accompanied
with many weakneſſes and frailties, that if it were
not for Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, and Chriſts
preſenting them, God the Father could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the beſt ſervice that ever was done by the
beſt men.</p>
               <p>And beſides, the Saints know that when they
have done all they can, they are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
if they could do a thouſand times more for
God, yet they have nothing to plead: Chriſt
teacheth us ſo, <hi>Luke 17. 10. So likewiſe ye, when
you ſhall have done all thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants; we
have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> Mark, if
it were poſſible for any of Gods people to do all
that the Lord requires, yet there is nothing to
plead, you have done but that which was your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that which was your debt; Now the payment
of a debt is no ingagement, he to whom the debt is
paid is not ingaged, you have done but your duty.
And ſo the beſt of all the Saints, if they could do
all that is required, they do but pay their debt;
there is a debt of thankfulneſs, not debt of juſtice,
we have done that which is duty, which we owe to
mercie and free grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43429:60"/>
Again, the Saints cannot plead their ſufferings.
Though a man ſuffer never ſo much, and ſuffer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo well, and ſuffer upon a good ground, and
ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, yet there is nothing
that he can plead by way of merit, for there is no
man ſuffers without ſin: there was merit in Chriſts.
ſufferings, becauſe he ſuffered and had no ſin of his
own, he was the <hi>Lamb of God without ſpot;</hi> but
now the beſt of Saints upon earth, who do ſuffer
for the name of Chriſt, cannot ſuffer without ſin,
though it is not puniſhed for ſin, yet ſtill there is
ſin in the perſon, and ſo can be no deſert.</p>
               <p>And then beſide, it is that which the Saints owe
to Chriſ as they owe all duties, ſo they owe all
ſuffering for the name of Chriſt, and if they ſhould
ſuffer a thouſand times more then ever any man
ſuffered, it is but what they owe; and therefore
ſuffering cannot be pleaded no more then ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And ſo you have the firſt part of the
point.</p>
               <p>But of the ſecond part, to ſpeak more briefly to
that, as a ſoul is taken off of it ſelf, ſo it pleads on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mercie, flees to free grace, comes to naked
mercie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For a gracious heart it ſees and knows,
that there is a <hi>fulneſs</hi> in mercie to ſatisfie all its
wants, all its deſires, there is enough in mercie to
make abundant ſupply to it as it; ſees there is that
in it ſelf, which may make it run from it ſelf, ſo
there is that in mercie and free grace, which may
make it run to it as to a City of refuge. There is
a fulneſs in mercie which may anſwer the ſoules
deſires and wants; for as you heard before, when
the Lord doth diſcover to a man, that he is a poor
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43429:61"/>
creature, deſtitute and naked, why the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
doth diſcover, that there is enough in mercie to
ſupply all wants; mercie hath made great provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the poor, naked, deſtitute creature; and as
it diſcovers to a ſoul, that it is a ſinful creature, ſo
the ſame ſpirit doth diſcover, that there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in mercie to take away all ſin, and pardon all
tranſgreſſions; and mercie and free grace hath
ſet open a fountain, an infinite fountain, a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
fountain of merit in the blood of Chriſt, for
the waſhing away of ſin; and as the ſoul ſees,
that it is a poor weak creature, ſo the ſame ſpirit
doth diſcover to it, that mercie is ſtrong, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is able to reach him in every condition, and
able to lift him up in the loweſt condition, and as
it ſees that it is an enemie to God, ſo the ſame
ſpirit doth diſcover, that mercie can reconcile it,
ſhew what is done for the reconciliation of poor
creatures; mercie hath given Jeſus Chriſt for to
ſlay the enmitie and to reconcile poor loſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Thus, I ſay, a gracious ſoul it will flee to
mercie, it ſees that there is a fulneſs in mercie to
anſwer all its wants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as it ſees a <hi>fulneſs,</hi> ſo there is a
<hi>freeneſs</hi> in the Lords mercie, and therefore runs to
mercie, as this woman did, and pleads mercie, and
to caſt her ſelf into the armes of mercie, becauſe
free; ſee that the Lord is a tender hearted God,
and that mercie flew freely from him, mercie
makes free invitations, the ſoul ſeeing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, it is perſwaded to apply it ſelf to
mercie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such a ſoul will flee to mercie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it knows, that all that God doth for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43429:61"/>
in the buſineſs of ſalvation, it is for the <hi>exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of mercie and free grace, the great work of
the redemption of ſouls, it is only for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mercie and free grace; it vvas free grace
that found out the vvay of redeeming ſouls, and
free grace that gave ſinners to Chriſt, and free
grace that gave Chriſt for ſinners, and free grace
gives Chriſt unto ſinners, and all that God doth in
ſanctifying and ſaving his people, is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of mercie and free grace, and therefore the
Lord he invites ſouls to himſelf, and he makes
choice of ſuch as may moſt of all declare the
riches of his mercie, vvhen he ſends to invite
men to come in to him, he ſends to the high
vvayes and hedges, goes and compels them to
come in, <hi>Go and call the blind and the lame:</hi> When
Chriſt makes a feaſt, he ſends to the poor; he
knovvs, that the poor hungry ſouls, vvhen they ſhall
taſte of the riches of his grace, they vvill be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and they vvill advance mercie and free grace,
and therefore he ſends to the high-vvayes and
hedges to compell them to come in. Thus you
have ſeen both the parts of the Doctrine open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>A vvord or tvvo for improvement, and I ſhut
up all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us take heed, brethren and friends,
that vve be not found looking to any vvorthineſſe
of our ovvn, vvhen vve come to Chriſt; take heed
that vve be not found looking to any righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our ovvn; take heed vve bring no price
in our hand vvhen vve come for mercie, that vvill
ſpoil all: O there is many a poor ſoul by this is
kept from coming to Chriſt, from cloſing vvith
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43429:62"/>
Chriſt, from reſting upon Chriſt, and ſo from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
becauſe it is a hard matter to bring them
off from looking to ſomething of their own; men
will hardly be perſwaded that they do ſo; but yet
it is a very ordinary thing, and thouſands more do
it, then will be perſwaded they doe it, who doe
look upon ſomething of their own, and ſo are kept
from Chriſt: Whence is it elſe, that men ſtand
ſo much upon their own juſtification? men ſtand
to plead for themſelves, and juſtifie themſelves
and quarrel with God in time of affliction, and
entertain hard thoughts of God, it is becauſe,
men have too good thoughts of themſelves?
Whence comes it elſe, that men are up and down
in their ſpirits, and comforted according to their
actings? But from hence, becauſe men are proue
to look to ſomething of their own, as a foundation
of their acceptance with God: Whence is it
elſe, that men are kept from cloſing with Chriſt,
becauſe of the ſight of their unworthineſſe? But
from hence, becauſe men would have a price in
their own hand, to buy grace of him, and mercy of
him.</p>
               <p>But it may be many a poor ſoul will ſay, that he
doth not look to his worthineſſe, God forbid that
I ſhould do it, ſayes the ſoul: Ah, but thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
does keep thee from Chriſt; and if ſo,
then thou ſuppoſeſt that ſome worthineſſe in thee
ſhould make thee cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you Brethren, that we do not
look to any thing in our ſelves, think not to bring
any price with you when you come to Chriſt, but
know, that we are poor, and naked, and miſerable,
ſinfull, and weak, and full of enmity againſt God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43429:62"/>
and Chriſt, that there is nothing that we can plead;
what is there that we would carry? If you had
more grace, you could not plead that; if you had
done more ſervice, you could not plead that; and
if you had ſuffered for Chriſt, you could not plead
that: O then why do our ſouls flag and hang back,
and do not make haſt to Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>And let me tell you, that ſouls that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
have beſt acceptance: I ſaid before, that if
you carry a price you looſe all your labour, Chriſt
deals with the poor, and with none elſe, and trades
with them that have no mony; and I ſay, that
ſouls that come to Chriſt moſt empty, moſt naked,
moſt deſtitute, moſt deſolate, in the apprehenſion
of their own vileneſs, ſinfulneſs, enmity; that ſoul
that comes thus to Chriſt, ſhall have beſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
If a man comes and pleads any thing elſe,
pleads, Lord, I have done ſo and ſo, I have been ſo
and ſo, this moves not the Lord, to tell God of
your righteouſneſs, and what you have done, it
moves not God at all; but to tell God what a
poor creature you are, full of ſin, and full of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
full of enmity, and full of wants, this will
move the Lord: Is it not ſo with your ſelves?
I pray conſider how it is with our ſelves, and what
it is that moves us; when a poor man comes,
what is it that moves us? O when he ſhall ſpread
his wants, and expreſſe the ſence of his wants and
miſery; a poor man comes to you and ſayes, O
Sir pitty me, help me, I want every thing, I have
not a rag to put on my back, no bread to put into
my belly, I am blind, I am lame, I have no legs to
walk with; no hands to work with, O this will
make impreſſion upon the hearts of men, though
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43429:63"/>
hard; And ſhall not this move tbe Father of
mercies? O it will prevail much: If a ſoul ſhall
goe and ſay, Lord, I am miſerable, naked no eye
to ſee, no legs to walk, no hands to work, O this
ſpeaks loud; when the ſoul ſhall cry, Lord help,
Lord hear me; I tell you, this will plead very
loud in the eares of God, for Chriſt (as I ſaid
before) he will deal with none but the poor, he
will heal them that have nothing; you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Phyſitians that goe up and down and give it
out, that they will heal the poor for nothing.
So Chriſt gives it our in the Goſpel, that he will
heal the poor, and none but the poor; let a poor
deſolate, naked, empty ſoul goe to Chriſt, and
ſay, Lord, thou haſt invited poor ſinners to
come that have no money, and I am ſuch an one,)
Lord, heal me: Chriſt will heal ſuch a ſoul;
Chriſt will not heal the rich, if they be rich and
full they have no need of him; <hi>The rich he will
ſend away empty,</hi> but the poor ſhall not goe away
empty. O then, that this might perſwade us,
that when we go to God we might go poor, in the
ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, for it is the beſt
thing to move the Lord to mercy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let us make mercy our refuge, for it
is not enough for a man to run from himſelf, if
he does not run to mercy, if he does not run
to free grace, if he goes any where elſe there
is no healing. Now therefore it calls upon us
all, every one in the Congregation this day, to
make mercy and free grace our refuge: O that
we might goe to God upon that account, at
this woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, <hi>Have mercy on me.
O Lord, thou ſon of David:</hi> She comes to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43429:63"/>
mercy, and pleads mercy, and reſts upon mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and free grace.</p>
               <p>Oh that we might make more uſe of mercy
and free grace for all things! Let us come hither
for pardon of ſin: Doe you want pardon of ſin?
Plead with mercy and free grace, flee to the
Promiſes of mercy, I <hi>will be mercifull to their
ſin, and remember their ſin no more.</hi> And ſo
would you have peace? Goe more to free
grace, plead more with mercy, there peace is
to be had, it is mercy that <hi>creates the fruit of
the lips peace peace.</hi> And ſo doe you want heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
healing of your corruptions, of your
diſtempers of ſpirit? What is it that you want?
O goe to free grace, it is to be had in mercy,
there is healing for you, <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings,
and love them freely.</hi> Oh that the
Lord would help us all to flee to this refuge.
Doe you deſire any thing? Goe upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of mercy, doe not ſtand upon any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
any juſtification of your ſelves, and
if you be kept from Chriſt by your unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then you have an eye to your worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
O that we might not look upon any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe!
If a man come to you and plead, that
you would take pitty upon him, it would move
your hearts more, then if a man ſhould come
and require of you that you ſhould doe ſo and
ſo for him, becauſe you have done ſo and ſo
for others? No, but if he falls down at your
feet, it prevails more with you; and ſo, when
God ſees that a man ſtands upon it, upon his
own juſtification, O this does not prevail; but
when a ſoul cometh to the foot-ſtool of free
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43429:64"/>
grace, and pleads nothing but mercy, I am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be caſt out, but thou haſt given an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſinners, and here I will wait at the foot-ſtool
of free grace; this will move the bowels of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Ah, but may not a man cry for mercy,
and yet goe without it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True indeed, it is poſſible a man may
cry for mercy, and call for mercy in a dead, cold,
formal way, many a poor creature will ſay, Lord
have mercy on me, and he truſts to his <hi>Lord have
mercy on me,</hi> and ſo thinks that ſhould ſave him;
but that is not to truſt in mercy; they truſt in
their ſaying ſo, but they truſt not in mercy: It is
poſſible that a poor wretch in time of extremity
may cry out, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> and yet not apply
himſelf to mercy; for the ſoul that applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to mercy, he applies himſelf in Gods way:
Now Gods way in ſhewing mercy, it is in Jeſus
Chriſt; if a man cries never ſo loud for mercy, yet
if he does not apply himſelf in Gods way, look
thorough the Mediator, he may cry and go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; but he that doth apply himſelf rightly to
mercy, he ſeeks it in Chiſt, for mercy will doe no
good out of Chriſt; therefore a gracious heart
applies himſelf only to Chriſt; and he that applies
himſelf to mercy, he waits the Lords time for
mercy: So that a man may ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi>
and cry out for mercy, and yet be far from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy.</p>
               <p>But now this let me ſay, that if any poor ſoul
that is ſenſible of his own miſery, that ſees it is full
of wants, and full of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, and
full of weakneſs, unable to help himſelf, and full
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43429:64"/>
of enmity, ſo that it can do nothing but ſin againſt
God, I ſay, a ſoul that ſhall ſee this, and ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it ſelf to mercy in mercies way, look to God
through Chriſt the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> come as this woman,
to the <hi>Meſſias, O thou ſon of David have mercy
on me;</hi> no ſoul that ſhall thus apply himſelf to
the mercy of God thorough Chriſt, being ſenſible
of his own loſt condition, and ſhall there wait, but
certainly the Lord will make a good end with
that ſoul, and that ſoul, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
<hi>Shall find grace and mercy to help in time of
need.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We ſhall now ſee the <hi>love</hi> of
this woman; here is her <hi>love</hi> as well as her <hi>faith;</hi>
there was a great deal of love and compaſſion in
her towards her daughter, the ſtroke that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her daughters body, fell upon her ſpirit, and lay
heavy there; and therefore ſhe doth not ſay,
<hi>Lord have mercy upon my daughter,</hi> but, <hi>Lord have
mercy upon me:</hi> It is my affliction, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>Lord have mercy upon me, for my daughter is

was heavy upon her ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Whether was this
affection natural or ſpiritual grace? Whether
did ſhe ſpeak this from natural affection to her
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43429:65"/>
child, or was this a fruit of her faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Here was both natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſpiritual grace; for ſeeing this woman had
a ſeed of faith in her, as hath been proved, natural
affection could not work alone; where there is
the grace of faith in the heart, it will not leave na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to work alone, but grace will ſtep in and
rectifie natural affection, order natural affection, ſet
bounds to natural affection, ſet natural affection
upon a right ground, and make them look to right
ends, where there is grace natural affection cannot
work alone: Indeed in that heart where grace doth
not dwell, there nature works alone, as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affections, grief, and ſorrow, and anguiſh, in a
natural man, where the ſpirit is not, nature works
alone, he cannot propound any ſpiritual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to himſelf to quiet his grief and ſorrow; he
may fetch in ſome carnal conſiderations, or he may
ſtay till nature ſettle of it ſelf, time may wear
out his grief, but no work of grace to compoſe
the ſpirit, time muſt work it out: But now in a
gracious ſoul, nature cannot work alone, but grace
will ſtep in to order and rectifie, to ſet bounds to
the affections, and will help to compoſe the ſpirit;
and ſo we may conclude of this woman, here was
firſt natural affection in her; nature did teach
her to love her child, but natural affection did not
work alone, here was alſo the ſpiritual grace of
faith, faith taught her to love her child aright; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taugh her to love her child, but grace taught
her to love her child aright.</p>
               <p>So that there was the working both of nature
and grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Was it not an evil to
give way to natural affection?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:43429:66"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, No, natural affection is not
the corruption of nature: Indeed there is a great
deal of corruption in natural affection, but natural
affection is not the corruption of nature; no, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection is part of the <hi>Image of God,</hi> the
remnant of the Image of God which was left in
man ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> for it is a ſin to be
without natural affection: The Apoſtle, ſpeaking
of the ſins of the laſt dayes, he reckons up this as
one, <hi>without natural affection, Rom. 1. 31.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection is part of the Image of God; and
it is that, without which the world could not be
continued: The Lord in abundance of mercy and
wiſdome hath planted natural affection in the
hearts of Parents to their Children, for if it were
not ſo, Gods name would ſoon be diſhonoured,
and there would be all manner of cruelty, and the
race of mankind would ſoon be deſtroyed; ſo
that it is a mercy to have natural affection, but to
have ſpiritual grace to work with natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to have faith to ſet natural affection right, and
to cauſe it to work aright, that is the greateſt
mercy: Now this woman had both, ſhe loved her
child, and loved her child aright.</p>
               <p>And this woman may be a pattern to all parents,
to all thoſe that have children, and may teach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of us, not only to love our children, but to
love them aright.</p>
               <p>So then to cloſe with the Doctrine, which is
this:
That whereſoever there is faith in any man or
woman, it will rectifie natural affection in them;
faith will teach parents to love their children
aright.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:43429:66"/>
In the opening of this Point I ſhall ſhew you
two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there is a great deal of love in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection in the hearts of parents towards
their children.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where there is faith, it will rectifie
thoſe natural affections, and teach to love Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
aright.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It will not be unneceſſary to ſhew you,
that there is a great deal of love in natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the hearts of parents to their children;
it will not be altogether unuſeful to ſee how much
love there is in the hearts of parents to their
children, that children may ſee the love of their
parents to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What a great deal of natural affection is there
in the hearts of parents towards their children?</hi>
O Lord, thou ſon of David, have mercy on
me, for my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a
Devil.</p>
               <p>And you ſhall ſee, that the Lords hand hath
ingraven natural affection upon the hearts of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and it is ingraven in ſuch great letters upon
the hearts of parents, that it is almoſt impoſſible
to wear it out, <hi>Iſai. 49. 15. Can a woman forget
her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
on the ſon of her womb?</hi> It is a very hard
thing to do it, it is almoſt impoſſible that a woman
ſhould forget her ſucking child: It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ſome have done it, ſome have forgotten it,
ſome have laid cruel hands upon their ſucking
child; ſuch are monſters rather then women, but it is
not poſſible that a woman that hath the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a woman ſhould forget her ſucking child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43429:67"/>
And our Saviour tells us, that it is in the worſt
of men, <hi>Matth. 7. 11. If ye then being evil
know how to give good gifts unto your children:</hi>
There is this good thing in the hearts of the worſt
men living, love in their hearts to their children.
And therefore it is, that the Lord doth make uſe
of the compaſſions that is in the hearts of parents,
to ſet forth his own love and compaſſion toward
his people; that place before, <hi>Iſai. 49. 15, 16.
Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe
ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb?
Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I have graven thee upon the palmes of my
hands.</hi> And ſo <hi>Pſal. 103. 13. Like as a father
pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that
fear him:</hi> He maketh uſe of the bowels, the pitty
and compaſſion of Parents, to hold forth what
bowels are in his heart towards his children.</p>
               <p>Now that you may ſee what this natural affection
is, and that you may ſee the greatneſs of the love
of parents to their children, conſider how it
works.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, Love makes them willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
a great deal of pain and ſorrow, labour, care
and travel; what is it almoſt that Parents are not
willing to undergo for their children? O how
much ſorrow do poor women meet withall in
bearing and bringing forth children? And yet
their deſire to children doth carry them through
all; <hi>A woman, though ſhe have a ſore travel,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>when delivered forgets her ſorrow, for
joy that a man is brought forth into the world.</hi>
And ſo when they are brought forth; what great
pains are parents willing to take for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43429:67"/>
How long doe they hang upon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
breaſts before they can ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
And yet that affection that the Lord hath
planted in parents, makes them willing to doe all
this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that natural affection that the Lord
hath planted in parents to their children, maketh
them to ſympathize with their children, in every
burden and affliction, every affliction that lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their children to be their own affliction; ſo
this woman in the Text, <hi>O thou ſon of David have
mercy upon me:</hi> The affliction was upon her
daughter, but it was her burden; <hi>O Lord have
mercy upon me.</hi> The parent doth ſympathize
with the child, and doth account the affliction of
the child to be their own affliction; for how are
Parents affected when their children are ill, and
when the hand of God is upon their children?
If the childs head doth but ake, it makes their
heart ake, ſo ſenſible are parents of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
troubles: The Noble man that came to
Chriſt, ſee how he was affected when his child
was ſick, <hi>John 4. 49. Sir, come down ere my child
die:</hi> At verſe 47. he beſought Chriſt, that he
would come down and heal his ſon, <hi>for he was at
the point of death.</hi> Chriſt delayed the buſineſſe,
verſe 48. then ſaid Jeſus unto him, <hi>Except ye
ſee ſigns and wonders ye will not believe:</hi> But ſee
how abruptly he anſwered Chriſt, verſe 49. <hi>Sir,
come down ere my child die.</hi> He was not able to
attend any thing elſe, all his mind was upon his
child, <hi>O Sir, come down ere my child die.</hi> He could
hear nothing till his child was healed, and thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection vvorketh tovvard their children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:43429:68"/>

his father to forgive him, to pardon all his miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and to cloſe with him again upon his firſt
return and ſubmiſſion?</p>
               <p>And you know that Inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> which
holds forth a great deal of affection that was in
that good man towards a wicked child, <hi>2. Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

18. 5. Deal gently for my ſake with the young
man, even with Abſalom.</hi> He was a wicked and
rebellious ſon, one that roſe up againſt his father,
one that would have turned his father out of his
kingdome, one that ſought his fathers life, one
that had committed great wickedneſs in the ſight
of the Sun: But oh! how doth <hi>Davids</hi> heart
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43429:68"/>
yearn towards him? And when the Captains
went forth to battel, <hi>David</hi> gave this charge, that
<hi>they ſhould deal gently with him for my ſake.</hi> Thus
you ſee how the hearts of parents works towards
their children.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That natural affection that God hath
planted in the hearts of parents towards their
children, doth teach them to accept willingly any
ſervice that is done by their children; though it
be never ſo weakly done, yet if the Father ſees
that the child hath done its good will, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and in love, O! how acceptable is the leaſt
piece of ſervice done by ſuch a child? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord taketh an argument from this to
ſtrengthen his peoples faith, <hi>I will ſpare them as a
man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him, Mal.
3. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Natural affection will teach the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to <hi>ſupply all the wants</hi> of the children. O!
what care doth parents take to ſupply their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
wants, that they may want nothing that is
good for them? They ſhall have that which is
ſutable to them: <hi>Ye that are evil know how to give
good gifts to your children:</hi> What care do parents
take of their children, while young, to ſupply their
wants? And what care do they take to make
proviſion for their children, when they are dead
and gone? Nay, do not many a poor parent undoe
himſelf to make proviſion for his children, that he
may make them great in this world, and leave
them ſomething when he be dead and gone.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, to name no more; The love
that is in parents makes them exceeding <hi>unwilling
to part with their children;</hi> it is the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43429:69"/>
in the world, they had rather looſe all their
eſtates then looſe their children: Nay, though
parents many times be ſo poor as they cannot keep
their children, yet how loath are they to part with
their children? The poor Widdow we read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>2 King. 4. 1.</hi> all her eſtate was gone; nothing
left her but her two ſons, the creditor came to take
unto him her two ſons from her, but how loth was
ſhe to part with her two ſons? Nay, how hard is
it for parents to part with their children when
God takes away their children by death? You
know that Inſtance of <hi>Job, Job 1.</hi> he did bear very
well all the afflictions and loſſes that he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
till he came to looſe his children, the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
came and told him, that all his eſtate was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; and you read of nothing that <hi>Job</hi> ſaid,
but when they come and told him, his <hi>children
were ſlain,</hi> then <hi>Job rent his mantle, and fell down
upon the ground and worſhipped:</hi> To looſe his eſtate
was nothing, but to hear that all his children were
ſlain, he rent his mantle, and fell down upon the
ground; a token of his great ſorrow: And you
know how <hi>David</hi> was affected, when they brought
him word that <hi>Abſolom</hi> was killed, he went up to
the chamber over the gate, and he wept as he
went, ſaying, <hi>O my ſon Abſolom, would God I had
died for thee:</hi> A moſt pathetical complaint that
this poor man makes when his child was taken
away, though he was a wicked child, and one that
ſought his fathers life. Thus you ſee the firſt part
of the Doctrine, that God hath planted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection in the hearts of parents to their
children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:43429:69"/>
But ſecondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond part of the Doctrine.</note> I ſhall ſhewe you, that where there
is faith, natural affection cannot work alone, but
faith will rectifie natural affection; faith will teach
Parents to love their children aright: Natural
affection will teach them to love their children,
ah, but ſpiritual love that ſprings from faith will
teach them to love their children aright.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay to me, when may Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
be ſaid to love their children aright? or how
ſhall we know that the love of Parents to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is not only the working of Natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, where there is faith, it will teach
Parents to love the <hi>ſouls</hi> of their children: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will teach to provide for the body, but the
Spirit of the Lord that teaches Parents to look
after the ſouls of their children; now when the
ſoul is loved and reſpected more then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
then do Parents love their children aright.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Gen. 17. 18.</hi> you may ſee what a requeſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
doth make for his ſon <hi>Iſhmael: Oh! that</hi>
Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee.</hi> God hath been
making many gracious promiſes to <hi>Abraham</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
another Seed, but <hi>Abraham</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his ſon <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> neither could he beg that he
might have a great eſtate, but that he might live
in the ſight of the Lord: When Parents take care
of the ſouls of their children, then Parents love
their children aright.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Parents love their children aright,
when as they do love them in <hi>obedience to the Lord;</hi>
when they love them, and when they take pains,
and act for them, and perform all offices of love
to them in <hi>obedience to the Lord;</hi> when Parents
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43429:70"/>
do bring up their children, and perform
every duty to them, in obedience to the
Lord: <hi>theſe are the children that the Lord hath
graciouſly given his ſervant;</hi> and ſo he love them,
and perform duties to them, that he may obey
the Lord, and be found working the work of his
ſtation and relation, in bringing up theſe children
to the Lord; this is that love that is not only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
but ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Again, Parents love their children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
when as they have an eye to the <hi>Covenant</hi>
of God concerning their children; when they
have an eye to the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God that he hath
made to the children of Believers: He hath ſaid,
<hi>that they that come of thee, ſhall build the old
waſte places.</hi> When as Parents thus eye the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God in looking upon their children as
the Lords, and theſe are they that the Lord hath
ſaid he will own; and ſo love their children more
becauſe they are the Lords then theirs, becauſe
the Lord hath promiſed that he will own them,
and make uſe of them. And ſo I conceive <hi>Moſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>'s
Mother had reſpect to this in her love to her
child, Hebr. 11. 23. <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he
was born, was hid three Months of his Parents,
becauſe they ſaw he was a proper child, and they not
afraid of the Kings commandment.</hi> Her love
ſprung from faith, when ſhe hid her child <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
three months; it was not from Natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but from faith. <hi>By faith Moſes</hi> when he was
born, was hid three months, becauſe they ſaw he
was a proper child, and they not afraid of the
Kings commandment. The Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was, that all the Male-children ſhould be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43429:70"/>
drowned, and to diſobey his commandment, it
did endanger their own lives; ah, but by faith, ſhe
ventured: ſhe looked upon her child as one that
God would make uſe of, ſhe was perſwaded that
God would make uſe of this child <hi>Moſes,</hi> to do
ſomething for the future; ſhe knew that there
was a promiſe that God would deliver his people,
and ſhe knew not but that this might be the Man,
and ſo was not afraid, but by faith hid him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Parents love their children aright,
when as they are much <hi>praying</hi> for their
children, preſenting their children to the
Lord, and praying for them, crying to the
Lord in their behalf for the bleſſing of the Lord
upon them, when they are very inſtant with God
that he would take away the guilt of original ſin
that is upon their children, and the guilt of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
tranſgreſſions that are found upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<hi>Job</hi> every day took a ſacrifice, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
for his Sons and Daughters, he prayed for
them, he was careful that ſin might not lie upon
them: Oh, that was ſpiritual love that was found
in <hi>Job,</hi> it was of a right ſtamp, he was careful that
the guilt of ſin might not lie upon them, and
therefore he every day offered a ſacrifice to the
Lord. And the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhe cries in
the behalf of her child, ſhe comes to Chriſt, and
cries to him for her child. And ſo when Parents
go to Chriſt for their children; when under bodily
Infirmities go to Chriſt for them, and when under
ſpiritual Infirmities, go to Chriſt for them, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Chriſt for them, then do Parents love
their children aright.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; when Parents are careful to <hi>educate</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:43429:71"/>
their children for God, when they are careful that
God may be honoured by their children, that
their children may be inſtructed ſo as to honour
God, when they deſire and endeavour to prevent
all diſhonour that may be done to God by their
children, to reprove them, and to rebuke them,
and not to be ſo indulgent as old <hi>Eli</hi> was, which
proved to be the ruine of the whole family. I
ſay, when Parents are careful that God may not
be diſhonoured, but labour that their children
may be inſtrumental for God, and they do ſeek
the Lord for this thing, and do deal with them
upon this account, and are careful to inſtruct
them, and to lay before them the mind of God,
and careful ſo to diſpoſe of them, as God may be
ſerved by them; when this is the care of Parents,
this is a diſcovery that their love is not only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection, but ſpiritual grace, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection is ſet right by their faith, which
the Lord is pleaſed to beſtow upon them.</p>
               <p>For the Application.<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Take notice what a mercy it is, that
God hath planted ſuch Natural affections in the
hearts of Parents; it is a great mercy, it is that
which is little taken notice of, but it is that which
we and all in the world have cauſe to bleſs God
for, that parents, yea thoſe that are evil can do ſo
much good for their children, give out of the
good things which they have to their children;
there is much of the wiſdom and goodneſs of
God in it, that Parents ſhould do ſo much for
their children, when they doe not deſerve it,
it is long before it can deſerve any thing; nay
when grown up, there are many times contrary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43429:71"/>
deſerts, and that yet the hearts of arents ſhould
be kept up towards their children, as I ſaid before,
there is a great deal of the wiſdom and goodneſs of
God in it; for there is a great deal of evil thereby
prevented, a great deal of ſin and cruelty that is
prevented by the Lords giving of natural affection.
Oh admire the wiſdom &amp; goodneſs of God in this!</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let Parents know that this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have natural affection and love to their
children, but oh that Parents would labour to love
their children <hi>aright.</hi> It is not enough to love
them much, to have great natural affections, but
let Parents labour to love their children <hi>aright;</hi>
labour ſo to love them as to love their <hi>ſouls,</hi> to
take care of their ſouls, which is a thouſand times
more worth then the body; labour to love them
in <hi>obedience to God;</hi> labour to eye the <hi>Covenant</hi> of
God in loving your children; be more in <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the face of God,</hi> in the behalf of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
Oh that Parents would look upon it as their
duty, to pray more for their children. Oh, look
upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and let him be your pattern;
how did he cry to the Lord in the behalf of <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el?</hi>
it lies upon all Parents to go to God for
their children, yea for every one in particular. <hi>Oh
that ſuch an one might live in thy ſight!</hi> Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how did ſhe cry to
Chriſt for her daughter? oh, <hi>Lord have mercy
upon me:</hi> Now let Parents go to Chriſt for their
children; oh go and cry for the ſouls of thy
children, as this woman did for the body of her
daughter; oh Lord, I ſee ſuch a corruption in
ſuch a child, and ſuch a luſt in ſuch a child, oh
that the <hi>Son of David</hi> would have mercy on them.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43429:72"/>
We ſhould go to Chriſt for the ſouls of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that Chriſt would caſt out thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that we ſee ſprouting in our children.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Oh that this might provoke us all to
look after <hi>faith:</hi> what need have Parents to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for faith in Jeſus Chriſt? if it be but upon
this account, that you may love your children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
oh look to Chriſt for <hi>faith,</hi> cry unto Chriſt
to give you <hi>faith,</hi> that ſo you may love your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
aright: There may be a great deal of natural
affection in parents, they may dote upon their
children, and undo their children, and yet not
love them aright; for it is impoſſible that a man
or woman that hath not faith to love children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
they cannot love their children aright, till
they have faith.</p>
               <p>And to provoke all parents to look after faith
upon this account of their children, let me ſay
this to you; that faith will teach you to love your
children impartially. There is a great deal of
partiality in natural affection, and it runs out much
to one child, and neglects another; ah, but with
ſpiritual love it is not ſo. When Parents love their
children aright, it will teach to love their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
more equally; not to love one more then
another, unleſs they ſee more of God in one then
another.</p>
               <p>Again, let me tell you, that faith will make
your work to your children eaſie; there is a great
deal of labour, travel, and pains (as you have
heard) to bring forth children, and a hard work to
bring up children when brought forth, but faith
will make your work more <hi>eaſie,</hi> when as God is
eyed in it, and ſo you are bringing up children for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43429:72"/>
God, when as you are loving and caring for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in obedience to God. Oh this will make
your work more <hi>eaſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further let me tell you, that faith will
make your work more <hi>acceptable</hi> to God. That
work you are doing for children, when it is done
in faith, is accepted; if you love your children in
faith, the Lord will take it well at your hand,
and the Lord will reward all the labour, ſervice,
travel and pains that Fathers and Mothers do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
for their children. That inſtance you find
in Scripture of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mother, when <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
daughter found <hi>Moſes</hi> by providence, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him to his own Mother to be his Nurſe, and
ſhe pays his own Mother for him: And ſo the Lord
he will deal with you that are parents that act in
faith, and perform your duties in faith, the Lord
will reward you for your love to your own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for taking care of your own children, all
your labour is taken notice of by the Lord, and
you ſhall be rewarded: Oh! what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
here to all Parents to look after faith in Chriſt,
that ſo your ſervice may be accepted of the Lord?</p>
               <p>One thing more, and ſo I conclude: and that
is a word to children; is it ſo, that there is ſo
much love in the hearts of Parents to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
is there ſo much that Parents do
from love to children? oh, that children would
labour to know what is their duty that they owe to
Parents! it cannot be told, it cannot be expreſt,
how much it is that children owe unto parents.
<hi>Children,</hi> it is impoſſible that ever you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
the love of your parents; oh the pains, the
travel, and ſorrow of bringing forth, and bringing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43429:73"/>
up! oh, that children might know that there is a
great engagement lies upon them to love their
parents, to reſpect their parents, to take heed that
they do not grieve their parents, to paſs by all in
firmities of parents, to ſhew all reſpect to them,
and when grown up, to take care of them!</p>
               <p>And this is a duty that Chriſt lays upon you,
though a Moral duty, ſee what is ſaid in <hi>1 Tim.</hi>
where children may ſee what Chriſt injoyns them,
<hi>1 Tim. 5. 4. But if any widow have children or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,
let them learn firſt to ſhew piety at home, and to
requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable
before God.</hi> God lays this duty upon children:
you ſhould labour <hi>to requite your parents,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their love, their care, their ſorrow, their
pains and travel; and you are bound by the Law
of Chriſt to requite your parents, <hi>this is good, this
is piety, and this is acceptable to God.</hi> And ſo
that place, Levit. 19. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every man
his Mother, and his Father, and keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths:
I am the Lord your God.</hi> Here is a duty
that God lays upon children, to <hi>fear every man his
Mother and Father.</hi> Children are moſt apt to
deſpiſe their Mothers, therefore the Lord begins
there, and lays that duty, firſt that children ſhould
<hi>fear</hi> every man his <hi>Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And take notice of it, that this is a duty that
the Lord ſets before the keeping of his <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
as if the Lord ſhould ſay, in vain ſhall they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be Religious, if they do not fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
every man his Mother and his Father: I
will not accept of your ſervice. It was a brand
that was ſet upon <hi>Eſau</hi> to all generations, that he
did that which was a grief to his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43429:73"/>
Now children ſee your duty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your duty, which the Lord Jeſus lays upon you.</p>
               <p>And oh that children would labour for faith,
that they may perform their duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love their children aright, till they have faith;
and truly children cannot reverence their parents,
nor perform the duties they owe unto parents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they have faith. Oh, then that Parents and
children would look up to Chriſt for faith! and
then ſhall both be able through faith in Chriſt to
perform that mutual duty that God requires from
parents and children.</p>
               <p>And to ſhut up all; let this that hath been
ſpoken, ſtrengthen the faith of all Gods people
in Gods love to them: Oh, that by this we might
aſcend to the love of God! O, that they that
think they have not been concerned in what hath
been ſpoken hitherto, would know they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this. The Lord would have you to
aſcend by the conſideration of the bowels that are
in parents to their children, to a conſideration of
thoſe infinite bowels that are in him towards you
that are his children; <hi>As the Father pitieth his
children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him;</hi>
what ever workings of love are in the hearts of
parents towards their children, oh! know that
there is larger workings of love in the heart of
God towards his children; there are infinite
bowels in the everlaſting Father: and if there be
ſo much pity in the hearts of parents, that they
are willing and ready to give out good things to
their children, and willing to paſs by and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the miſcarriages of their children; oh! how
much more willing is our God to paſs by and to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43429:74"/>
pardon the failings of you that are his children?
oh! that this might encourage prodigal children
to return to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the father receive his
child, that hath been a prodigal, why the Lord is
ready to receive you though a prodigal, if the
Lord give you an heart to return, though you have
ſpent all, and abuſed all your mercies, yet the
Lord is ready to pardon and to receive you.</p>
               <p>And let it ſtrengthen your faith and hope in
Chriſt, you that cleave to Chriſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
you that are the children of that everlaſting
Father; oh know that Chriſt will plead for you,
Chriſt will cry to his Father for you: Was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Candan</hi> ſo affected with the miſery of her
daughter, that ſhe cries, <hi>Lord, have mercy on me,
my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a devil?</hi>

(I ſay) this found in this woman towards her
daughter? and ſhall not this be found in Chriſt

and preſſure of ſpirit, come to Jeſus Chriſt,
and cry ſo earneſtly unto him, and believe ſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
upon him, and yet Jeſus Chriſt give her not
one word of anſwer to her prayer, this was a ſore
trial; for this carriage of Chriſt, it ſeems to be
contrary to what ſhe had heard of Chriſt, and to
what ſhe believed was in Jeſus Chriſt; for Chriſt
ſeemed now either to be without compaſſion to
her, he ſeems to take no notice, not to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſhe complained and cried out of her great
burden, and Chriſt ſpeaks not a word; the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt ſeems either not to be affected with
her miſery, or not to regard her miſery, not to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43429:75"/>
take notice of ſuch a poor creature as ſhe was;
now both theſe were contrary to what ſhe had
heard of Chriſt, and to that ſhe had believed was
in Jeſus Chriſt, without doubt ſhe had heard out
of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
when he came, ſhould <hi>bind up the broken-hearted,
and preach deliverance to the captives;</hi> now when
ſhe applyes her ſelf to Chriſt, Chriſt ſeems not to
be that compaſſionate Saviour; certainly ſhe had
heard that <hi>Sions</hi> King was <hi>meek and lowly,</hi> and that
<hi>he would not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
ſmoaking flax;</hi> but Chriſt ſeems to diſdain her,
and take no notice of her, nor look after ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
worm as ſhe was; nay, ſhe had believed, that
Chriſt was low and meek, as appeareth by that
expreſſion of hers in <hi>ver. 22. Thou Son of</hi> David
<hi>have mercy on me;</hi> now <hi>David</hi> was a merciful
Prince, and was very pitiful and compaſſionate
and very meek, and lowly, and humble, therefore
ſhe believed that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was much
more compaſſionate; and ſhe did believe that
he would not diſdain her though ſhe was a poor
Gentile; but Chriſt ſeems to be quite contrary,
and <hi>anſwered her not a word;</hi> this was a ſore trial</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> then is this.
That it is a very ſore and great tryal unto the Lords
people,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> when the Lord is ſilent to their prayers,
and gives no anſwer to their cries.</p>
               <p>In the opening of the point I ſhall ſhew you;
that God hath dealt thus with his own people;
and that it hath been a very ſore tryal unto</p>
               <p>And then ſhall ſhew you wherefore the Lord is
pleaſed thus to try his people; which will make
way for the Appplication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43429:75"/>
Firſt, God hath dealt thus with his people. I
ſhall point you to ſome places of Scripture: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
often maketh this complaint, Pſalm 28. 1.
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee will I cry O Lord, my rock, be not ſilent
to me, leſt if thou be ſilent to me, I become like
them that go down into the pit.</hi> How earneſtly
doth <hi>David</hi> beſeech the Lord that he would not
be ſilent to his prayer? Lord, <hi>Do not turn away
thy ear from my prayer, and do not ſhut thy mouth,
be not ſilent.</hi> If thou doſt not ſpeak ſomething to me
in anſwer to my prayer, I am not able to hold out,
but ſhall be like them that go down to the pit.
And <hi>Pſalm 69. 3.</hi> he maketh a ſore complaint, <hi>I
am weary of my crying, my throat is dried: mine
eyes fail, while I wait for my God.</hi> The trial was
ſo great to his ſpirit, that it had an influence upon
his Body; when <hi>David</hi> cryed to the Lord, he
anſwered not a word; his throat was dried and
parcht up, and his eyes began to fail. And ſo the
Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Lam. 3. 44. he expreſſeth it
in the name of the Church. <hi>Thou haſt covered
thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayer ſhould not paſs
thorow.</hi> God ſeems to hide himſelf, and cover
himſelf with a cloud, and did ſo hide himſelf as
prayer could not find him; he gave him not a
word. And the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> he complains
of it, chap. 1. ver. 2. <hi>O Lord how long ſhall I
cry, and thou wilt not hear? even cry unto thee of
violence, and thou wilt not ſave?</hi> Nay, that it was
a ſore trial, you ſhall ſee it in thoſe expreſſions
of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> ſpoken of in the perſon of
Chriſt, Pſalm. 22. 2. <hi>O my God I cry in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
but thou heareſt not; and in the night-ſeaſon,
and am not ſilent.</hi> It was a ſore affliction to Chriſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43429:76"/>
himſelf. O my God, I cry in the day-time, and
in the night-ſeaſon; that is, I cry continually,
night and day, never ſilent: But thou art conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ſilent to me, this was a ſore affliction and
burden to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now that this is a ſore affliction and trial, for
God to be ſilent to the prayers of his people, it
appears,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you conſider that <hi>relation</hi> the Lord
ſtands in to his people, and they to him; he ſtands
in relation of a <hi>Father,</hi> they his <hi>children;</hi> he
ſtands in relation of an <hi>Husband,</hi> they his <hi>Spouſe;</hi>
he ſtands in relation of a <hi>friend,</hi> they <hi>his friend;
Abraham,</hi> he <hi>was the friend of God,</hi> and ſo is
every believer; God a friend to him, and he a
friend to God; now it is a ſore trial, when one
friend ſhall cry to another, or a wife to an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or a child to a father, and theſe relations
not give one word of Anſwer, if a poor child
in great extremity ſhould cry to his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
father help me, and the father not to give one
word, this is a ſore tryal; if a man cry to a
ſtranger, and meet not with one word, it is no great
diſappointment, but when a child cries to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or a wife to an Husband, or a friend to a
friend, and they not to ſpeak a word, it is a great
trial.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will appear to be a great trial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is nothing in all the world, that a
gracious ſoul <hi>longs more after then this,</hi> that the
Lord would be giving a return of prayer, that
there may be a converſe betwixt God and the
ſoul, to ſpeak to God, and to hear God ſpeaking
back again to it; nothing that a gracious foul
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43429:76"/>
more longs after; oh it longs to hear a word
from God, it knows that the return of prayer, is
the way to make a ſoul rich towards God, and
to make it rich in experience, in faith, in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
in obedience. Oh how doth a Merchant-venturer
long for the return of his commodity
from a far Country? truly there is no merchant
in the world, can long more for the return of his
commodity from a far Country, then a gracious
ſoul longs for the return of prayer; oh ſaith the
ſoul, when wilt thou come unto me? Now if it
be that which a gracious ſoul doth more long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any thing in the world, it is a great
trial, when God doth not give a return of
prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A gracious heart when it puts up a
prayer to God, it <hi>looketh for a return,</hi> for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
Pſalm 85. 8. <hi>I will hear what God the
Lord will ſpeak:</hi> And ſo the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had prayed, I will get me upon the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower,
and I will watch to ſee <hi>what he will ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</hi> I will wait to ſee what God will ſpeak by
his ſpirit, or by his providences; one way or
other God will ſpeak. Now to have this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
diſappointed, to wait upon the Lord
for an anſwer, and the Lord not to ſpeak one word,
this is a ſore trial.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt needs be a great trial, when
God gives never a word of anſwer; for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ſoul knows aſſuredly, that if God do not
anſwer, <hi>none elſe can hear prayers,</hi> and give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to prayer; it is Gods name, <hi>oh thou that
heareſt prayers, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> God
only can hear prayer, and God only can give an
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43429:77"/>
anſwer; it is God only that can reach out mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the ſoul, and ſpeak a word of comfort and
counſel; God only can ſpeak a word of ſtrength,
a word of peace, the creature cannot: No, it is
God only, <hi>I create the fruit of the lips pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,
peace.</hi> Now when a ſoul looks up to the Lord, and
meets with nothing from him, and knows that
there is no anſwer to be expected from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this muſt needs be a great and a ſore
trial.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it will appear to be a great trial, if we
conſider that the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> are exceeding
ready <hi>to make a great advantage</hi> of this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God and diſpenſation towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
for they will improve this to the diſhonour
of God and diſcomfort of the ſoul, and therefore
a great trial.</p>
               <p>In two or three Particulars, I ſhall ſhew you
how ready the Fleſh and Devil is to improve
this to Gods diſhonour, and the ſouls diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Fleſh and Devil will raiſe up many
doubts, and jealouſies, and miſ-giving thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
both concerning God, and concerning a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
own condition, and concerning the duties and
ſervices which are offered up to the Lord. They
will make the ſoul to doubt of the goodneſs of
God, to doubt of the free-grace of God, to
doubt of the faithfulneſs of God, of the truth
of God; Surely ſaith unbelief, the Lord is not
ſo gracious as thou haſt taken him to be; thou
haſt reſted upon the Arm of his mercy, and thou
haſt believed his grace to be ſufficient for thee in
every condition; thou haſt looked toward him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43429:77"/>
as toward an infinite compaſſionate God; but
where are the compaſſions of the Lord now?
not to ſpeak one word to relieve and comfort
thee: Thus will the Devil and the unbelieving
heart object, when the Lord doth not give out a
preſent anſwer; yea unbelief will be accuſing the
faithfulneſs of God: Oh! where is his
Word and his Promiſe? He hath ſaid, that
they that <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall
be ſaved.</hi> He hath ſaid, <hi>Call upon me in the
time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou ſhalt glorifie me:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h! where is the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God? God is unmindful of his promiſe.
<hi>Aſaph</hi> was under this temptation, Pſalm 77. 7, 8.
<hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
no more? Is his mercy clean gone for
ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> And
thus he goeth on making many Queries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the goodneſs and faithfulneſs of
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Devil and the Fleſh doth raiſe
many doubts and jealouſies concerning the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi>
of God, ſo there are many doubts caſt into
the ſoul concerning the <hi>eternal eſtate</hi> and <hi>condition
of the ſoul,</hi> and that upon this ground; when as
the ſoul hath ſought the Lord, and the Lord not
anſwer, preſently the ſoul begins to doubt; oh,
ſurely I am no child of God, no ſponſe, no friend;
God could not deal ſo with children, not to give
one word of comfort, not one word of anſwer:
Oh, ſurely I am an Hypocrite, for <hi>the prayer of
the upright is his delight,</hi> and if there were any
truth of heart in me, the Lord would give out an
anſwer; and thus the Devil and the Fleſh-raiſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43429:78"/>
many jealouſies and fears about the ſouls eternal
ſtate. Or</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Devil and the Fleſh prevail not
ſo far as to cauſe the ſoul to queſtion the goodneſs
of God, and the Truth of God, or to queſtion
its own Sonſhip, yet they will prevail ſo far as to
make the ſoul <hi>queſtion his ſervices and his duties</hi>
which it hath performed to God: Oh! ſurely I
have not ſpoken to the Lord as I ought, ſurely
I have not been fervent in Spirit, ſerving the
Lord, my prayer hath been but words of my
own, not the teachings of his Spirit, if it had
been his own Spirit, the Lord would have heard
his own Spirit; but my prayer hath been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ſo many infirmities as it hath not
reached up to heaven. And thus you ſee how
many a poor ſoul is led into temptation upon this
ground, the Lords being ſilent to the prayers of
his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> wherefore doth the Lord thus
try his people?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, ſometimes indeed the fault is in our
ſelves that we have no anſwer to our prayers; for
it is poſſible that a man or woman that hath faith
in Jeſus Chriſt, may be <hi>remiſs in their walkings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
they may neglect ſome known duty, or they may
connive and wink at ſome evil way, and if ſo, no
wonder though the Lord be ſilent at their prayers.
<hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not
hear my prayer:</hi> If <hi>David</hi> regard iniquity, if there
be any way of ſin that his heart cloſeth with, the
Lord will be ſilent to his prayers; if any iniquity
be regarded, no wonder though the Lord do not
hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:43429:78"/>
Yea, ſometimes Gods own people are found
remiſs in their duty, and though they pray, they
<hi>pray remiſly</hi> and coldly; their prayer is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ſo much deadneſs and diſtraction,
there is ſo little life and ſo little ſpirit, the Spirit
ſpeaks ſo low that the Lord cannot hear, and he will
not hear; and when it is ſo that we pray coldly
and lazily, we make but a light matter of it, and
are not found <hi>crying</hi> to the Lord with our
hearts, no wonder though the Lord be ſilent to
our prayers.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſometimes Gods own people may miſs
of an anſwer, becauſe they <hi>do not look after an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
and then the fault is their own; when as we
ſhall put up our petition, and ſhall not be looking
after our prayer, ſhall not be found looking up,
as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, Pſalm. 5. 3. <hi>In the morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi>
I will wait for an anſwer, and <hi>hear what God the
Lord will ſpeak,</hi> Pſalm 85. 8. But when we do not
regard our prayer, then no wonder there is no
anſwer: I ſay therefore the Lord is ſometimes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to the prayers of his own people, and the
fault is in themſelves.</p>
               <p>But the Lord is not alwayes ſilent upon theſe
grounds: A gracious heart may walk cloſe with
God, and may regard no iniquity, and deſire not
to connive at any ſin, and it may wait upon the
Lord for an anſwer; and yet the Lord may be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and give no preſent anſwer to the prayers of
his people.</p>
               <p>Why ſo? why, will the Lord deal ſo with
any of his people?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:43429:79"/>
I anſwer,<note place="margin">Gracious ends why the Lord defers an anſwer to the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> for gracious ends; as</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they may <hi>exerciſe the ſpirit of prayer</hi>
which is given out, the Lord he loves to hear the

children when they ſpeak in prayer; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Again, the Lord is ſilent many times at the
prayers of his people, to <hi>try whether they will
continue in prayer,</hi> though the Lord doth give
them no preſent anſwer; oh here is the trial of
perſeverance; <hi>God hath heard my prayer</hi> (ſaith
<hi>David) therefore will I call upon him as long as I
live.</hi> Ah but that is no great matter for a man to
ſay, God hath heard my prayer and therefore I
will call upon him ſtill: But for a ſoul to ſay, I
have been crying and calling, and I will ſtill wait
upon him, as long as I live, I will wait upon God;
Oh here is perſeverance in prayer, in which Chriſt
doth delight.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord is ſilent many times upon
this ground; he gives no preſent anſwer, that ſo
he may <hi>prepare an anſwer</hi> for them, and that he
may <hi>prepare them for an anſwer;</hi> God gives no
preſent anſwer, that ſo he may prepare mercy,
and ripen mercy, and make mercy fit for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that he may ripen them, and fit them
and their hearts for the mercy; ſo that it is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of grace, and mercy, and love that the

anſwer to his people, for all the
time the Lord is ſilent, he is preparing of mercy
and goodneſs for them, he is making of the
mercy fit for his people, the mercy ſhall be ripe,
and the mercy ſhall be ſweet and wholſome, and
do them good at the heart: When the Lord hath
thus prepared mercy for them, and fitted them for
the mercy, they ſhall have the mercy; ſee what
is ſaid in <hi>Iſa. 80. 18.</hi> And <hi>therefore will the Lord
wait that he way be gracious unto you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will he be exalted; for the Lord is a God of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43429:80"/>
judgement, bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi>
He waits that he may be gracious, he waits for
the beſt ſeaſon, the fitteſt opportunity, he will
ſtay till the ſoul hath need of help, in the fitteſt
time the Lord will come in mercy, when he may
be moſt exalted for mercy, when his people may
ſee moſt of the hand of God, when they moſt
prize their mercies, and glorifie God for mercy;
God waits for ſuch a time. And therefore you
ſee it is for gracious ends that God many times
ſeems to be ſilent for a ſeaſon, and gives not one
word in anſwer to prayer, as Chriſt here to this
<hi>woman of Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Application</hi> of the Point.<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſpeaks ſadly of them that never regard
whether the Lord give an anſwer or no, to their
prayer, that pray and pray, and look not after an
anſwer: How far are ſuch men and women from
the diſpoſition of Gods children? a gracious
heart cannot but be affected, when it ſpeaks to
the Father, and the Father gives no anſwer: And
therefore ſurely when men and women make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prayers, and look not up for an anſwer, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not whether the Lord anſwer, or not, either
they are none of his children, or elſe under a ſore
temptation; for let me ſay unto you, that though it is
not for your prayers that God doth regard prayer,
yet if you do not look up for an anſwer, if you
do not regard your prayers, neither will God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
your prayers. And let me ſay further, that
this is a great diſhonour to God: Oh what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is it? it is a loſs to God, and it is a loſs alſo to
the ſoul: for a man to loſe all his prayers, it is a
loſs indeed. When as a ſoul doth not regard
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43429:80"/>
whether God anſwer or no, God loſeth, he loſes
that glory which would redound to him in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of prayer: <hi>Call upon me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in the
day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Now if the ſoul call upon God,
and doth not obſerve whether God hears or no, it
cannot glorifie God for the return of prayer,
but God loſes that honour, that thankfulneſs, and
that love and obedience, and that dependance,
which an anſwer of prayer might engage the ſoul
to.</p>
               <p>And as God loſeth, ſo the ſoul loſeth; oh they
that look not after the return of prayer, they loſe
that which would make their ſouls rich. For a
Merchant to loſe all his return, it will make him a
poor Tradeſman in concluſion; that ſoul that doth
not look after the return of prayer, loſeth a great
deal of faith, and dependance, and experience;
for God by giving out an anſwer to the prayers of
his people, he doth encourage them, and engage
them to truſt in him at all times ſo long as they
live; they that loſe the return of prayer, loſe the
ſtrengthening of faith, and the engaging of their
heart to God.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, let me ſpeak to ſuch poor ſouls
as are in the ſame condition with this woman of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> that have prayed, and have not met with
one word of anſwer: Poor ſouls! is this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of any of you? I know that it hath been,
and may ſtill be the condition of the Lords deareſt
ſervants, they may pray, and the Lord may ſeem
to give no anſwer: Remember it was ſo with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> and with <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:43429:81"/>
And let me ſay this unto thee, that if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt
any iniquity in thy heart, any known ſin
that thou regardeſt or conniveſt at, or if there be
ſlightneſs in the performance of thy duty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteſt
thy ſelf with a ſlothful performance of thy
duty, or thou doſt not regard thy prayer when
thou haſt put it up to the Lord; for this we have
cauſe to be humbled, and no wonder the Lord
do not anſwer our prayers.</p>
               <p>But now, if thy own ſpirit and the Spirit of the
Lord can teſtifie that thou deſireſt to regard no
iniquity in thy heart, but to walk up to thy duty,
and deſire to be conformable to Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to cry in faith, and to wait upon the Lord for
an anſwer, be of good comfort, though thou doſt
not meet with one word of anſwer from the
Lord, though thou haſt cryed nights and dayes,
weekes, months and years, and haſt not met with
with one word of anſwer, yet be comforted,
this may be the condition of Gods own
people.</p>
               <p>And let me ſay further by way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Lord he extends much good to
thee in this deferring and delaying to give out an
anſwer; it is for gracious and merciful ends to
thy ſoul that the Lord do not give thee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
mercy thou prayeſt for; he will exerciſe the
ſpirit of prayer, he will exerciſe thy faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and he will fit thee for mercy, and mercy
for thee, and thou ſhalt have it ſo at laſt as thou
ſhalt bleſs God for it.</p>
               <p>Yea let me ſay further, though an anſwer be not
given out, thy prayer is heard, and thy perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
accepted: Thy prayer is heard with the Lord;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43429:81"/>
oh that that might be a ſtay to poor ſouls that are
in this condition as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> was,
that cry, and have cryed long: I ſay thy prayer is
heard. Oh ſayes the ſoul that I knew my prayer
were heard, if I did but know that the Lord hath
heard my prayer, I would be content to wait all
my dayes for an anſwer, I have been crying for the
light of his countenance, and for the aſſurance of
his love, I have been crying night and day, and if
the Lord hath heard my prayer, I ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to wait for an anſwer.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I know that the Lord hath heard
my prayer?<note place="margin">How to know when God hath heard our prayer.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer thus; Firſt of all, by that <hi>ſecret ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
by thoſe ſecret hints which the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at one time or other to bring to thy ſpirit, ſome
hint of life, ſome hint of comfort. Surely if thou haſt
obſerved while thou haſt waited upon the Lord,
there hath been ſome ſecrets hints of comfort that
after thou haſt been before the Lord, thou haſt
been at eaſe; and thy trouble is not ſo great as it
was. <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe poured out her ſoul before
the Lord, ſhe was in great diſtreſs, but before ſhe
went away, the Lord heard her prayer; and this
was the ſign there was ſome eaſe in her ſpirit, her
burden was taken off, a great deal refreſhed in
her ſpirit and ſo though the Lord hath given
thee but the leaſt hint of comfort, the Lord hath
heard thy prayer, and in due time he will give a
full anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, thou mayſt know that the Lord hath
heard thy prayer by that <hi>ſtrength he hath given
thee to go thorow:</hi> Thou art under ſore afflictions
and temptations, ſuch as are ready to break thy
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43429:82"/>
very ſpirit, to make thy ſoul fade and faint, and
yet thou art ſupported; thou haſt cryed to the
Lord, and thou ſaiſt thou haſt no anſwer; why, doth
nor the Lord ſupport thee? if the Lord doth ſupport
thee, and bear thee up under thy burden, he doth
in ſome meaſure anſwer thee, or elſe how comes
it to paſs thou haſt not ſunk under thy burden?
when <hi>Paul</hi> beſought the Lord under his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he prayed thrice, that is, often, that God
would take off the Meſſenger of Satan; the
temptation was not taken off, ah but <hi>Paul</hi> was
heard in his prayer, in that the Lord did bear him
up under his temptation, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for
thee;</hi> though I do not think good to remove the
temptation, I have heard thy prayer, <hi>my grace is
ſufficient for thee.</hi> So then remember poor ſoul
that if the Lord hath ſupported thee, the Lord
hath heard thy prayer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, doth the Lord carry on thy ſoul to
<hi>continue in thy prayer?</hi> that although thou haſt
prayed, and met with no anſwer, yet thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
ſtill to go on, and ſayſt, though the Lord
hath not ſpoken one word to me, I will not give
over ſpeaking to him, but my ſoul ſhall ſtill cry
after God. That was the reſolution <hi>David</hi> took
up, Pſal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the
Lord, that I will ſeek after;</hi> I have deſired it,
and though I have not attained it, <hi>I will ſeek after
it as long as I live;</hi> Is it ſo that the Lord doth carry
up thy ſpirit ſtill to wait upon him, and ſtill thou
art crying and breathing after the Lord in prayer?
that very thing is a certain ſign that the Lord hath
heard thy prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:43429:82"/>
Fourthly, doth the Lord enable thee and
make thee <hi>willing to wait upon him?</hi> thou
haſt not a preſent anſwer, yet thou wilt
wait as <hi>David</hi> when he had been at prayer,
he waited for the mercy, Pſalm 27. 14.
<hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall
ſtrengthen thine heart: Wait I ſay, on the Lord.</hi>
Oh my heart, wait I ſay, wait on the Lord: Haſt
thou through grace ſo ſpoken to thine own heart?
I have no anſwer, but I deſire to wait, and I check
mine own heart that I can wait no more quietly,
I ſpeak to mine own heart to wait, I ſay wait
on the Lord; if it be ſo, the Lord hath heard thy
prayer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, obſerve how thy ſpirit, and <hi>how thy
carriage is towards God</hi> in that time of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay:
Is thy heart kept up towards God, and thy
converſation in a way of obedience? that thou
art deſirous ſtill to walk with God, and thou durſt
not go out from God, though God give thee no
anſwer, but thy heart is made more humble, and
thou art more meek, and more obedient, and
more watchful and obſervant of thy heart,
and watchful over thy wayes; is it ſo? the Lord
hath heard thy prayer, though he gives thee no
anſwer.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſay,<note place="margin">The duty of ſuch ſouls to whoſe prayers God is ſilent and gives no anſwer. Firſt to mind their duty.</note> take no care for an anſwer:
I ſpeak to ſuch poor ſouls as have prayed, and
cryed, and have not met with one word of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from the Lord, take no care for an anſwer,
only mind that which is <hi>thy duty,</hi> and let the Lord
alone; he is preparing an anſwer, he is waiting
to be gracious, he waits for a fit ſeaſon, for ſuch
a ſeaſon as his grace and mercy may be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43429:83"/>
be not thou ſo ſolicitous about an anſwer,
but mind what is thy work and thy duty.</p>
               <p>And do thou <hi>hold on thy duty</hi> in praying to
pray, in crying to cry, yea do thou cry louder
then even, and the more Chriſt ſeems to ſtop his
ears, and ſhut his mouth, and give no anſwer,
the louder do thou cry, as this poor woman did,
ver. 25. <hi>Lord help me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, to juſtifie God.</note> this is thy duty while the Lord thus
deals with thee, to <hi>juſtifie God,</hi> and condemn thy
ſelf, clear the Lord, &amp; lay the blame upon thy ſelf;
ſay the Lord is righteous, and the Lord is holy,
and though he make wait me longer and longer, yea
many years for this mercy, yet the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and there is no iniquity in him; the Lord
cried, and I did not hear, and the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
though he makes me wait long; the Lord is
gracious, that he ſpeaks at all to ſuch a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that there is any promiſe that he will give out
an anſwer. Oh juſtifie God, and ſay the Lord is
<hi>holy;</hi> thus did the Pſalmiſt, Pſalm 22. 3. <hi>But
thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the praiſes of
Iſrael;</hi> though thou dealeſt thus with me, <hi>thou
art holy,</hi> thou art juſt, and thou art righteous, and
thou art good and faithful, though ſilent for the
preſent to my prayer; And ſo let us ſay, if the
Lord be ſilent to any of our prayers, yet Lord
thou art holy, thou art righteous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, to maintain good thoughts of God.</note> this is thy duty <hi>labour to maintain
good thoughts of God:</hi> it is not enough to juſtifie,
not to charge God, but to maintain good thoughts
of God at that time that God is ſilent to our
prayers, and do thou believe that God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
good at that time, now is the Lord wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43429:83"/>
to be gracious and preparing an anſwer. Oh
this is a bleſſed frame of heart, and how pleaſing
would it be to God, to believe that he is good,
and that he is gracious, and this very thing it is
for good, for the good of my ſoul, that he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
faith and patience, and try my perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and that he may fit me for mercy, and
mercy for me? Oh that we could entertain
good thoughts of a gracious God when he defers
an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, be looking to God thorow the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</note> be <hi>looking to God through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi>

               <p>Fifthly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Fifthly, wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</note> 
                  <hi>wait patiently for him;</hi> oh
take up a reſolution to wait upon the Lord;

though he ſpeaks not to day nor to morrow,
though he ſpeaks not this month, this year, not
in this opportunity, yet ſay I will wait for the
Lord, I will wait in every ſeaſon, and get upon
the watch-tower, and wait patiently, and ſee which
way Chriſt will come to thy ſoul; know it is thy
duty to wait, take hold of his promiſe, <hi>he is a

waiteth for an opportunity, and therefore it is

to the prayer of the woman, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
her not a word, whereupon
the Diſciples they ſtep in and perform
an office and duty of love for this poor woman
they ſtep in, and they plead with Chriſt for her
<hi>Lord ſend her away, for ſhe crieth after us.</hi> It is
a great queſtion with ſome, whether the Diſciples
did pray for this woman here or no; ſome think
that they did not make any requeſt for her,
there is no mention of any, they only ſay, <hi>Lord

               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:43429:84"/>
But I rather conceive, that the Diſciples in
theſe words did pray for her, they did perform
an office and duty of love, in interceding with
Chriſt for her. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, it ſeems they were very earneſt in
it, <hi>they came and beſought him,</hi> ſaying, ſend her
away; Surely, if it had been only to ſtop her
mouth, to diſpatch her, the Diſciples would not
have been ſo earneſt with Chriſt to beſeech him;
good nature would have taught them more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
and therefore grace teacheth them much
more.</p>
               <p>And then, they ſeem to be affected with
the cry of the woman, <hi>ſhe crieth after</hi> us,
ſend her away, it breaks our hearts the cries that
ſhe makes; <hi>Thou Son of David have mercy on

               </p>
               <p>And thirdly, it is clear and evident in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verſe, from the anſwer that Chriſt gives
upon their ſeeking of him. <hi>I am not ſent but
to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Therefore
it is evident, that the Diſciples did not plead
with Chriſt to ſend her away, to ſtop her mouth,
but they did plead with Chriſt though not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that he would grant her requeſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>truth</hi> then which the words hold forth to
us, is this.
That it is the duty of Chriſts Diſciples to preſent
the conditions of others unto the Lord in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as well as their own.<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We find that <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord was
much in this work, much in praying for others,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43429:85"/>
and interceding for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> upon every occaſion

               <p>And ſo <hi>David</hi> in many of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
the conditions of others unto the Lord.
And our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf who is our
great pattern, was much in the performance of
this duty, <hi>John 17.</hi> you ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd there that the

it was ſpent in praying for others, there is but
one petition that he put for himſelf, in <hi>ver. 1.</hi> and

Diſciples, for thoſe that were converted, and for
thoſe that did belong to God that were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
Many requeſts the Lord Jeſus makes in
the behalf of others, and but one for himſelf.
And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a follower of

<hi>Rom. 1. 9.</hi> he did appeal to God, that

2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>I thank God whom I ſerve from my

Paul</hi> did remember others before the Lord.</p>

you, Firſt, <hi>who</hi> they are that we are bound to pray

               <p>Secondly, <hi>what are the ſpecial time</hi> we are

               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:43429:85"/>
If you ask,<note place="margin">Who Gods people are bound to pray for.</note> who they are that we are bound to
pray for.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are bound to pray for them that have
done us wrong; a hard leſſon, but a leſſon that
Chriſts Diſciples muſt learn; we muſt pray for
thoſe that have done us wrong, that have done
evil, and ſpoken evil of us. See what our Saviour
Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 5. 44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love
your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uſe you, and perſecute you:</hi> See here, out of
Chriſts own mouth this is our duty, if we be
Chriſts Diſciples we muſt pray for them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
us, and deſpitefully uſe us, we ſhould go
to the Lord, and beſeech the Lord to forgive
them; thus did Chriſt, <hi>Father, forgive them,
they know not what they do.</hi> We ſhould pray that
the Lord would open their eyes, that the
Lord would turn their hearts to himſelf firſt,
and then to us: Brethren, ſuch a prayer is
very welcome to the Lord, as welcome as
moſt prayers that his people can make,
when you ſhall from the heart pray to the
Lord for thoſe that injured you, and done you
wrong, ſuch a prayer ſeldom goes unrequited.
Sometimes the Lord gives in the ſoul of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at the requeſt of his people; and oh what a
choice mercy will that be, if thou mayſt gain the
soul of an enemy, if a ſoul may be delivered
from going down to the pit, why the Lord many
times gives in the ſoul of an enemy; but if the
Lord ſhould not give in the ſoul of an enemy,
that prayer ſhall not go unrewarded; it may be
ſometimes the Lord will give in the ſoul of a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43429:86"/>
friend, thou goeſt to God, and thou prayeſt for
ſuch an enemy, Lord forgive ſuch an enemy, Lord
open his eyes, and turn his heart, and forgive his
tranſgreſſion; if the Lord does not grant that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
it may be the Lord will give in the ſoul of
a child or ſome of thy relations, becauſe thou
haſt found in thy heart to pray for an enemy, or
elſe the Lord will reward that prayer by giving
out more of himſelf; thou beggeſt for an enemy,
if the Lord do not that, the Lord will give thee
more grace, more of his Spirit, the Lord it may
be, will cauſe his face to ſlaine more upon
thee, while thou at his commandment, and for
his ſake canſt find in thy heart to pray for them
that are thy enemies, and have done thee wrong;
thou haſt prayed for an enemy, and I will be a
friend to thee, ſaith the Lord, I will ſhew thee
more friendſhip, more of my face; this is the
firſt thing: Oh that the Lord would teach us to
practiſe it, it is our duty to pray for thoſe that
have done us wrong.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be our duty to pray for thoſe
that have done us wrong, then it is our duty to
pray for ſuch as the Lord hath made inſtruments
to do us good. Creatures they are but inſtruments,
and all the glory is due to God alone; ah, but
God is to be ſought to for the inſtrument, hath
the Lord done us good by ſuch an inſtrument, in
reſpect of our ſouls in a word of counſel and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
we are to pray for them. When
God made uſe of <hi>Abigail</hi> in giving a word
of counſel to <hi>David,</hi> how did he bleſs the Lord
and pray to God for her, 1 Sam. 25. 32, 33. And
<hi>David ſad to Abigail, bleſſed be the Lord God of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43429:86"/>
which ſent thee this day to meet me, and bleſſed be
thy advice, and bleſſed be thou</hi> &amp;c. And ſo hath
the Lord made any inſtrumental any way to do us
good in the outward man, to give any refreſhment,
we are bound to remember them before the
Lord; thus did <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 1. 16. The Lord
give mercy unto the houſe of</hi> Oneſiphorus, <hi>for he
oft refreſhed me, and was not aſhamed of my chains.
Oneſiphorus</hi> was a means of refreſhing <hi>Paul</hi> in
his bonds, and <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon it as his duty to
remember him before the Lord, he begs a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for him and his houſhold; <hi>The Lord grant
mercy to the houſe of</hi> Oneſiphorus; it is our duty
to remember thoſe before the Lord, that have been
uſed as inſtruments to do us good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is our duty to remember before the
Lord even thoſe that are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to us, thoſe that
we have not known, if we know their conditions.
If the Lord hath brought the condition of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to us, if the condition of ſtrangers be a ſad
condition, we are bound to remember them, and
to preſent their condition before the Lord; and
thus did the Diſciples here in the Text, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhe was a ſtranger to them, they never ſaw
her face before, ſhe was of a ſtrange Nation, one
of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> and yet when the ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this woman was brought before them, and
they heard her cry, their hearts were moved with
compaſſion, and they beſought Chriſt for her.
<hi>Lord ſend her away,</hi> Lord grant her requeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And the Lord layd a great charge upon his people
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould remember ſtrangers, and
not oppreſs ſtrangers, but ſhew kindneſs to them;
and this is one part of the duty we owe to them,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43429:87"/>
to remember them, and if in any ſad condition,
we are bound to preſent them and their condition
before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If it be a duty to remember Strangers,
then much more to remember our own <hi>Relations,</hi>
and to preſent them before the Lord. All our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
what ever they be, as we ſtand related to
others in Political Societies, there is an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to remember them before the Lord, a mutual
tye betwixt the Magiſtrate and the people, and they
are bound to pray one for another, godly Magiſtrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and godly people are bound to remember one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
You know King <hi>Solomon</hi> he was one that
feared the Lord, and he was very much in praying
for the people, <hi>1 Kings 8. 22.</hi> he ſpent much
time in prayer: And ſo back again it is the peoples
duty to remember their Governours; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
lays it upon Chriſtians as their duty, <hi>1 Tim.
2. 1. I exhort therefore that firſt of all, ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be
made for all men,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>for Kings, and for all,
that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty:</hi> In this
relation, there is a mutual tie to remember one
another before the Lord.</p>
               <p>And if we come to Family-ſocieties, there we
ſhall ſee relations are bound to remember one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
before the Lord; the relation of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Wife, Parents and Children, Maſters
and Servants, the Scripture holds it forth as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
incumbent upon all Chriſtians to remember
their relations mutually before the Lord. Husbands
are bound to remember their wives, to preſent their
condition before the Lord: <hi>Iſaac</hi> prayed for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43429:87"/>
Gen. 25. 21.</hi> and at his requeſt the Lord
was entreated; and ſo back again, the wife is
bound to remember the husband. And ſo in the
relation of parents, parents are bound often to
preſent their children before the Lord; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Job</hi> is given for our imitation, <hi>Job 1. 5.
And it was ſo, when the dayes of their feaſting were
gone about, that</hi> Job <hi>ſent and ſanctified them, and
roſe up early in the morning, and offered burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
according to the number of them all: for</hi>
Job <hi>ſaid, it may be that my ſons have ſinned,
and curſed God in their hearts; thus did</hi> Job <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi>
See <hi>Job</hi> preſented them all one by one
before the Lord, and begged mercy for them, and
that the Lord would take away the guilt of ſin
which they might contract while they were feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in one anothers houſe. And ſo good old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
performed this duty for his children, even then
when he lay a dying, he called for all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Gen. 49.</hi> he called them one by one, and
prayed for a ſpecial bleſſing to be upon their
heads. Parents are bound to remember their
children, and children many times miſcarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
parents are no more in doing their duty, no
more crying to the Lord in the behalf of their
children; and ſo back again children are bound
to remember their parents. And ſo in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Maſters and ſervants, Maſters are bound
to pray for their ſervants; you know that inſtance
of the Centurion, he came to <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the behalf
of his ſervant, and was very earneſt with Chriſt,
that Chriſt would be pleaſed to heal his ſervant;
this is a duty that is little performed by many
Maſters, they think if they can have their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43429:88"/>
to work for them, it is all that they have to
look after, but let ſuch Maſters know that God
will require an account of ſervants ſouls; have
you inſtructed them, and have you preſented them
often in your prayers before the Lord? the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi>
came for the body of his ſervant, and it is
our duty to come often to the Lord for the ſouls
of our ſervants; and ſo back again it is the duty of
ſervants to pray for their Maſters. And thus you
ſee the fourth particular, That it is our duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
all our relations before the Lord. There
is one relation more, and that is our <hi>Spiritual rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which I ſhall touch before I end that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
ſuch as ſtand in relation one to another in
<hi>Church-ſociety,</hi> they are bound often to remember
one anothers conditions before the Lord, <hi>James
5. 14, 15, 16. Confeſs your faults one to another, and
pray one for another;</hi> yea in Church-ſocieties, it is
eſpecially the duty of Paſtors and Elders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their flock, and it is the duty of the
people to remember their Elders, and to pray
often to the Lord in their behalf. Faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are bound often to pray for their people;
remember what is ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>For
God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in
the Goſpel of his ſon, that without ceaſing I make
mention of you alwayes in my prayers.</hi> When ever
he came to God, he was mindful of the Church,
I am alwayes mindfull of you without ceaſing:
and indeed the profiting of a people, and the
ſtedfaſtneſs of a people in the faith, and in the
truth, and in the wayes of God, it is the glory,
and the crown, and the joy and rejoycing of a
faithful Teacher; and therefore ſurely it is their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43429:88"/>
duty often to remember their people before the
Lord, and ſo it is the peoples duty to remember
their Paſtor and Teacher. The Apoſtle lays it
upon them as their duty, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 18, 19. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes with all prayer and ſupplication in the
Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance
and ſupplication for all Saints, and for me, that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
may be given unto me, that I may open my
mouth boldly, to make known the myſterie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
It is your duty (ſaith he) to pray for all
Saints, and for <hi>me in particular,</hi> that I may
open my mouth boldly, to make known the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Goſpel; for many times Satans great
deſign is to overthrow them that the Lord hath ſet
to go before his people. Satans great deſign is to
hinder the work of God in their hand, to make
ſuch to fall, and therefore the Lords people had
need to pray the more earneſtly; for even the
beſt of the Teachers and Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
they are but empty pipes in themſelves, and
can afford no more then the Lord is pleaſed to
drop in from above; and therefore there is need
that the Lord ſhould be dropping in continually,
or elſe they cannot bring forth bread in due ſeaſon,
and make proviſion for the people, if the Lord do
not fill them from heaven; yea the beſt of Teachers
have need of teaching, though they know never
ſo much they have need of more knowledge, they
have need of more ſtrength, and therefore it is
the duty of the people to remember them before
the Lord, that the Lords <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
may be with them. Thus in all relations it is our
duty mutually to remember one another before
the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:43429:89"/>
Fifthly, it is our duty to remember thoſe that
for the preſent are <hi>ſtrangers to Chriſt:</hi> You will
ſay, what, are we to pray for ſuch as have
not the knowledge of God? yea it is our duty
to remember them; if the Lord hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to make us to differ, and called us out from
the number of thoſe Gentiles who know not God,
oh we are bound to pity them, and to pray for
them, whoſe condition is ſuch as never was rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, as the heath in the deſert, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſad, and we ſhould remember them before
the Lord, that God would ſend forth his light and
truth to them, that they that deny Chriſt, in word,
in profeſſion, and converſation, that they may be
brought home to the knowledge of the Son of
God, <hi>Pſal. 67. 1, 2. God be merciful unto us, and
bleſs us, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us. That
thy way may be known upon earth, thy ſaving health
among all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many Nations, and great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that to this day know not God and
Chriſt, that ſit in darkneſs, and periſh for want
of viſion; and truly they who through free-grace
do know any thing of God, they are bound to
pity them that ſit in darkneſs, and to pray that
the Nations may know the ſaving truth, and the
way of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if it be a duty to pray for thoſe that are
ſtrangers to Chriſt, then it is a duty to pray for
thoſe that are <hi>Chriſts friends;</hi> for all that know
the Lord, and love the Lord in ſincerity, <hi>Epheſ.
6. 18. Praying alwayes with all prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with
all perſeverance and ſupplication for all Saints:</hi> It is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43429:89"/>
our duty to remember all <hi>Saints,</hi> to remember
them that are ſcattered, to remember them that
are gathered: <hi>all Saints,</hi> we ſhould remember
them in our prayer before the Lord, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Jeruſalem, Sions Aſſemblies</hi> they ſhould be
remembred, <hi>Pſal. 122. 6, 7. Pray for the peace
of</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee. Peace
be within thy wals, and proſperity within thy palaces.</hi>
You ſee <hi>Jeruſalem, Sions</hi> Aſſemblies in a ſpecial
manner ſhould be remembred by us in our addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to the Lord. And ſo <hi>Pſalm 14.</hi> you may ſee how
the Pſalmiſt doth expreſs himſelf in the behalf of
<hi>Sion: Oh that the ſalvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were come out
of Sion!</hi> oh that the Lord would haſten the time
that he will ſave his people, and <hi>Sion</hi> be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and built up; Oh that the time were come.
And in <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi> he doth expreſs, that when he had
been praying for himſelf, yet he did not forget <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Pſal. 51. 18. <hi>Do good in thy good pleaſure unto</hi>
Sion, <hi>build thou the walls of</hi> Jeruſalem. So that
you ſee that hath been ſpoken to, who they are
that we are bound to pray for.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What are the ſpecial times in which we are bound to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber others before the Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>what are the ſpecial times</hi> in which
we are bound to remember others, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
their conditions before the Lord.</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt of all, when they have <hi>ſinned a
ſin</hi> againſt the Lord: When we ſee any that have
ſinned greatly againſt the Lord, that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the Lord, eſpecially ſuch as have the name
of God and Chriſt upon them, oh then it is time
for us to ſtep in and plead hard with God for
them. So did <hi>Moſes</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſinned a
great ſin in making the <hi>Molten calf,</hi> then he ſteps
in, and cries hard to the Lord; nay this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43429:90"/>
as a duty, <hi>1 John 5. 16. If any man ſee his
brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall ask,
and he ſhall give him life for, them that ſin not unto
death.</hi> If it be not a ſinning wilfully, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
perſecution of the Truth that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
why then if a man ſee his brother ſin, he
ſhall ask and give his brother life. It is a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſe, and a great encouragement to go to
the Lord one for another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in time of <hi>great affliction,</hi> when the
Lord lays his hand heavy upon others either on the
outward or inward man, it is our duty then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, and to preſent their conditions
before the Lord; in time of great calamity, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
calamity upon a nation, it is a duty of Gods
people to preſent the condition of their people
before the Lord. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did preſent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the people before the Lord, when the
hand of the Lord was ſore upon them: And ſo
when God doth lay any great affliction upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
then it is our duty to remember them, and
preſent their condition before the Lord. <hi>David</hi>
did ſo for his enemies when they were ſick (ſaith
he) <hi>I put on ſack cloth, and I faſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in time of <hi>perſecution,</hi> that is a ſpecial
time to preſent the conditions of others before
the Lord; when we ſee any that are perſecuted
for righteouſneſs ſake: When the Church was
perſecuted in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the Diſciples caſt
into priſon, then the Church prayed, then Gods
people did look upon it as their duty to pray, &amp; to
pray more earneſtly then ever they had done. And
ſo when the Apoſtle was in bonds, he ſent to them
that they would earneſtly ſeek God for him, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43429:90"/>
he might hold cloſe to the truth, that he might
not deny the truth nor Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when as the Lord <hi>threatens to go away</hi>
from a people, when a God threatens to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his preſence from a people, or from a ſoul,
oh then it is the duty of others to remember them
before the Lord. When God threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> oh then <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſteps in, and
he is pleading with the Lord. And ſo when God
threatned, and was about to caſt off the <hi>Jews</hi> after
they had rejected Chriſt, oh how doth the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> ſtep in, and cry earneſtly to God, <hi>Rom. 10. 1.
Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>is that they might he ſaved.</hi> When God
threatens to go away from a ſoul or people, oh
then it is time for the people of God to ſtep in,
and to plead hard with God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, another time in which we are
bound to remember others, is when we ſee God
coming towards any in a way of mercy. When
the Lord was coming towards the <hi>Jews</hi> in a way
mercy, he ſtirred up <hi>Daniel</hi> to pray for them, &amp; to
cry earneſtly to the Lord for them, when he came
to underſtand that the time of deliverance was
not far off, but mercy a coming, ſalvation a coming,
then he cried, and cried more earneſtly then ever
he had done, he ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord by
faſting and prayer: When we ſee God a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards any people in a way of mercy; when
God comes towards a friend and relation in a way
of mercy, when we ſee God is beginning to
work, and to move upon their ſpirits, oh it is a
duty for thoſe relations that know the Lord, to
ſtep in and to cry earneſtly to God, yea then to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43429:91"/>
go forth and meet the Lord, and to intreat the
Lord that that work may not go back, but that he
would help it on.<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I ſhall not have time for the
Application, onely this one uſe I ſhall leave with
you.</p>
               <p>That if it be the duty of Gods people to pray
for others, a duty to remember one another, then
it will follow from hence, that it is our duty to
<hi>acquaint others with our conditions.</hi> If it be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for others to pray for us, then it is our duty for
us to to acquaint them with our conditions, or
elſe how can they ſeek God in our behalf; if it
be their duty to pray, it is our duty to beg their
prayers, and there are ſome times in which it doth
lye more eſpecially upon us to beg prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they would ſtep in and plead with
God. I ſhall in a few words ſhew you what
thoſe times are that we are bound more eſpecially
to call others into our help to ſeek the Lord for us.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">What thoſe times are that we are bound more eſpecially to call upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſeek the Lord for us.</note> when the Lord doth lay the <hi>guilt of ſin</hi>
heavy upon the ſpirit, when the guilt of ſin lieth
ſo heavy upon a mans conſcience that it cannot be
removed, he hath tryed all private means, and ſtill
his ſpirit is ſo oppreſſed as he knows not how to
ſtand under it, then it is a duty to call in the help
of others; <hi>Confeſs your ſins one to another, and
pray one for another,</hi> James 5. and he maketh a
gracious promiſe that in ſuch a caſe he will hear.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are eſpecially bound to ask the
prayers of thoſe <hi>whom we have offended.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Lord will not be appeaſed till we have
begged the prayers of thoſe whom we have
wronged; this was the caſe of <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> when
he had wronged <hi>Abraham</hi> in taking away his wife
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43429:91"/>
                  <hi>Sarah.</hi> The Lord ſmote <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> and God
doth adviſe <hi>Abimeleck</hi> to go to <hi>Abraham</hi> to
pray for him, <hi>Gen. 20. 6, 7.</hi> And Abraham <hi>did
pray for</hi> Abimeleck, and God did hear the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Abimeleck, Gen. 20. 17.</hi>
And ſo the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they come to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
when as they had ſinned againſt the Lord, and
murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they deſired that
<hi>Moſes</hi> would pray for them, and <hi>Moſes</hi> did pray
for them, <hi>Numbers 21. 7.</hi> and the Lord was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for them.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was the caſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
them to go to <hi>Job,</hi> and he ſhall pray for
you, and ſaith God, <hi>I will hear him,</hi> Job 42. 8.
you have ſinned againſt me, and have had
hard thoughts of <hi>Job,</hi> and have been ſad comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to <hi>Job,</hi> but go to <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſhall pray for
you, and I will hear <hi>Job.</hi> Oh! when we have
wronged others, in ſuch a caſe it is our duty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our offences, and to entreat that they
would ſeek the Lord for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when as the Lord <hi>lays any heavy ſtroke
upon us,</hi> our affliction is ſo heavy as we know not
how to bear it our ſelves; truly it is wiſdom then,
and a duty to call in help, in great afflictions we
are to requeſt the prayers of others: The Apoſtle
gives this direction, that ſuch as were members of
Churches that when they were afflicted, <hi>they
ſhould ſend for the Elders of the Church, and that
they ſhould pray for them,</hi> James 5. 14, 15. And
the Lord he promiſeth that he would give out
healing; in great afflictions we are to call in the
help of others, members of the Churches they
ought to ſend for the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43429:92"/>
that in time of affliction they may pray for them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when <hi>we are nigh ſome great danger,</hi>
liable to danger either in the outward or inward
man, or to walk in ſome dangerous wayes, or
when we are by providence put upon ſuch wayes
as we may meet with ſhares and temptations,
where there is any danger, then it lies upon us
to call in the help of others. So <hi>Eſther 4. 16, 17.</hi>
ſhe was in great danger, there was a Law that
whoſoever went into the King, and was not called,
muſt be put to death, and the cauſe was ſo, that
ſhe muſt go in to ſpeak with the King though it
ſhould coſt her her life, and therefore ſhe ſendeth
to <hi>Mordecai</hi> to gather the Jews that are preſent in
<hi>Shuſhan,</hi> and <hi>faſt ye for me, pray for me,</hi> for it
may coſt me my life, therefore I deſire you to faſt
and pray for me.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when the Lord calls his people to ſome
great ſervice, ſome work that may be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory: So <hi>Eſther</hi> when ſhe was about
ſome great work, faſt for me, faſt and pray, and
I will ſpeak to the King.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, when the Lord doth ſeem to ſhut us
up that we cannot pray our ſelves, our condition
may be ſo: Sometimes through weakneſs we are
not able, and ſometimes when the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
his Spirit, we are not able to pray our
ſelves, that our prayers are but like <hi>Hezekiahs,</hi>
like the chattering of a Crane or Swallow, then
in ſuch caſes it is a duty to ſend to others, and
call upon others; when we cannot pray our

               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, when the <hi>Lord ſeems to be
angry</hi> with any people, when the diſpleaſure of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43429:92"/>
the Lord waxes hot and heavy, and we do not know
how to bear it, it is hard then to go to God as to a
Father, our ſelves, and therefore then we had
need call in others to our help. When the wrath
of the Lord was kindled againſt the children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> then <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtept it, then he cryed to God
for them, for they could not look to the Lord as
to their Father, the wrath of the Lord was hot;
and at that time it is our wiſdom and a duty for
poor ſouls to call in others that they may cry to
the Lord in their behalf.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have heard of this womans <hi>faith,</hi>
and the <hi>firſt tryal of it:</hi> Chriſt tries
her faith by being <hi>ſilent,</hi> and giving no
anſwer unto her requeſt; it was a ſore
temptation that the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the merciful
King ſhould not open his mouth, nor ſpeak one
word for the refreſhment of a poor diſtreſſed
creature: When ſhe poured out her complaint, he
anſwer'd her not a word; that is a great temptation.
You have heard alſo how the Diſciples ſtept in,
and beſought Chriſt in her behalf, they came and
beſought him that he would ſend her away with
an anſwer, with an anſwer of peace, certainly that
was their requeſt.</p>
               <p>But behold here is a <hi>ſecond temptation,</hi> here is a
<hi>ſecond trial</hi> of this womans faith: Chriſt firſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43429:93"/>
tries her by being ſilent, and now he tries her
by <hi>ſpeaking a hard word</hi> as it ſeems, <hi>I am not ſent,
but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>I <hi>am not ſent,</hi> Chriſt intimates that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with this woman, it was beſides his
Commiſſion, I cannot do it ſaith Chriſt, I muſt
walk by rule, I muſt obſerve my Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
I muſt do that work, and that work only
which I was ſent for, but now I was not ſent, but
<hi>to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, my work is
to do good to a certain number of perſons, to
ſhew mercy to a certain number of perſons,
that are given me of my Father. He calls them
here <hi>ſheep, Chriſts ſheep,</hi> I am ſent for their ſakes,
and to do good to them, though termed ſheep:
Now the Scripture holds them forth to be ſuch as
were given him of his Father from Eternity, <hi>all
that are given to Chriſt, are Chriſts ſheep,</hi> though
they may not for the preſent have Chriſts mark
upon them, though Chriſt does not own them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world, yet he owns them before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
all that belong to the election of grace
they are Chriſts ſheep, and Chriſt ſaith, he was
ſent to ſuch, <hi>I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep,</hi> they
are in a <hi>loſt condition,</hi> even that number of perſons
that are given to Chriſt, they are <hi>loſt in</hi> Adam,
and they have <hi>loſt themſelves</hi> by going on in the
wayes of actual tranſgreſſion, they are in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
loſt condition, Chriſts ſheep; but Chriſt
was ſent to do good to them, Chriſt was ſent to
ſave them; <hi>The Son of man came to ſeek and to
ſave them which were loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:43429:94"/>
The <hi>houſe of</hi> Iſrael may here be taken literally,
for the people of the Jews which are called the
houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Chriſt tells the Diſciples and
this woman, that his Commiſſion was to do good
only to them, I am not ſent to others, I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent <hi>to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, my
work is with the Jews, I have nothing to do with
the Gentiles; No, my work is to gather in the
loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, how doth this agree with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures, with thoſe propheſies that concern the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi> our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that when <hi>he came
he ſhould preach to the Gentiles,</hi> and that <hi>God
would give him to be a Covenant to the Gentiles,</hi>
Iſaiah 42. 1, 2, 6. And in divers places there are
propheſies that concern the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that when
Chriſt came God would <hi>give him to be a light to the
Gentiles</hi> as well as to the Jews? why then doth
Christ ſay, <hi>he was not ſent but to the loſt ſheep
of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt ſpake firſt of all, of his
<hi>perſonal Ministry;</hi> as he preacht himſelf in
perſon, and wrought miracles himſelf, ſo he was
ſent unto the Jews, his word was to them, he was
their Apoſtle, their Miniſter; ſo the Apoſtle to
the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 15. 8. Now I ſay
that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſe
made unto the Fathers.</hi> Chriſt was to preach in
his own perſon to the Jews, he was their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
and ſo in that reſpect, he was not ſent,
but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be ſaid that Chriſt was not
ſent to the Gentiles, but to the loſt ſheep of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43429:94"/>
houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>that order that God
the Father had appointed for the diſpenſation of his
light, and of his grace and Spirit among the ſons of
men.</hi> God had appointed that firſt of all Chriſt
ſhould come to the Jews, and mercy firſt ſhould
be tendred to them, and grace be firſt brought to
that people; ſo Chriſts firſt work was to the
Jews, I am not ſent but to them, that is, I am
<hi>firſt</hi> ſent to them, and <hi>chiefly</hi> ſent to them; my
firſt work is here in <hi>Judea:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Chriſt did not ſend him to baptize, but to
preach,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize,
but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> that is, I was <hi>firſt</hi> ſent about
this work, for he was ſent to baptize, for he did
baptize, but my <hi>firſt work</hi> was to preach. And ſo
here, ſaith Chriſt, I was not ſent to the Gentiles,
but to the Jews, that is <hi>firſtly</hi> and <hi>chiefly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, or in reſpect of <hi>time:</hi> It is true, Chriſt
was not ſent, that is, he was not <hi>then</hi> ſent; his
preſent work was not to preach to the Gentiles,
and ſhew mercy to the Gentiles, no, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
There was a time, when Chriſt did not go
himſelf to the Gentiles, and did not ſhew mercy
to the Gentiles; nay he forbad his Apoſtles and
his Diſciples: <hi>Go not into the way of the
Gentiles, but go ye rather to the loſt ſheep of the
houſe of</hi> Iſrael. So that there was a time when it
pleaſed the Lord not to ſend the Goſpel, but to
reſtrain it from the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But there was a time alſo when Chriſt did ſend
forth his glorious Goſpel to the Gentiles; ſo that
you ſee in what reſpect Chriſt ſpeaks here, <hi>He
was not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi>
Iſrael,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:43429:95"/>
I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe
of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a ſeeming denial that Chriſt gives to
this woman; he ſeems to tell her plainly, that he
cannot do it for her, it was beſides his preſent
work and commiſſion, he was not ſent to do it;
there is the denyal. Nay the tryal was the greater,
in that Chriſt anſwers thus not only to the <hi>womans
requeſt,</hi> but to the <hi>Diſciples requeſt;</hi> this heightens
the temptation and tryal, and maketh it the
greater: So long as this woman ſaw that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
were pleading for her ſhe might have
hope, though there was no ground of hope as to
her requeſt, Chriſt being ſilent thereunto, yet it
might revive her ſpirit to ſee his Diſciples ſtep in,
and they to improve their intereſt in Chriſt: But
when Chriſt ſhall not only give a denial to the
woman, but to the Diſciples, this was a ſore try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:
if the Lord had not mightily ſtrengthened her
faith, ſhe could never have held up her head, ſhe
would have concluded, oh alas, my eſtate and
condition it is ſad, it is in vain for me to expect
any ſalvation, any mercy, he is ſilent at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and he gives a denyal, when his Diſciples
pray for me; and if God will not hear his own
people, why then ſurely my condition is ſad, thus
lay the temptation, and yet the Lord ſupported
this womans ſpirit.</p>
               <p>So that we may obſerve this;
That God ſometimes doth ſeem not only to be ſilent
at the prayers of his people when they cry
themſelves,<note place="margin">Doctr. 1.</note> but he giveth a denial when others
ſtep in and pray for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:43429:95"/>
Nay obſerve,
<hi>That</hi> after a ſoul hath waited upon God in the uſe
of the means,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> when it hath prayed and hath
believed, and when it hath called in the help
of others prayers, yet the Lord may ſeem to
give a denial, and the condition may ſeem to
be worſe, and the temptation ſeem to riſe higher
even after a ſoul hath waited upon God in the
uſe of means, and yet the Lord may have a
gracious deſign towards the ſoul.</p>
               <p>For mark it, this womans condition was worſe
now then ever it was; the Diſciples had prayed
for her, and yet even after this Chriſt ſeems to
give a flat denial, and tells them that he cannot
do it for her, it was beſides his commiſſion, he
was not ſent to do it. So that after the uſe of
means, after her own prayer, and the Diſciples
prayer, this woman meets with a flat denial, and
yet the Lord Jeſus had a deſign of mercy to this
poor woman.</p>
               <p>Yea, it is Gods ordinary way to his people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have uſed the means to remove ſuch a
burden, ſuch a temptation, ſuch a corruption,
they have gone to the Lord, they have waited,
they have believed, and called in the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and yet temptations grow high, and yet
notwithſtanding that, the Lord my have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of mercy. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they
were in the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> under bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, they cried to the Lord, and the Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

cried to the Lord as well as they, as they pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:43429:96"/>
ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, he prayed for them, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Moſes</hi> was come, the people were not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but their burdens and oppreſſions grew
heavier and heavier, never ſo oppreſſed, as when
<hi>Moſes</hi> came to deliver them, when they cried
themſelves, and <hi>Moſes</hi> cried, and waited upon
God in the uſe of means, yet their bondage grew
greater and greater; ſo it was with them, and
yet God had a deſign of mercy towards
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo in</hi> Mark 1. 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>At</hi> ver. 23.
<hi>you read of one that had an unclean Spirit: And</hi>
there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean
Spirit, and be cried out,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 24.</hi> Saying, let us alone, what have we to
do with thee, thou Jeſus of Nazareth? art thou
come to deſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, the
holy one of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 25.</hi> And Jeſus rebuked him, ſaying, hold
thy peace and come out of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver. 26.</hi> And when the unclean Spirit had torn
him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of
him.</p>
               <p>Mark, when he applyed himſelf to Chriſt for
deliverance, while Chriſt was ſpeaking the word,
commanding the unclean ſpirit to go out, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the affliction begin to wax greater and
greater, and the devil he rageth the more; and
yet notwithſtanding mercy is not far off, Chriſt
had a deſign of mercy: And ſo doth God deal
many times with his own people upon the uſe of
means; it is poſſible their afflictions may increaſe,
their temptations may increaſe, and corruptions
wax ſtronger and ſtronger, and yet God have a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43429:96"/>
gracious deſign towards them, and deliverance
may not be far off.</p>
               <p>It is true,<note place="margin">Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> that Satan he hath a deſign, and hath
a hand in it; ah but God alſo hath a deſign, and
Gods deſign is a gracious deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay what is Satans deſign, and
what doth Satan intend?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, Satans deſign is firſt of all, <hi>to take
off the ſoul from the uſe of the means,</hi> to make the
ſoul undervalue the means, and to caſt off the
means. Thus he tempts poor creatures that have
prayed, and have met with no anſwer, but they
are worſe; others have prayed for them, and yet
they grow worſe and worſe, why then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
to undervalue the means; for while a ſoul
is thus waiting upon God in Gods way, mercy is
not far off; therefore the Devils great deſign is
to drive the ſoul out of Gods way. What is
prayer? and why will ye pray any longer? you
are never the better for your own prayers, nor
the better for others prayers; and thus the Devil
diſcourageth the ſoul from waiting upon God in
the uſe of the means.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> Satans deſign is, <hi>to drive the ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the rock of deſpair,</hi> to make a ſoul to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his confidence: Why will you hope any
longer, and pray any longer? you ſee all is in vain,
God heareth not your prayers, God heareth not
others for you; others have prayed and cried in
your behalf, and there is no anſwer, and your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
is greater then before, and therefore why
ſhould you wait any longer? Satans great deſign
is to make a ſoul caſt away all his hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to daſh and break it in pieces upon tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
rock.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:43429:97"/>
But now, God hath a deſign of mercy in it,
though it be ſo that the affliction grow greater
and greater after the uſe of means, yet God hath
a deſign of mercy. For by that.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>God will teach the ſoul not to rest
upon the means, but upon himſelf.</hi> Satans deſign is
to draw the creature from the uſe of means, and
Gods deſign is to draw the creature more to the
uſe of means. And truly we are ready to drive
our ſelves upon this work, either to caſt off
prayer, or elſe to reſt upon the means; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that a poor ſoul is ſo caſt down when as it
hath been waiting upon God in the uſe of means,
hath been praying, looking to the promiſe, and
hath been calling in the help of others. I ſay,
we are apt in this caſe to ſhew forth the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our ſpirits, which doth evidence that we
look too much to the means: We think prayer
ſhould ſave us, and upon the uſe of means if the
Lord doth not come in, we are murmuring; Now
the Lord will teach us this, to uſe the means, but not
to reſt upon the means, but to reſt upon himſelf,
upon his arm for ſalvation, and upon his free grace,
and not upon any means.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath this deſign, when the
condition of the creature ſeems to grow worſe
and worſe after the uſe of the means, why the
Lord doth not preſently help it, is becauſe <hi>that he
will appear at ſuch a time when his work of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will be most glorious.</hi> He will come in
the moſt ſeaſonable time, when as deliverance
ſhall be moſt welcome, and that is, at ſuch a time
when all means fail, when the creature hath tryed
all means whatſoever: As the woman that had the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43429:97"/>
iſſue of blood, ſhe went from Phyſitian to Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and yet the worſe. Oh the cure from the
hand of Chriſt was welcome. And ſo when the
poor man brought his ſon to the Diſciples, he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all means, and the Diſciples could not caſt the
Devil out: Oh when all means failed, that was the
time for Chriſt to ſtep in. The Lord will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at ſuch a ſeaſon, when poor creatures are
brought to the loweſt ſtate, when a poor ſoul ſaith,
Lord we have uſed ſuch and ſuch means, but ſtill
worſe and worſe; oh Lord <hi>we know not what to
do, but our eyes are towards thee.</hi> Oh this is a
time that the Lord will draw nigh to his
people.</p>
               <p>And therefore to reflect a little upon this;
doth God make this to be the condition of any of
you? have we been under ſome great affliction
and burden, and ſome great temptation, and
have been uſing all means, and ſtill we find it
grow worſe and worſe according to our own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
worſe after prayer then before, more
temptations after prayer then before, more temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
after looking to the promiſe then before?
if this be thy condition, be not diſcouraged, for
this hath been the condition of many of Gods
people. This was the condition of the woman of
<hi>Canaan</hi> here before thee, ſhe was worſe after
prayer then before, ſhe was worſe after the
Diſciples had prayed for her, then ſhe meets with
a flat denial, and Chriſt ſaith to her, <hi>that he was
not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
This was the condition of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and yet the Lord Jeſus he loveth this woman, and
he had an intent to ſhew mercy to this woman,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43429:98"/>
and to grant her requeſt. And therefore if this
be your condition, oh take heed of the Devils
deſign; the Devils deſign (as you heard before)
is to make you undervalue the means, and to drive
you to deſpair; take heed of the Devils deſign.
And though this ſhould be your condition, do not
think the worſe of the Ordinance of God, do not
think the worſe of prayer, the worſe of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and do not think the worſe of the prayers
of others, do not think the worſe of ſearching
the Scripture, and of applying your ſelves to the
promiſes, do not think the worſe of theſe things,
it is the Devils deſign to make you undervalue the
means. And take heed that you do not now
caſt away all hope, Satan will tell you that there is
no hope concerning you; the ſervants of God
have prayed for you, and now no hope: Oh know
that that temptation will drive you upon the rock
of deſpair; but oh that you would look to God,
and know that he hath a deſign of mercy towards
you, nay in this very thing that it is worſe and
worſe with you, he hath a deſign of mercy in it,
he will draw you off from reſting upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and reſting upon means, and the Lord will
now teach you to reſt upon himſelf, and God will
come in when it ſhall be moſt welcome. Oh
therefore in ſuch a condition we ſhould ſet faith a
work, though to ſence we ſeem to be worſe and
worſe, and deliverance further off then ever,
worſe after prayer then before prayer, oh yet we
ſhould ſet faith a work, for faith will ſee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
is near, and conclude it, becauſe it is
Gods way in which he walks towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were moſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43429:98"/>
grievouſly oppreſſed by the Egyptians, then the
Lord handed out deliverance; O ſoul, though
the clouds do ſeem to gather, and it be darker
with thee then ever, yet ſay, I will wait upon the
Lord in his way, and I will be found praying ſtill,
and calling in the help of others ſtill. Oh that
we might ſet faith a work, and we ſhould ſee
that Gods ſalvation were neer. But I ſhall paſs
from this.</p>
               <p>I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of
Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Chriſt tells this woman that he cannot do it for
her, becauſe it did not lie in his Commiſſion, to
which he muſt be faithful, he could not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his Commiſſion: What may we learn from
hence?</p>
               <p>We may take notice of this <hi>Hiſtorical Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi>
                  <hi>That</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all he did,<note place="margin">Hiſtorical Propoſition.</note> he acted
by commiſſion, and kept his eye upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
which he was faithful unto.</p>
               <p>The Scripture holds forth, that he was <hi>ſent</hi> of
his Father, the Father ſent him, and <hi>gave him a
commandment what he ſhould do, and what he ſhould
ſpeak.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt he was very faithful in
obſerving his commiſſion, he kept his eye upon
the work that his Father had given him to do, and
in that work he was faithful. In every thing that
Jeſus Chriſt acted, he looked to his Fathers rule,
the commiſſion that his Father had given him,
See <hi>John 5. 30. I can of my own ſelf do nothing:
as I hear I judge, and my Judgement in just, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43429:99"/>
I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the
Father which hath ſent me.</hi> And as in the matter
of judging, ſo in all other diſpenſations Chriſt was
pleaſed to look to the will of his Father that ſent
him. I came not to do my own will in that thing,
but the will of my Father. And ſo in <hi>John 6.
38, 39.</hi> For <hi>I came down from heaven, not to do
mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me, and
this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of
all which he hath given me,</hi> I <hi>ſhould loſe nothing,
but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> As in
his works of judging, ſo in his works of mercy,
Chriſt kept his eye upon his Fathers will, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his commiſſion, this is the Fathers will that
I ſhould loſe none of them, but that I ſhould give
life to them all, and raiſe them up at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Yea, in his very <hi>words,</hi> in all Chriſt ſpake, he
kept his eye upon the rule, and ſpake according
to his Fathers will and commandment. I <hi>ſpeak
not of my ſelf, but what I have heard of my Father,</hi>
John 8. 26. <hi>I ſpake to the world thoſe things which
I have heard of him,</hi> John 12. 50. <hi>Even as the
Father ſaid unto me, ſo</hi> I <hi>ſpeak.</hi> In all that
Chriſt ſpake, he kept his eye upon his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>And as in all that Chriſt ſpake, he kept his
eye upon his commiſſion, ſo in all Chriſt <hi>did: As
the Father gave me commandment, even ſo</hi> I <hi>do,</hi>
John 14. 31. ſtill his eye was upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of his Father, upon his commiſſion;
And in obedience to that commiſſion, he lays
down his life, <hi>John 10. 15.</hi> And <hi>I lay down
my life for the ſheep,</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>No man taketh it
from me, but</hi> I <hi>lay it down of my ſelf:</hi> I <hi>have power
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43429:99"/>
to lay it down, and</hi> I <hi>have power to take it again:
this commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea in Chriſts <hi>motions</hi> this way and that way,
his going to one place, and not to another, his
preaching in one place and not in another, ſtill he
kept his eye upon the commiſſion of his Father.
See <hi>Luke 4. 43.</hi> I <hi>muſt preach the Kingdom of God
to other Cities alſo; for therefore am</hi> I <hi>ſent.</hi> They
would have kept Chriſt with them, no, ſaith he, I
muſt preach the Kingdom of God in other Cities;
in all that Chriſt did, he kept his eye upon his
Fathers commiſsion, he looked to his Fathers
will, and that was his rule to walk by.</p>
               <p>And the ground of it is this, becauſe <hi>Chriſt
was found in the form of a ſervant;</hi> though he
thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet
he took upon him the form of a ſervant; though
the Son of God, yet he was content to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
that he might bring about the great work of
Redemption: Therefore God calls him the
righteous ſervant, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> Iſaiah 53. 11. And as
Chriſt was a righteous ſervant, a faithful ſervant,
ſo he kept his eye upon his commiſsion. Now if
Chriſt had not done ſo, if he had not acted all
things according to the will of his Father, he had
not been a righteous ſervant, but he was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
righteous ſervant, and therefore he ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
looked upon his commiſſion, what was his
Fathers will, and ſo he applyed himſelf to it.</p>
               <p>And as in all other things, ſo in this particular
in the Text, of preaching the Goſpel, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy <hi>firſt to the Jews</hi> and not to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43429:100"/>
                  <hi>I am not ſent, but to the lost ſheep of the houſe
of Iſrael,</hi> I am ſent to ſhew mercy to the houſe
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtill he eyed that work that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him, becauſe <hi>the promiſe was made to
them, the promiſe of the Meſſias it was firſt made to
Abraham and his ſeed, to that Nation that came out
of the loins of Abraham:</hi> And Chriſt came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the promiſe that was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Seed, therefore in this thing he obſerved his
Fathers order and his Fathers time; though his
Father had a deſign of mercy to the Gentiles, yet
he will ſhew mercy firſt to the Jews, and then
to the Gentiles: So that the Jews firſt of all muſt
have the offer, and then the Gentiles ſhall have
their time; Chriſt eyed his Fathers will and
time, &amp; therefore he applies himſelf to that work.</p>
               <p>But by way of Application.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> what cauſe have we who are of the ſtock
of the Gentiles, who live in this time and in this
Generation, to bleſs the Lord that we do live in
that time when the partition-wall is taken down?
there was a time when the Jews only were the
people of God, and when Gods deſign was to
ſhew mercy to them; and there was a time when
mercy ſeemed to be reſtrained from the Gentiles;
there was a time when Chriſt muſt not preach to
the Gentiles, ſo it was his commiſſion then not to
ſhew mercy to the Gentiles at that time: <hi>Go not
into any of the wayes of the Gentiles, and into any
of the Cities of Samaria enter not.</hi> There was a
time when the Gentiles were ſhut out from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when the word of life and ſalvation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from them, when the Lord gave this
commiſſion, <hi>go not into the way of the Gentiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:43429:100"/>
oh how are we beholden to free-grace that hath
broken down this wall of partition? that now
ſince the reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
there is no difference, but now mercy is freely
offered to the Gentiles as well as to the Jewes, for
the wall of partition is now broken down; and
of how ſhould we admire the grace of God in it?
we that were out-caſts of the Gentiles, ſinners
of the Gentiles, that the Lord ſhould ever ſend to
perſwade us to dwell in the <hi>Tents of Shem;</hi> we
we might have dwelt in the barren wilderneſs
every day, and never have been called, and that
God ſhould invite us to dwell in the <hi>Tents of

that we live in ſuch a time that there is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint

in bringing his word to us Gentiles! oh we are
engaged to the Lord that it is our lot to ſtand here!</p>
               <p>And this may teach us to admire the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and wonderful love of God that is let out to
the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Vſe. 2.</note> I ſay, we ſhould with holy fear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
it, the Jews were the Lords firſt born,
Chriſt was ſent firſt to them, cheifly to them,
they muſt have the firſt tender and the firſt offer
of mercy, the kingdom of God came firſt to them,
and yet behold now that word of Chriſt is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<hi>the firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt;</hi> they
were the firſt, and the Gentiles were the laſt:
We were ſhut out, and a reſtraint laid upon the

the firſt is laſt, and now God ſaith, go not into

that we do not neglect the great ſalvation held
forth to us, that we do not trample under our

the Lord to caſt off the Jews, when they caſt off
Chriſt and would none of him, when they caſt

then the Lord takes away the Word of Life from

and that is dangerous, every man that is loſt, he is
loſt in a dark way, the way of ſin, it is a way of
darkneſs: The Wiſeman ſaith of the ſinner, <hi>he
knows, not whither he goes:</hi> his way is the way of
darkneſs, he is loſt in a way of darkneſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

he knows not whither he goes.</p>
               <p>And as it is a dark way, ſo it is a <hi>filthy way,</hi> it
is a miry way, that a poor ſinner is loſt in; a way
where there is nothing but dirt, that when
a poor creature falls, he defiles himſelf, is woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defiled with ſin which is the greateſt defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And it is a <hi>ſlippery way,</hi> and that maketh it more
dangerous; the way that we are loſt in, it is a
ſlippery way, and ſo ſlippery, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for a poor creature to keep his feet, he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every day, yea he falls and falls, and bruiſeth
himſelf by his falls.</p>
               <p>And as the way it ſelf is dangerous, ſo there
are <hi>many dangers</hi> in the way, there is <hi>a Lion in
the way,</hi> and there are <hi>fiery Serpents in the way.</hi>
The way of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
way; truly this is the way that all, <hi>Adams</hi>
ſons and daughters are loſt in, where the Serpent
lyeth, the Lion alſo, the old Serpent that watcheth
to fright, and deſtroy, and devour: And oh the
pits that are in the way, and the ſnares that are
in the way, and the enemies that are in the
way!</p>
               <p>And further, the way is ſad in reſpect of <hi>the
end of it.</hi> The way that we are loſt in, it is a way
that doth lead to deſtruction, the end of the way
is death, and it is not poſſible for a man to miſs
the pit, and to miſs deſtruction and death, if the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43429:102"/>
Lord doth not help him out of the way. Every
ſinner that is loſt, he will go further and further in
this way, till he comes to the end which is death,
unleſs the Lord help him out of the way, unleſs
the Lord order it ſo, that he cannot find his way,
he ceaſes not till he comes to the end of his way,
which is death.</p>
               <p>And it is the more ſad and dangerous, becauſe
that a poor creature hath none to help him, none
to ſtand by him, ſo long as a man is out of Chriſt,
till Chriſt comes and finds a ſoul, none comes to
take care of him, and help him out of this dark
way, none to protect him, none to guide him,
none to go before him, none to diſcover the pit
and ſnare to him, none to uphold him and keep

               <p>You ſee the Point opened,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> a little by way of
Application, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> it lets us ſee that there are many
that may be Chriſts ſheep, though for the preſent
they be loſt, yet many that we look upon as loſt,
may be Chriſts ſheep. For although it is true,
we cannot own them, till they have the mark of
Chriſts ſheep upon them; Saints cannot own
them, for God himſelf doth not own them viſibly
before the world, till they hear the voice of
Chriſt, ah, but yet they may belong to Chriſt,
and may be his ſheep, though for the preſent
they may be loſt; <hi>I have other ſheep</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<hi>I have other ſheep that I will bring in;</hi> they are
my ſheep now though poor wandring ſheep,
though loſt in a wilderneſs, yet they are my ſheep,
and they ſhall hear my voice, and I will bring them
into my fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:43429:102"/>
Therefore this ſhould teach us not to mourn
as men without hope (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in
another caſe) not mourn as men without hope for
the dead; ſo when we look upon Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and cannot but judge them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in a loſt condition; we may mourn, and we
ought to mourn, but not mourn as men without
hope; for they may belong to Chriſt, and Chriſt
may bring them in, though they be not yet brought
in; therefore we ſhould not give them up for
deſperate, though they may be gone very far from
God; though they have gone a great way from
God, yet give them not up for deſperate: Chriſt
hath other ſheep then theſe that he will bring in;
and know, that the Lord is able to bring them in,
though they be gone far from God, and far from
his way, yet God is able to bring them in; the
great Shepherd is able to finde them, and to lay
them on his ſhoulder, and able to bring them into
his Fold: and therefore we ſhould not be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
but ſtill be found waiting upon God in the
uſe of the means; if we ſay there is no hope,
then we give over the uſe of the means: Hope
ſtill, and wait upon God in the uſe of the means,
cry to God in their behalf, wait upon the great
Shepherd, that he would go forth to ſeek and to
ſave.</p>
               <p>And we ſhould labour to carry ſo towards all
friends, and neighbours, and relations that are for
the preſent oppoſite to God and his wayes, that
we may gain them; they may be ſuch as Chriſt
may bring in; Chriſt's ſheep were loſt, ſo were
we, and ſo were they; and therefore take heed
that we do not ſet them off from Chriſt, do nothing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43429:103"/>
to make them out of love with Chriſt; but oh
look upon them as thoſe that Chriſt may bring in,
and therefore let us do what we can for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> It lets us ſee the ſad condition for
the preſent of thoſe that do not believe in Chriſt
O! that all ſinners would conſider their ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
Truly it is a loſt eſtate that every ſinner is
in, and that is a ſad eſtate, for a man to be loſt;
loſt to God, and loſt to himſelf, and loſt to others;
yea ſo loſt, that he is altogether uſeleſs and unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
neither profitable unto God nor man;
yea ſo loſt, as he is in a hopeleſs condition, to have
no hope: Truly there is not any ſinner that goes
on in a way of ſin, that hath any true ground of
hope; and that is a ſad condition which is a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
condition; helpleſs in reſpect of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
helpleſs in reſpect of himſelf, helpleſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of all men; and oh! it is a dangerous way,
O that ſinners would think of it; for a man to be
loſt in a dark ſlippery dirty way, for a man to be
loſt in a wilderneſs, to have none to guide him, no
friend to comfort him, none to help him out, in a
vaſt howling wilderneſs, compaſſed about with
diſmal darkneſs, it is a ſad condition, eſpecially
when there are wilde beaſts in the wilderneſs, and
every ſtep that he ſets he treadeth on a Serpent,
and a Lion in the way. O that God would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
ſinners of this their loſt condition! to be
loſt, and thus loſt, is a ſad eſtate! yet this is their
miſery, and men are not ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>And it is more ſad, becauſe it is the ſoul that
is loſt: and O! what would it advantage a man
or woman to gain the whole world, and to loſe
their own ſouls? What ever ſlight thoughts men
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43429:103"/>
or women have of their precious ſouls that lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in their boſomes, it is of more worth then ten
thouſand worlds; now for a ſoul to be in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
a ſoul to be in the dark, a ſoul to be in
the midſt of Serpents and Lions, O it is a ſad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and condition: the Lord open the eyes of
men and women to ſee into this their ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> Are poor creatures by nature in a loſt
eſtate and condition? O that they that are loſt
would hear the voice of Chriſt the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:
Every man is loſt before brought home to
Chriſt; and O that poor loſt ſouls might hear the
voice of Chriſt this day; here is glad tydings, O
that men would receive it: <hi>The Son of man came
to ſeek and to ſave tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which was loſt.</hi> Here is
glad tydings to you that are in a loſt condition;
O that God would bore the ear of the ſoul to hear
this voice of Chriſt; it is the Shepherd that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after you, O my ſheep return to me, I am
come out of heaven to ſeek you, and to ſave you,
and I am now gone forth in the miniſtration of the
Goſpel for this purpoſe: O that poor loſt ſheep
would hear the voice of the Shepherd, and would
receive the glad tydings that he brings! either
men are ſenſible of their loſt eſtate, or they are
not: there are ſome that are loſt, yea many, and
they know it not; but it is more ſad for a man
that is loſt, and will not be perſwaded that he is
loſt, but he hath a good opinion of his way; ſuch
a man goes the faſter, and rideth the faſter, and he
will the ſooner be at his journeys end.</p>
               <p>Now to thoſe that are loſt and know it not, let
me ſay unto you? that the Lord Jeſus doth at once
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43429:104"/>
hold forth both your danger, and the remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that danger; Chriſt doth by one word hold
forth to you, that you are loſt; and he doth hold
forth to you the way by which you may be ſaved
from that loſt eſtate; you heard that <hi>he was ſent
to the lost ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and to the
loſt ſheep of the Gentiles too, though Chriſt's
preſent work was not among them; but now
Chriſt ſends to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of the
Gentiles as to the houſe of Iſrael; and by his
word he would convince you that you are loſt, and
doth diſcover to you the way to come out of that
loſt condition by believing; O that you would
hear the voice of the great Shepherd that comes
forth this day, and gives you an invitation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome that are ſenſible of their loſt
eſtate; O they ſee it, and they know that they are
loſt, and therefore they look upon themſelves as
the moſt miſerable creatures; well, here is glad
tydings for you this day, <hi>The Son of man is come
to ſeek and to ſave what is loſt:</hi> You ſee your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be a ſad condition, and you ſay it is loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and what ever it is it can be but loſt; why the
Lord Jeſus he was ſent on purpoſe to ſave that
which was loſt, it was the work that Jeſus Chriſt
was ſent about, the great thing that was put into
Chriſt's Commiſſion, the great work that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put into his hand, to ſave what was loſt: Now
therefore look to the promiſes of God, yea that

promiſe it concerns the poor loſt ſheep, how he
will ſeek them, and ſave them, and binde them up;
O behold there the readineſs that is in Chriſt to
finde them; and indeed, Chriſt hath the greateſt
care of ſuch poor loſt ſheep. <hi>If a man hath a
hundred ſheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth
he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the

He goeth forth to ſeek the one ſheep that is loſt;
you being that one loſt ſheep, and you looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your own condition to be loſt, and you are
ſenſible that none is ſo loſt as you, he will leave the
ninety and nine to ſeek you: And therefore hear
the glad tydings of your Shepherd, he cometh
forth to ſeek you, be you willing to come to Chriſt,
and O! what joy will there be in heaven at your
return?</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> It lets us ſee, and O that
we might ſee! the infinite riches of the grace of
God in Chriſt to poor ſinners; O! here is grace
indeed: What rich mercy was that, that ſent out
Jeſus Chriſt to ſeek loſt ſheep? O! that we might
conſider a little of the greatneſs of this grace of
God, the exceeding riches of it, that the Lord
ſhould ſend forth his Son Jeſus Chriſt to ſeek loſt
ſheep. O! conſider what worthleſs creatures
we were, how unuſeful and unprofitable both to
God and man; nay, the Lord ſaw how little uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
we ſhould be afterward, how little we are able
to return to the Lord for this his great mercy; yet
the Lord ſent forth his Son to ſeek you.</p>
               <p>And conſider, that this was at ſuch a time when
we could never have returned to the Lord, when
we could never have found God; though we had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43429:105"/>
ſought him, we could not have found him; if we
had had any diſpoſition to have ſought after the
Shepherd, we could not have found him; no, by
all our ſearching we could never have found him.
And then when it was ſo with us that we could not
finde the way to go home again, that he ſhould
ſend Jeſus Chriſt to ſhew us the way that he
makes, by the Shepherd to lead the wandring
ſheep home; O free grace! If the Lord had ſent
forth the leaſt Angel of heaven to have ſought poor
loſt ſinners, it had been mercy; but that God
ſhould not commit this work to his ſervants, but
give a Commiſſion to his Son, and make it his
great work to ſeek poor loſt ſheep, O great love!
nay, when we could not finde God, and when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
could not have found us if they had ſought
us; herein is the exceeding riches of grace. Nay,
it was at ſuch a time as the Lord might have ſent
his Juſtice to have found us out, God might have
ſent the Avenger of blood after us; the Lord
might have ſet all our ſins upon us to have found
us out, they might have followed us as ſo many
Avengers of blood; O that at ſuch a time God
ſhould ſend Chriſt to finde us out, after all our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wandrings from God! that he ſhould make
his Son to come and ſeek, O infinite love!</p>
               <p>And therefore let me ſpeak to thoſe that have
received this grace: Hath the Lord found out
your ſouls? Hath Jeſus Chriſt found you out in
your wandrings, and through mercy brought you
home to God? Hath he brought home any poor
ſoul to believe in Chriſt, and to give up it ſelf fully
and for ever to Chriſt? O! be thankful for this
mercy, and labour to walk worthy of it, and ſtudy
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43429:105"/>
to know what is your duty now; you that are
Chriſt's ſheep, and were loſt, O! what is your
duty? Chriſt hath found you, ſurely ſome duty
you owe to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Why,<note place="margin">The Duty of ſouls whom Chriſt hath found.</note> this is our duty; It is our duty now <hi>to
ſeek Chriſt,</hi> to ſeek much faith in Chriſt; if Chriſt
hath ſought us, and took ſo much pains in ſeeking
us, that were not worth the ſeeking after, O! how
ſhould we lay forth our ſelves to ſeek Chriſt?
Seek him every day,<note place="margin">Duty 1.</note> ſeek much of Chriſt, ſeek his
face evermore, ſeek more of Chriſt every day:
Chriſt ſought us when we were not worthy, and
ſhall not we ſeek him who is infinitely worthy,
who is the deſire of all Nations?</p>
               <p>Again, It is our duty to <hi>ſeek others.</hi> Chriſt hath
found us, it is our duty to ſeek others, to pity the
ſheep that are loſt, that for the preſent are in a loſt
eſtate and condition; take ſome pains to ſeek them
according to your Talent and opportunity: O
take pains to ſeek others: Aſſoon as ever Chriſt
found <hi>Andrew, Andrew</hi> he findes <hi>Simon Peter;</hi>
O! Come (ſaith he) and ſee Chriſt: I ſay, if
Chriſt hath found us, let us labour to finde others,
labour to bring them to the knowledge of Jeſus
Chriſt, the great Shepherd: The Lord gave a
Commandment, <hi>Deut. 22. 1.</hi> That if any man
ſaw his neighbours Oxe or Sheep go aſtray, he
ſhould pity them, he ſhould not hide himſelf from
them, but he ſhould pity the poor loſt ſheep, and
the loſt Oxe: Doth God take care for Oxen? Doth
Godtake care for Sheep? That a poor loſt Sheep
be brought home to his Owner? And that a poor
loſt Oxe be brought home to his Owner? And
doth not God take more care for poor loſt ſouls?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:43429:106"/>
And is it not a more acceptable work to bring
home loſt ſouls? O pity poorloſt ſouls, tell them
of Chriſt, ſhew them the way to Chriſt, and know
that if you ſhall be an inſtrument in the Lord's
hand to bring home a loſt ſoul to Jeſus Chriſt the
Owner, O it will be ſervice very acceptable to
God your Father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Duty 3.</note> If Chriſt hath found us, then we ſhould
loſe no opportunity of honouring him; Let us
know that we are the Lord's, we are not our own
any longer, but engaged to be the Lord's, ſought
out by Chriſt, and ſaved by Chriſt, and brought
from a wandring condition, and loſt in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and yet found by Chriſt in this wilderneſs
condition; O let us know that we are engaged
for ever to be the Lord's: therefore let not Chriſt's
ſheep loſe any opportunity of doing ſervice to
Chriſt, take heed that we do not loſe any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of being profitable to Chriſt, bringing honour
to Chriſt in our generation, for that is expected
by Chriſt the Shepherd: So <hi>Paul</hi> did engage for
<hi>Oneſimus</hi> in the Epiſtle of <hi>Philemon; Oneſimus</hi> he
was a poor run-away ſheep, <hi>Paul</hi> he findes <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and he brings him home to Chriſt, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
in his converſion, and he ſendeth him
to his Maſter, and he tells him, that now he will
be <hi>profitable; before he was unprofitable, but now he
will be profitable to thee and to me,</hi> and to Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unprofitable: A ſheep is of no uſe when loſt,
but when its found, then it is profitable; and ſo if
the Lord hath found our ſouls, O that we might
do all we can to bring honour to Chriſt, and lift up
his name in this our generation, for Chriſt hath
ſound us for that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:43429:106"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Duty 4.</note> If Chriſt hath found us, we ſhould
be content to loſe all we have for him; Let all go
for Chriſt, it matters not what we loſe for Chriſt,
if Chriſt hath found us: If God calls for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
let that go; if Chriſt hath found us, we
have that which is better then a great eſtate: it
had been more ſad if God had taken away our
eſtates from us before he had found us, but if the
Lord hath found us, though we loſe the world,
there is good cauſe we ſhould be content; what
God calls for, let it go, we ſhould be willing to
loſe our eſtates, our credit, our name, for Chriſt
hath found us; if we cannot walk with Chriſt, and
do the ſervice Chriſt calls us to, but we muſt loſe
eſtate, and credit, and name, why let all go, Chriſt
found us, and we ſhould be willing to loſe our
lives for Chriſt; and know, that it ſhall not be
loſt, but what a man loſes for Chriſt, it ſhall be
reſtored him again.</p>
               <p>And fiftly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Duty 5.</note> Let us take heed that we
do not go out from Chriſt any more; O! what an
engagement lyeth upon us to keep cloſe to Chriſt?
O! What pains did Chriſt take to ſeek us, when
wandring? And what pains did Chriſt take to bring
us home? O! Take heed of wandring in the ways
of ſin, for it is a dangerous way, and therefore take
heed that we be not found wandring; let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to cleave to God, and keep cloſe to Chriſt;
let the ſheep hear the voice of Chriſt, and follow
him where ever he goeth; keep cloſe to Chriſt in
every Ordinance, in every Truth; take heed that
we go not out from Chriſt, for that will be ſadder
then all that hath gone before; that loſt ſheep
whom Chriſt hath found, ſhould go into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43429:107"/>
again, dark wayes again, and defile your
elves again, O! this will go to the heart of Chriſt;
and therefore Brethren, what need have we to
watch? O! let us watch over our own hearts, if
Chriſt hath found us, and brought us home to God,
O let us watch over our hearts and wayes, that we
go not out from Chriſt; O let us watch, and let us
cry to the Lord, that he would watch over us, that
we may not go out from him: O! let us beg of him
that he would put his holy fear into our hearts,
that is his promiſe; O beg of the Lord that he would
make good his Covenant, that we may have that
holy fear in our hearts, that may keep us for ever
from wandring and going out from Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a <hi>ſecond Tryal</hi> of this womans
Faith, as I told you when I opened
the words. Chriſt had tryed her
faith by his <hi>ſilence,</hi> and now by his
<hi>ſpeaking</hi> a ſad word, <hi>I am not ſent
but to the lost Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein
he holds forth, that there a <hi>certain number</hi> that he
is ſent unto, a certain company that are given to
him to be his ſheep, and that he can ſhew mercy
only to ſuch; they only are in his Commiſſion, and
he cannot go beyond his Commiſſion; they whoſe
names are written in the book of life, their names
are written in Chriſt's Commiſſion; <hi>I am not ſent
but to the loſt ſheep.</hi> Here is a great tryal of this
womans faith, and ſhe is put upon it to make out
her <hi>Election;</hi> here is a <hi>tryal</hi> concerning her <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
whether ſhe did belong to God or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:43429:108"/>
So then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> the Lord is pleaſed ſometimes to exerciſe his

               </p>
               <p>That was the great tryal that this woman was
now put upon. In the opening of the point it will
be needful to ſhew you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That</hi> there is an Election of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this Election <hi>may be known,</hi> it
may be known who are elected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew you that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> it
ſelf, it is <hi>full of ſweetneſs,</hi> and <hi>unſpeakable comfort</hi>
to God's people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſhew you, that God's own
people may meet with <hi>many Temptations</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the doctrine of <hi>Election,</hi> and concerning <hi>their
own election</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, That <hi>there is an election of God,</hi> which
is a glorious truth of the Goſpel, and it is needful
that it ſhould be known: Let us enquire <hi>what ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an Act of God'<hi>s</hi> good pleaſure from eternity,<note place="margin">Election deſcribed.</note>
whereby he made choice of certain perſons, that he
might make them holy and happy through Christ
Jeſus unto the glory of his own grace. <hi>Take this
as a deſcription of Election; where you have</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> that is <hi>God,</hi> it is an act
of God; and you have the <hi>nature of this Act.</hi>
1. It was <hi>an act of his good pleaſure.</hi> 2. It was
<hi>from eternity.</hi> 1. It was an Act of his <hi>good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi>
there was no moving cauſe at all in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
why God did love it and chuſe it; no impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43429:108"/>
cauſe was found out of God's own bowels, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the creature, nothing out of himſelf, it
was an Act of good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>2. And this was from eternity; what ever was
done in time, it was purpoſed from eternity; they
are choſen before the foundation of the world,
bleſſed of my Father before the foundation of the
world; it was from eternity that God did thus chuſe
and ſet his love upon poor creatures. You ſee the
nature of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the deſcription you have the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of it,</hi> who they were that God did chuſe from
eternity: Why, they were <hi>certain perſons, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number of perſons</hi> that God ſet his love upon
freely; and amongſt thoſe ſometimes in Scripture,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be the firſt that was choſen; he
was the <hi>head of them,</hi> he was the foundation of
the building, therefore he is called <hi>choſen of God:
Diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and
precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 4. the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
he was a choſen precious foundation ſtone.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſt was choſen to be <hi>Head,</hi> ſo there
was a <hi>certain number</hi> that were choſen to be his
members; a certain number known unto God,
that ſhould fill up the <hi>body of Christ;</hi> for God's
Decree is not an uncertain nnumber, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
propoſition (as ſome conceive) that whoſoever
believes ſhall be ſaved; ſome make no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God but this, <hi>that whoſoever believes ſhould
be ſaved,</hi> but he did not purpoſe any particular
perſon, but whoſoever believe ſhall be ſaved:
Truly that decree is no decree, if there were no
other decree but ſo, that whoſoever believe ſhould
be ſaved, and not decreed certain perſons, then it
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43429:109"/>
were poſſible that no man nor woman at all ſhould
be ſaved, if God did not determine ſuch and ſuch
perſons, but onely ſuch as believe ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
then I ſay, there is a poſſibility that none at
all ſhould be ſaved; it is true, that is the way of
the declaration of God's grace, that whoſoever
believes is ſaved.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, We have further to conſider, what
is the <hi>end of Election;</hi> wherefore did God chuſe
certain perſons?</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold end,
Firſt, In reſpect of the <hi>creature.</hi>
Secondly in reſpect of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>reſpect of the creature;</hi> this was God's end,
that ſuch creatures ſhould be made <hi>holy and happy,</hi>
that they ſhould attain to eternal life, which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life begins here in holineſs; and that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, to know the Father and the Son; that is
the end for which God doth predeſtinate, that
they might be holy through the ſanctification of
the Spirit, and that they might be bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
for ever.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>reſpect of God,</hi> the great end of Election,
it is the <hi>praiſe of his own grace,</hi> that ſo they that
ſhall be ſaved, they may for ever admire and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
that rich and free grace of God towards
them, that choſe them ſo freely, when as they were
ſo vile; this is the end of Election.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, We may conſider <hi>the means</hi> by which
God doth fulfil and execute his Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The <hi>means of executing his Decree,</hi> it is <hi>Chriſt
Jeſus as Mediator;</hi> he choſe ſuch and ſuch, to bring
them to ſuch and ſuch an end by ſuch means, by
<hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>by Faith in him;</hi> Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43429:109"/>
he is the cauſe of the means of God's exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
and fulfilling his Decree, though not the
cauſe of Election, but the cauſe of the means of
God's executing and fulfilling his Decree, for
God would ſave them no other way but by <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt;</hi> in <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4.</hi> you have theſe all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before
the foundation of the world; that we ſhould be holy
and without blame before him in love:</hi> Here you ſee
it is an Act of God from eternity, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world; and at <hi>v. 5.</hi> you may ſee it
is an Act of his <hi>Free Grace; According to the good
pleaſure of his Will,</hi> v. 5. He was not moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by any thing in the creature; no, it was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the good pleaſure of his Will:</hi> And you
ſee alſo the ſeveral ends for which God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
<hi>v. 4.</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>creature,</hi> the end is,
that we ſhould <hi>be holy;</hi> and at <hi>v. 5.</hi> that we ſhould
<hi>be happy,</hi> and attain the inheritance of children;
and the great end of all is in <hi>v. 6. That this may
be the praiſe and glory of his grace:</hi> And then there
is the means by which God doth execute this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
<hi>v. 4. He hath choſen us in him, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world:</hi> So that you ſee ſomthing of
this great and wonderful myſterie of <hi>Election</hi> in
this place.</p>
               <p>But there are two things further which I ſhall
inſiſt upon for the clearing of the Truth to you; in
the opening of which, I ſhall meet with thoſe
things that are moſt of all objected againſt this
Truth.</p>
               <p>This Act of God from eternity, it was
<list>
                     <item>1. Abſolute.</item>
                     <item>2. Immutable <hi>and</hi> Vnchangeable.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:43429:110"/>
There are theſe two general heads, which will
clear up much of the minde and will of God in
this Truth; 1. God's Decree is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>free:</hi>
2. It is <hi>unchangeable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> it doth not depend
upon any thing in the creature; God did not
chuſe, becauſe he foreſaw men would be ſuch and
ſuch; he did not chuſe any, becauſe he foreſaw
they would believe, (as ſome imagine) he did not
chuſe any becauſe he foreſaw they would be holy;
his decree, and choice, and love, it was not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon any thing in the creature, for the Lord he
hath no ſuch reſpect in his choice; you may ſee
what is ſaid of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Rom. 9. 11.</hi> The
Apoſtle is there treating of this myſterie, and he
doth there, let us know, that it is free and abſolute,
and doth not depend upon the work or worthineſs
of the creature; <hi>For the children being not yet born,
neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe
of God according to election might ſtand; not of works,
but of him that calleth:</hi> v. 12. <hi>It was ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> v. 13. <hi>As
it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I
hated.</hi> Before they had either done good or evil,
God made choice of <hi>Jacob;</hi> God did not chuſe
him becauſe he foreſaw he would be better then
his brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> no, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
unto God; nay, if there were any prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<hi>Eſau</hi> had it; he was the firſt born: and
<hi>was not Eſau Jacobs brother?</hi> ſaith God, <hi>yet I loved
Jacob,</hi> Mal. 1. 2, 3. <hi>and I hated Eſau:</hi> I have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſpecial love upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> leſs upon <hi>Eſau:</hi> Not
that God hates the creature without ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
but <hi>hating</hi> here is to ſhew a <hi>leſs love:</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:43429:110"/>
Chriſt ſaith, a man ſhall hate his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Chriſt's ſake; that is, love them leſs then
Chriſt; and <hi>Jacob</hi> had two wives, one was <hi>hated,</hi>
the other <hi>loved; Rachel</hi> beloved, and <hi>Leah</hi> hated,
that is, leſs loved; and ſo God here, he beſtows
ſpecial love upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not upon <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is evident from Scripture, that God
could not chuſe for foreſeen faith and holineſs; for
the Scripture holds forth, that both faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
they are the <hi>fruits</hi> of Election, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Election; men therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and are made holy, becauſe God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
them from eternity, <hi>Acts 13. 48. As many as
were ordained to eternal life believed;</hi> ſee here, faith
is made the fruit of Election, and of God's love
from eternity; the words cannot be read thus,
That as many as believed were ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life; but <hi>as many as were ordained to eternal
life, believed;</hi> and ſo <hi>holineſs</hi> or ſanctification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Election, no, it is the <hi>fruit</hi> of
Election: ſee <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. According as he hath
choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world,
that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him
in love:</hi> He hath choſen us, <hi>that we ſhould be holy,</hi>
not choſen us becauſe we were holy, but that we
might be holy; holineſs then proceeds from God's
ſpecial love.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall make it further evident to you from
ſome Arguments from Scripture,<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proving Election to be an act of Gods good pleaſure:</note> that it is not
poſſible God's choice ſhould be grounded upon
any thing in the creature, but meerly an Act of his
own good pleaſure; for</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, that which maketh the Will of God
to depend upon the creature, that cannot be a true
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43429:111"/>
doctrine: but now if God doth chuſe upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
faith and works, becauſe he foreſaw the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be ſuch, then the Will of God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the creature, which deſtroyes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature of God, and the freedom of God's
Will; it is not poſſible that God's Will ſhould
be determined but by its ſelf; now if God choſe
upon foreſeen faith, and works, then God's Will
is determined by ſome thing in the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It doth derogate much from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God's grace, as alſo from the greatneſs of
the myſterie, and of the wonder of the Goſpel: I
ſay, If God did chuſe men becauſe he foreſaw
that they would be holy, it derogates much from
the freeneſs of his grace: <hi>If it be of works, then it
is not of grace;</hi> If God's choice were grounded
upon ſuch a foreſight of faith and holineſs, then it
is not an election of grace.</p>
               <p>And it derogates much from the great myſterie
of the Goſpel; God will ſave creatures in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
myſterious way, in ſuch a myſterious way as
men and Angels ſhall ſtand and wonder at to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
now if God did chuſe upon ſuch a foreſight,
or for faith, or for holineſs in the creature, why
there is no ſuch great myſterie or wonder; but
for God to chuſe freely, when there was nothing
to draw him to ſuch an act, yet then to chuſe ſuch
poor creatures to everlaſting ſalvation, O! this is
the wonder of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Yea thirdly, God's choice cannot be upon any
foreſight of faith or works, for the Scripture holds
forth that God's choice is before our choice; he
choſe us firſt, and he loved us firſt; ſee what
Chriſt ſays <hi>John 15. 16. You have not choſen me,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43429:111"/>
but I have choſen you, and ordained you that you
ſhould go and bring forth fruit. You have not choſen
me,</hi> that is, you have not choſen me <hi>firſt;</hi> and ſo in
<hi>1 John 4. 19. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved
us:</hi> Now if God did chuſe upon any foreſight of
faith or works, then God did not love us firſt; for
if God did conſider men as believers when he
choſe them, why then if the ſoul believed before
God choſe, it choſe God firſt, which is contrary
to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Scripture holdeth forth that there
is ſome that are Chriſt's ſheep, that are known to
the Lord, though not known to themſelves; and
therefore it is God's free love to them to make
them ſheep; but when they believe they ſhall
know that they are ſheep; but they are ſheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they believe, but when they believe, they
ſhall be known to be ſheep, <hi>John 10. 16. And
other ſheep I have which are not of this fold; them
alſo I must bring, and they ſhall hear my voice, and
there ſhall be one fold, and one Shepherd.</hi> My Fathers
love hath made them ſheep; and becauſe they are
ſheep, they ſhall hear my voice, and ſhall believe
in me.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, there is one argument more to confirm
the truth; If ſo be that God did chuſe upon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
faith or works, or becauſe he ſaw that there
was an ability in the creature to perform or not; I
ſay, if Gods decree were a conditional decree, then
God ſaw that the creature were able or not able to
perform the condition; If the creature were not
able to believe, or to be holy, then it were a vain
Decree; but if God ſaw that the creature were
able to perform the condition, this ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43429:112"/>
and to be holy, it muſt be either from the
creature, or from God; if it were from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then it deſtroyes the Doctrine of Grace, and
brings in the Doctrine of Works, and that ſets up
the <hi>Idol of Free-will,</hi> which the Scripture beateth
down, and it lays the ſtreſs of the creatures ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and happineſs upon it ſelf; If God did chuſe
becauſe he foreſaw that the creature would be
ſuch, and had a power in it ſelf to believe, and to
obey, this lays the ſtreſs of the creatures ſalvation
upon it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſaid, That God did intend to give
the condition, the creature is not able to believe
of it ſelf, and be holy of it ſelf; ah, but God did
determine and decree to make ſuch and ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and to be holy, and ſo he choſe them upon
that.</p>
               <p>Now to that I ſay, this comes to nothing, to ſay
God did decree to make ſuch and ſuch believers,
and to make them holy, and upon that foreſeeing
they would be ſuch, choſe them to life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Why this is as much as to ſay,</p>
               <p>God did firſt of all chuſe them, and then he gave
them faith and holineſs that he might chuſe them;
for what is God's Decreeing to give faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
but his chuſing and ſetting apart the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for his ſelf? for that is a part of the end for
which God choſe, that it might be holy as well as
happy: and beſides, I ſhewed you before, that
faith is made to come after election, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go before election.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected againſt this, Doth not
<hi>David</hi> ſay in <hi>Pſal. 4. 3. But know that the Lord
hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf?</hi> and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43429:112"/>
may we not object from thence againſt the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs
of God's Decree?</p>
               <p>Anſwer, Some indeed urge from hence, that
God conſidered men as godly when he ſet them
apart; but there is no ſuch thing in the words; for
the Pſalmiſt doth not ſpeak of Gods chuſing, but
he ſpeaketh of the manifeſtation of God's decree
and purpoſe to ſave; now it is manifeſted by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
whom God hath choſen, and it comes to be
known to others; God doth not chuſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are holy, but ſuch as are holy, they are
evidenced to be ſuch as God hath choſen; and
therefore he ſpeaketh to others in <hi>v. 2. O ye ſons
of men! How long will ye turn my glory into ſhame?
How long will ye love vanity, and ſeek after leaſing?</hi>
and then it follows <hi>v. 3.</hi> But <hi>know that the Lord
hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf:</hi> Though
a godly man be in affliction, and you may think that
God doth not love him, becauſe he is afflicted;
but know, that if he be godly, though in affliction,
God hath ſet him apart for himſelf; ſo that this
place doth not ſpeak of God's decree, but of the
manifeſtation of God's decree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another objection is raiſed out of</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4.
According as he hath choſen us in him. In him,</p>
               <p>Some argue from hence, That we are <hi>choſen in
Chriſt,</hi> and there is no man <hi>in Chriſt</hi> but a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
no man is <hi>in Chriſt</hi> but he that hath faith;
and therefore God chuſeth no man till he be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
for we are <hi>choſen in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt of all <hi>in him;</hi> it may be
underſtood, he hath choſen us <hi>together with him,</hi>
as head and members are choſen together; as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and other ſtones may be choſen together;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43429:113"/>
when a man is to build a houſe, he may at once
chuſe the foundation ſtones, and alſo divers other
ſtones that he layes upon the building; he doth
not lay ſtones upon the foundation, and then make
choice of them; no, that they are laid upon the
foundation, doth argue he hath made choice of
them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In him,</hi> that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the
way and means of executing his Fathers Decree:</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt he is the way by which God doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
his purpoſe and his decree of bringing ſuch
and ſuch ſouls unto bleſſedneſs; God the Father
will bring them by Chriſt, he will bring them this
way to life and ſalvation, and no other way but by
Chriſt Jeſus; he is the cauſe of the execution of
God's Decree, but not the cauſe why God will
chuſe ſuch and ſuch; for Chriſt ſaith himſelf, that
there is a love that the Father himſelf hath toward
his people; the Father himſelf loveth his people
from everlaſting, he loveth them the better for
Chriſt's Interceſſion, but (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Father
himſelf loveth you:</hi> ſo that there was love in the
heart of the Father to his people from eternity.
And that firſt love of God it is held forth as the
cauſe of giving Chriſt; Chriſt was not the cauſe
of that firſt love, but God loved from eternity,
and therefore he gave Chriſt; <hi>God ſo loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son;</hi> and love
gave that Son Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, we are ſaid to be <hi>choſen in
him,</hi> not as being believers, not that God did
conſider men as believing in Chriſt actually, but
they may after a ſort be ſaid to <hi>be in Chriſt,</hi> even
from eternity, not actually, but virtually. Some
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43429:113"/>
do explain it thus, as the corn that is ſown, and
begins to bud, why as ſoon as it begins to bud,
there is the blade, and the ear, and the corn vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
but not actually; and ſo we were <hi>in him</hi>
from eternity <hi>virtually,</hi> as choſen together with
him, and given unto him; but not actually in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, till ſuch time as men do believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is a third Objection, which I ſhall but
touch.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Why, then God makes choice
of ſinners, and how can that be? If God did not
chuſe men upon fore-ſeen faith and holineſs, and
not conſider them in Chriſt, then he conſidered
them as ſinners; but now how can God chuſe
men as ſinners? When the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He is
a God of purer eyes then to behold the leaſt iniquity:</hi>
If a man be not in Chriſt, he is a ſinner; and can
God love a vile creature from eternity?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, There is a love of <hi>good will,</hi> and a
love of <hi>delight;</hi> there was a love of <hi>good will</hi> that
God had to his people from everlaſting, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that God ſaw they were in themſelves vile,
ſinful creatures; but God doth not love them
with the love of <hi>delight,</hi> till they are waſhed and
cleanſed in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> It is not poſſible that God
ſhould do ſo: A good man he may not take a vile
perſon to be his boſome friend or companion, and
he may not take one that is wicked, into the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a wife or husband; and how ſhall God do
it, who is a God of purer eyes?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Though we may not make ſuch a
choice, God may make ſuch a choice; why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43429:114"/>
God is able to make them gracious and holy:
If we were able to make them holy, then we might
chuſe the worſt in the world: But now there is
power in God to do it; if he chuſe the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he can make them righteous; and if he chuſe
unbelievers, he can give them faith; and if he
chuſe unholy ones, he can make them holy: Nay,
he chuſeth for that very end, that he might make
them holy and blameleſs. So that you have ſeen
that God's Decree it is <hi>abſolute,</hi> that it is not
grounded upon any conſideration or worth in the
creature, but <hi>abſolute,</hi> in reſpect of the means.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, As it is free and abſolute, ſo it
is <hi>unchangeable;</hi> God cannot, he will not caſt off
any that he hath choſen; no, ſee what the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 19. Nevertheleſs the foundation of
God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them that are his.</hi> This Decree of God is
<hi>unchangeable;</hi> for it is as a ſure foundation: The
foundation is the beginning of the building, and
ſo this Decree, it is the beginning of all that good,
and thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings that God doth beſtow
upon his children; and the foundation is ſure and
unmoveable, if it be laid by a skilful and powerful
hand; foundations are laid ſure: why, this foundation
is laid by God's own hand, it is laid by his wiſe and
mighty hand, and who ſhall remove the foundation
that God hath laid? All the men and Angels in the
world cannot overturn the purpoſe and decree of
God for the ſaving of one poor ſoul; all the devils
in hell cannot overturn this foundation; and there
is nothing in the creature can hinder it, no ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
no unworthineſs, before converſion, and after
converſion, for it is ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:43429:114"/>
And it muſt needs be <hi>ſure,</hi> becauſe God in his
Eſſence is unchangeable, and therefore his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
unchangeable; for the Will of God is God
himſelf, and therefore the purpoſe of God can be
no more unchangeable then God himſelf, So that
you ſee there is an Election, and this Election is of
grace: That's the firſt particular.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular, which I ſhall but touch,
is, That <hi>this Election may be known by the ſons of
men,</hi> though it be tranſacted in heaven; though
their names be written in heaven, yet it is poſſible
for men to know this ſecret of God's Decree; this
great myſtery it is poſſible that it may be known <hi>to
others,</hi> and it is poſſible that it may be known to
<hi>our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Election may be known</hi> to others, <hi>ſee</hi> Phil.
4. 3.<note place="margin">Our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction known to <hi>others.</hi>
                  </note> And I entreat thee alſo, true yoke-fellow, help
thoſe women which laboured with me in the Goſpel,
with Clement alſo, and with other my fellow labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
whoſe names are in the Book of Life: <hi>The
Apoſtle here ſpeaking of ſuch and ſuch perſons,
he concludes, that</hi> their names are in the book of life,
<hi>and in</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. 3, 4. Remembring without ceaſing
your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience,
of hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſight of God,
and our Father; Knowing, brethren beloved, your
Election of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How can this be known?</p>
               <p>Why, it may be known by the fruits of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
when the Goſpel comes with power, when
the Goſpel doth overpower the heart, when men
and women are overcome to believe in the name
of Chriſt, when they make a reſignation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Chriſt, and when the Image of Chriſt is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43429:115"/>
ſtampt upon them, and they in ſome meaſure made
conformable to Chriſt, who is the head of the
Church; then others may conclude in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of charity, ſuch and ſuch are elected of God:
ſo far as we may know the truth of others faith, ſo
far we may in the judgement of charity know the
election of others.<note place="margin">Our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be known to <hi>our ſelves.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, This may not only be known to
others, but <hi>to a mans own ſelf;</hi> that he is choſen
of God before the foundation of the world; for
we are put upon it to make it ſure, <hi>2 Pet. 1. 10.
Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
election ſure;</hi> ſtrive to put it out of doubt, be not
content to be at uncertainties in this buſineſs; it
may not only be known, but make it ſure: he doth
not exhort them to make it ſure <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> by doing
this or that, for it is ſure in it ſelf; but make it
ſure as <hi>to your ſelves,</hi> wait upon the Lord that your
hearts may be confirmed in it, that you are called
and elected of God; for it is poſſible for a man to
know that he is elected.</p>
               <p>Yea, Chriſt puts his Diſciples upon it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the conſideration of this, that they were
elected, <hi>Luke 10. 20. But rather rejoyce, becauſe
your names are written in heaven.</hi> Rejoyce in this,
that God hath choſen you, and loved you, that he
hath loved you with an everlaſting love, and that
he hath given you to his Son, and will bring you
to life and happineſs, to the praiſe of his grace; in
this rejoyce.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is that the Spirit of the Lord
is given out to believers, that they might know
their election; it is one end of Chriſt's ſending the
Comforter, the Spirit of the Lord, who ſearcheth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:43429:115"/>
the deep things of God, and ſo reveals them unto
believers; Now this is among the deep things of
God, God's eternal love, this is one of the depths
that made the Apoſtle cry out when he conſidered
God's way from eternity to poor creatures, <hi>The
Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God,</hi> and reveals
them to his people; the Spirit of the Lord ſtood
by when he did write the names of his children in
the book of life, the Son was preſent, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was preſent even from eternity before the
world was made, when God writ the names of
his people in the book of life; and therefore the
Spirit it is one of God's Witneſſes, and is given
to teſtifie this to his people, he is ſent by Chriſt
to teſtifie what he ſaw from eternity, that the
names of ſuch and ſuch were written in the book
of life; <hi>God hath given us of his Spirit, that we
might know the things that are given us freely of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. Now this is one of the things
that are freely given us of God, this abſolute
choice, this love of God that was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
if ever any thing were free, this is free;
now the Spirit of the Lord is ſent to cauſe us to
know the things that are <hi>freely given us of God;</hi>
Now when the Spirit of the Lord doth make
known to a ſoul that it is elected, ſomtimes it
makes uſe of the teſtimony of the blood of Chriſt,
and of the teſtimony of Water; and ſomtimes he
declares this to the ſoul by his own <hi>immediate wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
the Spirit of the Lord doth ſometimes make
it known <hi>mediately,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>immediately:
Mediately, There are three that bear record in earth,
the Spirit, the Water, and the blood, and theſe three
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43429:116"/>

now when the Spirit of the Lord doth ſhine

               <p>And ſomtimes there is a more <hi>immediate wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
The Spirit it ſelf bearing witneſs that we are

Teſtimony, beſide all others, that a ſoul is loved
of God; ſo that you ſee the ſecond general head,
which is this, that this great myſterie of election
may be known, it may be known unto others, and
to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And therefore, O that we might wait upon

creature; Alas, if God's love had gone by deſert
in us, there had been but little hope; And I do
not know what ſolid ground of comfort they can
lay, that contend ſo for a conditional Decree,
grounded upon the creatures acting; for if the
Lord had not loved and choſen till he had ſeen
ſome worthineſs in the creature, till he had ſeen
ſome better improvement in us then in others, if
the Lord had ſuſpended to love and to chuſe till
then, O! what little hope might any creature
have had, that know the contrary workings of his
own heart? What little hope of being ſaved?
But now, when all is of Free grace, and the Lord
overlooks all unworthineſs, and chuſeth freely,
and loves freely; O this is a ground of hope and
great conſolation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second ground of comfort.</note> There is another ground of comfort
and refreſhment from this Doctrine; It doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
us that the Lord is very ready to be entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Lord is not hardly brought off to
ſhew mercy to poor ſinners, that there is not an
unwillingneſs in God to this work; as unbelief,
and the Tempter would ſuggeſt; why? It was
that which was the purpoſe of God from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I ſay, God from all eternity hath purpoſed
it: It was the counſel of God, the great work of
God, that which God ſpent his thoughts upon
from all eternity; they were (as I may ſay) the
firſt thoughts of the heart of God, to love, and
pity, and to ſave, and to bring about that great
work of ſaving ſinners by the blood of Chriſt;
this was the great contrivance of God; and it is
a great ground of comfort and refreſhment: A
poor ſoul may doubt whether God be willing to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43429:118"/>
ſave, and willing to be reconciled to him that hath
ſinned ſo and ſo: O! This Doctrine doth comfort
exceedingly; for certainly, if it were the great
work of God from eternity, the Lord is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
now to do it. Chriſt tells his Diſciples,
<hi>That the Father himſelf loveth you:</hi> That is a
ground of comfort; there was a love in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards you, before I made a requeſt for
you; though the Father now love you more, and
better, yet the Father himſelf loved you, before
I made any requeſt for you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Third ground of comfort.</note> This is another ground of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
from this Doctrine, That the love of
God towards his people, it is <hi>an ancient Love,</hi>
a love that did not begin yeſterday, a love that is
not of a few years ſtanding, but an ancient love,
it is as ancient as eternity; it is as ancient as the
Ancient of dayes; as ancient as God himſelf; no
beginning but from eternity: O! That commends
love exceedingly, when as love is an ancient love,
when as one hath born love to ſuch a Family
through many generations, and hath provided love
for ſuch a family for many generations to come;
that exceedingly commends the love of a friend,
when a friend ſhall take care that there ſhall be
an Eſtate entailed to ſuch a family for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
to come, that he ſhould provide a portion
for them before they had a being, O! that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
love, and that doth commend the love of a
friend; and truly it commends the love of the
Creator, and it is full of ſweetneſs and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God hath loved his people from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
love hath run down that long Tract of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and he hath provided a portion from eternity,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43429:118"/>
an inheritance from eternity; oh! that the Lord
ſhould make ſuch proviſion for poor creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had any being, not only thouſands of
years but even from eternity before they had any
being, when there was no world, no creature, no
being, but only in the mind of God; that God
then ſhould chuſe them, and provide an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for them; truly this commends the love of
God, and makes it very ſweet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The fourth ground of comfort.</note> There is this ground of refreſhment
that the Doctrine holds forth; that this love of
God to his people it is <hi>a diſtinguiſhing love;</hi> oh!
that commends love exceedingly, when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing,
when it puts a difference where there
was no difference; that love that makes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and ſo vaſt a difference when no difference,
that love is very precious. See what is ſaid in
<hi>Hoſ. 1. 6, 7.</hi> For <hi>I will no more have mercy upon
the houſe of Iſrael; but I will utterly take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
But I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah,
and will ſave them by the Lord their God,</hi> &amp;c. See
here at the very time that God ſaid he would not
have mercy upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he would have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Judah,</hi> and would ſave them; oh, how ſweet
was the diſcovery of that love? And truly, this is
the love of God that this Doctrine holds forth, a
diſtinguiſhing love, that when there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the creature, and one not better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet that God ſhould take thoſe, and
chuſe thoſe, that were as bad as thoſe that were
left; oh! this diſtinguiſhing love, it is very ſweet
and hath a great deale of refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">The fifth ground of comfort.</note> This Doctrine holds forth a <hi>ground of
joy,</hi> there is a great deale of true grounded joy,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43429:119"/>
laſting joy, that may ariſe and doth ariſe unto the
people of God, from the knowledge of this, that
God hath choſen them and loved them from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with an everlaſting love, it doth adminiſter
the beſt ground of comfort that can be found in all
the World. See that place <hi>Luke 10. 20. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rejoyce becauſe your names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
The knowledge of this ſpeciall love, that
God hath written the names of poor creatures in
Heaven, it is a ground of unſpeakable joy; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
not that the uncleane ſpirits are ſubject to
you, why? they might rejoyce more in that then
in any outward mercy whatſoever, that the unclean
ſpirits were ſubject to them, for it is more then if
all the men of the world were ſubject to them:
ah, but yet, in this rejoyce not, rejoyce not ſo
much in this, for here is a more laſting ground for
your joy, that your names are written in Heaven;
it will afford ſuch joy, and will kindle ſuch a flame
of joy, as all the waters of affliction cannot quench.
When a ſoul comes to know this, and can make
out this, that his name is written in heaven, a ſoul
may then rejoyce in every condition, rejoyce in
Tribulation, rejoyce in Perſecution, rejoyce in
Poverty and diſtreſſe, yea, though they may looſe
all the comforts of life, yet when God reveals to
them, that their names are written in Heaven,
they may rejoyce, for they have a portion that can
never be loſt, an inheritance that can never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from them, though they meet with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much ſcorn and reproach from the World,
though men ſhould caſt out their names as vile,
yet if their names are written in Heaven they may
rejoyce, for their names are precious before God
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43429:119"/>
when viſe before men, and it is written there
where it can never be blotted out; ſo that it doth
adminiſter matter of ſound and ſollid joy, ſuch
joy as will hold out and cannot be quencht with
many waters.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">The ſixth ground of comfort.</note> Another ground of comfort that doth
ariſe from the knowledge of our election is this,
that we have and ſhall enjoy that great priviledge
and benefit of the <hi>miniſtry and ſervice of the holy
Angels.</hi> When God comes to make out his love
to the ſoul, why, it may conclude that the Lord
hath given his Angels charge over them, that the
Angels ſhall defend, and the Angels ſhall protect,
and the Angels ſhall deliver from many dangers.
See what the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb. 1. 14.</hi> ſpeaking
of the Angels: <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits,
ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of
ſalvation.</hi> They that are choſen by God to an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
reſerved in Heaven, they have the miniſtry
of all the holy Angels while on earth; though we
ſee it not with this bodily eye, though we ſee not
the Angels how they aſcend and deſcend, how
they goe to Heaven and come from Heaven, yet
it is matter of faith, the word of the Lord hath
ſaid they are all miniſtring ſpirits, for the good of
the Saints; many a kindneſs the Angels doth us,
and we are kept from many a danger by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
<hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge, and they
ſhall bear thee up that thou daſh not thy foot againſt
a ſtone:</hi> That is another ground of ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth ground of comfort.</note> It doth adminiſter this ground of
comfort, that <hi>all that Gods people doe meet withall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here in the world ſhall work for their good.</hi> God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43429:120"/>
will make an advantage of whatſoever his people
doth meet withall. See what the Apoſtle ſaith in
<hi>Rom. 8. 28. And we know that all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for good, to them that love God, to them who
are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> All things
ſhall work together for good to thoſe who are
called according to his purpoſe; according to
that ancient love in the boſome of God; all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
all croſſes, all oppoſition, all perſecution,
the worſt that Gods people can meet withall in the
world, nay their very ſins and failings and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſhall work together for good; the infinite
wiſe God will make advantage of all, that all that
they meet withall ſhall tend to the furtherance of
his work, to the bringing about his purpoſe. All
ſhall work together for good, yea for the beſt
good, though they ſee it not for the preſent, but
wait to the end, and by that time God hath done
with his people, put all together and you ſhall ſee
that all things ſhall work together for good; nay,
we know it by experience, we have found that
God hath brought good out of the greateſt evill,
and out of the greateſt affliction. And this is to
thoſe who are called according to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">Eigth ground of comfort.</note> There is another ground of comfort
which ariſeth from the Doctrine of election,
which is this, that <hi>The Lord will ſhorten all the
dayes of tribulation</hi> which they meet withall here
in the world; the dayes of affliction, and dayes of
tribulation ſhall be ſhortned for the Elects ſake
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is a great refreſhment and comfort, that
God will ſhorten all the dayes of darkneſs, dayes
of tribulation, they ſhall be ſhortned for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
ſake; all their winter dayes ſhall be ſhor
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43429:120"/>
dayes, dark dayes ſhort dayes, there is an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of light a coming, a day that ſhall have no end,
the Sun ſhall never ſet; but as for the dayes of
darkneſs, of ſorrow, affliction and tribulation, the
Lord in mercy will ſhorten them: See what is
ſaid <hi>Matth. 24. 21, 22. For then ſhall be great
Tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of
the world to this time, no, nor ever ſhall be: and
except thoſe dayes ſhould be ſhortened, there ſhould
no fleſh be ſaved; but for the Elects ſake thoſe dayes
ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> But for the Elects ſake all the
dayes of publick calamity ſhall be ſhortned, dark
dayes, ſad dayes, ſuch a ſad day as the Jewes ſaw
when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken by <hi>Titus;</hi> it is ſpoken
firſt of that dark and ſad day to the Jewes, when
ſo many millions of them periſhed, ſuch tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as never was, and if the Lord ſhould not ſhorten
thoſe dayes, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved, that is, not
one of them would have been left alive upon the
earth, thoſe dayes were ſo dark and ſo ſore, but
for the <hi>Elects ſake thoſe dayes of tribulation were
ſhortned.</hi> And ſo all the dayes of calamity that
Gods people meet withall, thoſe dayes of diſtreſs,
yea dayes of publick calamity, and the dayes of
their particular afflictions, yea every dark day the
Lord will ſhorten; the Lord in mercy will ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the dayes of their affliction; and that is a
great comfort to them, that though their dayes of
affliction be very grievous, the Lord in mercy will
make their affliction dayes to be but ſhort.</p>
               <p>In the ninth place,<note place="margin">Ninth ground of comfort.</note> there is this comfort that
doth flow from the knowledge of our election,
that <hi>the Lord will certainly avenge the cauſe of his
people.</hi> The Lord doth take notice, and he will
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43429:121"/>
avenge all the wrongs that any of his elect people
doth meet withall in the World. See <hi>Luke 18. 6,
7. And the Lord ſaid, heare what the unjuſt Judge
ſaith, and ſhall not God avenge his own elect which
cry day and night unto him, though he beare long
with them, I tell you that he will avenge them ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
I tell you, ſaith Chriſt, that he will avenge their
cauſe and all their wrongs and injuries that they
meet withall in the World.</p>
               <p>In the tenth and laſt place,<note place="margin">Tenth ground of comfort.</note> there is this ground
of comfort, that the Lords people, thoſe whom he
loves from eternity, <hi>they ſhall never fall away from
him,</hi> never be plucked out of his hand, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
thing that they ſhould periſh. This is a
mighty ground of ſtrong conſolation which they
rob poor ſouls of that doe plead for conditionall
election; the condition to be performed by the
creature, it is alwayes at uncertainties to the end
of a mans life, whether he ſhall continue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
or no. But now the Doctrine of free and
abſolute and immutable election doth afford this
ground of comfort, and the knowledge of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Gods election doth aſſure us of this, that
not any of Chriſts Sheep ſhall periſh, they ſhall
never be drawne off from Chriſt, never be drawn
off from following Chriſt their Shepherd, from
laying him as the foundation of their life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.
Oh! what need have we to get ſuch a
ground of comfort in theſe back-ſliding times?
when ſo many that make a profeſſion doe ſwerve
from their profeſſion, and make ſhipwrack of their
profeſſion of faith; <hi>But notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,
having this ſeal the Lord knoweth thoſe that are his.</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:43429:121"/>
Though never ſo many that make a profeſſion fall
away, yet the foundation of the Lord ſtand ſure;
and therefore in <hi>Math. 24. 24.</hi> See what Chriſt
ſaith, for <hi>there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe
Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders,
inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive
the very elect.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh of the latter dayes,
a propheſie of our times, that there ſhould ariſe
ſome that ſhould doe great wonders, and be falſe
Chriſts, that ſhall indeavour to take men off from
looking to the true Chriſt that was crucified at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and is riſen againe, falſe Chriſts that
ſhall put you upon it to looke to a Chriſt within
you, and they ſhall come in ſuch a way, if it were
poſſible that they ſhould deceive the very Elect,
but is it not poſſible that the people of the Lords
Election ſhould fall finally; they may fall for a
time, we know not what ſinfull practiſes Gods
people may fall into if the Lord leaves them, and
what errour in judgment if the Lord leaves them;
but it is not poſſible that they ſhould be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for ever; for the Lord will bring them back
againe to the right Chriſt, it is not poſſible that
they ſhould fall away totally and finally, for the
mighty power of God is ingaged for their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>You are kept by the mighty power of God through
faith unto ſalvation.</hi> If it were in our own hand it
were not poſſible that we ſhould be kept, we meet
with ſo much from within, from an unbeleeving
heart, and ſo much from without, but you are kept
by the mighty power of God through faith to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
My Father holds you, ſaith Chriſt, and I
hold you, and no man can pluck them out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hand. And ſo you ſee the third particular
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43429:122"/>
that this doctrine of election doth adminiſter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
grounds of ſtrong conſolation, and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
to the people of God.</p>
               <p>I come now to the fourth particular propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that is this.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding this Doctrine doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſo much ground of comfort, yet,
The Lords people may meet with many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Doctrine of Election.<note place="margin">Fourth part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They may meet with many temptations, both
about the election of <hi>others,</hi> and their <hi>own election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Gods people may meet with many temptations concerning <hi>others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>
                  </note> They may meet with many temptations
about the <hi>election of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt of all, this may be a temptation, a
ſoul may be prying by the eye of carnall reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this great Myſtery of Gods eternal purpoſe and
counſell, it is poſſible that the people of God may
ſuffer much this way, and by this may be brought
into great temptations and ſnares, by giving way
to carnall reaſon and ſetting carnall reaſon on
work to look into this great myſtery, and to deſire
and covet that their reaſon may be ſatisfied; this
proves a great ſnare and a great temptation to
men when they ſhall goe about to ſatisfie their
carnall reaſon, and ſhall be unſatisfied in that they
cannot apprehend to be according to reaſon; if
their reaſon be not ſatisfied they cannot reſt in the
purpoſe and decree of God; oh! this leads many a
poor ſoul into great ſnares and great temptations.</p>
               <p>And as a remedy againſt this temptation know
this,<note place="margin">1. Remedy.</note> let us know, that God is no bound to give an account to
our reaſon, of any of his actings. <hi>He giveth no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his matters,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> God is not bound
to give an account to the creature, he is abſolute
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43429:122"/>
and free, and is not bound to give an account to
our carnall reaſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Let us know this, that our reaſon is a
corrupted and a crooked rule;<note place="margin">2 Remedy.</note> and ſhall we goe
about to meaſure the counſell of Gods purpoſe and
his acting from eternity by our crooked rule, and
not ſubſcribe to them unleſſe we make them out
by our crooked rule? Oh! let us know, that
when this temptation preſents it ſelf, our reaſon is
a crooked rule, and Gods rule ſtrait; and our rule
being crooked we muſt not goe about to meaſure
Gods actings and purpoſe by our reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As a Remedy againſt this, know that
though our reaſon were never ſo ſtrait,<note place="margin">3 Remedy.</note> yet there
are many things in God that are too deep for us to
find out. Though our reaſon be not crooked, though
it be ſpirituallized, there are many of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
myſteries of God that we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend;
though they are not <hi>againſt</hi> ſpirituall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
yet they are <hi>above</hi> our reaſon, that it is not
poſſible, and ſo long as in this ſtate we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them; it cannot be made out to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thoſe wonderfull myſteries of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt not goe about to ſearch them out by
our reaſon, and be diſconted becauſe our reaſon
is not ſatisfied; but we muſt reſt ſatisfied in the
will of God, &amp; admire that which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
know that God is not unrighteous, if he
chuſe one and leave another, he is not unrighteous
though we cannot make it out to our carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but oh let us ſtand and wonder and admire
as the Apoſtle did, he could not ſatisfie his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but he ſtands and admires and cries out, oh
the depth of the wiſdom and counſel of God! how
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43429:123"/>
are his wayes paſt finding out?<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> carnall reaſon may put us upon ſome
other temptations; a ſoul may be tempted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
about that way of God, his chuſing ſome

with this temptation, and be much diſquieted with
this; oh! why will not God ſave all the World?
he ſaves ſome men, but oh! why will not God
ſave all? we think it had been better if God had
ſaved all, there is mercy enough in God to ſave
all, and there is enough in the death of Chriſt to
ſave all, his blood hath price enough and vertue
enough to ſatisfie for a thouſand worlds; why
then would not God ſave all?</p>
               <p>To ſilence this temptation,<note place="margin">1. Remedy.</note> that it
is infinite grace that God ſaves any; when we
conſider what the loſt condition was that man
brought himſelfe into, what ſtrangers and enemies
how deſperately bent and ſet againſt God: Oh!
the indignity that hath been done to God by the
ſons of men! oh! what free grace is it that God
will ſave any? we ſhould rather ſtand and wonder
that God will ſave ſo many thouſands yea millions,
when as he might have left all in condemnation.
Oh! let us not wonder that God hath not ſaved
all, but wonder that God hath ſaved ſo many; and
that any of us are in the number of thoſe that are
ſaved.</p>
               <p>And further,<note place="margin">2. Remedy.</note> to ſilence this temptation; why?
ſay that the fault is not in God, the fault is in the
creature; <hi>thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf;</hi> Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is not the cauſe of any mans deſtruction;
no, man brought deſtruction upon himſelfe, and
man bringing deſtruction upon himſelf, God
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43429:123"/>
may chuſe whether he will ſave him or no.</p>
               <p>And we may ſay further for the clearing of
God,<note place="margin">3. Remedy.</note> that God doth lay blocks in mens way to
keep them from running to hell; he layes many
commandements and many promiſes to keep men
from ſinning; God put many morall barrs in mens
way, though the Lord is not pleaſed to work pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
and overcomingly, yet there are many
barrs that God doth lay in mens way to keep them
from ſinning, ſo that mens own conſciences ſhall
witneſſe that their deſtruction is of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Yea I may ſay further for the clearing of God;<note place="margin">4. Remedy.</note>
that God doth afford means of life, and meanes of
ſalvation; there is ſufficient means afforded to a
great part of the World, if not to all; I ſay there
is ſufficient meanes afforded for bringing men to
life and ſalvation, to thoſe that ſit under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
Though it is true, the Lord doth not alwayes
nor to all men make them effectuall infallibly, yet
I ſay there is a ſufficiency in the means, if there
were no lett in the creature, but that the Lord doth
not make thoſe means afforded to us effectuall,
infallibly to bring men to life and ſalvation;
therein we muſt reſt in the good pleaſure of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> this is another temptation; why doth
God chuſe this man and not that man? why <hi>Peter</hi>
and not <hi>Judas? Judas</hi> ſin it was no greater then
<hi>Peters</hi> ſin. <hi>Judas betrayed Chriſt, Peter denyed
Chriſt</hi> and is forſworne; now that God ſhould
chuſe one man and not another; why this man
and not that man?</p>
               <p>To ſilence this temptation, we muſt know that
the Lord is free, and mercy it belongs to him, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43429:124"/>
he may ſhew it where he pleaſeth. As for this
God will give no account to the creature, why one
man and not another, why the Lord will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to one man not to another.<note place="margin">Luke 17. 34, 35, 36.</note> You know what
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be two men in one bed, the
one ſhall be taken and the other left; two women ſhall
be grinding together, the one ſhall be taken and the
other left; two men ſhall be in the field, the one ſhall
be taken and the other left.</hi> Two in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the one taken and the other left. And for
this we muſt reſt in the good pleaſure of God,
and nothing elſe will quiet our ſpirits, if we doe
not reſt in the good pleaſure of God, for God
doth no wrong to the creature, if he doth love one
and not another.</p>
               <p>And it is a ſtrange thing, that we in our carnall
reaſon will abridge God of that, which we will
take to our ſelves, and that is to love where he
pleaſe; if you love one more then another, you
are not bound to give any account of it; and men
take a liberty to beſtow gifts upon one and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another. And let not us bind the Lord from
that which we will take to our ſelves, to love one
and not another. And truly if we doe not reſt in
the good pleaſure of God in this, we ſhall but
diſquiet our ſpirits, and meet with no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Againe, Gods people may be tempted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Relations,<note place="margin">4 Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> their children. Oh many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
have many thoughts, whether God loves
their children or no, and whether their children
be choſen of God from eternity; and eſpecially
at ſome times. As when God comes to take away
children by death, then the temptation ſets upon
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43429:124"/>
but eſpecially when children goe on in the wayes
of ſin, Parents they pray and wait, and they ſee no
fruit, but ſtill they goe on in the wayes of ſin. It
may be the Parents dye and leave their children
going on in ſin, and ſee not the fruit of Gods
electing love, nor the fruit of Covenant mercy,
then this proves a ſore temptation to them.</p>
               <p>Now to ſilence this temptation,<note place="margin">How to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the fourth tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</note> know that there
is no beleeving Parent, but he may have hope of
his children, even of all his children while they
are young, before growne up to renounce the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
If God take away any of your children
young, no Parent but may have hope concerning
his children in the Covenant made to beleeving
Parents, I ſay they may have hope, the Covenant
of God will relieve in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>Ah, but when children doe grow up, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
ſee that they walke in wayes that are evill,
and are contrary to God, and are far from God,
yet believing parents may believe that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that, they may belong to God; I ſay
<hi>notwithſtanding</hi> for the preſent they are far from
God, and walke contrary to the Lord, yet they
may be known to the Lord, and in his due time he
may bring them in. And Parents ſhould not give
over the uſe of the meanes, and though Parents
ſhould wait all their dayes, and pray and plead
the Covenant, and deſire to ſee the fruit of Gods
Covenant, and ſhould not ſee it, believers they
may dye in hope, the Lord he may bring in Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
children; the Lord he may doe them good
afterward, when you are dead and gone, he may
bring ſome of your good counſells and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their remembrance; he may afterward
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43429:125"/>
when you lye in the duſt, bring to remembrance
ſome of your words, and may make them work
powerfully upon their hearts. Believing Parents
may ſtill dye in hope, though they ſee not the fruit
of the Covenant, though their children may be at
a great diſtance from God, the Lord may bring
them in, and you meet with them with comfort at
the laſt day.</p>
               <p>There is one Temptation more concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which I ſhall but touch, and that is this:
Is not the Goſpel Preached to all? and are not all
commanded to believe? and is it not declared
that whoſoever doth believe ſhall be ſaved? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
man or woman in the World doth believe
ſhall be ſaved; yea, doth not the Scripture ſay,
that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved, and come
to the knowledge of the truth?</hi>—The ſoul may
thus reaſon with it ſelfe, how can this ſtand with
Gods purpoſe and decree and election? If there
be an abſolute immutable unchangeable election,
how can it be declared that whoſoever believe in
Chriſt ſhall be ſaved; whereas if men be not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
they cannot be ſaved, and if elected, they
ſhall be ſaved, though they doe not believe. Thus
the temptation may work.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, notwithſtanding Gods ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the Goſpel may and muſt ſo be preached;
and yet there is no deceivableneſſe in God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but truth and ſincerity in God: for you muſt
know that we are to walke by the revealed Will
of God. And all men ſhall be judged by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Will of God. Now what is the revealed
Will of God, why, that <hi>we believe in the name of
his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> declaring <hi>that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43429:125"/>
ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And God will certainly
make good that word; <hi>whoſoever doth believe ſhall
be ſaved.</hi> Never any in the World that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt and believed on his name, but was ſaved.
Notwithſtanding the ſecret decree and purpoſe of
God, and there is no man but may claime life and
ſalvation, upon thoſe tearmes on which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth hold forth life and ſalvation, and that is
beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection. But,</hi> God would have all men to be
ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth; <hi>why
then ſure there is no election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That Scripture doth but hold forth,
what the thing is which is well pleaſing to God,
that men return to the Lord, and that they believe
in the name of Chriſt, which is the way to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this is a thing that is pleaſing to the Lord; not
that God wills it with an effectuall operative will,
for then it muſt needs be: But it only holds forth
what is pleaſing to God, not that God will bring
all men to repentance, not that God will worke
faith in all men, therein God will be left free to
his good pleaſure; he wills it not with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
will, for then it muſt needs be.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. But you will ſay, what are the Wills
of God contrary one to another? hath God a will
and a will? hath God a revealed will, that he
will have all men to be ſaved, and is his ſecret
will contrary to his revealed will?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, no, Gods wills are not contrary to
one another. To ſay God doth delight, and it is a
thing pleaſing to him, that men doe believe and
return to the Lord, and take hold of Chriſt; and
to ſay that God is not pleaſed to work this in the
heart, is no contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:43429:126"/>
The Goſpel declares that this is well pleaſing
to God, that men doe returne to him, and believe
in Chriſt; and the Goſpel doth declare, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
doth beleeve ſhall be ſaved. Now if God
ſhould condemne any man that doth beleeve in
Chriſt, then God ſhould walk contrary to his will.</p>
               <p>But to ſay, God doth approve of theſe things,
they are excellent, and ſo he wills them, that is he
delights in them; and yet to ſay, God is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to work this in every mans heart, there is no
contradiction. And thus we ſhould labour to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thoſe temptations which our carnall reaſon
may make concerning this great myſtery of Gods
election; you ſee what temptations Gods people
may meet withall concerning the election of
others.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Gods people meet with many <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi> concerning <hi>their own election.</hi>
                  </note> A poor ſoul may be thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
that it is an impoſſible thing for it to attaine
to the knowledge of Gods love; this is a ſecret,
this is that which was tranſacted in Heaven, and
therefore ſure it is not poſſible for me to attain to
the knowledge of this, that the Lord hath loved
me, and hath written my name in the book of life.
Men may have ſome good hopes of it, but ſurely,
ſaith the temptation, it is preſumption for any man
to think or ſay, he may come to aſſurance, that the
Lord hath written his name in the Book of life;
for there are theſe two things againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Secret things belongeth to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No eye hath ſeen what is done in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43429:127"/>
Heaven, and if eye hath not ſeen it, how ſhall I
attaine to the knowledge of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Anſwer to this temptation, know and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that many of the Saints of God hath attained
to the knowledge of Gods eternall love, and hath
riſen to this aſſurance, that the Lord hath loved
and will love with an everlaſting love. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
Paul <hi>did attaine to it, and he gloryes in it;
yea then, when he ſpeaketh in the perſon of all the
Elect of God.</hi> Rom. 8. 33. Who ſhall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods elect; it is God that
juſtifieth: <hi>Verſ. 34.</hi> Who is he that condemneth;
it is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again,
who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
interceſſion for us. <hi>Verſ. 35.</hi> Who ſhall ſeparate
us from the love of Chriſt? <hi>He ſtands up to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
all the world, and the powers of darkneſſe,</hi>
who dare lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?
<hi>And in the 38. verſe ſee what he further ſaith,</hi>
For I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor
Angels, nor Principallities, nor Powers, nor things
preſent, nor things to come: <hi>Verſ. 39.</hi> Nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt
Jeſus our Lord. <hi>So then you ſee, it is a thing not
impoſſible to attaine to the knowledge of Gods
eternall electing love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, it is laid upon all the Saints as a duty to
ſeek after the knowledge of it, <hi>2 Pet. 1. 10.
Wherefore the rather brethren, give diligence to make
your calling and election ſure, for if you doe theſe
things, ye ſhall never fall.</hi> So then election may be
made ſure, and it is a duty which lyeth upon all
believers to ſtrive after, that they may make their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43429:127"/>
calling and election ſure. Now if it be ſo, that this
is a thing that may be attained unto, and that the
Saints hath attained unto, and a duty which all the
children of God are put upon, then certainly this
is a temptation; and know it is a temptation, that
it is an impoſſible thing for any to attaine to the
knowledge of Gods electing love.</p>
               <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> The ſecond temptation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our election may be this, a poor ſoul may be
thus tempted; it is true, there may be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods love, and many of the Saints have
attained to this knowledge, but as for me I have
no certainty; I have ſtriven, and I have waited
upon God, and ſought for aſſurance, but I have
not attained it; and therefore I am ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
ſurely the Lord hath not loved me, others
ſought and they have attained, and have aſſurance;
I have ſought and I cannot meet with aſſurance of
the love of God, and therefore certainly the Lord
hath not loved me.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer to this temptation, know, that thou canſt
not conclude that God hath not called thee effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
becauſe thou haſt not aſſurance, and if thou
canſt not conclude that God hath not called thee
effectually, becauſe thou haſt not aſſurance, much
leſs canſt thou conclude, that God hath not choſen
thee from eternity, becauſe thou haſt not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, In anſwer to this temptation, hath
not the Lord given thee a heart to cloſe with
Chriſt, as held forth in the Goſpel to poor loſt
ſinners? hath not God made thee willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Chriſt? hath not the Lord in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
inabled thee to cleave to Chriſt? and doſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43429:128"/>
now reſolve to caſt thy ſelf upon Chriſt, to venture
all upon Chriſt, even thy eternity? why then
know, here is that which gives the eſſence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of faith? this accepting of Chriſt held forth in
the Goſpel with thy reſting upon him, it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of faith, and this faith is no other, but the faith
of Gods elect, the fruit of Gods electing love, it
ſprings from that eternall love which choſe his
people unto ſalvation through faith; and therefore
though there be not the comfort of faith, (aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is the comfort of faith, the flower that
grows upon the fruit of faith) yet if there be that
which gives the being of faith, thou mayſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Lord hath not loved thee, becauſe
thou haſt not aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In anſwer to this temptation, thou
ſayſt thou haſt no aſſurance of Gods electing love,
and therefore thou concludeſt that God doth not
love thee. As thou haſt no aſſurance that God
hath choſen thee, ſo thou haſt no knowledge of
the contrary, and mayeſt not conclude the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that God hath not choſen thee; for if thou
ſhouldſt ſo conclude, thou mayeſt lye againſt the
truth; and therefore ceaſe to draw any concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that which is not knowne to thee; and give
up thy ſelf to doe the revealed will of God; and
what is that? but that thou take hold of the offer
of ſalvation and receive Chriſt, that <hi>you believe in
the name of his Son, for this is his commandement,
1. Joh. 3. 18.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</note> this temptation may ariſe in the
ſoul, namely, a deſire that God would give it a
ſigne, an extraordinary ſigne, it reſolves it cannot
believe, and will not believe unleſs God give it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:43429:128"/>
ſigne. This is a temptation that ſome of Gods
people hath met withall.</p>
               <p>To anſwer this temptation, know that it is not
Gods ordinary way to give ſatisfaction to the ſoul
concerning his love, by giving an extraordinary
ſigne; it is true the Lord may ſometimes, in ſome
caſes condeſcend to his people, and may give an
extraordinary ſigne; yea the Lord may and hath
prevented his people ſometimes with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ſigne to prevent their unbeleefe when they
have not asked a ſigne: You have heard of that
woman that ſometime lived in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that
was many yeares in a tempted condition, and being
ſorely afflicted one day, ſhe took up a glaſſe in her
hand and caſt it againſt the ground with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>I am as ſurely damned as this glaſſe is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
and it pleaſed God ſo to order it that the
glaſs was not broke, which was to the conviction
of her unbeliefe. I ſay the Lord may give a ſigne,
yea when it is not asked, but it is not Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way; but now for a ſoul to ſtand it out with
God, that it cannot beleeve unleſs God doe give
it ſome extraordinary ſigne; oh this is a tempting
of God, and the Lord may leave ſuch a ſoul for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in its unbeliefe, when it ſhall take up ſuch a
reſolution that it will not believe though it hath
the promiſe unleſs it hath a ſigne; the Lord I ſay
may leave ſuch a ſoul in its unbeliefe.</p>
               <p>And further in anſwer, It is true, this was Gods
way formerly to ſatisfie his people by a ſigne, by
ſome extraordinary ſigne and viſion; but now
ſince the coming of Chriſt, <hi>God hath choſen to ſpeak
to us by his ſon,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb. 1. 2. God who at ſundry
times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43429:129"/>
the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe last
dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> God formerly did
reveale himſelf in an extraordinary way, he did
appeare ſometimes and ſpake mouth to mouth to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was Gods way then;
but now God hath choſe to ſpeak to us by his Son,
God ſpeaks by Chriſt, and Chriſt ſpeaketh by the
Scripture, <hi>heare him,</hi> faith the Father. Now Chriſt
hath laid down a rule for our faith and for our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and know this, that Jeſus Chriſt by his
Spirit can ſo make uſe of the word, that it ſhall
give as cleare and evident ſatisfaction to a ſoul
concerning the love of God, as if God ſhould give
a ſigne, as if God ſhould ſpeak immediately from
Heaven. When the Spirit of the Lord will make
uſe of the word of grace, it ſhall ſatisfie the ſoul
as fully of his love, as if the Lord did appear from
Heaven, and ſpeak to the ſoul mouth to mouth.</p>
               <p>Further, One thing more I ſhall ſpeak to this
Temptation; you that deſire a ſign, and would
have an extraordinary ſign that God loveth you;
why, know that God hath given you a ſigne; we
have ſigns as well as our fore-fathers had, what is
the water in Baptiſme, but a ſigne to us? and the
bread and wine in the Sacrament, but a ſigne to us?
that Ordinance of the Supper which we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of this day; the Lord hath condeſcended to
us to give us a ſigne, the bread is a ſigne, and the
wine is a ſigne, and the ſitting at the Lord Table
a ſigne, it is a ſigne unto faith, to every beleeving
ſoul; theſe are ſigns that God hath loved it from
everlaſting, and ſet it apart for communion with
himſelf, that he hath loved us and given his Son
for us, that Chriſt hath loved us and given his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43429:129"/>
blood for us, that he is reconciled and hath ſet us
at his Table, and we ſhall ſit with him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
here is a ſigne though not unto ſence, yet
here is a ſigne unto faith. We think that <hi>Abraham</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets</hi> they were happy, in that God did
appear to them from Heaven, and ſpake to them
immediately. When God appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and he called to him out of Heaven, <hi>Now I know
that thou loveſt me, and I have ſworne by my ſelf, in
bleſſing I will bleſs thee:</hi> You think that <hi>Abraham</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were happy, that he ſhould tell
them, that he knew they loved him, and that he
would love them, and would bleſs them. But
know it of a certaine that he hath dealt more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
with us under the Goſpel, then with them,
in this very perticular in which we deſire a ſigne;
in giving us theſe gracious ſignes; for it was but
ſeldome that God gave them a ſigne, very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and it was but to ſome of them, <hi>Abraham</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Patriarks;</hi> but now it is
Gods ordinary way to give us a ſigne, that which
was very rare to them, God hath made to us a
ſtanding ordinance, ſo that we have a ſigne conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
before us; as often as we brake the bread
and drink the wine, the Lord gives a ſigne to faith,
and ſpeaks to faith his everlaſting love. And
therefore take heed that we doe not tempt God to
ſeek another ſigne. What ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Math. 12.
39.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſees deſired to ſee a
ſigne from Chriſt, <hi>verſ. 38. An evill and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
generation ſeeketh after a ſigne, and there ſhall
be no ſigne given to it, but the ſigne of the Prophet
Jonas.</hi> They would not accept of the ſigne that
Chriſt gave them, no, they would have other
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43429:130"/>
ſigns; <hi>They are an adulterous Generation,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>and they ſhall have no other ſigne, but the
ſigne of the Prophet Jonas.</hi> So when we are ſeeking
for other ſignes, and oh that God would worke
extraordinary ſignes! why, ſaith God, they ſhall
have no other ſignes then the ſigne of the bread
and wine and water, theſe ſhall be ſealing ſignes.
And know, whereas we think ſome extraordinary
ſign ſhould convince us and overcome our hearts,
ſuch is the unbeleefe of our hearts, that if we doe
not believe when God gives us his word, and theſe
ſignes, neither would we believe if God ſhould
ſpeake in ſome extraordinary way from Heaven.
<hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if
they will not heare them, neither will they hear if one
roſe from the dead. Dives</hi> he was deſirous that one
ſhould goe from the dead to his Brethren; oh no,
they have <hi>Moſes and the Prophets, if they will not
believe them, neither will they believe though one
roſe from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Another temptation may be this; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
deſire to be out of the World, that ſo a man may
know what that ſtate is which God hath ordained
him unto; there may be ſuch a temptation as this,
a haſting to dye, and to goe out of the world, that
ſo men might know what their ſtate in another
world is, what it is that God hath decreed and
purpoſed concerning them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, There is abudance of folly in this;
for let me ſay to ſuch a ſoul under ſuch a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1. Either thou haſt aſſurance of Gods eternall
love, or elſe thou haſt it not; 2. Thou knoweſt
not but that thou mayeſt have it; or 3. Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaireſt
of ever having it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:43429:130"/>
Now to the firſt, If the Lord hath given thee
any evidence of his love, and any hopes of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the World to come, thou doſt very ill
thus to make haſt to be poſſeſſed of that which the
Lord hath given thee, thou ſhouldſt rather waite
the Lords time. Remember, what the Scripture
ſaith, <hi>He that believeth maketh not haſt.</hi> If thou
haſt faith, if thou haſt any hope of a bleſſed ſtate in
the world to come, take heed that thou doſt not
make haſt, thou ſhouldſt rather covet and deſire to
do that which is thy work before thou goeſt hence,
thou ſhouldſt deſire an opportunity of lifting up
the name of the Lord before the Sons of men; now
there is no ſuch opportunity of making the name
of the Lord glorious in the grave; and therefore
thou ſhouldſt rather deſire to know thy work and
to doe thy work before thou goeſt hence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If it be ſo that thou haſt no evidence
of Gods love, not any knowledge of it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet thou art not without all hope; why then,
what a folly is it to deſire to be out of this world,
that thou mayeſt know thy ſtate. Surely thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
out of thy way, that is not Gods way to come
to the knowledge of what God hath purpoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thee, thy way is to give all diligence
while here, not to deſire to go into another world
to know what it is; but it is thy duty to give all
diligence before thou goeſt, to make thy calling
and election ſure, to wait upon God with all thy
might.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be ſo that thou haſt no hope, but
thou diſpareſt concerning the love of God; Oh I
ſhall never attaine to the knowledg of Gods love;
why then it is deſpairing madneſs, it is beaſtly and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43429:131"/>
unreaſonable madneſſe in thee to haſten thy end,
to deſire to remove out of this world before the
Lords time, that ſo thou mayeſt know thy worſt,
I ſay, that is madneſſe and folly, for ſo long as thou
art in the Land of the living, thou art in a ſtate of
poſſibility; no poor ſinners how vile ſoever, but
while in the Land of the Living, they are in a ſtate
of poſſibility, for as I ſaid before, ſo againe, that
even reaſon and a mans conſcience will tell him,
that it is not poſſible that he ſhould know that the
Lord hath rejected him; and therefore for any
man to ſay it is impoſſible that he ſhould be ſaved,
and have no hope, that man lyes againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and againſt truth, to conclude that which the
Lord hath not revealed; and therefore while in
the ſtate of life, you are in a ſtate of poſſibility,
and oh! what madneſſe is it for a man to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into ſuch a ſtate where there is no hope, no
poſſibility?</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> There is another temptation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our own election, which is this; If God hath
decreed all things, his purpoſe muſt ſtand, why
then his purpoſe cannot be reſiſted, God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
whatever falls out in the world, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
it; and therefore we cannot withſtand it,
if we doe ſin againſt God we cannot helpe it, God
hath purpoſed it, he hath purpoſed all things: and
therefore why doth God find fault, why doth
God puniſh the ſons of men, we cannot helpe our
ſinning againſt God. That cavill is raiſed in <hi>Rom.
9. 19. Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath
reſiſted his will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, Gods decre doth not neceſſitate any
man, doth not compell the will; no, when he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43429:131"/>
decrees to ſave his people and beſtow faith upon
them, he doth not compell the will, but ſweetly
inclines the heart. And ſo God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the will of men to ſin, Gods decree is not the
product of mans ſinning; it is true, God ſuffers it
ſo to be, but mans will it is voluntary in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſin, and it is that which he chuſeth, that
which he delights in and loves; and this is the
condemnation, Gods decree is not the cauſe of
mans ſinning, no, mans own perverſe will is the
cauſe of all ſinning. And therefore let no man
ſay, <hi>he is tempted of God,</hi> for no charge no blame
can be laid upon God. It is true, Gods <hi>ſecret abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
will</hi> cannot be reſiſted; but Gods <hi>revealed
will</hi> (which is mans rule) may be reſiſted, and is
reſiſted, and that ſhall be their condemnation.
Gods ſecret will is not knowne, but it is evident
men may reſiſt Gods revealed will. <hi>Ye ſtiffe neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and uncircumciſed in heart, and eares, ye doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt; as your Fathers did,
ſo doe ye,</hi> Acts 7. 51. So that the Spirit may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
and Gods will may be reſiſted, that will
which is our rule may be reſiſted, and is reſiſted,
and that freely and voluntarily by mens own will,
and they are not ordained to it by any of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees:
And therefore ceaſe to lay the blame on
God, for man ſhall one day ſee that his ſin is his
own, and his condemnation his own.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiod.</note> There is another temptation that may
ariſe from Gods decree, and it is a temptation to
this hour. A man may thus reaſon, if God hath
decreed that I ſhall be ſaved, then I ſhall be ſaved,
I ſhall be ſaved without my ſtriving, what need I
make ſuch a ſtir; if God hath decreed that I ſhall
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43429:132"/>
be ſaved, then I ſhall be ſaved though I goe on in
ſin, Gods decree and purpoſe cannot be hindred;
and therefore if I be choſen to life and ſalvation,
I ſhall be ſaved without my own ſtriving, without
taking paines, and I ſhall be ſaved whatever I
doe.</p>
               <p>This is a deſperate temptation, and I ſhall
ſpeake ſomething to it. Thou ſayeſt if God hath
decreed thy ſalvation then thou ſhalt be ſaved and
muſt be ſaved without thy pains, though thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
no paines to look after Chriſt, and believe and
repent as others doe.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: Firſt, though God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
thy ſalvation, and though thou beeſt in the
number of his choſen, yet without thy ſtriving and
wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing upon God in his own way, thou canſt not
attain to the knowledge and comfort of it; and is
this nothing for a man to goe all his dayes (though
he be choſen) without the knowledge of Gods
love, and goe under fears, and be in bondage all
his dayes? is this nothing, though choſen, ſo long
as thou fitteſt ſtill thou canſt not know it, and ſo
not have the comfort of it? But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath joyned the meanes and
the end together, know that; ſo that one cannot
be without the other. Thou ſayeſt if thou beeſt
elected then thou ſhalt be ſaved, thou concludeſt
concerning the end; and I ſay, if thou beeſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
then thou ſhalt certainly be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Chriſt and become a new creature. The
meanes it is purpoſed by God as well as the end,
God hath decreed to bring his people to life and
ſalvation this way, by believing; in the way of
faith, and in the way of repentance, and in the way
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43429:132"/>
of holineſſe, you ſhall be ſaved; and truly it is as
impoſſible for them to goe without faith, to be in
an unrenewed condition all their dayes, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for thoſe to be ſaved that are not elected;
yea I may ſay notwithſtanding Gods decree, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
Gods election, yet if thou doſt not
beleeve in Chriſt, and be not a new creature thou
canſt not be ſaved, if thou doſt not get faith and
holineſſe thou canſt not be ſaved. The Apoſtle he
reaſons ſo in <hi>Acts 27.</hi> God tells the Apoſtle there,
that the lives of them all ſhould be ſaved, and at
<hi>verſ. 30. 31.</hi> When the Ship-men were about to
flee out of the Ship. <hi>Paul ſaid to the Centurion and
to the ſouldiers, except theſe abide in the Ship ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaved.</hi> Becauſe as God purpoſed the end, as
that they ſhould be ſaved, ſo he purpoſed that they
ſhould be ſaved that way, by ſtaying in the Ship.
And ſo notwithſtanding Gods decree, if thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
not faith in Chriſt, and beeſt not a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
thou canſt not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>And to that which thou ſayeſt, it is not of him
that willeth nor runneth, but God that ſheweth
mercy; and therefore why ſhould I ſtrive for
life and ſalvation?</p>
               <p>I deny that, that God will ſave thee without
thy ſtriving: It is true, it is not for thy faith and
repentance that God will ſave, but without theſe
God will not ſave; this is the way by which God
ſaves. You would think he were an unreaſonable
man that ſhould argue thus, God hath decreed
how long I ſhall live, whether twenty, thirty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or ſixty yeares, the period is appointed by
God, and therefore it matters not that I eate.
Now if God hath appointed a man ſhould live
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43429:133"/>
ſo long, he hath alſo appointed that you ſhould
uſe the meanes. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> he knew how long he
ſhould live, <hi>I will add unto thy dayes fifteen yeares,</hi>
2 Kings 20. 6. It had been ſtrange reaſoning for
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> to ſay, I will neither eate nor drink for
Gods purpoſe muſt ſtand; as God hath purpoſed
the end, ſo he purpoſed the means; ſo that the
means and the end are joyned together.</p>
               <p>But thou reaſoneſt further; that if God doth
decree that I ſhall be ſaved, why then I ſhall be
ſaved though I goe on in a way of ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, here is a groſſe miſtake of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;
God doth not decree to ſave any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he doth, though he all his dayes goe on to
deſtroy himſelfe; God never made ſuch a decree,
no, Gods decree is to ſave men from ſin as well
as from wrath. If God decrees to ſave any man
from wrath, he decrees to ſave that man from ſin:
As it is impoſſible that that man ſhould goe to
hell that God decrees to ſave, ſo it is impoſſible
that that man ſhould wallow in ſin.</p>
               <p>And oh what great ingratitude? to ſay, though
I goe on in ſin I ſhall be ſaved, if God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
it. Oh great ingratitude! As if a child
ſhould ſay, my father hath entailed a great eſtate
upon me, and I cannot goe without it though I
doe all that I can againſt him; oh! is this the
part of a child? ſure of a baſtard and not a child!
oh horrible ingratitude!</p>
               <p>Nay, let me ſay there is madneſſe in it; there
is this madneſſe, as if a man ſhould ſay, God hath
purpoſed how long I ſhall live, and it matters not
though I ſtab my ſelfe, and though I run into the
Sea, I ſhall live ſo long as God hath purpoſed;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:43429:133"/>
oh! ſuch deſperate madneſſe is in many men
when they reaſon about Gods decree.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt temptation, is a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of deſpaire,<note place="margin">7. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> which ſome of Gods people may
be exerciſed withall; and thus they may reaſon,
if the Lord hath not purpoſed my ſalvation, if he
hath not decreed my ſalvation, them I cannot be
ſaved whatever I doe, though I take never ſo
much paines, and ſtrive never ſo much; though
I ſeek faith and repentance, yea though I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and though I doe repent, yet if God hath
not decreed my ſalvation I cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; that Gods decree and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhall never infringe the truth of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
that he hath made; now he hath made a
promiſe, <hi>that whoſoever believe in Chriſt ſhall be
ſaved:</hi> Now Gods decree ſhall not infringe the
truth of this promiſe; and there is no man upon
earth that ſhall believe in the name of Jeſus
Chriſt, but he may claime life and ſalvation upon
Gods promiſe, and it ſhall be made out to
him.</p>
               <p>And let me ſay further, that thou doſt not take
the right courſe to begin at Gods decree: Oh!
this is a diſcouragement, this will keep thee off
from the uſe of the meanes; if I be not elected I
cannot be ſaved, thou takeſt the wrong courſe to
begin at they election, who taught thee this way?
God never taught thee ſo; it is from Sathan who
endeavours to puſſell thee in thy way. Though
there be ſuch an election, and the Saints have
much comfort when they doe know their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet you muſt not begin with election, but know
that you muſt walk by Gods revealed will, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43429:134"/>
look to Gods revealed will; if thou art called to
faith and to believe, thou art not amongſt the
loſt ones, and art called to life and ſalvation; and
therefore look to the revealed will of God, ſo
long as a man is in the ſtate of unbeleefe it is not
poſſible that he ſhould know what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
concerning him. Therefore doe not begin
at election; this is for a man to covet to ſet his
foot upon the higheſt ſtep of the Ladder before he
ſets it upon loweſt. When a man is in his youth
he doth not know whether God hath purpoſed old
age for him, and becauſe he does not know it, he
is not diſcouraged from the uſe of the meanes;
and ſo I ſay, in a ſtate of unbeleefe thou canſt not
know that God hath loved thee, but this ſhould
not diſcourage thee to waite upon God in the uſe
of the meanes, giving up thy ſelfe to his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will, which commands thee, and all the Sons
of men, to beleeve in Chriſt. And as I ſaid, ſo I
ſay againe, that there is no man that ever beleeved
in Jeſus Chriſt but he was ſaved; and therefore
it is madneſſe and folly for a man to ſay, though I
beleeve in Chriſt, I ſhall not be ſaved if God hath
not purpoſed it, I tell you there is none that ever
did beleeve in Chriſt but was ſaved, and any that
doe beleeve to the end of the world, may goe to
God and challenge him upon his word: Nay, I
may ſay, if <hi>Judas</hi> had beleeved and repented and
turned to the Lord, <hi>Judas</hi> had been ſaved.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. But you will ſay, If I be not elected,
I cannot believe, it is in vaine for me to take pains;
if the Lord hath not purpoſed to give me faith, I
ſhall never be able to work it in my own heart, and
therefore in vaine for me to temper with my own
heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:43429:134"/>
                  <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> That thou doſt not know that God
hath not purpoſed to give thee faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art bound to wait upon the Lord in the
uſe of the means. And that thou haſt not faith,
do not lay it upon God, though it be true; Faith
is his gift, yet God doth hinder no man from
believing, God layes no Blocks in any man's
way: Nay, there is a great deal that God doth
to bring men unto Faith, what means doth God
uſe? What workings are there? What ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the Spirit? What Invitations? What
Exhortations? the Word of the Lord is full of
them.</p>
               <p>And let me ſay further, that if the Lord hath
given thee a heart in good earneſt to deſire the
gift of faith, the Lord will certainly give it out to
thee; I ſay, if the Lord hath ſet a man's Heart
and Will to the Lord, that a man doth from the
heart deſire Chriſt, that great gift of God, the
Lord will certainly give the gift of Faith; <hi>If thou
kneweſt the gift of God, and did ask of him, he
would have given thee living water:</hi> John 4. 10.
If there had been a Will in thee to have deſired
it, he would have given thee Water of Life;
But if there be not a Will in man to have Faith;
Nay, the heart of man doth ſecretly oppoſe it;
why, then let not man lay the fault upon God;
But if the Lord hath given a Will, and a man's
Will be not againſt the Lord, then there is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of God's work, and the Lord will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
give out the gift of Faith, and Chriſt, to
a poor Soul, that ſhall be found waiting upon
him.</p>

ſet carnal Reaſon on work to finde out this great
and wonderful Myſterie; take heed of the very
beginnings of carnal reaſon; when you begin to

why God ſhould chuſe one, and refuſe another;
Seek not to ſatisfie Carnal Reaſon in this; for

And therefore for the ſilencing of Carnal Reaſon;</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt of all, That <hi>he is God, and thou art
man;</hi> therefore do not quarrel and contend with
God, and ſeek to bring down God to ſatisfie thy
reaſon in this; <hi>Rom. 9. 20. Nay but, O man, Who art
thou that replyeſt againſt God? Shall the thing

made me thus?</hi> The Apoſtle he brings in this for
the ſilencing of carnal reaſon, that is too buſie in

unleſs he hath a reaſon; <hi>Man, Who art thou?</hi>
conſider that thou art man, that thou art but a child
of <hi>Adam;</hi> and remember that as thou art man,

               <p>Thirdly, For to ſilence carnal reaſon, conſider,
That <hi>the more a man wades into this myſterie with
his own reaſon, the further he is and ſhall be from
ſatisfaction:</hi> for it is juſt as if a man ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to go and wade over the Sea on foot, when
a man ſets the firſt ſtep into the Sea, it may be he
is up to the knees, the next ſtep up to the loyns,
next ſtep up to the neck, and the next ſtep over
head and ears, and can feel no bottome.</p>
               <p>It is true, by faith we may go down into this
great deep, and ſee the wonders of God; by
faith a man may go upon this great depth of the
love of God, and wonder at it, and cry out, <hi>O!
the depth of the love of God!</hi> But if we go with
carnal reaſon, we ſhall be over head and ears;
and the more reaſon, the further from ſatisfaction,
and he will confound his reaſon; If a man gaze
upon the Sun to know the nature of the Sun, and
think to comprehend the Sun, the more he gazeth
upon the Sun, the more will the Sun confound the
eye, that he will not be able to comprehend the
Sun; and ſo when the dim eye of carnal reaſon
ſhall gaze upon this glorious myſterie of God, the
eye will ſoon be confounded, and we ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider for the ſilencing of carnal
reaſon, That <hi>it is not poſſible that a man ſhould go
about to ſatisfie his reaſon, but he ſhall daſh againſt
many dangerous Rocks that will ſplit him all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
Many a man of learning have thought to
comprehend this myſterie by reaſon, and ſo they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43429:137"/>
have ſplit againſt many dangerous rocks of error,
and made ſhipwrack of Faith; many have come
to reaſon againſt <hi>Rom. 9.</hi> and have wiſhed that it
had been torn out of the Book of God: O dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Rocks that men ſplit themſelves againſt,
that will have their reaſon ſatisfied in this deep
myſterie! I have known ſome (I hope gracious)
that have been miſerably ſhattered this way, that
would needs call God to account, why God let
<hi>Adam</hi> fall, and why God did not ſave all the
world, and why God ſhould take one, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and they have reaſoned thus, until they
have reaſoned themſelves out of good thoughts
of God, and out of acts of Faith and Hope; and
have reaſoned themſelves out of their duty to
God, and have been as poor creatures in the midſt
of an Ocean, and have found no ground to ſet
their foot upon.</p>
               <p>And again conſider, That <hi>the Divel will make
uſe of carnal Reaſon in this Myſterie of God, to
keep a poor ſoul in a dark and perplexed condition;</hi>
there is many a poor ſoul is kept in the dark, and
led into a labyrinth that they can finde no path;
they are kept in a fruitleſs condition many dayes
and years, an uſeleſs condition; they are kept
from their preſent work and duty, by giving way
to their carnal reaſon in this great myſterie.</p>
               <p>And conſider laſt of all, for the ſilencing of
carnal reaſon, That <hi>it is an impoſſible thing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to ſatisfie it,</hi> and therefore it is a vain attempt,
time is ſpent in vain, and thou layeſt out thy ſelf
in vain; while a ſoul ſeeks that which cannot be,
to know their Election in the firſt place, before
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43429:137"/>
they come to Chriſt, and be found believing and
obeying, and walking with God, I ſay, it is an
impoſſible thing for you to know your Election,
before you believe in Chriſt, and be a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
It is true, you are put upon it to make your
Election ſure, ay but he does not ſay, finde it out
by reaſon, have an account of it in the firſt place;
no, make it ſure by getting faith in Chriſt, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Chriſt, fetch grace and ſtrength from
Chriſt, more grace from Chriſt, adding grace to
grace, and that is the way to make your Election
ſure; that is the firſt general Rule that I ſhall lay
down for the ſilencing of this Temptation, Take
heed that you do not ſo much as deſire that your
carnal reaſon ſhould be ſatisfied in this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie;
no, you muſt reſt in the Will, in the good
pleaſure of God, or elſe you will never have reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Rule 2.</note> a ſecond Rule for the ſilencing of
Temptations concerning Election is this, <hi>When
ever you are troubled in Spirit about your own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then flee to the Covenant of Grace, flee to the
Promiſes,</hi> the free, gracious, abſolute promiſes of
the new Covenant; and do not ſay, well, here I
will ſtand, and go no further, till I make out my
Election; truly that is the way to periſh, to ſtand
there, and to go no further; no, when you are in
the dark concerning Election, and doubt of the
love of God, then immediately flee to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
run to Chriſt, run to the free grace of the
Father, run to the righteouſneſs of the Son, run to
the gracious Promiſes held forth in the word of
Reconciliation; look to that which is nigh thee,
to the Word, to the tender of grace and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43429:138"/>
look to thoſe things in which you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with God, if unbelief do not give him the
lye, and if unbelief do not make you to lye againſt
the Truth, you may agree with God in thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Grace and Mercy which are before you;
and therefore flee to them, look to the Scripture,
the Word of God holds forth gracious tenders
and invitations for the relief of poor ſouls; <hi>Iſa.
45. 22. Look to me all ye ends of the earth, and be
ſaved, for I am God, and there is none beſides me:</hi>
There is a gracious word to flee unto, when you
are doubting concerning Election; and ſo, <hi>Let
the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous
man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. and ſo,
<hi>The Son of man came to ſeek and to ſave that which
was loſt,</hi> Matth. 18. 11. Another gracious word,
and <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary, and heavie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and I will give you reſt,</hi> Matth. 11. 18. and
<hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son; that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not
periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3. 16. and ſo
in <hi>John 6. 37. All that the Father giveth me, ſhall
come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in
no wiſe caſt out:</hi> Here is another gracious word for
poor ſouls to flee unto. And ſo again in <hi>1 Tim.
1. 15. This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all
acceptation, That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world
to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> O! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gracious tenders and invitations are there in
the Word of God for poor ſouls to flee unto?
And O that God would teach his people who are
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43429:138"/>
tempted about their Election, and cannot make
out their Election, preſently to flee to ſome free
promiſe of the Lord held forth that is before you;
and in that you and God may agree, if unbelief
hinder not.</p>
               <p>There have been ſome Parliaments in <hi>England</hi>
in which many good things have been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the welfare of the people; but all the
Members have not been ſatisfied in ſome things
propounded; Now had they laid aſide thoſe
things in which all were not ſatisfied, and fallen
upon thoſe things in which all might have agreed,
a good work might have been carried on by them,
and in due time all might have been ſatisfied, but
ſtanding upon thoſe things concerning which all
were not ſatisfied, it broke all to pieces; and ſo
I may ſay of this buſineſs of Election; it may be
the Lord he is ſatisfied concerning thy Election,
it is clear to him, <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them
that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. But thou art not ſatisfied,
&amp; thou reſolveſt to meddle with nothing till God
ſatisfie thee concerning thy Election; why that's
the way to break all to pieces: Look to that in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
thou mayeſt agree with God, the word of grace
that is before thee, thoſe Promiſes in which God
and thy ſoul may meet, O fall upon them, and
cloſe with God in them, and afterwards in God's
due time he will clear up thy Election, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thee that thou art one that he hath loved and
choſen. Only remember that is the ſecond Rule,
when we are ſtumbled about Election, Run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the free Grace of God in Chriſt, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43429:139"/>
to the gracious promiſes held forth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>A third Rule for the ſilencing of theſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Rule 3.</note>
when-ever thou art in the dark concerning
Election, puſled either about the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
or thine own Election in particular, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to juſtifie God, to clear the Lord however it be,
and ſay he is righteous:</hi> Lay that down for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
concluſion, Lord, thou art righteous, and
thou haſt no iniquity in thee, and canſt do no
wrong, whether I underſtand thy way or not; the
Apoſtle in <hi>Rom. 9. 13.</hi> ſpeaketh of God's taking
one, and leaving another; <hi>As it is written, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
have I loved, but Eſau have I hated:</hi> and at
<hi>verſ. 14. What ſhall we ſay then? Is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
with God? God forbid.</hi> Is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
with God? It ſeems ſo, that God
ſhould deal thus unequally with perſons that are
equal, that are in the ſame condition, Is this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?
That God ſhould take one, and leave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
when both in the ſame condition, is not
this unrighteouſneſs? It ſeems ſo, but it is not ſo,
God forbid, ſaith he, that we ſhould have the
leaſt thought that God ſhould be unrighteous;
no, that cannot be; for God to take one, and leave
another, it is no injuſtice; and it is no act of
God's Juſtice to take and leave, but an act of his
Soveraignty: For a Prince to pardon one Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
and leave another to the righteous cenſure
of the Law, there is no injuſtice in it: for a man,
when two perſons ſtand before him, and both in
the ſame condition, to make one his boſome friend
and nor another, it's no injuſtice; this is the caſe
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43429:139"/>
with God; God will chuſe boſome friends, chuſe
one, and not another, it is the act of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and no injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Indeed if God ſhould condemn the innocent,
there would be ſome colour to charge God with
unrighteouſneſs; if God ſhould condemn a man
or woman meerly becauſe they are not elected, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that man or woman ſhould believe and
repent, there were unfaithfulneſs in God; but
God never did ſo, God never condemned the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
he never condemned the ſoul that return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him by Chriſt, therefore God cannot be
charged with unfaithfulneſs: Therefore let us
reſolve upon it, God is righteous: Juſtifie God,
though thou art in the dark, and perplexed and
troubled in Spirit about thine own Election, or the
Election of friends, yet do thou reſolve and ſay,
I wil juſtifie God, though God hath not choſen me,
and my children, &amp; though God hath not choſen
my friends, yet no unrighteouſneſs in him. Truly
this is the way to overcome the Temptation; and
till a ſoul be brought to this, a ſoul that is troubled
about his Election, will never finde reſt, till he
come to juſtifie God, and lye at the feet of the
Lord, and ſay, Lord, though thou condemneſt me,
and all my children and friends, thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
till we juſtifie God, we ſhall have no peace
in our ſelves: What a reſtleſs condition was <hi>Job</hi>
in when he ſtood quarrelling with God's Decree?
He never had peace till he came to Juſtifie God,
<hi>Job 42. 2. I know that thou canſt do every thing, I
will contend no more:</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> came thus to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God, then <hi>Job's</hi> Temptation vaniſhed, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43429:140"/>
then the Lord turned unto <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Turned again
his Captivity,</hi> and doubled the mercies he had
taken away. That's the third Rule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Rule 4.</note> For the Overcoming and Silencing of
theſe Temptations about Election; Remember
this, that when-ever we are tempted about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that <hi>we preſently fall to worſhip the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi>
ſo it was with this woman in the Text, when
ſhe met with this Temptation about Election;
Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the
Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> What follows? <hi>She came and
worſhipped him:</hi> She ſpake not a word of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
but falls down, and worſhipped him. This
is the way to overcome the Temptation, when you
are doubting concerining the love of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
about Election, preſently fall to worſhip
the Lord, worſhip him. Worſhip him, How?</p>
               <p>Worſhip him,<note place="margin">How to worſhip God.</note> Firſt, With the <hi>Inward Worſhip
of the Spirit.</hi> Fear before him, that is part of his
Worſhip: Reverence the Lord greatly in your
hearts notwithſtanding all, that's part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Love the Lord, let your ſouls be breathing
in love towards him, cleave unto him, purſue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him with your Spirit, that is part of the Inward
worſhip; Commit your ſouls unto him, truſt in
him, caſt your ſelves upon the Lord, and the word
of his grace, that is the Inward Worſhip; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your dependance upon him, reſolve
there to hang; ſay, Lord, my whole dependance
is upon thee, my bleſſedneſs is in thy hand, all
that I expect for eternity doth depend upon thee;
Go, and cleave, and claſp about the feet of Chriſt,
and by faith depend upon Chriſt, and ſay, Lord,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43429:140"/>
here I will hold and ſtay, and will not away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I be pulled away by violence from the feet
of Chriſt. This is Internal Worſhip, and this is
that worſhip that gives ſo much glory to God.
<hi>Abraham believed above hope, and againſt hope, and
gave glory to God.</hi> When you are tempted about
Election, thus worſhip him.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, Worſhip him with <hi>External
Worſhip;</hi> There are two principal parts of this
Worſhip that will tend to the ſilencing of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
about Election.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
The ſecond is <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you are tempted about Election, or
doubt of the love of God, fall to prayer; go and
pour out a cry before the Lord, go and lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him; and ſay, though I do not know whether
thou wilt accept of me, O Lord, yet I will cry
after thee, I will lament after thee; cry after
himſelf, his preſence, his face, his favour, his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindneſs, go and cry after him; this is the
way to be rid of the temptation: And truly, this
will be a diſcovery that God hath Elected thee:
In <hi>Luke 18.</hi> you have Chriſt ſpeaking there of the
unrighteous Judge, who neither feared God or
man, but at <hi>verſ. 7.</hi> you have him ſpeaking of the
righteous Judge, and ſaith he, <hi>Shall not God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
his own Elect, which cry day and night unto
him?</hi> This is a good diſcovery that God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
that ſoul, though the ſoul knows it not, when
as it is crying after the Lord, and reſolves to cry,
and not give over; <hi>They are his Elect that cry
day and night,</hi> and he will certainly hear their cry;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:43429:141"/>
God will come in and manifeſt himſelf to the ſoul,
and therefore when tempted about Election, go
to Prayer.</p>
               <p>Another part of <hi>External Worſhip</hi> is <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;</hi>
an excellent Remedy againſt this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
about Election: O! deſire that thy heart
may be put into a thankful frame, look up to God
for it, and plead with the Lord, that thy heart may
be put into a thankful poſture; Conſider what
thou haſt to be thankful for: Is there nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
O certainly, if thou art not exceeding ungrateful,
thou mayſt ſee ſomthing to be thankful for in the
worſt condition; O! the years of patience and
goodneſs of the Lord toward thee, think upon the
bounty of the Lord toward thee; Hath not the
Lord tendred his Chriſt to thee? And hath he
not held forth his promiſes to thee? Hath he not
been working upon thy heart, to overcome thy
heart? Is not this worthy of Thankfulneſs? Thoſe
ſupports that thou haſt met withall under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have not everlaſting Arms been under thee?
Surely thou muſt ſay it, that everlaſting Armes
have been under me, and why doſt thou not bleſs
the Lord that he hath put underneath everlaſting
Arms? Yea, hath there not been ſome ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations
of love, though thou haſt not received
ſo much as another? Yet, hath there not been
ſome ſecret hints of grace and love? O! that is
worthy of thankfulneſs. Yea, look to all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſalvations that thou haſt met withall; look
to all the years of goodneſs, and all the years of
mercy; Hath not God come to thee, and to thy
Family, with many ſweet refreſhments? What?
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43429:141"/>
None of theſe worthy of Thankfulneſs? O that
thou wouldeſt learn to creep, if thou canſt not go!
and every night when thou lookeſt back, O ſay,
here is another day of goodneſs; the Lord might
have cut me off, here is another day of patience;
and in the morning when thou wakeſt, think of it,
the Lord might have cut me off this night; Here
is another night of patience; and ſee if this cannot
draw forth thy ſoul in thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>I have heard of a young man very lately in the
Town of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> that being very weak, and
nigh to the grave, and under the apprehenſions of
the wrath of God, and ſuppoſing that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
going down to the pit, he cries out, <hi>O that
God would ſpare me but two dayes!</hi> He would have
accounted it a mercy to be kept out of hell but
two dayes: O! God hath given thee more then
two dayes, many moneths, many years, in which
the Lord hath exerciſed his patience; O! may
not all this provoke thee to thankfulneſs? Well,
if thou canſt not ſee any thing to be thankful for,
of that which God hath done for thee, why then
bleſs God for what is in himſelf; O! Think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the gracious Nature of God, think upon the
glorious Majeſty of God, think upon all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, are they not worthy of praiſe?
His name it is glorious, and worthy to be exalted,
bleſs God for what is in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Or Bleſs God for what he hath done for others,
if not for what God hath done for thee; ſee if
thou canſt not get up thy heart to bleſs God for
what God hath done for others; and look upon
the grace that God hath beſtowed upon others;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43429:142"/>
and ſay, though I can ſee little in my ſelf for which
I ſhould bleſs God, yet bleſſed be God that God
hath given out of his Spirit to others, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
his love to others, and hath made others
fruitful and ſerviceable, and that there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to lift up the name of Chriſt in the world; and
if by any means the Lord will put thy heart into
a thankful frame, the temptation will ſoon vaniſh.
Endeavour it all thou canſt, wait upon God, and
look upon that which is matter of Thankfulneſs,
that thy heart may be put into a thankful poſture
to bleſs God for ſomthing beſtowed on thee, or
ſomthing in himſelf, or others, and the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will ſoon vaniſh.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Rule 5.</note> When thou art tempted about Election,
<hi>Reſolve ſtill to hold on in God's way;</hi> though thou
art in the dark, and perplexed in thy ſpirit for want
of the knowledge of God's love, yet reſolve in
the ſtrength of the Lord to hold on the Lord's
way, to keep in his way, and to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
take heed of turning out into crooked
wayes, deſire to keep the way of the Lord, which
is a ſtreight way; Say, well, though I do not know
my Election, I do not know whether I ſhall come
into heaven, yet by the Lord's ſtrength I will be
found looking toward Chriſt, I will be found
looking to him, <hi>who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt;</hi>
This is to keep the Lord's way.</p>
               <p>And ſo alſo, <hi>Reſolve to be found walking in wayes
of Holineſs;</hi> though I do not know that I ſhall
be ſaved; ſaved, or not ſaved, I will reſolve to
walk in wayes of holineſs, and to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
take heed of every ſinful way, every crooked
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43429:142"/>
way. The Apoſtle in <hi>2 Tim. 2. 19.</hi> ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Election, <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtandeth
ſure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth them that
are his:</hi> Why then ſaith he, <hi>Let every one that
nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi>
And ſo I ſay, though Election be not ſure to thee,
be ſure to depart from iniquity, reſolve to walk
with God in his way; <hi>All this is come upon us, yet
have not we forgotten thee,</hi> Pſal. 44. 17. and ſo
do thou ſay, though all this darkneſs be upon my
ſpirit, I reſolve in the ſtrength of the Lord not to
forſake him; though I do not know that the Lord
will be for me, I reſolve to be for none elſe, my
ſoul ſhall be for no other Saviour, and I will not
be for any other way but the way of holineſs, I
deſire to depart from every way of iniquity: And
as I ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, if God ſhall bring
up the heart to this, Surely the Lord will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſuffer that ſoul to go on doubting, but he
will come and manifeſt his eternal love; if the
ſoul ſhall reſolve thus in the ſtrength of the Lord,
to be found in the Lord's way, ſaved or not ſaved,
I will be looking to the Father through the Son,
and walk in every way of the Lord, and depart
from iniquity, the Lord will not alwayes ſuffer
that ſoul to go on doubting, <hi>John 14. 21. He that
hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is
that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of my Father, and I will love him, and will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
my ſelf to him.</hi> My <hi>Father ſhall love him;</hi>
that is, my Father ſhall manifeſt love to him; not
that God begins then to love, but my Father will
come to that ſoul, though that ſoul may walk in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43429:143"/>
darkneſs, though that ſoul may for the preſent be
in a ſad condition, and not ſee the face of God,
and not know that God hath loved him from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
yet my Father will manifeſt love to him,
my Father will manifeſt that he doth love that
ſoul: and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will love him, and manifeſt
my ſelf to him:</hi> Chriſt will come to that ſoul, and
ſay to it, I ſee that thou loveſt me, and I know
thou loveſt me, thou haſt walked in the dark night,
yet thou haſt not turned out from me, thou haſt
reſolved to cleave to me as to thy Saviour, and
haſt reſolved to keep my way, and to depart from
iniquity, and now I ſee that thou loveſt me, and
I will let thee know that I love thee, that is, that
I love thee firſt, that I have loved thee from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.
And thus you have the five general Rules
to ſilence all Temptations which may ariſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Election.</p>

words of the Apoſtle, <hi>2 Pet. 1. 10. Wherefore the
rather Brethren give diligence to make your Calling

give all diligence to make your Election ſure, reſt
not till your hearts be eſtabliſhed through grace
in the knowledge of God's love. For</p>
               <p>Let me tell you firſt,<note place="margin">It's of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to make our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure.</note> That <hi>it is a matter of great
concernment.</hi> That which this Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
us to, to give all diligence to make our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſure, it is that which doth concern your
whole ſtate; you had need give diligence to make
it ſure, it doth not concern your temporal eſtate,
but it concerns your eſtate in another world, all
that you have to live upon in another world doth
depend upon it, you had need give diligence to
make that ſure: What pains do men take to make
that ſure that concerns their outward Eſtates?
Men will make their Bonds and Bills ſure, their
Evidences ſure, their Titles to Lands and Houſes
ſure; if there be any thing amiſs in them, what
pains will men take to make them ſure? O that
God would help us to give diligence in this great
buſineſs that doth concern another manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
then that which you poſſeſs here! even all
that you have to live upon in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſeeks to hinder ſouls in making their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure.</note> Let me ſay to you to ſtir you up to
be diligent in making your Calling and Election
ſure; why, <hi>You have an Adverſary that taketh a
great deal of pains, uſeth diligence to hinder you in
this work;</hi> the Divels great deſigne is to keep
you in the dark, to keep you in a puzled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43429:144"/>
condition, to finde ſome flaw or other in
your evidences, to caſt ſome blot upon them, that
you ſhall not be able to read them; doubtleſs
you will put God to it to leave you to be tryed in
this at one time or other; God for the moſt part
leaves his people to be tempted concerning their
Election, and therefore you had need give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth depend upon the making E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure.</note> Let me ſay, That <hi>your comfort doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

in this world doth depend upon it, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of every condition doth depend upon it, the
ſweetneſs of every mercy depends upon it. Alas,
if a man had a thouſand times more then he hath,
what is all he hath without the love of God?
Your comfort depends upon it; Although your
names be written in heaven, yet you cannot have
the comfort of it, till it be made ſure to you;
though it be ſure before God, yet you cannot be
comforted, but you are as if there were no thoughts
of love in the heart of God toward you. Your
comfort depends upon it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure.</note> Your <hi>Holineſs doth depend upon it, your
uſefulneſs, your fruitfulneſs, your ſerviceableneſs in
your generations doth depend upon your knowledge of
the love of God;</hi> it is that which wil make a Chriſtian
uſeful &amp; ſerviceable, when as his Election is made
ſure, when he comes to be eſtabliſhed in the
knowledge of God's Election; <hi>Put on therefore
(as the Elect of God, holy, and beloved) bowels of
mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of minde, meekneſs,

               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:43429:145"/>
And truly, till that be put out of queſtion to a
ſoul, til the Lord gives ſome degrees of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a ſoul concerning his love, the ſoul is wholly
taken up, alwayes taken up about that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it ſelf: O Lord! Doſt thou love me? That's
the great queſtion: And when it goes to God in
prayer, Lord! Doſt thou love me? And O that
thou wouldeſt make out thy love to me! The ſoul
is wholly taken up about that, and well it may;
but when God comes to give ſome ſatisfaction,
O then the ſoul hath a great deal of freedome to
minde the things of Chriſt, to put up many a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for others, and many a requeſt for Chriſt
and his Kingdom, and the Intereſt of Chriſt, then
his thoughts they run that way; ſo that if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be uſeful and ſerviceable in your generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it doth engage you to look after this, to give
all diligence to make your Election ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, How ſhall we do that?
O there is nothing in the world that I would ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
do then that, but I know not how to make my
Election ſure.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, It is the work of God, it is the work
of grace to make it out to you; it is the work of
free grace to give a ſoul aſſurance of that free and
everlaſting love. But be found waiting upon God
in this way.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">How to make our Election ſure.</note> Look up to the Lord to clear up unto
you the myſterie of the Goſpel; if you deſire to
make your Election, look up to the Lord, to clear
up to your ſouls the great myſterie of Chriſt, that
thou mayeſt know the Lord Jeſus as he was the
gift of the Father, the gift of love, the gift of free
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43429:145"/>
grace; O that the Lord would clear up to thee
the great end of his giving that gift of Chriſt!
Wherefore was it that God ſent his Son out of his
boſome? Wherefore was it that he gave Chriſt?
And wherefore was it that Chriſt gave himſelf to
die? What was the end of the Father's ſending
Chriſt, and the end of the laying down his life? It
was to ſave loſt ſinners; <hi>God ſo loved the World,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever
believes in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life,</hi> John 3. 16. O! Look up to God, to clear
up this great Goſpel myſterie to you, the deſigne
of God the Father, in ſending Chriſt; and the
great deſigne of the Son, in laying down his life:
It is through ignorance of this Myſterie, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a poor ſoul is kept from eſtabliſhment, and from
aſſurance of God's electing love.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Wait upon the Lord to draw thy
ſoul to accept of Chriſt; it is not enough to have
a diſcovery of the myſterie, this will not ſave thee,
though a man know the deſigne of God, and know
the end of it, that will not ſave thee; no, but
wait upon the Lord to draw thy heart to reſt upon
Jeſus Chriſt, as he is held forth in the Goſpel; ſee
that there is a neceſſity that God the Father
ſhould draw thee; <hi>No man comes to me</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt) <hi>except the Father which hath ſent me draw
him,</hi> John 6. 44. till he be drawn by the Father,
he cannot come to Chriſt, therefore that man is
miſtaken that thinks it is an eaſie matter for him
to come to Chriſt. O! Many a man doth miſtake
faith of their own working, for that faith which is
of the operation of God. When God hath beaten
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43429:146"/>
many a ſoul out of his Breſt-works, and the ſoul
ſees he can no longer defend himſelf there, good
works will not do it; then he taketh up a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his own ſtrength; well, I willgo to Chriſt,
I will believe in Chriſt, if I cannot have it by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
I will have it by believing: Ah! But he
never ſaw that there was an impoſſibility for him
to believe, but he goes to Chriſt in his own
ſtrength, and the faith is of his own working, and
it is ſuch a faith as Chriſt will not own; no, when
God deals with a ſoul in a ſaving way, he diſcovers
to it that it is no more able to believe in Chriſt,
then it can obey the whole Law, and that there
is a neceſſity that he ſhould be drawn of God; and
in his ſpirit he breaths after God, and ſaith, Lord,
draw me, for if thou doſt not draw me, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to Chriſt; ſee a neceſſity of being drawn
to Chriſt; And when thou art drawn, give up thy
ſelf to thoſe breathings and workings of the Spirit
of God; after thou haſt ſeen thy ſelf in a loſt
condition, and no poſſibility to help thy ſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by thy works, or by believing; why then if
the Lord open the word of Reconciliation to thee,
and is breathing ſweetly upon thy heart, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
upon thy ſpirit, while thou heareſt the word
of grace opened, and the tender of Chriſt urged,
O then give up thy ſelf to thoſe drawings of the
Spirit of Chriſt, and do not hinder thoſe drawings
by thy unbelief, but give up thy ſelf to the Lord,
and ſay, Lord, I ſee thy hand onely is able and
powerful to draw ſouls to thy ſelf, and I will ſtand
out no longer. That's the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:43429:146"/>
Thirdly, Be diligent to make the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Jeſus Chriſt; when God hath diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the myſterie of Chriſt to thee, and in ſome
meaſure hath drawn thy heart, and made thee to
lye at the feet of Chriſt for life and ſalvation, and
for faith to believe in him; be diligent to make
the beſt improvement of Chriſt. Improve Chriſt
for holineſs and ſanctification, if thou deſireſt to
have Election made out to thee, improve Chriſt
for holineſs. The Apoſtle <hi>2 Pet. 1. 5.</hi> exhorteth
them to this, <hi>Giving all diligence, adde to your faith
vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge
temperance, and to temperance patience, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
godlineſs;</hi> and ſo he goes on, and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
at <hi>verſ. 10. Give all diligence to make your
calling and election ſure; for if you do theſe things,
you ſhall never fall.</hi> In this way give diligence to
make your Election ſure, improve Chriſt for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
for grace, for ſtrength, for more ſtrength;
be diligent in waiting upon the Lord for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the work of holineſs; let Chriſtians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be continually in the exerciſe of grace,
and in the performance of every duty that the
Lord calls them to; adde grace to grace, and
wait upon Chriſt, that one degree of grace may
be added to another; knowledge to knowledge,
faith to faith, temperance to temperance; truly
it is in this way that God comes in with diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of electing love; I do not ſay it is for your
diligence, and for your improvement of Chriſt,
and adding grace to grace; but this is the way:
when the Lord doth enable his people to be thus
faithful and diligent in the improvement of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43429:147"/>
Chriſt, and in the exerciſe of grace, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of duty to God and man, God comes in
that way, and giveth a ſoul a more clear diſcovery
of his electing love.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Deſire the Lord to ſet a heavenly
Byaſs upon your ſpirits, if you deſire to have your
Election cleared and made ſure; take heed of an
earthly heart; and O! Look up to God earneſtly,
that he would ſet a heavenly Byaſs upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that you may be able to ſay, <hi>Our converſation
is in heaven,</hi> our heart is there, <hi>from whence we
look for a Saviour; we groan to be clothed upon with
our houſe which is from heaven.</hi> Truly Brethren,
if we look too much downward, if we be grubling
below, and be writing upon the duſt, we ſhall
hardly ſee what is written in heaven: Though
your names may be written in heaven. O! the
looking too much upon this world, keepeth many
a Chriſtian from ſeeing his name written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
What pains will Aſtrologers and Star-gazers
(as the Scripture calls them) take to ſee into the
ſecond heaven, the ſtarry heaven? How often will
they look up? And how long will they look up
to ſee (as they pretend) what is written there,
what is the language of the Stars! And O! What
a ſhame is it to Chriſtians that we ſhould look up
no oftner, and no longer into the third heaven,
that we may ſee our names written there? Truly
Brethren, it is no eaſie matter for a Chriſtian to
ſee his name written in heaven, though his name
may be written there; we ſhall hardly ſee it, if
our hearts be not much there, and our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
much there; we uſe to ſay, if children look
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43429:147"/>
off their Books, they will never learn their Leſſons
well; Truly, if we look ſo much on the world, and
ſo little into heaven, we ſhall hardly learn to read
our names written in heaven. But when as the
Lord ſees that his people are deſirous to have
their thoughts in heaven, and their converſations
in heaven, the Lord will come and ſay to that ſoul,
well, I ſee that thine eye is in heaven, and thy
heart in heaven, know for thy comfort, that thy
name alſo is in heaven, thy God is in heaven, thy
Chriſt is in heaven, and thy portion is in heaven.
O! Beg of God that he would clap a heavenly
byaſs upon your ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take heed of ſinning againſt the Lord,
take heed of giving way to any ſin; as you deſire
to have your election cleared up to you, take heed
of turning out into any crooked way. Let not
Chriſtians give way to themſelves, nor allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in any way of evil. You know what
the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>2 Tim. 2. 19. Nevertheleſs, the
foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal,
the Lord knoweth them that are his: And let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart
from iniquity.</hi> The Lord knoweth them that are
his; Ah! but would you know your ſelves to be
in that number? Take heed that you do not give
way to any ſin, do not allow your ſelves in any way
of ſin, be not found in any way of iniquity; every
ſin that is allowed, it will caſt a blot upon your
Evidence, and you ſhall not be able to read it.
This is the firſt Uſe unto thoſe that have not
God's electing love cleared up to them; there is
a neceſſity that every ſoul ſhould give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43429:148"/>
to have their Election made ſure, it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of infinite concernment, and you have been
taught in what way to wait upon God to make
your Election ſure.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is to thoſe that have attained
to the knowledge of God's electing love: And
it calls upon them,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be <hi>Thankful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To labour to walk worthy of ſo great
a mercy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To be <hi>Thankful.</hi> O conſider that it is
the free love and the free grace of God that did
make the difference between you and others, Is
there not cauſe then of Thankfulneſs? You were
no better then the worſt in the world, no better
then thoſe that are caſt out of God's ſight into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
darkneſs; there is as much evil in our hearts
as in <hi>Judas</hi> his heart that betrayed Chriſt. O! It
is free grace that hath put a difference; if God
hath made known to you that he hath choſen you,
know that it is free grace that hath put the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
O! Rich grace, free grace, that God
ſhould take you, and leave another as deſerving
as you; O it is free grace!</p>
               <p>And that we may be ſtirred up to Thankfulneſs,
conſider that all the mercies that ever you do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
or hope for, ſpring from this Electing love!
O! What cauſe have you to admire this love? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
love it was a fruitful wombe, all your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
lay in it, your comforts they all ſpring from
it; if the Lord had not given you his love from
eternity, he had never given you Chriſt as he did,
he had not given you the knowledg of Chriſt. All
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:43429:148"/>
the mercies and comforts that you do enjoy, do
ſpring from this love; if it had not been for this
love, you had never known what pardon of ſin had
been, you had never known what peace with God
had been, what a mercy it is to be reconciled to
God; your preſent mercies they all lye in this
womb of God's Electing love; O! what an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
is this to Thankfulneſs?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Walk worthy of this love; Chriſtians
you that ſee your Intereſt in Electing love, walk
worthy of it, improve this your mercy, that great
mercy, the knowledge which God hath given you
of his love in Chriſt, improve it, let it be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
upon you to duty.</p>
               <p>To what duty doth this Love of God
engage unto.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">What Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>electing love</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> Let this love of God to you engage you
to a <hi>holy confidence,</hi> to a holy truſt in the Lord, and
a ſtedfaſt relyance upon Chriſt and his grace in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſtate and condition; the Lord would have
you make this improvement, his love is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for this end, that your faith may be ſtrengthned,
and your hope ſtrengthned, and made more firm
and lively; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of
God's Elect, it is God that juſtifieth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 8. 33.</hi>
Thus doth the Apoſtle improve it, <hi>If God be for
us, who ſhall be againſt us? I am perſwaded, that
neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
ſhal be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which
is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. Nay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in all
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43429:149"/>
theſe things we are more then Conquerours.</hi> Chriſt
would have his people improve this love, for the
caſting out of fear, perfect love caſteth out fear,
it is caſting out fear, though it hath not caſt out
fear; <hi>Fear not little flock, it is your Fathers good
pleaſure to give you a Kingdom;</hi> he would ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
them againſt fear by ſetting before them the
Father's Electing love; it is the Fathers good
pleaſure to give you a Kingdome. O that we
might improve this for the ſtrengthening of our
confidence!</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Lord hath diſcovered his love,
know, that it is an engagement, as to Confidence,
ſo to <hi>Holineſs;</hi> a holy and unblameable walking
before God. The adverſaries of this Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that this is a Doctrine of Liberty: Ah! but
there is no ſuch tendency; <hi>Put on, as the Elect of
God, bowels of mercy.</hi> If you be the Elect of God,
put on bowels of mercy, and ſo be you like to
Chriſt; I ſay, know that this is the end of God's
Electing love: God hath choſen you, wherefore
hath he choſen you? <hi>Eph. 1. 4. According as
he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the
world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in love:</hi> This is the great end of God's
love, and the diſcovery of it, that you may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
O! Know that if God hath loved you, you
ſhould be holy.</p>
               <p>Thridly, Know that you are engaged to <hi>walk
humbly.</hi> Who put the difference? What was it
that made the difference? This Doctrine of free
Electing love hath taught you, that it is grace that
hath made the difference, not your free will and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43429:149"/>
improvement, but it is free grace that made the
difference: The Lord ſaw us ſo far from impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that which he gave us, as any other; and
therefore this may ſilence all fleſh before the
Lord, let not fleſh glory; Why? what haſt thou
to glory in? If thou be better then others, whence
was it? It was from free love, and therefore it
engageth thee to walk humbly with thy God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is an engagement to <hi>Love.</hi> O!
love the Lord dearly; if the Lord hath made out
his Electing love, you are engaged to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
ſhew forth much love, love to Chriſt, and
love to the Image of Chriſt, love to the way of
Chriſt, love to the Truth of Chriſt, love to the
Ordinances of Chriſt, love to the Saints of Chriſt,
<hi>As I have loved you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſo ought you to
love one another,</hi> John 13. 34. <hi>As I have loved
you;</hi> as much as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, this is the
greateſt argument that I can propound to you to
move you to love one another, <hi>I have loved you:</hi>
If the Lord have loved you with this electing love,
and hath diſcovered that his love to you, you are
engaged to love him, and his people, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath the Image of God and of Chriſt upon it.
And ſo I have done this point, this great myſterie,
this Doctrine of Election.</p>
               <p>I deſire not to read this Verſe again; there
is one thing more which I ſhall but touch, and ſo
conclude.</p>
               <p>I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe
of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:43429:150"/>
The Houſe of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>What is <hi>the Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Why, the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe name was
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> the twelve Tribes they are the Houſe of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were the peculiar people that God
choſe out of all the Nations; he left other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and he choſe them for his peculiar people,
he choſe them to be his Houſe, when he took them
into Covenant with himſelf, and they took hold
of his Covenant, they became a Church of Chriſt,
and this Church of Chriſt is the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael is God's Houſe:</hi> That's the Point that I
ſhall but touch, and ſo ſhut up all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every true Church of Chriſt is the Houſe of God.</hi>
They are a Houſe, and they are the Houſe of God.
What was ſpoken of that Church, may be ſaid of
every true Goſpel Church; they are a Houſe, and
God's houſe, they are God's Houſhold, they are
called the <hi>Houſhold of Faith, Gal. 6. 10.</hi> And ſo
again in <hi>Epheſ. 2. 19. Now therefore, ye are no
more Strangers, and Forreigners, but Fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God;</hi>
And this is propheſied of by the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi>
chap. 4. verſ. 2. <hi>And many Nations ſhall come
and ſay, Come, Let us go up to the Mountain of the
Lord, and to the Houſe of the God of Jacob;</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Goſpel-times; the Churches of the Lord
are called the <hi>Houſe of God. Chriſt as a Son
over his own Houſe, whoſe Houſe we are,</hi> &amp;c.
Heb. 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Now in a houſe there is a <hi>Maſter of the Family;</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:43429:150"/>
why the Maſter of this Houſhold is Chriſt; every
houſhold hath a Head, a Maſter, the Lord of the
Family; Chriſt is the Maſter of this Family, he
is the Lord, the Head of the Church: <hi>If they call
the Maſter of the houſe Beelzebub,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>how
much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold,</hi>
Matth. 10. 25. Chriſt is the Head, and the Lord,
and he is the Maſter of his Houſe, of his Church,
the Maſter of the great Family.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Members of this houſe they are
fellow Brethren, fellow Servants, ſometimes they
are called Children: Members of a Family, they
are either Children, Servants, or Friends that
dwell in the Family; The Lord calleth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
his children, his ſervants, ſomtimes his friends,
ſtill he owns them, the members of his houſe, are
fellow brethren, and fellow ſervants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In a great Houſhold you have Officers
and Stewards; Great Families they have their
Stewards, they are under their Lord to overſee
the houſe, and to look to the wayes of the houſe,
and to make proviſion for the houſe, and to give
them their meat in due ſeaſon: In this Houſe of
Chriſt, and in every Goſpel Church, Chriſt hath
appointed his Stewards, <hi>1 Cor. 4. 1. Let a man
ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and
Stewards of the Myſteries of God:</hi> Chriſt hath
appointed Officers, as his Stewards, to diſpenſe his
good things to his Servants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In a Houſe you have the Lawes and
Cuſtomes of the Houſe; In Chriſt's Houſe there
are Lawes and Cuſtomes, he hath left it on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
the Lawes of his Houſe are written, how he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43429:151"/>
will have his Houſe governed; all the Lawes of
his Houſe are written in his Word; it is not left
to men to make Lawes for Chriſt's Houſe, (No)
but Chriſt himſelf as Head and Lord of his Church
he hath made Lawes for the Government of his
Houſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, In a houſe or houſhold, there is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for them in the houſe; ſo Chriſt in his houſe
hath employment for all the members of his
Houſe, ſome work that he hath appointed for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
childe and ſervant in his Houſe, for every one
that is a Member of any viſible Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
which is the Houſe of Chriſt, there is
work that is common to all that are in the Houſe,
<hi>Pſal. 134. Bleſs ye the Lord, all ye ſervants of the
Lord, which by night ſtand in the Houſe of the
Lord:</hi> And again in <hi>Pſal. 135. 1, 2. Praiſe ye
the Lord, praiſe ye the Name of the Lord, praiſe
him O ye ſervants of the Lord, ye that ſtand in the
Houſe of the Lord, in the Courts of the Houſe of
our God.</hi> The duty lay upon all in the Houſe of
God, <hi>to bleſs the Name of Chriſt;</hi> and there are
ſome particular works that Chriſt cuts out for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
member: Chriſt would have none in his houſe
idle, there is ſome work that every one may do,
that may be for the good of the whole houſe.</p>
               <p>And as this Houſe hath his <hi>Work,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the houſe of Chriſt.</note> ſo this houſe
hath its <hi>Priviledges.</hi> O! there are ſpecial Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
the Lord he is engaged to <hi>teach</hi> all in
his houſe; it lies upon the Maſter of the houſe to
teach thoſe that are in his Family; why the Lord
Jeſus the Head of the Family hath engaged to
teach all that are in the Family, <hi>Iſa. 54. 13. And
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43429:151"/>
all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord:</hi> Sions
children, they that are of the houſhold of God,
God doth engage for it that they ſhall all be
taught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this is another Priviledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Priv. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That as the Lord
will teach them, ſo he will</hi> defend and protect them,
<hi>He hath promiſed ſpecial protection to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in his Houſe,</hi> Iſa. 4. 5. And the Lord will
create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and
upon her Aſſemblies, a Cloud, and ſmoak by day, and
the ſhining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all
the glory ſhall be a defence: <hi>The particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt under the Goſpel, upon all their
glory ſhall be a defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is another Priviledge,<note place="margin">Priv. 3.</note> That <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Houſe will do the ſervants work:</hi> You
know what the Church ſaith, <hi>Iſa. 26. 12. Lord,
thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou alſo haſt
wrought all our works in us:</hi> What-ever he calls
for from any of his people in his houſe, he wil do
it himſelf, he will ſtrengthen them to do it, his
own Arm ſhall be at work. This is a choice privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that belongs to the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>Another priviledge is,<note place="margin">Priv. 4.</note> That <hi>they ſhall eat of the
beſt, and drink of the beſt; they ſhall have a feaſt of
fat things, and Wine on thee Lees well refined:</hi> He
will make ſuch a Feaſt in the day of the Goſpel,
upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, upon
every houſe of the Lord; the Lord engageth to
make them a Feaſt of Fat things, his own fleſh
ſhall be ſet before them, which is meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
and his blood, which is drink indeed.</p>
               <p>Another priviledge is this,<note place="margin">Priv. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſervants ſhall
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43429:152"/>
ſit down with the Lord and Maſter at Table:</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have ſeldome ſuch a priviledge in any houſe,
to ſit down with their maſter; but in Chriſt's
houſe all the ſervants ſhall ſit down at Table with
their Lord. O! What a choice priviledge is this,
to ſit at their Lord's Table?</p>
               <p>Nay,<note place="margin">Priv. 6.</note> while they ſit at Table, <hi>their Lord will
ſerve them.</hi> Such a priviledge the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to his people, <hi>Luke 12. 37. He ſhall gird
himſelf, and make them ſit down to meat, and will
come forth and ſerve them.</hi> He will cut out their
portion for them; he will ſee to it, that they
want nothing that he ſeeth good for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> he will bleſs their proviſion to them;<note place="margin">Priv. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>that is
another priviledge,</hi> Pſal. 132. 13, 14, 15. For
the Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his
habitation; this is my reſt for ever, here will I
dwell. I will abundantly bleſs her proviſion: I will
ſatisfie her poor with bread. <hi>See the Lord will
bleſs Zions proviſion, and make his people fat and
flouriſhing, for ſo is the Promiſe,</hi> Pſal. 92. 13,
14. Thoſe that be planted in the Houſe of the Lord,
ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, they ſhall ſtill
bring forth fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and
flouriſhing. <hi>Theſe are the priviledges of the
Lord's houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhut up all with a word or two of <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If every true Church of Chriſt be the Lord's
houſe,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> Why then, Let not men take it ill if any
Church of Chriſt, in obedience to the Rule of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43429:152"/>
Chriſt, and to the Commandment of Chriſt, ſhall
be watchful and cautelous who they receive into
the Houſe of Chriſt: Let it be no offence, it is a
Churches duty, and it ſhould not be any Offence,
they muſt walk by the Rule that Chriſt hath left:
Chriſt's houſe hath a rule given them, and they
muſt not for a houſe full of gold and ſilver, go
from the rule of the Lord; Chriſt hath left a rule
how he will have thoſe qualified, that ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into his houſe, <hi>Pſal. 15.</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 24. 3, 4.
Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord? And who
ſhall ſtand in his holy place? He that hath clean
hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lift up his
ſoul unto vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully.</hi> Theſe places
ſpeak of Goſpel times, men and women muſt be
viſibly holy: And therefore let it be no offence to
any that the Church walketh by the Rule of the
Maſter of the Family; they muſt receive none
but ſuch as they can judge to be thoſe that are
qualified according to the rule that Chriſt hath
left; ſuch as Chriſt hath received, and no more;
you your ſelves will be choice whom you receive
into your houſes, and I pray let Chriſt have that
liberty you challenge to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> From hence it lets us ſee, that the
ſins of Profeſſors, eſpecially the ſins and ſcandals
of Church-members, muſt needs be a great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Chriſt. O that we could think upon it
ſeriouſly, there is much ſadneſs in it, that they
that have a profeſſion of Chriſt upon them, the
Livery of Chriſt upon them, that they that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the houſe of Chriſt, accounted as
children there, and ſervants there, and friends
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43429:153"/>
there, that they ſhould walk ſo as Chriſt ſhould
be diſhonoured; Profeſſors, look to it, and ye
eſpecially that are Church members; your ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
your open ſins, bring more diſhonour to
Chriſt, then the ſins of the whole world; your
ſins are a ſhame to Chriſt, they reflect to the
diſhonour of Chriſt, and ſhame to Chriſt: It is a
ſad thing, that men ſhould look upon Profeſſors,
and ſay, they are like the world; they make a
profeſſion, Ah! but they are as greedy after the
world as wicked men, and they are as proud as
the Devil himſelf; O that Profeſſors might not
give occaſion for wicked men thus to ſpeak! for
this will be a diſhonour to Chriſt. When you ſee
a childe rude and deboiſt, you will ſay, who is his
father? Or, who is his Maſter? What? Hath he
no Father? Or no Maſter? O! What a ſhame is
it to the Maſter of the Houſe? And ſo for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
when men ſhall look upon thoſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
converſation, and they ſhall ſay, Who is
their Maſter? What? Chriſt their Maſter! And
they ſpeak ſo and ſo! And walk ſo and ſo! O
that the Lord would make them that have the
profeſſion of Chriſt upon them watchful in this;
Take heed that you give no occaſion to the world
to ſpeak evilly of Chriſt, who is the Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> It lets us ſee what a Priviledge it is
to be a Member of the Church of Chriſt, and to
have Right thereunto; Take that along. O!
What a priviledge is it? What a deſireable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is it? How will every one ſtrive to get their
children into great mens houſes? If they can but
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43429:153"/>
get their ſons to be one of a Noble-man's houſe,
you think it to be a great priviledge; O what a
mercy and priviledge is it to be one of Chriſts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?
How many are the priviledges that they
enjoy that are in Chriſt's Houſe? You had a taſte
of them before, and O that the taſte might draw
all Chriſtians to the performance of their duty!
O! How did <hi>David</hi> long and thirſt after it?
<hi>Pſal. 27. 4. One thing have I deſired of the Lord,
and but one thing;</hi> What is that? <hi>That I may
dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my
life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in his Temple:</hi> O how deſirous was <hi>David</hi>
to dwel in the Houſe of the Lord? And he counts
them bleſſed, <hi>Pſal. 84. 4. Bleſſed are they that
dwell in thy Houſe.</hi> Now if it be ſuch a mercy
and priviledge, take heed that we do not contemn
it, and take heed that you do not ſlight it, and
ſay, it is no great matter whether I be in the houſe
of God or no, ſo long as I am a Believer: O!
Take heed that you do not deſpiſe ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> What an engagement
doth lye upon all in Chriſt's houſe to be holy? This
is an engagement to duty.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Duties of Church-Members.</note> It engages the Saints in Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
unto the exerciſe of the grace of <hi>Love;</hi> why
they are all of one houſe,<note place="margin">Duty 1.</note> and of one houſhold, and
and they are engaged to love one another, they
are engaged to ſeek the good of one another: you
take it ill if a ſervant or childe ſhould not regard
what becomes of their fellow ſervants, and fellow
brethren, every one muſt ſeek the good of th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43429:154"/>
If one Houſe, we are engaged to a great
deal of love and tenderneſs that we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
towards one another; not to minde our own
things, but to minde the good of others; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in the ſame houſe; we are bound to <hi>do
good to all the houſhold of Faith,</hi> but eſpecially in
the ſame houſe; we have the ſtrongeſt tye to love,
and to help one another, if in Chriſt's houſe.</p>
               <p>And if this be Chriſt's houſe,<note place="margin">Duty 2.</note> O! What duty
do we owe to Chriſt, that are received into Chriſts
houſe? If in Chriſt's houſe, we ſhould keep
Chriſt's Lawes, the Rules of his houſe: O! what
Rules hath Chriſt given us to walk by? Faith and
Love, the great Commandment of the Goſpel: O!
if in Chriſt's houſe, know that you are engaged to
walk by Chriſt's Lawes.</p>
               <p>And it engages you to <hi>do the work of Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duty 3.</note>
what is the work that is in Chriſt's houſe? Surely
there is ſome work for every one, Chriſt will not
have an idle perſon in his houſe, ſome work Chriſt
layes before every member; O that we might be
helpful; there is ſomthing in which the meaneſt
member may be ſerviceable to the houſe of Chriſt;
wait upon the Lord to know your work, and wait
for ſtrength to do it.</p>
               <p>And we ſhould <hi>bleſs Chriſt for the proviſion of

                  <note place="margin">Duty 4.</note> O! how engaged are we to wait upon

hath ſaid, That <hi>thoſe that are in his houſe ſhall be fat

the Lord requires of his people when afflicted and

               <p>1. This Worſhip it is either the Worſhip of

               <p>2. It is the waiting upon God in thoſe Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Heb. 12. 9. When as the ſoul is filled with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear, fearful to ſin againſt God, and to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him in affliction and temptation, when the
ſpirit is fearful to grieve the Spirit of God in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
when it is fearful to take the name of

fear before the Lord in the time of affliction, this
is part of that Internal Worſhip the ſoul owes to
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Worſhip conſiſts in <hi>Love,</hi> as
well as in fear; when the ſoul is acting in love
toward God in time of affliction or temptation, as
that it dares not conclude that God loves him the
leſs, though he be afflicted, though he be in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,

the ſoul is looking towards his portion as a bleſſed

thus breathing in love towards God in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
or temptation, this is a part of that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
worſhip it owes to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Internal Worſhip is that <hi>Truſt
and Affiance</hi> the ſoul hath, which it placeth in God
alone; when the ſoul is acting of faith in the
Lord, <hi>The Lord is my portion, my ſoul hath ſaid it,
and therefore I will hope in him;</hi> I will look toward
him, I will reſt upon his Arm, doubtleſs thou art
our Father, though all this hath befallen us, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
God's intentions are gracious, it is for my
good that he doth thus afflict me; doubtleſs the
Lord can and will make a good end of theſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for that is his promiſe: Now when the
ſoul is thus roling upon God, and reſting upon
his promiſe, cleaving to the faithfulneſs of God
for the fulfilling of his Promiſe in time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or temptation, this is a great part of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worſhip which God doth require of the ſoul,
when it ſhall thus believe in hope, above hope, and
againſt hope; as <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
did, this is Inward Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It conſiſts in the <hi>ſubmiſſion of the ſoul
to God.</hi> That Inward Worſhip that God doth
require of his people in time of affliction or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
I ſay it conſiſts in the ſubmiſſion of the
ſpirit unto God; when a man deſires to make a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43429:157"/>
reſignation of his Will unto God; <hi>If this cup may
not paſs from me, thy will be done;</hi> when a ſoul is
content to be at the diſpoſe of God, for the kinde
of affliction, and meaſure of affliction, and the time
of affliction; well, if God encreaſe my burthen,
let him encreaſe my ſtrength, and my ſoul ſhall
glory in him; if the Lord will continue my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
longer, and I muſt drink of this cup again
and again, yea the third time, if the Lord will
afford his preſence in affliction, my ſoul deſires to
ſubmit to the Lord; when thus the heart is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
toward God, ſubmitting, falling down before
the Lord, and making a reſignation of his Will to
the Lord's Will. This is that ſpecial Worſhip of
the Spirit, that Internal Worſhip that the Father
of Spirits calleth for from his children in time of
affliction.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">External Worſhip, what, and wherein it conſiſts.</note> This Worſhip muſt be <hi>External</hi>
as well as Internal, and it conſiſts in the giving
honour to God in thoſe wayes that are of his own
appointment, eſpecially in theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the pouring out of the ſoul in ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In ſpeaking good words of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe are two great parts of that external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that God calls his children to in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
to ſpeak gracious words unto God, and
to ſpeak good words of God to his praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>Firſt It is the <hi>pouring out the Supplication of the
Soul before the Lord in prayer;</hi> it is a ſpecial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
that God calleth his people to in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and temptation, to be much in ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43429:157"/>
pouring out their ſouls before the Lord. Now
this Supplication, this Prayer which the Lord doth
require and doth delight in, it is accompanied</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>With Humility;</hi> As you ſhall finde in the
example of this woman, her prayer in the day of
her diſtreſs, it was a humble prayer, a humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
one of the Evangeliſts obſerves, (the
Evangeliſt <hi>Mark, chap. 7. ve?ſ. 25.)</hi> that <hi>ſhe
came and fell at his feet;</hi> this woman came and
fell at the feet of Chriſt, and cryed to him, Lord
help me; It is a humble prayer that the Lord
doth delight in, when the ſpirit lyeth low before
the Lord, when the creature is ſenſible of his
own vileneſs, and ſhall acknowledge with <hi>Jacob,</hi>
That he is <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all thoſe mercies
which he doth deſire and expect at the hand of God,</hi>
that if ever the Lord be gracious, it muſt be free
grace, ſomthing in himſelf that muſt move him;
when the ſoul is enabled by the Spirit of the Lord
to put up ſuch a prayer, this is a part of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
worſhip that the Lord requires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You ſhall finde that this womans
prayer was accompanied with <hi>Fervency;</hi> her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expreſſion doth hold forth and declare the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of her ſpirit; ſhe cryed before, <hi>O Lord,
thou Son of David have mercy on me;</hi> and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſhe breaks forth into this expreſſion, <hi>Lord,
Help:</hi> Why, it is ſuch a prayer that God taketh
delight in, ſuch a ſupplication as is ſent up with a
holy fervency unto God; and indeed the Lord
brings his people into the furnace of affliction and
temptation, that ſo he may kindle this holy fire
of zeal and fervency in their boſomes; the Lord
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43429:158"/>
doth raiſe the ſtorms, that ſo he may make the
Diſciples to cry the louder. Now therefore when
the ſpirit is thus carried out to God, this is ſuch
worſhip as he requires and expects.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, We ſhall finde that this woman
ſupplication it was accompanied <hi>with Faith;</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
without faith could not avail; but there is
an expreſſion of her faith, that Title which ſhe
gave to Chriſt, <hi>Lord;</hi> Lord help: ſhe looked
upon him as the Lord of heaven and earth, ſo ſhe
applies her ſelf to him in her diſtreſs; infinite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
power, he was the <hi>Lord,</hi> and had infinite power,
he was able to help; ſo ſhe reſteth upon his all
ſufficiency: ſure he that is the Lord, the Lord of
all, he hath power enough in his hand, and grace
enough in his heart, he can do what he pleaſe, why
ſuch a prayer the Lord accepts of as is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with faith; the promiſe is made to faith;
<hi>What-ever you ask in my Name believing, you ſhall
receive;</hi> and <hi>the prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the
ſick:</hi> the prayer of faith can do great things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This womans prayer was accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Conſtancy;</hi> ſhe held on notwithſtanding
the diſcouragements ſhe met withal, they were
very many and great, the Lord (as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
was ſilent to her a long time, when he ſpeaks
he ſpeaks a ſad word, that <hi>he was not ſent to ſuch
as ſhe was,</hi> yet ſhe holds on; this diſcouragement
might have beaten her off, and made her to have
ſaid, well, I ſee that there is no hope, I ſhall loſe
my labour; but notwithſtanding all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſhe doth continue in ſupplication, ſhe
worſhips, and ſhe cryes, <hi>Lord help:</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43429:158"/>
in Prayer that the heart of God is taken
with, Chriſt you know ſpake a parable to this end,
<hi>Luke 18. 1. That men ſhould pray alwayes.</hi> The
ſoul ſhould continue with God, and abide with
God: Reſolve not to go away from his feet, but
there to ſit, and there to wait, and there to cry,
till the Lord be gracious; this part of that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
worſhip the Lord requires of his people in
time of affliction and temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The other part of external worſhip
is <hi>in ſpeaking well of God in affliction and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
So doth this woman, ſhe ſpake well of Chriſt
when ſhe worſhipped him, ſhe calleth him <hi>Lord;</hi>
by which word ſhe doth
Firſt of all, <hi>Exalt</hi> and honour Chriſt.
Secondly, She <hi>Juſtifieth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both theſe are good words, which God takes
well from his people in the time of affliction or
temptation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, She doth <hi>Exalt him,</hi> ſhe ſpake to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
thou art the Lord what-ever I be, though I
be a poor vile creature, as ſhe acknowledged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
when Chriſt converted her, yet <hi>thou art
the Lord;</hi> nay, though Chriſt ſhould debaſe her,
yet ſhe would exalt him: O this is an excellent
frame of ſpirit, an excellent part of that worſhip
we owe to God. And as ſhe doth honour God,
So</p>
               <p>Secondly, She <hi>Juſtifieth him; (O Lord)</hi> that
very word doth juſtifie Chriſt in all his dealings
towards her: Thou art <hi>the Lord,</hi> thou art <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
infinite, free and abſolute, and may do what
thou pleaſeſt, and in all this thou haſt done me
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43429:159"/>
no wrong, neither canſt thou do wrong, for thou
art the Lord, I am thy poor creature, thy vaſſal,
but thou art the Lord; thus ſhe juſtifieth Chriſt.
Now when the ſoul is thus carried out in time of
affliction and temptation, to ſpeak ſuch words as
may be to the honour of Chriſt, and ſo to ſpeak,
as to juſtifie Chriſt in all that hath befallen it, Lord
thou haſt done me no wrong, thou art righteous,
though my affliction be very great, though my
temptation be very prevalent, yet the Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in all that hath befallen me; if he ſhould
afflict me ſeven times more, and heat the Furnace
ſeven times hotter, I could not ſay thou wert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous:
When the ſoul is thus carried out (I
ſay) to ſpeak well of God, to ſpeak honourably of
God, and to ſpeak to the juſtifying of God in his
dealings, this is a great part of that worſhip which
we owe to God in time of affliction. And ſo you
have ſeen the firſt particular, <hi>What it is to worſhip
the Lord,</hi> or what is that worſhip which the Lord
doth expect from his people in time of affliction
and temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall give you two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
for the proof of the Point; That it is the
duty of the Saints thus to worſhip, what-ever
the affliction or the temptation be, and that both
with <hi>Internal</hi> worſhip of the ſpirit, and with <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
worſhip, ſpeaking good words unto God,
and of God.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inſtance 1. of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </note> look into <hi>Job 1. 20, 21.
Then Job aroſe, and rent his Mantle, and ſhaved his
head, and fell down upon the ground, and worſhipped,
and ſaid, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43429:159"/>
and naked ſhall I return thither: the Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name
of the Lord. Job</hi> he was under great afflictions at
this time, all his ſubſtance was taken away, a ſad
and unparallel'd affliction, and no doubt but it was
a day of great temptation to <hi>Job,</hi> for that was the
Devil's deſigne to make <hi>Job</hi> blaſpheme God to his
face, and therefore without doubt Sathan did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
horrible temptations, or elſe he had not well
proſecuted his deſigne; and yet notwithſtanding
it was a day of affliction, and a day of temptation,
<hi>Job worſhipped the Lord,</hi> expreſſed holy fear and
reverence, expreſſed love, and expreſſed his truſt,
his confidence, and his ſubmiſſion; and he prays,
and he praiſeth, he ſpake <hi>to God,</hi> and he ſpake well
<hi>of God,</hi> all parts of worſhip, he fell down and
worſhipped, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the
Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord:</hi>
And ſo <hi>David</hi> often met with afflictions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,<note place="margin">Inſtance 2. of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </note>
and yet you ſhall finde him worſhipping
in divers of his Pſalmes.<note place="margin">Inſtance 3. of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                  </note> Yea look upon <hi>Jonah,</hi>
and take <hi>Jonah</hi> for an inſtance, and O that God
would make theſe his Saints patterns to us; <hi>Jonah
2. 2, 3, 4.</hi> He was in a ſad affliction, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
was accompanied with temptation, he was
as low in his own imagination, as if he had been in
the belly of hell, and yet even then, when in the
Whales belly, in the depth of affliction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
round about with ſore temptations, Then
<hi>Jonah worſhipped the Lord,</hi> verſ 4. <hi>Then I ſaid, I
am caſt out of thy ſight, yet I will look again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thy holy Temple. I ſaid I was caſt out of
thy ſight;</hi> there is a temptation of diſtruſt, when
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43429:160"/>
in that ſad condition, in the bottome of the Sea,
<hi>yet will I look towards thy holy Temple;</hi> and at
<hi>verſ. 7. When my ſoul fainted within me, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee, into
thy holy Temple:</hi> When he was in this condition,
he prayed, and he poured out his ſoul before the
Lord.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only give you one inſtance more,<note place="margin">Inſtance 4. of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> and
that is of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, when as he was in a ſore
affliction, and his affliction accompanied with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
then he prayed, <hi>Luke 22. 39, 40, 41, 42.
And he came out, and went as he was wont, to the
Mount of Olives, and his Diſciples alſo followed him,
And when he was at the place, he ſaid unto them,
Pray, that ye enter not into temptation. And he
was withdrawn from them about a ſtones caſt, and
kneeled down, and prayed, ſaying, Father, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
be willing, remove this cup from me: Nevertheleſs,
not my Will, but thine be done:</hi> and at verſ. 44.
it is ſaid, <hi>being in an Agony, he prayed more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</hi>
His affliction doth increaſe, and his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
do increaſe, and as they encreaſe, ſo he
cries the more earneſtly to his Father: Afflictions
do not make Chriſt ceaſe to worſhip; no, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
the more, and he cryeth the louder, and
prayeth the more earneſtly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Grounds of the point, why it is the duty of Gods people to worſhip in time of affliction.</note> We ſhall conſider <hi>the Grounds</hi> of the
Point; Why it is the duty of God's people, to
worſhip God in time of affliction and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe there is no affliction or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but it is <hi>from the Lord,</hi> it is his Meſſenger, it
is of his ſending; we have to deal with God in it
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43429:160"/>
and it is fit that we ſhould fall down and worſhip
him, when God ſends affliction, <hi>Iſa. 45. 7.</hi> I <hi>form
the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and
create evil; I the Lord do all theſe things:</hi> It is
not ſpoken of Natural darkneſs, the darkneſs that
is of the Ayre, that was not created by God, there
is no creating cauſe, withdrawing of light cauſeth
darkneſs; but God (ſaith he) <hi>creates darkneſs,</hi> he
creates <hi>Metaphorical darkneſs,</hi> that darkneſs which
he ſends as an affliction to his own people, <hi>I create
it;</hi> there is no darkneſs but that which is of the
Lord's forming and creating: In the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world, <hi>God ſaid, let there be light;</hi> but
God never ſaid, let there be darkneſs: but now,
when God will afflict any of his people, he creates
darkneſs, and there is no darkneſs, till God ſay,
let there be darkneſs; when God ſayes, let there
be darkneſs in ſuch a man's eſtate, all his comforts
ſhall wither; when God ſays, let there be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſuch a man's family, there ſhall be darkneſs;
for he can turn the Sun, or Moon, or Stars into
darkneſs; he can take away the head of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the children that are as the Stars of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
if God ſpeak the word, though there be
never ſo many in the family, he can turn light into
darkneſs: and ſo, when God ſayes, let there be
darkneſs in ſuch a man's ſpirit, O then, though it
was comfortable before, it will be as ſad and as
dark in the inward man, even as it is with the
Ayr at midnight; darkneſs is of God's creating:
and therefore when-ever the Lord brings us into a
ſtate of darkneſs, affliction and temptation, either
outward or inward, it is time then to worſhip the
Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:43429:161"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Ground 2.</note> We ſhould then worſhip the Lord in
time of affliction and temptation, for <hi>it is the Lord
only that can enable a man to bear temptation or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:</hi>
there is need (I ſay) that we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our ſelves to the Lord, for he only can enable
a poor creature to grapple with his affliction and
temptation; If the Lord help not, the proudeſt
helper in the world ſhall ſtoop, and not be able to
bear up a man under the leaſt affliction, eſpecially
when the affliction is accompanied with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is wounding; <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can
bear?</hi> It is only everlaſting Armes that can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
under ſuch a condition; ſurely therefore it is
our duty in affliction and temptation to fall down
and worſhip.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ground 3.</note> The <hi>Lord only can give a ſanctified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
of affliction;</hi> he only can do us good by our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
temptations; affliction it ſelf cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
ſad experience ſhews it, a man may have ſtroke
after ſtroke, and yet receive no profit, no ſpiritual
advantage, <hi>I am the Lord thy God that teacheth
thee to profit,</hi> Iſa. 48. 17. God only can teach to
profit; <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou correcteſt and
teacheſt,</hi> Job 5. 17. When God's inſtruction and
teaching go along with his correction, that man is
bleſſed, that affliction ſhall be bleſſed: Affliction
it ſelf cannot do it, and therefore there is need
that we ſhould apply our ſelves to God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Ground 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God only can remove the affliction,</hi> and
he only can rebuke the diſtemper, and ſilence the
temptation; for certainly both affliction and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
(as I ſaid before) they are the Lord's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
they are the Armies of the Lord of Hoſts,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:43429:161"/>
they go, and they come at his command, he gives
out the word, and he bids affliction to charge, and
it chargeth; and if he bids it to retreat, it ſhall
retreat; God only can deliver from affliction, and
from temptation; therefore ſurely it is our duty
to worſhip in affliction and temptation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Ground 5.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the end of all afflictions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to bring the ſoul nearer to God, to drive the
ſoul nigher God:</hi> We are very prone to content
our ſelves to live at a diſtance from God; <hi>before
I was afflicted, I went aſtray,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal.
119. 67. Now the end of affliction and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to fetch home the ſtragling ſheep, to bring
God and the ſpirit nigher together; therefore it
is fit that we ſhould fall down and worſhip,
for therein do we draw nigh to God, when the
ſoul falls down and worſhips God with <hi>Internal</hi>
worſhip, <hi>fear</hi> him, <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>truſt</hi> him, and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
to him, and when it is pouring out its ſoul,
and lifting up the name of God, ſpeaking good
words of the Almighty; ſurely herein the ſoul
draws nigh to God, and ſo affliction attains its
end.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly,<note place="margin">Ground 6.</note> This <hi>is the way to eaſe and reſt
in our afflictions;</hi> we cry out for eaſe and reſt, that
is the thing we ſeek after; the way to have eaſe
and reſt, is to fall down and worſhip; for by ſo
doing, the ſoul doth caſt its burthen upon the Lord.
When it doth thus fall down, and worſhip with
the worſhip of the Spirit, fear, and love, and truſt,
now the ſoul caſteth its burden upon the Lord, and
his burden being left there, it bringeth in unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reſt. I ſay, when the ſoul by inward worſhip
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43429:162"/>
hath gone to God, and left his burden upon the
Lord, O! it bringeth in eaſe to the ſpirit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the affliction or temptation be.</p>
               <p>Well then, to <hi>Apply</hi> this in a word.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> What cauſe have we to be aſhamed that

many of your ſouls have been exerciſed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
but O! What hath been the carriage of

Truly we have cauſe to be humbled every one,
either we have not known our duty, or not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our duty in the time of affliction and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nay, Inſtead of worſhipping, Have not we been
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43429:162"/>
diſhonouring God in the time of affliction and

we not neglected our duty, and ſaid, what profit
is there if I pray unto the Almighty? Have we
not thought that we have had to excuſe from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

upon us? We have thought that affliction had
been our excuſe from our duty; truly we may
take up a ſad complaint againſt our ſelves, we are
all guilty before the Lord, and O that he would
help us to ſee the evil of our hearts, that hath paſt
in the time of affliction and temptation!</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, when ſome afflictions are upon
us, alas we cannot pour out ſupplications to the
Lord; ſurely in time of affliction he doth not
require it; he will have mercy, and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>But can our afflictions be worſe then <hi>Jobs</hi> were?
Can it be greater then <hi>Jonahs?</hi> he was in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of hell; Can our afflictions and agonies be
greater then Chriſt's were? yet he prayed, and
prayed the more earneſtly; the more his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and temptations encreaſed, the more he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I know the Lord doth ſomtimes exerciſe his
people with ſuch conditions, ſuch weakneſſes, as
they cannot be much in the performance of this
external part of Worſhip; they cannot be much
in ſpeaking unto God, nor ſpeaking well of God,
becauſe of that weakneſs that is upon the outward
man; and if that be the only hinderance, if the
ſpirit be not in fault, the Lord Jeſus will make an
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43429:163"/>
excuſe; Chriſt doth tender his poor ſervants and
children in ſuch a condition, when he ſees the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is willing, and the fleſh weak; they ſhall not
need to excuſe themſelves, Chriſt will. But even
then we are called upon to be much in giving to
the Lord that inward worſhip of the ſpirit, which
may be given when we are in the weakeſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the more we are hindred from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
part of worſhip, the more ſhould we be in
the internal part of worſhip, the more ſhould the
ſpirit be <hi>reverencing,</hi> and <hi>loving,</hi> and <hi>exerciſing</hi>
acts of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Affiance,</hi> and the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the Lord, and lying low; this the Lord
calls for from his people in the worſt condition:
and we have cauſe to be humbled that we are not
found in the performance of this duty in time of
affliction or temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> If it be a duty to worſhip in time
of affliction, it is much more our duty to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
when the Lord is pleaſed to free us from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and from temptation; if God looks for
Worſhip from his people when under affliction
and temptation, then much more he looks for
worſhip from his people when free from affliction
and temptation: This is a duty that lyes upon all
Saints, to be worſhipping the Lord, not only with
Internal, but External worſhip, to take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of worſhipping the Lord in publique, and
in our families in private, to be pouring out ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and to be ſpeaking well of God is our
duty: if in ſickneſs, then much more in health;
and if in adverſity, much more in proſperity; and
if under temptation, much more in the day of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43429:163"/>
freedome, when the hand of the Lord is not upon
us; it is our duty to take all opportunities, and
the beſt opportunities, and the fitteſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
both in our families, and in publique. Take
heed that our incumbrances of the world doth
not ſhut out our worſhip of God: <hi>Pour out thine
indignation upon the Heathen, and the Families that
call not upon thy name:</hi> O that that Scripture were
remembred! Truly we are apt to complain when
God lays his hand upon us, and exerciſes us with
affliction and temptation, our complaint is, that we
cannot worſhip; that is the grief and the burden,
that we cannot worſhip the Lord, we are taken off
from our duty; if ſo, we had more need to take
thoſe fairer advantages and opportunities of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping,
while the Lord is pleaſed to continue
his courſe of mercy and goodneſs towards us:
<hi>Seek the Lord while he is near, and call upon him
while he may be found;</hi> when afflictions come, we
cry out, God is far from us, and at a great diſtance,
and we know not how to apply our ſelves to him;
but examine and ſee whether this may not be the
cauſe, becauſe we have not taken our opportunity
while he was near, we have neglected to worſhip
him while we had ſtrength and ability of body, of
pouring out our ſouls to God, and ſpeaking to
God; and no wonder the Lord doth take thoſe
opportunities from us: and truly that proves a
great burthen to many of Gods own people in the
day of adverſity, when God brings them into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and exerciſeth them with temptation, and
they ſee they cannot worſhip him in that external
way; O! that is their grief, that they have not
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43429:164"/>
laid forth themſelves in the worſhip of the Lord,
both publique and private, while the Lord gave
them ſpace and opportunity; and therefore as we
deſire not to lie under that preſſure, which will be
exceeding heavie to God's own people, take heed
how we neglect worſhip, either in our families, or
in publique, or in both; for if it be our duty to
worſhip under affliction, much more in health,
peace, and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>To draw to a concluſion, one word of <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
and ſo I end.</p>
               <p>Brethren, Let us look up to the Lord to teach
us this leſſon,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> to make Impreſſion of this Divine
Truth upon our hearts; there is a time a coming
that every one of us may be put to the exerciſe of
it; and therefore look up to the Lord now to
teach you, that when affliction and remptation
come, we may through the Lord's ſtrength be
made able to fall down and worſhip, both with
Internal and External worſhip; O! that God
would make thoſe examples of the Saints that were
ſet before us, prevalent with us, to draw us on to
our duty; you heard how <hi>Job</hi> worſhipped, and
how <hi>Jonah</hi> worſhipped, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> worſhipped in
an Agony, in the midſt of affliction, accompanied
with great temptations; O that we might look
up to God to teach us this duty! that we may be
ready to fall down and worſhip, as <hi>Job</hi> was, when
the evil tydings came that all was taken from him,
be falls down and worſhipped, and bleſſes the
Name of God. O! Know, that we have need then
to be pouring out our ſouls before the Lord, and
to be crying, as this woman did, <hi>Lord help,</hi> if ever
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43429:164"/>
we had need to cry, then <hi>Lord help;</hi> when afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is upon us, eſpecially accompanied with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
men and Angels cannot help, we had need
to cry, <hi>Lord help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what is it that we ſhould cry
for to the Lord at ſuch a time? It is our duty to
worſhip, and to be pouring out ſupplications, but
what is it that God expects that his people ſhould
cry for in time of affliction and temptation?</p>
               <p>Briefly thus,<note place="margin">What Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould beg for in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> We ſhould cry, That <hi>the Lord
would diſcover the cauſe of that affliction, and that
tryal which the Lord doth exerciſe his people with:</hi>
Truly, it is not without cauſe, and therefore it is
not without cauſe that God doth afflict us, <hi>if need
be you are in temptation,</hi> it is not without cauſe, and
therefore it is our wiſdom and duty to cry to the
Lord that he would diſcover to us why it is thus
with us, to know what is his minde and will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, what God aims at, whether for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or tryal, or for exerciſe; wait upon the
Lord to know what is his end; it is an addition to
our affliction, when as our way is hid, and God's
way towards us is hid, and we know not what
God intends; therefore we ſhould be much in
this requeſt, fall down and worſhip him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Lord to ſhew us the cauſe, what is his end
in this affliction, this tryal and temptation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Fall down, and worſhip, and pray
<hi>that the Lord would take away the ſting of affliction;</hi>
the ſting is ſin, the ſting of death is ſin, and the
ſting of all leſſer deaths, affliction, is ſin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pray that the Lord would take away the ſting;
pray that <hi>he would not correct us in wrath, and that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43429:165"/>
he would not chaſten us in his ſore diſpleaſure;</hi> that
was <hi>David's</hi> requeſt <hi>(Pſal. 6. 1.)</hi> that the affliction
might not be accompanied with the Lord's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
but that the face of the Lord may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, and the comforting preſence of the
Lord with us in affliction; we ſhould cry that the
Lord would take away the ſting, and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
may be with us in affliction, that he would
not leave us in the fiery furnace alone, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his promiſe, would be with us, when we go
thorow the fire and water.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We ſhould cry, That <hi>the Lord would
make us willing to bear our affliction, what-ever it
be;</hi> that he would make our ſpirits ſubmiſſive to
him: that ſhould be the great requeſt of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart, that the Lord would make our ſpirits
ſubmiſſive unto him. O! What a gracious frame
of ſpirit was <hi>David</hi> in, when he was driven out
from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by his ſon <hi>Abſalom?</hi> 2 Sam. 15.
25. The Prieſts would have brought the Ark af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him; No (ſaith he) <hi>Carry back the Ark of
God into the City; If I ſhall finde favour in the
eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew
me both it, and his habitation; But if he thus ſay, I
have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him
do to me as ſeemeth good unto him:</hi> Here was a
gracious ſubmiſſive frame of ſpirit under a great
affliction; if the Lord will uſe me no longer as an
inſtrument, and I muſt Reigne no longer, let the
Lord chuſe what inſtrument he pleaſeth, and do
with me what ſeemeth good unto him. O! Beg
that God would give us a ſubmiſſive frame of
heart, that when the Lord leads us into any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43429:165"/>
we may be found ſubmitting to the Will of
God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We ſhould beg of the Lord, That
<hi>He would ſtrengthen us to bear our affliction;</hi> that
he would enable us to grapple with our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſo to bear our affliction, that we may
be no diſhonour to his Name; ſo to bear our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
as we may be to his praiſe. Surely the
leaſt affliction will cruſh us, if we have no other
ſtrength then our own, we ſhall be ſoon cruſht,
when under temptation: O! We had need cry,
<hi>Lord help,</hi> we had need cry that the Lord would
put under everlaſting Armes to bear up the ſpirit,
and to enable us ſo to carry it, as we may be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, When we fall down and worſhip, Beg
<hi>that the Lord would give a ſanctified uſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
or temptation, whatſoever it be:</hi> Our ſpirits
ſhould be breathing after a holy improvement of
all God's diſpenſations, eſpecially theſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of great afflictions or temptations; truly (as
you heard before) it is not in affliction it ſelf to do
this, we cannot profit by it if the Lord doth not
teach; and therefore we had need go to him, and
cry to him, that he would give a ſanctified uſe,
that he would make affliction attain its end, that
he would bore our ear to inſtruction and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that we may hear the rod, and him that hath
appointed it, that he would carry on his own work,
and would make uſe of this affliction for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of our corrupt nature, making us partakers
of his Divine Nature. Thus we ſhould fall down
and worſhip, and beg that God would give us a
ſanctified uſe of all afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:43429:166"/>
And know Brethren, that we ſhall never have
eaſe nor reſt in our ſpirits till we be brought into
this poſture, we ſhall be in a woful turmoyl and
perplexity, as <hi>Noahs Dove,</hi> that found no reſt till
it came into the Ark; ſo we ſhall finde no reſt
till God brings us into this frame, bow the ſpirit,
and cauſe it to fall down and worſhip in time of
affliction, there will be no ſanctified uſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
never expect any good by affliction, till
God bring the ſpirit into this poſture, to fall down
and worſhip, as <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> did;
that is an argument that the affliction is working
the right way, when as the ſpirit is thus ſubdued
to God: now it is working for good, certainly
God will make a good end with that ſoul, when
it is brought thus to fall down and worſhip the
Lord, to <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>truſt,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit to
him,</hi> and to <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>praiſe,</hi> to <hi>ſpeak to God,</hi> and
<hi>to ſpeak well of God</hi> in time of affliction: Now the
Phyſick works kindly, and the Lord is engaged by
his word, that this ſhall work together for good,
even all afflictions; when it thus works, you may
have aſſurance of it, that all ſhall work together
for good, God will make a good end, as he did
with <hi>Job,</hi> and you may be ſure that God will
make a good end with you when as the affliction
does thus work. And till this be done, never
expect deliverance in mercy, if the ſpirit be not
thus brought off in time of affliction or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'tis no mercy to be delivered; and this is a
ſure Argument that mercy is at hand, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
not far off, when as the Lord ſhall enable
the ſoul thus to fall down and worſhip. When
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43429:166"/>
                  <hi>Jonah</hi> ſhall be looking towards the holy Temple,
though in the belly of hell, yet when he looks to
God thorow the Mediator, worſhipping, praying,
and praiſing, deliverance is not far off: O that
God would help us to be looking upon his, and
other examples! Yea, the example of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when ſhe was tempted and afflicted, ſhe
falls down and worſhipped, ſaying, <hi>Lord Help.</hi>

a very ſore temptation. Chriſt ſeems now to do his

for children, and give it to dogs, it were a ſin and

here to beat her back with a ſtrong repulſe; as if
he ſhould ſay, I wonder at this womans boldneſs,
ſhe being without the Covenant, among the dogs,

               <p>The truth that I ſhall cloſe with, is this.
The conſideration of unworthineſs and vileneſs,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>

               <p>God many times ſuffers his people to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,

their own vileneſs and unworthineſs. That is

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:43429:168"/>
Now to make it plain to you from Scripture,
that this many times doth prove a ſore temptation
to God's people, when their eye hath been kept
intent upon their own vileneſs; this was a great
temptation to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </note> and laid as a block in <hi>Moſes</hi>
his way, <hi>Exod. 3. 11. And Moſes ſaid unto God,
who am I, that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I
ſhould bring forth the children of Iſrael out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt?</hi>
He looked upon his own unworthineſs, he
was of a ſtammering tongue, and uncircumciſed
lips, when God would ſend him about that great
work of bringing the people of Iſrael out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi>
this was a hinderance to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he

thoughts and ſinful imaginations croud in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally?
And they do defile the moſt holy Service
that is taken in hand: O! This proves matter of
temptation: This body of ſin and death, it made
the Apoſtle cry out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am!
who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Rom. 7. 24. It had been a preſſing temptation, if
the Lord had not made a diſcovery of the way of
deliverance and ſalvation to him; for a poor ſoul
is apt to fear, ſurely there is nothing of God in
me, if there were any ſeed of God in me, my
heart would never be ſo vain, and the byas of my
ſpirit would never carry me out from God ſo, O!
I fear I am not made partaker yet of the Divine
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43429:169"/>
Nature. The ſight of that woful evil that is in
the heart, proves many times a ſad temptation,
that it is hard for a poor ſoul to get over it. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the Lord doth leave a poor
creature <hi>to ſin after mercy,</hi> and <hi>againſt mercy,</hi> it
hath been ſaved by the Lord, delivered by his
right hand, preſſed with ſuch and ſuch a mercy,
and yet overtaken in the ſnare of ſin; ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
mercy many times proves a ſore temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
O! I am afraid that I am none of the Lord's
children, mercy hath not its kinde work upon me,
it doth not bring forth thoſe fruits which the Lord
may look for when he gives out ſuch mercies:
ſinning againſt mercy, many times proves a ſore
temptation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When the Lord leaves a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>to fall again and again into the ſame ſin;</hi> O!
this proves matter of temptation, when as the ſoul
hath ſeen the evil of ſin, and hath bewailed it, hath
run to the Lord for ſtrength againſt it, yet hath
been overtaken again and again in the ſame ſin;
that I ſay proves matter of ſore temptation: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may the poor ſoul ſay, my ſpot is not the ſpot
of children, I have been overtaken once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
whereupon the poor ſoul may be tempted
to caſt away his hope and confidence, and not only
tempted to caſt away its confidence, but tempted
to depart from God, and to go out from the wayes
of obedience; <hi>There is no hope</hi> (ſay they in <hi>Jer.
18. 12.) but we will walk after our own devices,
and we will every one do the imagination of his evil
heart:</hi> We have back-ſlidden again and again, and
there is no hope for us, we had as good go on, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:43429:170"/>
take our fill in ſin: This temptation is ſet on many
times by falling into ſin. That is the firſt, That
unworthineſs by reaſon of ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Unworthineſs by reaſon of that <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
weak, and frail condition that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men are in;</hi> the great diſtance that man is
at from God, this proves matter of temptation to
many a poor ſoul, when he conſiders that he is a
poor piece of duſt and aſhes, and that there is an
infinite diſtance between God and the creature;
he is from everlaſting to everlaſting, he is Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,
and changeth not: But we are poor creatures,
that are of yeſterday, and are going down to the
grave to day, and ſhall be in the place of ſilence
to morrow: O this proves matter of temptation
and diſcouragement. Will the Lord look down
upon ſuch a poor creature, and upon ſuch a piece
of duſt and aſhes? Is it poſſible that the Lord
ſhould humble himſelf to take notice of me?
And beſides that common condition of frailty
which all men are in, the Lord is pleaſed to bring
ſome of his people into a lower condition then
that which is the ordinary ſtate of man, and yet
he is as low as duſt: Yet (I ſay) the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to bring ſome of his people into a lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then ordinary; By affliction God makes
mans ſtate to be low, when he brings him into an
afflicted ſtate; and when God maketh mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to be low, taketh away thoſe comforts, and
thoſe relations which have been his refreſhments,
I ſay, when a man is brought thus into a low and
afflicted condition, this added to that common
condition of frailty, it ſetteth at a great diſtance
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43429:170"/>
from God, and it proves many times matter of
diſcouragement and temptation to a poor ſoul: So
it was with <hi>Job, chap. 14. v. 1, 2, 3. Man that
is born of a woman, is of few dayes, and full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down;
he fleeth alſo as a ſhaddow, and continueth not. And
doſt thou open thine eyes upon ſuch a one?</hi> Lord,
(ſaith he) Is it poſſible that thou ſhouldeſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy ſelf ſo far to look down upon ſuch a one?
That God ſhould look down with the eye of pity
upon ſuch a one frail man is, one that is brought
ſo low, one that ſitteth upon the dunghil! Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
by reaſon of frailneſs, proves a temptation
many times to Gods own people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unworthineſs by reaſon of <hi>coldneſs and
deadneſs in affection:</hi> When a poor ſoul finds how
dead his heart is towards God; O! I have a heart
for the world, and I have affections to friends and
relations, there is love to creatures, nay there is
affection enough to vanity, but little or no heart
for God, there are not thoſe breathings, thoſe
thirſtings, thoſe pantings after God, not that firſt
love which ſomtimes it hath found to the Lord,
and to the things of Chriſt: O! This proves mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of diſcouragement and temptation: O! I fear
that the love of God dwelleth not in me, ſaith a
poor ſoul, I finde my heart ſo dead, and ſo ſtrait
towards God, open to the world, but ſtrait to
God: O! I fear that the love of God dwelleth
not in me; How can it be that God ſhould ſet his
love upon ſuch a one? Surely if the love of God
were in me, I ſhould love the Lord more then I
do. Deadneſs and coldneſs in affection toward
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43429:171"/>
the Lord, it proves many times a ſore tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Unworthineſs by reaſon of
<hi>unuſefulneſs and unſerviceableneſs to God,</hi> that is
matter of temptation; when as a poor creature
ſees that it can do little or nothing for the Lord,
O! I am a barren tree, I am a dry branch, I ſee
that others are fruitful, I ſee that others have the
promiſe fulfilled to them, they bring forth much
fruit, they are ſerviceable in their generation,
they are an honour to God, and do good to men;
but as for me, I know not wherein I can honour
him, I know not wherein I can be uſeful or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
O I bring forth no fruit unto God, and
therefore am afraid that I am the Tree the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Jude</hi> (verſ. 12.) ſpeaketh of, <hi>without fruit,
twice dead, plucked up by the roots, whoſe end is to
be burnt;</hi> This is matter of ſore temptation, and
therefore hereupon there is many a poor ſoul that
deſires to be out of the world; O Lord, I can do
no good, it is beſt for me to be put into the place
of ſilence, I hinder ſome goodly Tree that
would grow in my place, and would bring forth
more fruit; upon this many a poor ſoul haſtens to
the grave. This is matter of temptation, and it
is grounded upon this, a mans own unworthineſs
and unuſefulneſs, and unſerviceableneſs to Chriſt
in his generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Wherefore doth the
Lord ſuffer his people to be tempted thus about
their unworthineſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, the Lord he hath gracious ends.
Sathan who helps on this temptation many times,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43429:171"/>
he hath deſtructive ends; but God in ſuffering of
it, he hath gracious ends.</p>
               <p>What are Gods ends?</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Gods ends in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> God would teach us to learn this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>That the love of God goes not by the worthineſs
of the creature;</hi> therefore God he ſuffers us many
times to be bowed down by looking upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
even to temptation, becauſe we would
not learn this leſſon, that the love of God goeth
not by the creatures worthineſs, but that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
free, and not for any thing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is only in the Breaſt of God; there is
the ground of his love, no reaſon for it in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Go and take a woman of Whoredome, one
that hath played the Adultereſs, and yet beloved,</hi>
that was to ſhew forth and hold forth his love to
the children of Iſrael; What was there in ſuch a
woman that was lovely or deſireable? The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of whoredoms; no more worthineſs in the
children of Iſrael: Neither is there in any ſoul,
and God would have us learn this; and if we will
not learn it, he will ſuffer us to be carried into the
School of Temptation, to learn us this leſſon,
That God loves not for any worthineſs in the
creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">End 2.</note> God would teach us to learn this
leſſon, That <hi>the worthineſs of the creature is out
of it ſelf;</hi> therefore he ſuffers the ſoul to be
brought into this School of Temptation, and to
be bowed down with the apprehenſions of our
unworthineſs, that we may know that the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of man is out of himſelf; a leſſon hard to
learn, for a man is apt to ſeek his worthineſs in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43429:172"/>
himſelf, and is loth to be beholden unto any, no,
not unto God, and not to Chriſt for his worthineſs:
We have all learned this of <hi>Adam,</hi> it was the
firſt ſin, he would have his worthineſs in himſelf,
he would not have depended upon God for it, but
he would ſtand by himſelf, and have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon his Creator, and ſo by ſeeking to ſtand
on his own legs, he fell down below the condition
of a creature. And truly, ever ſince the ſons of
<hi>Adam</hi> have imitated their Father in this, Man
deſires and ſeeks to have his worthineſs at home
in himſelf, and he is loth to go out for it; and
therefore it is one of the hardeſt matters in the
world, to bring men to ſubmit to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Chriſt. Corrupt Nature, and Carnal
Reaſon (as it is corrupted) teacheth men to look
to their own righteouſneſs; Philoſophers taught
men, That men needed not to go out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to make themſelves happy; for a man had
all bleſſings in himſelf, and he needed not to go
out of himſelf: But Chriſt teacheth another leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
if ever man will be happy he muſt go out of
himſelf, and he muſt ſeek his worthineſs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he muſt have it in the Son of God. Now
that we may learn this leſſon, God ſuffers us to
be brought into the School of Temptation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">End 3.</note> God hath this gracious end, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth <hi>make his people more humble, and
lowly in Spirit,</hi> which is a gracious and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
diſpoſition; though the Devil he hath no
ſuch end when he preſents our unworthineſs, to
make us humble, yet God will make that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of it: You may ſee how humble and how
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43429:172"/>
meek this woman was when ſhe was under this
Temptation, in the next words, <hi>Truth Lord,</hi>
(ſaith ſhe) <hi>yet the dogs eat of the crumbs;</hi> all that
thou haſt ſaid is true; thou haſt ſaid I am a dog,
truth Lord, ſo I am. Thus ſhe doth lye very low
at the feet of Chriſt, he calls her dog, and ſhe
lies the lower, ſhe lies at the feet of Chriſt. This
is a gracious effect that God works by this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">End 4.</note> By this God doth make his people
<hi>really to prize, and to live upon, and to exalt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
free grace, and the Sons worthineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
I ſay, in this ſchool of temptation, God
teacheth his people to exalt really, and to prize
really, and to live upon the free grace of God the
Father, and the infinite worthineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O ſaith a poor ſoul, if I be
ſo vile, ſo unworthy, O! what need is there of
fleeing to the free grace of God? What need
is there of looking after the infinite righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Jeſus Chriſt? O! This will make the ſoul
deſirous to live upon God, and to live upon Chriſt,
to build upon free grace, and to build upon the
worthineſs and righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and this
will make the ſoul to exalt, and to lift up this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
name of God, and of his Son. O! What
had become of me, if it had not been for free
grace? If free grace had not over-looked all my
vileneſs, all my ſinfulneſs, all my diſtance from
God, all my coldneſs of affection, all my unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
what had become of me if it had not been
for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? If Chriſt had not
brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs, to cover all
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43429:173"/>
this unrighteouſneſs, O I had been miſerable and
undone. You ſee wherefore God ſuffers theſe
temptations.</p>
               <p>Briefly, a word or two by way of <hi>Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> It may teach us to take heed that we
do not help forward this temptation upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of thoſe that are weak Chriſtians: I ſay, Take
heed that we do not help forward this temptation,
there is no greater temptation then when the ſoul
is kept and bowed down to look upon the vileneſs
and unworthineſs of the creature; many a poor
ſoul cries out (as <hi>David</hi> did) concerning his ſin,
<hi>O, my ſin is ever before me;</hi> ſo many a poor ſoul
ſayes, my unworthineſs an vileneſs is ever before
me, my deadneſs is ever before me, my diſtance
from God, my ſin of Nature, my ſin of Heart, my
relapſes: Now take heed that we do not help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the temptation, by deſpiſing and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe that are weak, by deſpiſing Chriſtians
for their weakneſs; O! it may be, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
their eye is upon it, they look upon it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and therefore we ſhould not ſo look upon
it as to diſcourage them, and not to caſt off ſuch as
have any ſeed of God in them becauſe they are
weak, but to cheriſh that which is of God, though
we may apprehend there is coldneſs, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and unuſefulneſs; and it may be the Lord
hath made them deeply ſenſible of it; but if there
be but a little wheat, though covered with chaffe,
do not caſt it away; a little wheat is precious:
though there be but a little gold, and a great deal
of droſs, yet if we can diſcern any of Chriſt's
gold, we ſhould help forward the work of Chriſt,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43429:173"/>
and not help forward the work of Sathan.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> Take heed that we do not give
way to this temptation, let Chriſtians (eſpecially
weak Chriſtians) take heed that they do not give
way to this temptation, poring upon their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs,
as to be diſcouraged and to be beaten off
from Chriſt, and ſtaved off from their duty. We
may look upon our unworthineſs, and we ought to
look upon our unworthineſs, and O that we could
look upon our unworthineſs more then we do, in
God's way to look upon it, when God doth ſhew
us our unworthineſs in God's glaſs, then we may
look upon it without danger; but now it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to look upon it when Sathan preſents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs,
to behold it in the Divel's glaſs, it is
dangerous, and proves a very ſore temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, How ſhall we know
when God preſents unworthineſs, and when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
preſents unworthineſs? How ſhall we know
when it is duty to look upon unworthineſs, and
when it is ſin to look upon unworthineſs?</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">How to know when God preſents unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it.</note> Firſt of all, When God doth preſent
unworthineſs and vileneſs to us, he doth alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
himſelf to us; he doth not preſent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
of the creature, and leave it there, but
when God ſhews his people their unworthineſs,
he alſo ſhews himſelf; that you may look with
one eye upon the Lord, as you look with the other
eye upon your unworthineſs; ſo did the Church
in <hi>Micah 7. 18. Who is a God like unto thee, that
pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion
of the remnant of his heritage?</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>He will
ſubdue our iniquities, and thou will caſt all our ſins
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:43429:174"/>
into the depth of the Sea.</hi> She had looked upon her
unworthineſs, and upon her vileneſs, and had ſeen
her iniquity; but ſhe alſo looked unto God, <hi>who
is a God like unto thee?</hi> And truly when we look
upon our unworthineſs, we may ſay, and we ought
to ſay, O Lord! Who are ſuch vile, ſinful, and
unworthy creatures in the whole world as we are?
But take heed that we ſtay not there, and rob
God of his grace, but even then look up to the
Lord, and ſay, <hi>Who is like unto thee?</hi> Who is like
unto me for unworthineſs? But who is like unto
thy Son Chriſt for worthineſs and righteouſneſs?
No God like unto thee; No Saviour like unto
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When God preſents our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and vileneſs, it is to make us run nearer to
himſelf; and it hath that effect and that operation
upon the heart, when God ſhews a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
their vileneſs, it makes them run nearer to
God: But now when Sathan ſhews ſinfulneſs and
vileneſs, it is to draw the ſoul away from God, and
ſo forſake its own mercy; when God made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
to the <hi>Prodigal</hi> of his own unworthineſs, it
made him haſten to his father; that diſcovery was
from God, it made him haſten home; <hi>I will ariſe</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>and go to my Father, and I will ſay, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I have ſinned againſt thee, and am not worthy
to be called thy ſon:</hi> When as the ſoul ſhall thus
look upon its unworthineſs, and make the more
haſte to God, make the more haſte to Chriſt,
flee the faſter to the City of Refuge, that diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When God doth diſcover a ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:43429:174"/>
he doth make the ſoul (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<hi>thankful;</hi> he keeps the ſoul in a thankful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
notwithſtanding the diſcovery of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.
So <hi>David,</hi> the Lord helped him to
ſee his own unworthineſs, and the unworthineſs
of his people, yet <hi>David</hi> in the midſt of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
was kept in a thankful frame, <hi>1 Chron. 29.
14. But who am I, and what is my people, that we
ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort?</hi>
Lord, we are poor unworthy creatures, I and my
people, King and people; Ah but ſtill his heart
was kept thankful, and he is the more thankful to
God, that God ſhould employ ſuch in any ſervice
that is done for him. But when as the ſight of our
unworthineſs doth make us to repine againſt God,
and put the ſpirit into a murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
frame, that diſcovery is not from God, but
from Sathan. When God leadeth a ſoul into the
diſcovery of unworthineſs, yet he makes the ſoul
thankful.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When God diſcovers unworthineſs,
it ſhall be no hinderance to the ſoul in waiting
upon God in his Ordinances; when Sathan diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
unworthineſs, he doth thereby endeavour
to diſcourage and to beat off the ſoul from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Lord in the way of his Ordinances;
This woman of Canaan ſhe is not diſcouraged, ſhe
goeth on crying and praying; and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and
his people they went on to wait upon the Lord,
notwithſtanding they were made ſenſible of their
unworthineſs, and their want of preparation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the preparation of the Sanctuary; but
when a ſoul is diſcouraged, beaten off from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43429:175"/>
it is not for me to go to God, it is not for me
to pray, and to wait upon God in his Ordinances,
one ſo unworthy; Surely this is from Sathan, this
is not the diſcovery of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, When as God diſcovers a
man's unworthineſs, it ſhall not take him off from
any ſervice that God calleth him to; when as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
doth diſcover unworthineſs, it taketh a man
off from that work which God layeth before him.
<hi>Moſes</hi> was taken off from the work of the Lord by
the ſight of his own unfitneſs and unworthineſs, he
goes on to make many excuſes one after another,
it was a great ſtumbling block in his way, and it
did hinder him from following God in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that God called him out unto in his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>Moſes,</hi> he looked upon his unworthineſs, and
he was under a temptation; therefore thus you
ſee and may know when God diſcovers unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and when it is duty to look upon unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and on the contrary, when it is of Sathan,
and when it is your duty to look away from your
unworthineſs; we may ſee it, and muſt ſee it in
God's glaſs, but not in Sathans, And O that God
would faſten this upon the ſpirit; let us take heed
that we do not give way to this temptation. Weak
Chriſtians, you that are apt to be diſcouraged with
the thoughts of your unworthineſs, take heed of
giving way to this temptation, for you will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
hinder your own comfort by poring upon
your unworthineſs when Sathan preſents it; and
you will enſlave your own ſpirits, it will hinder
you from that freedome which Jeſus Chriſt hath
purchaſed, and which Jeſus Chriſt tenders to you,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43429:175"/>
it will hinder your ſouls from eſtabliſhment, it will
keep you alwayes in a weak condition, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
poring upon unworthineſs, to look upon
your ſelves continually, and not to look back again
to God, to look upon your ſinfulneſs, and not look
upon free grace, to look upon your unworthineſs,
and not to look upon the worthineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Chriſt: This will keep your ſouls from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment,
and keep you alwayes in a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>But now, when God doth preſent unworthineſs,
we may look upon it; only let us remember what
are God's ends, when as God doth preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs;
Gods ends are gracious, and O that
we might have Gods ends in our eye when we look
upon our unworthineſs! It is to teach us to know
that God loveth us not for our worthineſs, to teach
us to know that we muſt have worthineſs out of
our ſelves, to make us more low, more humble,
meek in ſpirit, to make us to prize the Father's
free grace, and the Son's worthineſs, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
Theſe are God's ends, O that when

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what ſhall I do when tempted about
my unworthineſs?<note place="margin">What to do when tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> Briefly thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be the portion of any ſoul to be
under theſe temptations, under theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before-mentioned; if it be a temptation
grounded upon the diſcovery of the ſinfulneſs of
our Nature, heart, and life; O flee to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
know that God hath declared that there is a
fountain opened, <hi>Zach. 13. 1. In that day there
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43429:176"/>
ſhall be a fountain opened to the Houſe of David, and
to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin, and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs:</hi>
Therefore when you are bowed down
with the ſenſe of your own unworthineſs by reaſon
of ſin, look to the fountain, there is a fountain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and there is vertue in that fountain to
cleanſe and take away all your ſin and unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>And if your temptation be grounded upon the
diſcovery of your weakneſs and frailty, your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from God, and this is helped on by your
low and afflicted condition, beſides the common
frailty of man; O know! That though the diſtance
be infinite, yet God hath overlooked it, free
grace hath over-looked it, and free grace can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look,
and free grace will over-look that infinite
diſtance that is between God any you: and know,
that God doth not judge of any man by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
low eſtate, by his outward afflicted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
you are apt to draw ſad concluſions from
thence, that God loveth you not, and Sathan he
tempts to conclude ſo, if God loved you, he
would not deal ſo with you: Ah, but know, that
God doth not judge ſo, neither can you judge of
the love of God by affliction.</p>
               <p>And if the temptation be grounded upon the
deadneſs of your heart, and coldneſs of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
look to Chriſt to warm you, look to the Son of
God to enflame your affections; but know, that
you are not able to judge of God's love by your
love, you muſt not meaſure God's love by your
love; not to conclude that God hath no love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you have little love; you cannot meaſure
God by your ſelves, you ſhould rather accept of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43429:176"/>
his love, entertain his love, and look to that love
of God, to beget more love in your hearts, and to
draw forth more love in your hearts; we have
cauſe to be humbled exceedingly that our love to
God is ſo little, but yet we muſt not meaſure the
love of God by our love.</p>
               <p>And if your temptation be grounded upon your
unuſefulneſs; O, you ſay, I am an unuſeful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
more fitter for the dunghil then for any thing
elſe; know that God hath ſome uſe of you, there
is never a Chriſtian living but God hath ſome uſe
of it, though it may be you ſee it not; thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
upon thy ſelf as a poor unuſeful creature, but
God hath ſome uſe of you: if God had not ſome
uſe of you, he would not continue you here, no,
not a moment; God hath appointed ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the body, and all are uſeful, not the leaſt
member but it is uſeful in the body; I ſay, ſurely
the Lord ſees that you are of uſe to him, although
you are apt to ſay you are altogether unuſeful. In
a word, when tempted about unworthineſs, do as
this woman did in the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, ſhe doth acknoledge all that Chriſt
ſpake, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread and
caſt it to dogs,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in <hi>v. 27. Truth Lord,</hi>
ſaith ſhe. Let us learn to do ſo, when bowed down
with the thoughts of unworthineſs and vileneſs;
let us ſubſcribe to it, that it is a truth, all that can
be ſaid, and all that can be preſented by Sathan
himſelf concerning our vileneſs, we may grant that
it is truth, I am unworthy, vile, and wretched.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Take heed that this do not hinder the
acting of faith; acknowledge that it is ſo, and that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43429:177"/>
we are as vile as it is objected; but let not the
ſight of this hinder the acting of faith; this woman
ſhe acted faith gloriouſly notwithſtanding; <hi>Truth
Lord, yet the dogs do eat the crumbs that fall from
their maſter's table;</hi> ſhe makes this to be a ground
of faith, even this very diſcouragement, this very
temptation, the ſight of her unworthineſs, this
doth not diſcourage her; It is <hi>Truth Lord, but
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs;</hi> and ſo be you ſtill
in the acting of faith, and let not the fight of
unworthineſs be any hinderance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is our duty ſtill to wait upon the
Lord in the midſt of the diſcovery of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs:
<hi>Wait upon the Lord, and keep his way,</hi> and
let no diſcovery of unworthineſs beat us off from
waiting upon the Lord, and keeping his way: this
woman held on her way, held on to wait notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all her unworthineſs; ſhe believes, and
waits, prays, and waits, and her expectations they
are from the Lord. And ſo in the midſt of the ſenſe
of our unworthineſs, let us do as ſhe did, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God notwithſtanding, be acting faith in
Chriſt, in the Lord's free grace, in thoſe gracious
promiſes which he holds forth, and which he hath
given us in Chriſt, and be waiting upon God in the
way of our duty, keeping his way; and the Lord
he will certainly make that ſoul more then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
of theſe temptations.</p>

called <hi>children,</hi> who are the <hi>children</hi> that have
right to the bread?</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, All they that are <hi>true Believers</hi> in
Chriſt, they are called children; I ſay, ſuch as are
really and truly believers, ſuch as are the ſeed of
Chriſt, the travel of his ſoul, ſuch as are begotten
again unto God by the immortal ſeed of the word,
and born again of the Spirit, new creatures; theſe
are children indeed, they are called the children
of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the children of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the
children of <hi>God by faith</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal. 3.
26. To as many as believed gave he this dignity to
be called the children, the ſons of God:</hi> To as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſons of God, even to them that believe
on his name, <hi>John 1. 12.</hi> primarily and chiefly
they are called children of God, and theſe have
right to the childrens bread.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, There are others that are called
children, that is, <hi>Such as are under viſible and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43429:178"/>
outward diſpenſations of the Covenant;</hi> I ſay, ſuch
as do outwardly belong to the Covenant of God,
ſuch as are under the viſible diſpenſations of the
Covenant of God; though poſſibly many of them
may not be under the efficacy, life, and power of
that Covenant, yet if they be under the viſible
diſpenſations, the outward diſpenſations, God
owns them, and they muſt be owned for children,
<hi>Rom. 9. 6. For they are not all Iſrael which are of
Iſrael;</hi> though they may be of Iſrael, the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of there, and
ſuch as were under the outward diſpenſations of
the Covenant, the Covenant of their father did
belong to them, yet ſaith he, <hi>all are not Iſrael that
are of Iſrael;</hi> they are not Iſrael indeed, <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Promiſe, as Iſaac was;</hi> they are not all
the elect of God, though they may be, and muſt
be owned for children, becauſe under the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſpenſation of the Covenant: And in <hi>Mat.
8. 12. But the children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt
out into utter darkneſs;</hi> called children of the
Kingdom, becauſe under an outward adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Covenant of grace, and yet poſſibly they
may fall off and apoſtatize; and ſuch children of
the Kingdom may be caſt out.</p>
               <p>Now perſons are under an outward adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant two wayes,<note place="margin">How per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be ſaid to be under an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant.</note> or by two rights,
as I conceive.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, by a viſible profeſſion of Chriſt, by
a profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, that may give men
right to a viſible being in the Covenant of God,
and ſo upon that viſible profeſſion that is held
forth, they may have right to the Ordinances of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43429:179"/>
God, and yet not belong to the inviſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God. For Brethren, if a viſible profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot give right to an Ordinance, there is no
man can have any ground for the adminiſtration
of an Ordinance to others, if not upon a viſible
profeſſion, for there is no man can be certainly
aſſured who are the true Iſrael of God, and who
belongs to the Election of God; no man can have
certain aſſurance of another man's condition, but
as he judgeth in charity upon his profeſſion; ſo
that an outward profeſſion gives right to a viſible
being in Covenant, and ſo to a partaking of the
Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is another way of right (as I
conceive) held forth in the Scripture, by which
ſome perſons have right to this viſible Covenant
of God, and ſo to ſome Ordinances of Chriſt,
(ſuch as they are capable of,) and that is, <hi>God's
gracious owning of them;</hi> I ſay, God's gracious
Declaration in the Word, that he will own ſuch
and ſuch, and will account them for his people,
ſet apart for himſelf; and ſo I conceive that the
Lord owns and eſteems of Believers, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of believing parents: And as ſome by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
have right unto the viſible Covenant, ſo
others upon Gods declaration of owning in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
way the ſeed of Believers; for ſo the Lord
declared when he made that everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would take in him
and his ſeed, and they ſhould be viſibly under the
diſpenſation of the Covenant, which promiſe
ſeems again to be renewed even in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<hi>Acts 2, 39. For the Promiſe is unto yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to your children;</hi> and ſaith the Apoſtle 1 Cor.
7. 14. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are
they holy.</hi> God's viſible owning of them, gives
them a right to the viſible Covenant, and ſo to
ſome Ordinances, ſuch as they are capable of.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, it ſeemeth ſtrange that any
ſhould be the ſubjects of an Ordinance who are
not capable of underſtanding what is done: Alas,
children have not the uſe of reaſon, and are not
capable of underſtanding what is done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſure ineffectual, and of no uſe, it is but ſetting
the ſeal to a blank.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That God alwaies hath inſtituted
ſome Ordinances both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſubjects whereof have been meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
God to declare his grace, will prevent poor
creatures before they are able to know him, hath
inſtituted ſome Ordinances, the ſubjects whereof
have been meerly paſſive.</p>
               <p>What did the children of old underſtand of
<hi>Circumciſion?</hi> They were meerly paſſive, and yet
that Ordinance I hope was not in vain, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be more ſuitable to God's grace now under
the Goſpel, to have an Ordinance the ſubjects
whereof ſhould be meerly paſſive, it declareth the
grace of God, that he ſpeaketh ſo to them before
they have any knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it is ſaid,</hi> It is the ſetting of a Seal
to a Blank.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, If God hath put in the names of the
children of Believers into the ſame Covenant
with their parents, if their names ſhall be found
written in the Covenant,, why then to ſet to the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43429:180"/>
Seal, will be no ſetting a Seal to a Blank; but their
names were written and put into the Covenant
when made with <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and
the God of thy ſeed;</hi> and we no where read that
their names were blotted out; nay, we rather
finde them renewed, <hi>Acts 2. 39. For the promiſe
is to you, and to your ſeed:</hi> and therefore let none
ſay, that it is ſetting a Seal to a Blank, if God hath
written the names of children in the Covenant.
Indeed I know it is very dangerous to miſapply
an Ordinance of Chriſt to wrong ſubjects, it is a
giving holy things to dogs; but take heed that
we do not call dogs where the Lord doth not call
ſo; and take heed that we do not blot out thoſe
names that the Lord hath put into the Covenant.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will ſay further by way of
Objection.</p>
               <p>If children belong to the Covenant of God,
and the Covenant that the children of believing
Parents is under is a Covenant of grace; of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
they muſt be ſaved: Shall they be under a
Covenant of grace, and not be ſaved?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Some may be under a Covenant of
grace, and not ſaved; I ſay viſibly, in reſpect of
the outward diſpenſation, they may be under the
Covenant of grace, and yet never attaine to life
and ſalvation; for when as we do Baptize thoſe
who do make a profeſſion of their faith, ſurely we
look upon them as Believers, and ſuch as are in
Covenant with God, and therefore we Baptize
them, becauſe believers, and ſo in Covenant with
God.</p>
               <p>But now, is it not poſſible, nay is it not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43429:180"/>
for many who make ſuch a profeſſion of Chriſt,
and are baptized upon that profeſſion, to fall off,
and to come ſhort of life and ſalvation? And yet
I hope you will ſay the Ordinance was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
adminiſtred, though they that did make
a profeſſion do fall off; ſo though all children of
believing parents do not attain to eternal life, yet
the Ordinance is no more unduly adminiſtred to
them then to others, for both Profeſſors and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
may be under the outward adminiſtration of
the Covenant, which being may give right to an
outward Ordinance, and yet not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, How ſhall we judge
of any but by their profeſſion that they make
of Chriſt; we cannot own any but ſuch as make
a profeſſion, and children cannot make a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, We muſt judge as God judgeth, and
own as God owns; take heed that we do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
what God owns; and if God will own the
children of believing parents viſibly, and put them
under an outward adminiſtration of the Covenant,
ſurely there is no danger of owning where God
owns; God's owning is a ſurer ground for us to
go upon, then any man's profeſſion: Now God
ſeems to own the ſeed of believers by his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promiſe: Nay, let it be conſidered, thoſe
Propheſies that ſpeak of the latter dayes, and of
the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhall
be in thoſe dayes, they ſpeak of this, that God
will then more abundantly and viſibly own the
ſeed of his people; God will own them, and God
will bleſs them, <hi>Iſa. 65. 23. They ſhall not labour
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43429:181"/>
in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are
the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
with them.</hi> When the Jews ſhall come in,
they ſhall be called <hi>the bleſſed of the Lord, and
their off-ſpring with them;</hi> their ſeed ſhall be
bleſſed according to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, when
they ſhall come in again.</p>
               <p>I know there are many gracious hearts that
cannot believe this truth, and will not, till Chriſt
comes to reveal it; but if the Lord hath handed
in any beam of light, ſhut it not out; This have
I ſpoken, becauſe it is in my way to ſhew you who
are children.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place,<note place="margin">Who are Dogs.</note> 
                  <hi>Who are Dogs?</hi> You
ſee who are to be accounted <hi>children: who are
Dogs?</hi> That muſt be opened too, and let it not
be offenſive, becauſe it is in the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Dogs</hi> in Scripture are taken ſomtimes
for all the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all the people
of the world (except the ſeed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> were
called Dogs, they were without the Covenant,
<hi>ſtrangers to the Commonwealth of Iſrael;</hi> all, we
and our fathers, all the Nations of the Gentiles;
time was that the Jewes only were the children,
and we and all Nations were called <hi>Dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, All <hi>wicked men</hi> in Scriptute
phraſe they are called <hi>Dogs;</hi> The Scripture doth
brand ſome ſort of wicked men, and ſome degrees
of wicked perſons by this name; In eſpecial manner
the Lord looks upon ſome wicked men as dogs.</p>
               <p>Who are they?</p>

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43429:181"/>
vile, and prophane, <hi>Rev. 22. 15. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

thoſe dogs are that are <hi>without,</hi> that ſhall be ſhut

are called <hi>dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, ſuch as do oppoſe the Goſpel of
Chriſt, ſuch as do reject the Goſpel, and oppoſe
the Truths of the Goſpel; ſuch as come to hear
for that end, that they may ſnarl againſt the word;
the Spirit of the Lord calls them <hi>dogs; Phil. 3. 2.
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They who do reject thoſe wholſome
reproofs, and counſels, and exhortations that the
Lord ſends them by any of his ſervants; ſuch as
ſcorn reproof, and hate reproof, that are ready to

when they do wickedly; What have you to do

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, Perſecuters of Chriſt, of his Truth and
people, they are called <hi>dogs;</hi> ſuch as do not only
bark againſt Chriſt, but even <hi>bite</hi> and <hi>rend his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
Why, the Lord looks upon them as vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they are dogs in God's account, what-ever
they are in the worlds; and ſo Chriſt calls them
by <hi>David</hi> his type, <hi>Pſal. 22. 16. for dogs have
compaſſed me, the aſſembly of the wicked have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
me, they pierced my hands and my feet.</hi> Thoſe
bloody perſecuters of Chriſt, that would not be
ſatisfied but with the blood of the Lamb of God,
nothing but the ſhedding of his blood would ſerve
their turn; even as the Blood-Hound that hunts
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:43429:182"/>
the Hind upon the mountain; the Lord calls them
<hi>dogs,</hi> barking dogs, biting dogs have compaſſed
me round about.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, What is the childrens bread that
muſt not be given to dogs?</p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel;</hi>
thoſe ſweet comforts that God hath laid up in the
Promiſes, they are not the portion of wicked
men; <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ſaith your
God, ſpeake ye comfortably to Jeruſalem, and cry
unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her
iniquity is pardoned; Iſa. 40. 1, 2.</hi> God doth
not ſend comfort to wicked men while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſuch; for all the promiſes of the Goſpel,
they are Chriſt's right, and Chriſt's inheritance,
they are Chriſt's portion; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They
are all yea and amen in him;</hi> now therefore they
cannot be applyed to any but to thoſe that have
Intereſt in Chriſt; if promiſes be yea and amen
in Chriſt, they cannot go without Chriſt; he muſt
be thy husband, or elſe thou haſt no right in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But you will ſay then, How ſhall men
come to believe in the promiſes, if they muſt not
be applyed to wicked men? How ſhall they come
to have faith in the promiſe?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, When the Spirit of the Lord doth
perſwade the heart of any ſinner to accept of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, to reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
application: as he is freely tendered in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Goſpel: when this is done, I conceive
that ſoul hath an Intereſt in Chriſt, and then right
to all the promiſes, for every mercy promiſed is to
thoſe that are in Chriſt, and childrens bread is not
to be caſt to dogs.</p>

They that are viſibly ſtrangers, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
unto God, ſtrangers to this Covenant, they
cannot have a right to that Ordinance of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, That Ordinance is a Love-Feaſt, and
the Lord he makes it, to declare that he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to all thoſe his friends whom he invites:
There was a falling out between God and man,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut when it is taken up by Chriſt, God the Father
declares that he is a friend, and therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
believers to ſup with him, which declares
and makes it out to them that he is reconciled, he
makes a feaſt for this end, and therefore called
<hi>the Lords Supper;</hi> they ſhall come and ſit at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with him, that he may declare that he is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled, and bears no old grudge, but hath
forgotten all. Now therefore, they that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that will not be reconciled, but profeſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt the Lord, they cannot have right to
this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Again, It is a ſeal of our Communion with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:43429:184"/>
Chriſt and with the Saints. <hi>The Bread which we
break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi>
And ſo the Wine, it is the Communion of the
blood of Chriſt, the ſigne of it, the ſeal of it, a
ſeal of our Communion with Chriſt; and it is a
ſeal of our communion with the Saints; all that
do partake of it, they proſeſs they are one bread
therefore it is an Ordinance that cannot and may
not be diſpenſed to wicked men.</p>
               <p>Beſides, The Supper of the Lord is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
that is appointed for the increaſe of grace
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is appointed for a Chriſtians growth, therefore
of neceſſity there muſt be life before there can

there can be increaſe of grace; It is true, it
is for the weak as well as the ſtrong; and if there
be any part of ſpiritual life in the ſoul, that ſoul
may receive it in Chriſt's way; but of neceſſity
there muſt be life, or elſe no right to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
for it is appointed for growth in grace, to
make a weak faith ſtrong, and ſo for the increaſe of
every grace.</p>
               <p>I might add, wicked men cannot perform the
actions of the living that God calls for in that
Ordinance, they cannot eat and drink ſpiritually,
they may eat the bread, and drink the wine, but
they cannot eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink the
blood of Chriſt; if a wicked man, he cannot eat
ſpiritually, and ſo he prophaneth the Ordinance,
the Body of Chriſt and the Blood of Chriſt he
becomes guilty of it, and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He
eateth his own damnation, if he cannot diſcern
the Lord's body,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 29.) and eat

of the Gentiles: Time was when we were
dogs; and that the Lord ſhould make them to be
children that were dogs, ſet them at his Table
that were caſt out, and give them childrens bread,
that had not right, no not to the crumbs! O the
free grace of God, let us admire it, and let us
debaſe our ſelves, and lie low before the Lord,
and ſay, O! What am I poor dead dog, that I
ſhould ſit at Table with the King, and that the
King ſhould own me? No cauſe of being lifted
up, but cauſe of lying low; for who are we poor
dead dogs, that the Lord ſhould make us chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and beſtow the portion of children upon us,
giving unto us childrens bread!</p>
               <p>And to ſhut up all;</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words that I have read, we have
the carriage and the behaviour of this
woman under thoſe <hi>Tryals</hi> or <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which ſhe met withal; her carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is very gracious, it is ſuch as doth diſcover</p>
               <p>Firſt, A depth of <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A height of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She diſcovers firſt of all, A depth of <hi>Humility.</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt he had called her dog; he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
others before her; he had told her, it was
not meet to take the childrens bread and give it
to ſuch as ſhe was: Now ſhe doth acknowledge
all this, nay ſhe doth not only acknowledge it,
but ſhe ſubmitted unto it, nay ſhe confirms it:
<hi>Truth Lord;</hi> Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>It was not meet to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43429:188"/>
take the childrens bread and caſt it to dogs: Truth
Lord;</hi> What-ever thou haſt ſpoken, Lord, is true:
Thou haſt ſaid that I am a dog, <hi>Truth Lord;</hi> Thou
haſt ſaid the Jews are children, <hi>Truth Lord;</hi> Thou
haſt ſaid it is not meet to beſtow childrens bread
upon dogs, <hi>Truth Lord; yet the dogs eat of the
crumbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as we have a diſcovery of her Humility, ſo
of her <hi>Faith;</hi> her condition was low, but her
faith was high; ſtrong, and glorious.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, By Faith ſhe doth anſwer the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
ſhe findes out the ſtrength of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſcope of it where it lay, and the Spirit of
the Lord doth unfold and reſolve the difficulty.
Chriſt had ſaid the Jews were the children, and
'twas not meet to give the childrens bread to
dogs; there is the temptation: She anſwers, <hi>Truth
Lord, yet the dogs cat of the crumbs.</hi> It diſcovers
thus much, Although the Jews are the children,
and they muſt be ſerved firſt, it is fit that they
ſhould have the firſt offer of mercy, it is fit that
they ſhould have whole loaves ſet upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and full diſhes, yet the Jews are not ſo the
children, that all others are excluded, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
are not altogether excluded from mercy, the
Gentiles may have the crums, eſpecially when the
children grow wanton, and caſt away their bread,
the Gentiles (though dogs) may have that which
fall from their Table. Thus by faith ſhe doth
finde out the force of the temptation, and is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to make an anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſtrength of her faith doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this, that ſhe doth not only anſwer the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:43429:188"/>
temptation, but ſhe gains advantage by it, her
faith is ſtrengthened, and riſeth higher, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſtronger; and that which was matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
in it ſelf, it is matter of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ſtrength unto her; Chriſt had ſaid ſhe
was a dog, this is an encouragement to her, Lord,
thou haſt ſaid that I am a dog, and if I be a dog, I
am thy dog, thou art my maſter, and therefore
ſurely the crumbs that fall from my maſters table
do belong to me; in all Nations, among all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
maſters table; Lord, thou haſt ſaid that I am a
dog, but I will lie at thy feet, and wait upon thee
for crums of mercy that fall from thee. Thus her
faith is ſtrengthened by that temptation, which in
it ſelf did tend to drive her from Chriſt; that
temptation that would have driven her from
Chriſt, makes her run to Chriſt; ſhe is called
dog, and ſhe waits under the Maſter's table for
crumbs of mercy. Thus you ſee the carriage of
this woman under the temptation, ſhe carries it
very humbly, and with a great deal of faith and
holy confidence in the midſt of theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>There are divers uſeful truths in theſe words, I
ſhall now cloſe with one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth Lord,</hi> (ſaith ſhe.)</p>
               <p>From whence Obſerve,
That the ſoul that is graciouſly and truly humbled
before the Lord, will juſtifie the Lord in all
that he ſpeaks and doth againſt it.</p>

                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:43429:189"/>
What-ever the Lord ſhall ſay, whether it be in
a way of diſcovery of ſin, vileneſs, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Or ſecondly, whether it be a word of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
In both theſe, that heart that is truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
it will juſtifie the Lord. When God ſpeaks
himſelf, and gives rebukes from himſelf, or when
God makes uſe of men to be inſtruments in his
hand, ſtill a gracious heart that is truly humbled,
in all it meeteth withal it will juſtifie the Lord,
and ſay, <hi>Truth Lord;</hi> the Lord is true, and the
Lord is righteous in what he ſpeaks and doth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When God comes and ſpeaks in a way
of diſcovery of ſin, when the Lord by his Spirit
in his Word doth come and rip open a mans heart
as it were, diſcovers its vileneſs to him, ſhews
him what a wretched, ſinful, polluted creture he
is; or when the Lord ſhall come and charge any
particular ſin upon a man that he hath committed,
ſet his actual ſin in order before him; when <hi>God
ſhall binde with the cords of affliction,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks,
and then <hi>diſcover a mans tranſgreſſion;</hi> if the ſoul
be truly humbled, it will ſay, <hi>truth Lord;</hi> I am
indeed as vile and as wretched, and as ſinful, nay
worſe then I can be charged with. When God
came to make a diſcovery to <hi>Job</hi> of his own heart,
in the 38, 39, and 40 chapters, God took much
pains to diſcover <hi>Job</hi> to himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> had ſtood too
much upon his integrity, upon his righteouſneſs,
he had not all along juſtified the Lord in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
but when God came to make a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to him, and ſhew him what a poor, vile, frail
worm he was, and ript open his heart, and ſhewed
him his corruption, <hi>Job</hi> then falls down, and cries,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43429:189"/>
                  <hi>truth Lord,</hi> Job 40. 3, 4. <hi>Then Job anſwered the
Lord, and ſaid, Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thee? I will lay may hand upon my mouth.</hi>
verſ. <hi>5. Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer:
yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> Behold I
am vile, as vile as thou haſt diſcovered to me,
Lord, I ſee it, and therefore I will ſtand no more
upon my own juſtification, but I will juſtifie thee;
and truly ſo it is with every ſoul that is truly
humbled, when God comes and makes a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of its corrupt nature and life, and chargeth
ſin upon him, it is ſo and ſo aggravated, thou haſt
ſinned againſt light, againſt knowledge, againſt
mercy and goodneſs; <hi>truth Lord,</hi> all is true, ſaith
the gracious heart; yea, not only when God
ſpeaks in the way of diſcovery of ſin, the ſoul that
is humble will cry <hi>truth Lord,</hi> and juſtifie the
Lord.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Even then when the Lord ſpeaks
very ſharply in a way of <hi>threatening,</hi> the ſoul that is
truly humble, it will juſtifie the Lord; <hi>Pſal. 51.
4. Againſt thee only have I ſinned, and done this
evil in thy ſight; that thou mighteſt be juſtified
when thou ſpeakeſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt.</hi>
Here <hi>David</hi> he will juſtifie the Lord in all that he

have penned this Pſalm, that I might clear thee
before all the world, that I might juſtifie God,
what. ever God ſhould do againſt <hi>David,</hi> or ſpeak
againſt <hi>David.</hi> I will ſay, Lord, thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
He would juſtifie God in all that God had
ſpoken againſt him; and yet God ſpake terrible
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:43429:190"/>
things againſt <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet,
<hi>2 Sam. 12. 10, 11, 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 10.</hi> Now therefore the ſword ſhall never
depart from thine houſe, becauſe thou haſt deſpiſed
me, and haſt taken the wife of ſriah the Hittite to
be thy wife. <hi>Verſe 11.</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I will raiſe up evil againſt thee out of thine own
houſe, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes,
and give them unto thy Neighbour, and he ſhall lie
with thy wives in the ſight of this Sun. <hi>Verſe 12.</hi>
For thou didſt it ſecretly, but I will do this thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Iſrael, and before the Sun.</p>
               <p>See here what terrible things God threatens
he threatens that the ſword ſhould never depart
from his houſe; That he would raiſe up evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him out of his own houſe, a terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
Nay, God threatens that he would give his
wives to his Neighbours, that ſhould defile them
before his face; a terrible threatening: Nay, God
tells him that this ſhould be done before all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and in the face of the Sun: And yet Lord, I
will clear thee when thou judgeſt, and juſtifie
thee when thou ſpeakeſt.</p>
               <p>Take another inſtance in old <hi>Eli,</hi> and you ſhall
ſee how he juſtified the Lord when the Lord
ſpake againſt him; <hi>1 Sam. 3. 18.</hi> at verſe <hi>11.
Behold I will do a thing in Iſrael, at which both the
ears of every one that heareth it, ſhall tingle;</hi> and
at verſe 14. <hi>I have ſworn unto the houſe of Eli,
that the iniquity of Elies houſe ſhall not be purged
with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever:</hi> Now all this
was told <hi>Eli</hi> at verſe 18. <hi>And Samuel told him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whit, and hid nothing from him:</hi> And he ſaid,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:43429:190"/>
                  <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
And ſo <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> take that inſtance, and ſee how
he juſtified the Lord, when the Lord ſpake ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
againſt him, <hi>2 Kings 20. 19.</hi> at verſ. 17, 18.
God threatens <hi>Hezekiah</hi> becauſe he boaſted of
his treaſure, and ſhews it to the Ambaſſadors of
the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> verſe 17. <hi>Behold the dayes
come, that all that is in thine houſe, and that which
thy fathers have laid up in ſtore to this day, ſhall be
carried unto Babylon, nothing ſhall be left, ſaith the
Lord.</hi> Verſe 18. <hi>And of thy ſons that ſhall
iſſue from thee, which thou ſhalt beget, ſhall they
take away, and they ſhall be Eunuchs in the Palace
of the King of Babylon.</hi> A hard leſſon, and yet
he juſtifies the Lord; Verſe 19. <hi>Then ſaid He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah
unto Iſaiah, Good is the word of the Lord
which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> So that you ſee that a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart that is truly humbled before the Lord,
it will juſtifie the Lord in all that he ſpeaks againſt
it; when he diſcovers ſin, or threatens puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſtill he will juſtifie the Lord; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
juſtifie the Lord in what he hath ſpoken, but he
will juſtifie the Lord in what he ſhall ſpeak; if
God ſhould ſpeak ſeven times worſe, ſtill a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart that is truly humble, reſolves to juſtifie
the Lord, <hi>2 Sam. 15. 26.</hi> ſaith <hi>David, But if he
thus ſay, I have no delight in thee; Behold, here
am I; let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
He did not only juſtifie the Lord in what he had
ſpoken; but in what the Lord ſhould ſay; if the
Lord ſhould ſay, I will uſe <hi>David</hi> no more, nor
bring <hi>David</hi> back no more to his Throne, <hi>David</hi>
in that juſtifieth God, and ſubmits to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:43429:191"/>
But ſecondly, A gracious heart that is truly
humbled, deſires to juſtifie God in his <hi>Actings;</hi>
when God ſhall <hi>act againſt him,</hi> as well as ſpeak
againſt him, it will juſtifie the Lord; if the Lord
ſhall prefer others before him, in this he will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the Lord. Inſtance in this woman of Canaan,
the Jewes (the children) they muſt have whole
loaves, and full diſhes, and they muſt be preferr'd
before her, yet ſhe juſtifies the Lord, and ſays,
<hi>Truth Lord.</hi> But I ſhall make it out to you in
divers particulars, that you may ſee how a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
heart that is truly humbled, will juſtifie the
Lord in his actings.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, If the Lord ſhall manifeſt more
love, more grace, more favour unto others, then
to it ſelf, though there be nothing in all the
world that it longeth more after then after the
enjoyment of the preſence of God, yet if the
Lord ſhall be pleaſed to diſcover more of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and give out more clear, full intimations of
his love and grace to others then to it ſelf, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to juſtifie the Lord. Chriſt (as I ſaid) he will
deal with the Jews as with children, give them
whole loaves, and full diſhes, this woman ſhe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies
the Lord; and if the Lord will give more
tokens of acceptance to others then to it ſelf, ſtill
it deſires to juſtifie the Lord: The heart that is
unſound cannot do this, nothing is more hard to
bear, that the Lord ſhould ſhew more favour to
others then to them; ſo it was with <hi>Cain,</hi> the
Lord ſhewed more favour to <hi>Abel</hi> his brother,
then to him, God gave him a token of his acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance,
<hi>Cain</hi> could not bear it; and ſo the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal's</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:43429:191"/>
eldeſt brother; the father ſhews a great
deal of love to the returning <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and the
eldeſt brother could not bear it; <hi>I have ſerved
thee all my dayes, and thou haſt not dealt ſo with
me; thou haſt not killed the fatted calf for me.</hi> But
the ſoul that is truly humble, it will juſtifie the
Lord in this, if the Lord gives our clearer mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations
of his love to others then to him, it will
ſay the Lord is righteous, and doth me no wrong;
the Lord is a free Agent; free grace, it is his
commodity, and he may beſtow it where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth;
and I have received more from the Lord
then I have improved, I have had more then I
have been thankful for, more then I have uſed for
the Lord's honour; I have ſinned ſo and ſo after
mercy, and it is a wonder that I have not ſinned
away all my comforts. Thus a ſoul that is truly
humbled, will juſtifie the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the Lord gives out a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſpiritual gifts to others, the ſoul that is
truly humbled it will juſtifie the Lord in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
it deſires to ſay, as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> John
3. 30. <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is my joy fulfilled; it deſires to rejoyce in
this, that the Lord may have any honour by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
though it look upon himſelf, and ſee it is a
barren wilderneſs; others, green trees, ſee others
flouriſhing like the Palm tree, and bring forth
much fruit; although a gracious heart ſees cauſe
to be humbled, and judge it ſelf for not following
on to know the Lord, for its not following on to
wait upon the Lord for ſuch enjoyments, yet it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
deſires to juſtifie the Lord; not to complain if
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:43429:192"/>
the Lord ſhall give out more to others then to
him; it knows in this alſo the Lord is a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and he may diſpoſe of his gifts, where, and
to whom he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Lord ſhould give out a greater
ſhare of temporal mercies to others then to him,
a greater eſtate, more riches, more honour, more
friends and relations, ſtill a ſoul that is truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
it will juſtifie the Lord in this diſpenſation:
it will ſay, I have received more then I am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, I am leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercies;
I have more then I have uſed for Gods honour,
this is the portion that the Lord ſees good for me;
the Lord ſees what a naughty heart I have, I am
enſnared with that little that I have, it is a ſnare to
me; therefore ſurely the Lord in mercy hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
much to me, leſt my heart ſhould be enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and therefore in this diſpenſation it will alſo
juſtifie the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the Lord ſhould lay greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon him then upon others; in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
the ſoul that is truly humbled will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the Lord. So it was with <hi>Job; Job</hi> he was
greatly afflicted, not any man living met with ſo
much as <hi>Job</hi> did, yet in <hi>Job 1. 20, 21.</hi> He falls
down and juſtifies the Lord; <hi>Then Job aroſe, and
rent his mantle, and ſhaved his head, and fell down
on the ground, and worſhipped; and ſaid, Naked
came I out of my mothers womb, and naked ſhall I
return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath
taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord:</hi> See
here what arguments he findes to clear the Lord
in this diſpenſation; though his affliction was very
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:43429:192"/>
great, he falls down and bleſſeth the Lord, and at
<hi>v. 22.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
God fooliſhly.</hi> And ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt,
when the Lord ſmote his two ſons that they died,
it is ſaid, <hi>Aaron held his peace,</hi> Lev. 10. 1, 2, 3.
<hi>And Nada<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u the ſons of Aaron, took
eit of them his Cenſor, and put fire therein, and put
Incenſe thereon, and offered ſtrange fire before the
Lord, which he commanded them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 2.</hi> And there went out fire from the Lord,
and devoured them, that they died before the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 3.</hi> Then Moſes ſaid unto Aaron, This is
that the Lord ſpake, ſaying, I will be ſanctified in
them that come nigh me, and before all the people I
will be glorified; And Aaron held his peace.</p>
               <p>He ſpake not one word againſt the Lord, but
was ſilent, and juſtified the Lord. And ſo <hi>David</hi>
in <hi>Pſal. 39.</hi> when there was ſome ſore hand of
God upon him, ſo that he cryed out, I am conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by thy rebukes, ſome affliction that did even
eat him up and conſume him, yet he juſtified the
Lord, <hi>verſe. 9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth,
becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Micah 7. 9. I will
bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt him.</hi> A ſoul truly humbled will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Lord, even then when he layes greater
ſtrokes of affliction upon him then upon others.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The ſoul that is truly humbled, it will
juſtifie the Lord when the Lord ſeems to ſhut
out his prayer; it calls, and cries, and waits, and
yet the Lord gives out no anſwer. O! how hard
a matter is it for an unhumbled heart to bear this?
<hi>Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt

not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou
takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Iſa. 58. 3. An hypocrite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear this; if God give not a preſent anſwer,
it will wait no longer: But now a gracious heart,
that is truly humbled, it will wait upon the Lord,
though the Lord gives not out a preſent anſwer;
yea, it will ſtudy anſwers to clear the Lord; the
Lord is righteous, and it is for gracious ends that
the Lord defers to hear; or, the mercy is not
ripe, or I am not fit for the mercy, it is mercy that
I may wait upon God, mercy that I have ſuch a
God to wait upon; the Lord might have cut off
my life, and my hopes, and my waiting; and
therefore ſtill the Lord is gracious, in that I have
opportunity to wait upon him. Thus a ſoul truly
humbled, will juſtifie the Lord, when the Lord
ſeems to ſhut out his prayer.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſly, The ſoul that is truly humbled,
will juſtifie the Lord, when the Lord ſhall lay
him aſide as one that is uſeleſs, when the Lord
ſhall make no more uſe of him in his work and
ſervice, but ſhall take him off from the work of
the Lord. God ſomtimes deals ſo with his own
people; yet if the ſoul be truly humbled, it will
juſtifie the Lord in this alſo; it is a hard matter
to ſubmit unto it, but when the heart is put into
a right humble frame, it will ſubmit and juſtifie
the Lord: And ſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord, God told them that he would
lay them aſide, God calls to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and
tells <hi>Aaron</hi> that he muſt be high Prieſt no longer,
commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtrip <hi>Aaron</hi> of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to put them upon another before his
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:43429:193"/>
face, and bids him go to ſuch a place and die; and
<hi>Aaron</hi> was obedient to the word of the Lord,
<hi>Numb. 20. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28.</hi> And ſo <hi>Moſes,</hi>
when his work was at an end, God tells him that
he muſt not carry the children of Iſrael into the
land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but he muſt go up to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and die: He ſubmits to the Lord, <hi>Deut. 32.
49, 50.</hi> and <hi>Deut. 34. 5.</hi> And thus you ſee, a heart
that is truly humbled, it will juſtifie the Lord both
in his ſayings and doings; when God ſhall ſpeak
againſt him, and diſcover his vileneſs and ſin, it
will ſay, <hi>Truth Lord;</hi> or when God ſhall threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
moſt ſeverely, nay when God ſhall walk in
thoſe ways that are hard to bear, yet a ſoul that is
truly humbled, deſires to ſubmit to the Lord, and
to juſtifie the Lord.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, When God ſhall not only ſpeak
himſelf, but when God ſhall make uſe of men, yea
wicked men, and ſhall ſet them to ſpeak againſt
it; when God ſhall ſet them to revile, and ſet
them to act againſt it, to perſecute it; the ſoul
that is truly humbled, it will juſtifie the Lord in
that diſpenſation; ſo did <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 7, 8.
<hi>And thus ſaid Shimei wheu he curſed, Come out,
come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial;
the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the
houſe of Saul, in whoſe ſtead thou haſt reigned, and
the Lord hath delivered the Kingdom into the hand
of Abſalom thy ſon; and behold thou art taken to
thy miſchief, becauſe thou art a bloody man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shimei</hi> he came and railed againſt <hi>David,</hi> it
was a great indignity that was done againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
by that railing wretch, <hi>and he took up ſtones,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43429:194"/>
and caſt at the King,</hi> at <hi>verſe 6.</hi> and it was, when
<hi>David was in diſtreſs, he was driven out by Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom
from Jeruſalem;</hi> he takes that advantage, he
comes and rails, and calls him the <hi>bloody man,</hi> and
ſaith he, <hi>the Lord hath now avenged the blood of
thy maſters houſe upon thee;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> at this time
juſtifies the Lord, <hi>verſe 10. So let him curſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord hath ſaid unto him, Curſe David;
who ſhall then ſay, Wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi>
See here how <hi>David</hi> juſtifies the Lord; though
that which this raiſing man did object againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was falſe, he calls him a bloody man in reſpect
of <hi>Saul</hi>'s houſe; <hi>David</hi> was clear in that, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
yet <hi>David</hi> he layes it to heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that God had ſome deſigne in it; though
in reſpect of <hi>Saul</hi>'s houſe I am not a bloody man,
yet I ſhed the blood of <hi>Vriah. David</hi> he is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
the Lord hath bid him curſe <hi>David;</hi> and
therefore <hi>David</hi> uſeth many arguments for to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the Lord, and to quiet his own ſpirit, and the
ſpirit of others, as you may ſee <hi>verſ. 11, 12. And
David ſaid to Abiſhai, and to all his ſervants; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
my Son which came forth of my bowels, ſeeketh
my life; how much more now may this Btnj amite
do it? Let him alone, and let him curſe, for the Lord
hath bidden him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 12. <hi>It may be the Lord will look on mine
affliction, and that the Lord will requite good for his
curſing this day:</hi> And ſo <hi>David</hi> in patience doth
poſſeſs his ſoul, and juſtifie the Lord in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
               <p>A word or two of Application, and ſo I ſhall
conclude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:43429:194"/>
Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> This calls upon us to be more in
the practiſe of this duty; O that the Lord would
help all his people to learn this leſſon! It is a
hard leſſon, we had need look up to the Lord,
that he would teach us to juſtifie the Lord when
he ſpeaks and acts againſt us; when he ſpeaks
himſelf, or when he ſuffers men to ſpeak againſt
us: It is our duty (as you have heard) to juſtifie
the Lord, as this woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, and as
thoſe in <hi>Micah 7.</hi> did, <hi>I will bear the indignation
of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him:</hi>
O that we could make thoſe holy men our pattern
that we heard ſpoken of before! Look upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
upon <hi>Job,</hi> upon good old <hi>Eli,</hi> upon this <hi>Woman
of Canaan,</hi> O! How did they juſtifie the Lord,
when the Lord ſpake hard things, and ſtretched
out his hand in a way of ſore affliction? Still we
finde them juſtifying the Lord, and O that we
could look upon them as our pattern!</p>
               <p>To perſwade us to this Duty,<note place="margin">Motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to the duty of Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord.</note> Firſt of all, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
That <hi>it is the Lord;</hi> It is the Lord that
ſpeaks, it is the Lord that acts; when-ever there
is any affliction upon us, it is of the Lord; and
if it be of the Lord, and from the Lord, why ſhould
we not juſtifie him? That was a prevailing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with good old <hi>Eli,</hi> when as thoſe terrible
threatnings came to his ear, That God would do
that againſt his Houſe, <hi>at which both the Eares of
every one that heard it, ſhould tingle; and that
the iniquity of Eli's Houſe, ſhould not be purged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with ſacrifice, nor offering for ever: It is the
Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:43429:195"/>
He hath power over all creatures, as the Potter
hath power over the clay; and ſaith <hi>David, I
was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou
didst it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly Conſider, That all that God ſpeaks
and doth <hi>is God;</hi> and if ſo, Why ſhould we not
juſtifie the Lord? You know what <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
ſaid, <hi>2 Kings 20. 19. Good is the Word of the
Lord:</hi> A hard word it was, that all his Treaſure
ſhould be carried unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his Sons alſo,
and made ſervants there, and yet he ſath, <hi>good
is the Word of the Lord.</hi> What-ever God doth,
is good; though it may ſeem to be never ſo hard,
yet there is ſome good in all that he ſpeaks and
doth; and the Lord doth it for good, <hi>Doth not
thy Word do good?</hi> Every word of the Lord is
good, and doth good to them that are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
though it be a hard word; yet all God's
words, and all God's wayes ſhall work together
for good; he will bring good out of them, if the
heart be ſubmitting to God, and juſtifying the
Lord in that diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, That <hi>there is mercy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diſpenſation;</hi> and that God doth afflict leſs
then the ſin deſerveth: Though the affliction may
ſeem to be hard, truly if we look into our own
hearts and wayes, we might ſee that there is that
which might provoke the Lord to afflict ſeven
times more. The Church in the <hi>Lamentations,</hi>
when ſhe came to conſider how ſhe had provoked
the Lord, though before ſhe had cryed out bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
of her Wormwood and Gall, yet in <hi>Lam.
3. 22. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:43429:195"/>
conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> We
have provoked the Lord greatly, and it is mercy
that we are not conſumed, mercy that we are out
of hell, and therefore good cauſe that we ſhould
juſtifie the Lord.</p>
               <p>Yea, and let us juſtifie the Lord when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
men to ſpeak againſt us: O! This is a hard
leſſon to fleſh and blood; but know it is a duty
that God calls for, when men do revile, and ſpeak
evil, and do accuſe us ſo and ſo, ſtill it is our
work to juſtifie the Lord; Look back to that pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Shimei,</hi> and let us
make it our pattern, when-ever we meet with
revilings and hard ſayings from men; he juſtified
the Lord, though it was falſe that which <hi>Shimei</hi>
did accuſe him of; <hi>That he was a bloody man in
reſpect of Saul's Houſe,</hi> yet he juſtified the Lord;
the Lord ſees that I am a bloody man, though not
in that particular; and therefore ſaith he, <hi>The
Lord hath bidden him.</hi> Either thou art guilty or
not guilty, when God ſuffers men to revile, and
ſpeak evil, and to faſten ſuch accuſations upon
thee; if thou art guilty, it is thy duty to make
uſe of it by whomſoever God ſhall diſcover it;
make uſe of that which comes out of the enemies
mouth, to finde out the evil that is in our own
hearts: But if thou art clear, and not guilty of
that which thou art accuſed of, yet in reſpect of
the Lord, there is cauſe of juſtifying the Lord: So
<hi>David,</hi> though he was not guilty in that reſpect
that <hi>Shimei</hi> ſaid he was guilty, yet ſaith he, it is
juſt with the Lord, and it is a righteous thing that
I ſhould be thus accuſed by <hi>Shimei.</hi> And for the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:43429:196"/>
quieting of thy ſpirit, uſe thoſe Arguments that
<hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Behold, the Son out of my Bowels ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
up againſt me, and therefore ſhall I think it a
great matter for a ſtranger to do it?</hi> So let us ſay,
behold, here is that which riſeth up in mine own
heart, the corruptions in mine own boſome, that
doth me many an ill turn, ſhall I think much that
ſtrangers do accuſe me? And conſider alſo that
which <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord doth hear the curſes
of Shimei, and will do me good by it:</hi> And ſo, if
thou canſt approve thy heart to God, and art not
guilty of what men do accuſe thee of, and that
thou canſt ſay, it is falſe in reſpect of man, but in
reſpect of God, thou ſayeſt, <hi>Truth Lord,</hi> Know
that the Lord he can do thee good by it, and that
he will turn thoſe very curſes of men to thy
good.</p>
               <p>Again, One word of Uſe more, and ſo I ſhall
conclude.</p>
               <p>Look up to the Lord for this grace of <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
O! What cauſe have we to give up our hearts
into God's hand, that he may make us truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Surely we ſhall never be able to juſtifie the
Lord, if the heart be not laid low, and made tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humble. The Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> he had humbled this
woman, he had laid her very low, he had ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
her affliction to humble her, ſhe had met
with great afflictions, her daughter was vexed
with a dvvil, the Lord ſanctified that affliction to
humble her: And ſhe alſo met with great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
<hi>three ſore Temptations</hi> we read of; and
the Lord alſo ſanctified thoſe temptations to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her: And ſhe had alſo met with diſcoveries
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:43429:196"/>
of grace and love, the Lord revealed himſelf very
gloriouſly to her faith, or elſe ſhe could never
have held out, the Lord alſo ſanctified thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
to humble her, and lay her low. Truly
if this woman had not had a humble heart, ſhe
could never have carried it ſo in the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and in the time of this temptation, but ſhe
would have flown in the face of Chriſt: Chriſt
calls her dog, and tells her, That <hi>it is not meet
to take the childrens bread, and give it to dogs:</hi> if
her heart had not been humble, ſhe would have
diſcovered her ſelf to have been a dog, ſhe would
have barked againſt him; but ſhe carried it very
graciouſly, and in all that Chriſt ſpake, juſtified
him, <hi>Truth Lord.</hi> O that we might go to the
Lord, and beg of God, that he would give out
more of this grace of humility to us! A proud
heart will never juſtifie God when he ſpeaks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or when he ſuffers men to ſpeak; a proud
heart will never take a repulſe from God, nor
reproofs from men: O! There is need of the
grace of humility that will enable a ſoul to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Lord in what-ever he ſhall ſpeak, and
in what-ever he ſhall do. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but he giveth grace to
the humble:</hi> He gives this grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that they ſhall carry it graciouſly when the
Lord ſpeaks againſt them, when the Lord ſhall
make a diſcovery of their hearts to them, of
their Corruptions to them, of the deſerving
of their Tranſgreſſions to them, they ſhall
juſtifie the Lord, and ſay, <hi>Truth Lord,</hi> all is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:43429:197"/>
true. And when God ſhall ſuffer men to ſpeak
againſt them, the Lord gives grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
they ſhall have this grace, made able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Lord.</p>
               <p>And truly, When the ſoul is brought into
this poſture, when the ſoul is thus truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
before the Lord, and can juſtifie the Lord
when the Lord ſpeaks, it is not far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance:
Salvation is nigh, Deliverance is
at hand, the time of God's Controverſie is at
an end. When God hath thus humbled the
ſoul under his mighty hand, and made it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to lye low, and to juſtifie the Lord in
all that he ſpeakes and doth; ſurely the time
of refreſhment from the preſence of the Lord is
not far off.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he lay low before the
Lord; there were diſcoveries of the glorious
Majeſty of the Lord made to him, at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the firſt Chapter; As, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Bowe that is in the Cloud in the
day of Raine, ſo was the appearance of the
brightneſs round about, this was the appearance of
the likeneſſe of the Glory of the Lord: and <hi>when
I ſaw it, I fell upon my face:</hi> See here, he
lay low before the Lord; and in <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> and
<hi>Verſe 2.</hi> What is ſaid? <hi>And the Spirit entred
into me when he ſpake unto me, and ſet me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly Brethren, When the Lord giveth
out ſuch a frame of ſpirit, that the heart is
made ſo humble as to lie low before the Lord,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:43429:197"/>
and to juſtifie the Lord in what he ſpeakes and
doth, the Spirit of the Lord is not far, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not far off. As the Spirit did enter
into <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſet him upon his feet, ſo
the Spirit of the Lord will come into that ſoul,
and fill it with joy and refreſhment from the
Lord's preſence.</p>

inſomuch as you think it would rain no more,
the clouds return again; and ſo in old Age, the
clouds will return again and again upon thee, there
is a cloudy day a coming, and a dark day in old
age, when thou canſt not ſee to do thy work, and
therefore <hi>Now</hi> Remember thy Creator.</p>
               <p>And there is another evil day that he ſpeaks of
in verſe 7. and that is, <hi>the day of death. Then ſhal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the duſt return to the earth, as it was; and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhall return unto God, who gave it.</hi> Therefore
conſidering all this, I counſel thee to remember
thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition or Doctrine then is this:
That it is the duty of all the children of men,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> to
ſeek after God in the day of youth.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Scripture takes notice of ſome
of the ſervants of God, and ſets them forth as
patterns and examples, that every man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God in the dayes of his youth. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
takes notice of ſome good thing that was
found in <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> childe, <hi>1 Kings 14. 12, 13.
Ariſe thou therefore, get thee to thine own houſe, and
when thy feet enter into the City, the child ſhall
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:43429:200"/>
die; And all Iſrael ſhall mourn for him, and bury
him; for he only of Jeroboam ſhall come to the grave,
becauſe in him there is found ſome good thing toward
the Lord God of Iſrael, in the houſe of Jeroboam:</hi>
In all the Family there was but one good childe,
and there is notice taken of him, and the Lord
thought of him in mercy, that he did not ſee the
evil that came upon his fathers houſe: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
takes notice alſo of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in <hi>2 Chron. 34.
3. For in the eighth yeer of his Reigne, while he
was yet young, he began to ſeek after the God of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
his father:</hi> He was but ſixteen yeer old, and
yet then did he ſeek after the God of <hi>David</hi> his
father: And <hi>David</hi> he tells us, <hi>He truſted in God
from his youth,</hi> Pſal. 71. 5. <hi>For thou art my hope
O Lord God, thou art my truſt from my youth.</hi> And
O that young men would look upon theſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns;
wherefore doth God take notice of them,
and wherefore are they recorded in Scripture, but
that young men might make them patterns, and
tread in their ſteps, to Remember their Creator

               <p>Secondly, Shew you what cauſe all men have
to Remember God.</p>

chariots, and ſome in horſes; but we will remember
the name of the Lord our God:</hi> So much faith in
God, ſo much remembrance of God, when God
is not believed on, and when God is diſtruſted,
when any thing beſide God is truſted, then God is
forgotten; And therefore when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Young man, Remember God;</hi> that is, ſeek after

faith in God; let them truſt in God, let them not
truſt in their ſtrength, truſt in their parts, let them
not truſt in their wealth, let them not truſt in their
friends, their fathers to provide for them, no, let
them Remember God, let them put their truſt in
God, for that is a remembring of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To <hi>Remember God,</hi> is to <hi>Love God,</hi>
to prize him, to have a high account of God, to
love him dearly above all things; for when God
is not loved above all things whatſoever, God is
forgotten; <hi>We will remember thy love more then
wine: The upright love thee.</hi> Cant. 1. 4. We will
remember thy love more then wine; that is, our
heart is affected with thy love, our heart is taken
with thy love; we finde more ſweetneſs in the
love of Chriſt, then in the ſweeteſt of creature
comforts; ſo that when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Young man
Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth,
that is, ſet thy affections upon God betimes,
prize him above all thy comforts and enjoyments:
if the heart be not ſet upon God, the Lord is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To <hi>Remember God,</hi> is to <hi>Serve God,</hi>
and to obey God, to walk with him, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him, to honour him, this is a Remembring
of God, <hi>Deut. 8. 11. Beware that thou for get not
the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments,
and his judgements, and his ſtatutes, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
thee this day:</hi> If thou doſt not yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the will of God, thou forgetteſt God;
but to yeild obedience to the Will of God, is to
Remember God: So when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Young
man, Remember God in the dayes of thy youth,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:43429:202"/>
that is, Walk with God, and take heed of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
God, ſinning againſt God; for if thou
ſin againſt God, thou forgetteſt God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be found walking with him, and worſhip the
Lord in truth, for that is a remembring of him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, To <hi>Remember God,</hi> is to <hi>ſpend the thoughts
of the heart upon God;</hi> When a man ſpends many
thoughts upon a perſon, or upon ſuch an object, he
then remembers it; and ſo when the thoughts
of the heart are ſpent upon God, then God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred:
But when God is not thought upon,
but vain thoughts thruſt out the thoughts of God,
there is no remembrance of God; the wicked
they are ſaid <hi>to forget God; God is not in all his
thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. And therefore when <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſaith, Young man, Remember God; that is,
young man, ſpend thy thoughts upon God; thou
haſt many thoughts in youth, do not let them run
out to baſe objects, to ſoul-deſtroying objects, but
Remember God, let God be often in thy minde,
and let the thoughts of thy heart be ſpent on him,
thy many thoughts, and thy beſt thoughts, thy
choice thoughts, let them be ſpent on God, for
that is a Remembring of God.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, To <hi>Remember God,</hi> is to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after communion with God;</hi> Seek to ſee
the face of God, and to have the preſence of God
in and thorow Chriſt, to walk with God, this is a
remembring of God; when a man neglects his
friend, and hath no communion with him, he is
ſaid to forget his friend; and ſo that ſoul that
ſeeks not after communion with God, that ſoul
forgets God: And therefore when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:43429:202"/>
Young man, Remember God; that is, let the
ſtrongeſt endeavour and purſuit of thy ſoul be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God, that thou mayeſt enjoy God, and act for
God, and ſerve him. That's the firſt particular, you
ſee what it is to Remember God.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why we ſhould remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> The ſecond thing is to ſhew you
what cauſe there is that all the ſons of men ſhould
Remember their Creator.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, God is <hi>worthy,</hi> yea <hi>only worthy</hi> to be
remembred: What is in any creature, in any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that does make it worthy of the thoughts of
your heart? Look unto God, and you ſhall finde
it infinitely more in him; Is it Goodneſs, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
bounty, Liberality, Wiſdome, Power, and
Greatneſs, Beauty and Lovelineſs? Go all the
world over, and finde out all the excellencies that
you can name, and you ſhall finde them all to meet
and center in God; all divine perfections are in
him originally; there is Love and Bounty, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Meekneſs, yea infinite grace in God;
<hi>He is good, and he doth good;</hi> and he doth good to
the worſt of creatures, even to thoſe that forget
him, while they run away from him: Yea, the
moſt forgetful of God, they have ſhowers of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
poured down every day upon their heads. Now
becauſe of thoſe excellent glorious perfections
that are in God, God is worthy to be remembred
of the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is worthy to be remembred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath <hi>Done ſo much</hi> to be remembred;
God hath taken more care of this one thing, then
he hath done of any thing elſe, beſides the great
work of the ſalvation of his people, that the ſons
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:43429:203"/>
of men might remember him; when man went out
from God in <hi>Adam,</hi> God ſaw that man would
ſoon forget him, man would have forgotten that
there was a God; now what a great deal hath
God done, that the ſons of men might remember
him! He hath written the remembrance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon every creature, that whereſoever man
looks, either upward or downward, he ſhall ſee
ſome footſteps of God, ſomthing that God hath
done to remember him, he hath engraven ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of himſelf upon every creature, <hi>Pſal.
8. 3, 4.</hi> verſe 9. <hi>When I conſider thy heavens, the
work of thy fingers, the moon, and the ſtars, which
thou haſt ordained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 4. <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of
him, and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi>
When I ſaw (ſaith he) the remembrance of God
that was graven upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
and ſo upon every creature on the face of the
earth, why then at Verſe 9. he cries out, <hi>O Lord,
our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the
Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, The Lord hath engraven the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of himſelf upon all his <hi>Providences;</hi> there
is ſome remembrance of God upon every mercy,
all thoſe mercies that have been made thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which thou haſt enjoyed ſince thou hadſt a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
wherefore are they but that thy ſoul might
remember God?</p>
               <p>Nay, God hath written his name upon his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
in the earth, that he might be remembred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wherefore God he doth work wonderfully, that
as his mercies are wonderful, ſo his judgements
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:43429:203"/>
are wonderful, wherefore doth God do ſuch great
things in the earth? Doubtleſs that he might be
remembred, that men may ſay, <hi>Verily there is a
reward for the righteous, and a God that judgeth
the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, God hath ſet up <hi>Conſcience</hi> in every mans
ſoul, and wherefore hath God ſet up Conſcience
in every man, but that Conſcience might put us in
minde of God? That every man's Conſcience
might ſpeak for God, that it might ſtand up and
cry for God, Remember God; and Conſcience
doth cry, and doth ſpeak, and men may hear the
cries of Conſcience if they will not ſtop their
ears: When men ſin, <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith Conſcience)
<hi>that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay further, God hath engraven his Name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and the great end is, that he
might be remembred; This is the great end of
the Ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper, Do it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and ſo every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
the Word that is preached to you, it is
that you might remember God; wherefore is
Prayer, and every Ordinance, but that the ſons of
men might remember God? He hath engraven
ſome remembrance of himſelf upon all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
See then what cauſe there is that you
ſhould remember God, ſeeing God hath done ſo
much that he might be remembred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is cauſe that the ſons of men
ſhould remember God; for God is <hi>their Creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Remember thy Creator.</hi> Now God being our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
it is but a juſt and equitable thing that thou
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:43429:204"/>
ſhouldeſt remember God thy Creator; thy being
is from him, thy life is from him, thy ſoul is from
him, thy comforts are from him, all thy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are from him, thou haſt not the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the world but what comes from God; he
being thy Creator, it is but a juſt thing that thou
ſhouldeſt remember him; yea, thy <hi>dependance</hi> is
upon him, as he is thy Creator; thy life is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from him, but thy life is in his hand; and thy
ſoul is not only from him, but thy ſoul is in his
hand; it is in his power to kill and to ſave; to
deſtroy both body and ſoul: And if there be ſo
great a dependance that man hath upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that not only thy comforts, but thy breathing,
thy ſoul, and thy eternity is in his hand, there is
good cauſe that thou ſhouldeſt remember thy
Creator.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is good cauſe that we ſhould
remember God, for while you remember God,
you remember your ſelves; for all good comes
to the creature by remembring God, thy peace,
and thy reſt, thy comforts, thy ſatisfaction, and thy
contentments, thy eſtabliſhment of heart, thy hope
for life, for heaven, for glory; there is not any
good thing that a creature can enjoy, or hope to
enjoy, but it muſt come in by remembrance of
God: And while you remember God, you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your ſelves; remembring God, thou enjoyeſt
God, and enjoying God, thou enjoyeſt all good
whatſoever: good reaſon then that thou ſhouldeſt
remember him. That's the ſecond particular.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew you what <hi>advantage</hi> it is
to man to remember God in youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:43429:204"/>
Firſt,<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring God in youth.</note> There is this great advantage; for the
moſt part that ſoul that remembers God betimes,
in its coming unto God he findes the eaſie and
the ready way to God; the longer a man forgets
God, the further he goes from God, every day
he is going from God, and therefore it will be the
harder task to come back again; it is a harder task
to caſt over a great Account, then to caſt it up
while leſſer; though in reſpect of God all things
are alike, and God can as eaſily forgive many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
as few, he can waſh away great ſins as
well as ſmall; but yet when poor creatures come
to look towards God through their unskilfulneſs,
they make it a difficult thing to finde God, and to
return to God, when they go a great way from
him, the greater account they have to caſt up, it
proves ſo to man becauſe of his unskilfulneſs,
though to God all things are alike; So that the
ſooner men begin to look after God, they finde an
eaſier way to come to Chriſt, they have ſome helps
in nature, that when a man is once turned to the
Lord, his natural abilities being ſanctified, become
great helps; ſo that young men have more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
in reſpect that natural parts are more ſtrong,
the Underſtanding, and Memory, and Reaſon, the
Senſes Internal and External, they are all more
vigorous; and theſe prove helps to a man, when
once the heart is ſanctified, and the ſooner a man
turns to God, the more he hath of theſe helps.</p>
               <p>Yea, Chriſt is very ready to go out to meet
ſuch children and young men: Are the hearts of
young ones towards the Lord? The heart of
Chriſt is towards them, and he is mightily taken
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:43429:205"/>
with ſuch, and will go forth and meet them. The
young Progigal in the Goſpel, no ſooner did he
think of returning to his fathers houſe, but his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ran out to meet him.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, for ought we ſee, young men
meet with as much trouble as others, and when
they come to remember God, they are afflicted
as much as others, and it proves hard to them as
to others.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, If it be ſo hard when they do return
to God in youth, it would have been much more
hard if they had ſtayed till old age; and if they do
meet with difficulties and temptations, and it
prove a hard way, it is becauſe that the Lord ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth;
and I might add, that the Lord will recompence
all with abundance of grace, and with the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of himſelf. That is the firſt advantage that
young men have many times, for the moſt part,
they finde the ready way to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have this advantage, The Lord
for the moſt part doth diſcover more of himſelf
to them that begin betimes to remember God,
then to thoſe that begin more later; <hi>Joel 2. 28.
And it ſhall come to paſs that I will pour out of
my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your Sons and your
Daughters ſhall Propheſie, your old men ſhall dream
dreams, your young men ſhall ſee viſions.</hi> Let not
old men grudge at God's diſpenſation, it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to them that they ſhall dream <hi>Dreams,</hi> but the
young men ſhall ſee <hi>Viſions;</hi> they ſhall have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
diſcoveries of God, and that is a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:43429:205"/>
Thirdly, There is this advantage, They that
remember God betimes, they have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of doing more for God then other men have;
for when men begin late, it is work enough to get
the heart eſtabliſhed in the knowledge of the love
and free grace of God; it is a great work, and a
long time before the heart be eſtabliſhed upon
Chriſt and the Promiſes; and till that be done,
little work or ſervice is done for God. But when
men begin betimes, they have time to get their
hearts eſtabliſhed upon Chriſt and the Promiſes,
and upon the free grace and righteouſneſs of
Chriſt, and then they have time alſo to act for
God, and the Lord makes uſe of them to do him
much ſervice in their generation: And O what a
great advantage is that. So that you have ſeen the
Point handled:
Firſt, What it is to <hi>Remember</hi> God.
Secondly, What <hi>Cauſe</hi> the Sons of men have
to Remember God.
Thirdly, What <hi>Advantage</hi> it is for the
Sons of men to Remember God in
youth.</p>
               <p>Now by way of Application.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Vſe 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> It diſcovers and reproves the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and madneſs that is bound up in the heart of the
children of men. If this be the duty of all the
ſons of men, and a point of great wiſdome to
remember God betimes, then this diſcovers the
folly and madneſs that is in mens hearts to forget
God: How many in this Congregation (I fear)
may fall under this reproof, that have not yet
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:43429:206"/>
emembred God? How many in their youth, and
how many paſt youth, that have not yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
God, that have all their dayes forgotten the
Holy One of Iſrael? O that the Lord would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
poor creatures of this evil, not <hi>Remembring
God.</hi> Shall I ſhew you the evil of it, and O
that God would ſhew you the evil of forgetting
God.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">The evil of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God.</note> It is the Mother and cauſe of all
other ſins whatſoever; for it were not poſſible
that many ſhould ſin againſt God as they do, if
they did not forget God; all ſin grows upon this
root of <hi>Forgetting God.</hi> The Pſalmiſt maketh it
the cauſe of all evil that is committed, becauſe
men do forget God, <hi>Pſal. 50. 19, 20, 21, 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 18.</hi> When thou ſaweſt a thief, then thou
conſentedſt with him, and haſt been partaker with
Adulterers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 19.</hi> Thou giveſt thy mouth to evil, and thy
tongue frameth deceit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 20.</hi> Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy
brother, thou ſlandereſt thine own mothers ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 21.</hi> Theſe things haſt thou done, and I
kept ſilence; thou thoughteſt that I was altogether
ſuch an one as thy ſelf: but I will reprove thee,
and ſet them in order before thine eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 22.</hi> Now conſider this, YE THAT
FORGET GOD, leſt I tear you in pieces, and
there be none to deliver you.</p>
               <p>As much as if he ſhould ſay, here is the cauſe
of this evil that is committed by you, your <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
God;</hi> It were not poſſible that men ſhould
dare to ſin in the face of God, if they did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:43429:206"/>
God. And it were not poſſible that men
ſhould ſin in ſecret againſt God, if they did not
forget God; they forget that God is an all-ſeeing
God, and that for all theſe things he will bring
them to judgement; It is not poſſible that
children and ſervants ſhould lye, and ſteal, and be
unfaithful, if they did not forget God; if they
did but remember that he would bring them to
judgement, and that no lyar ſhall come into the
<hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> if men did remember God,
they would not ſin againſt God: But this is the
cauſe of all the ſin in the world, Mens forgetting
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is this Evil; It makes a man
ſpend all his time in vanity, he comes up and goes
down to the grave in a momen, and hath loſt all
the time that he hath lived. The truth is, he hath
not yet begun to live, that hath not remembred
God, he hath not lived to the end of his life, what
is the end of his life, but that he may remember
God? But man forgetting God, his life is a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
life, a vain life, he comes up, and ſins, and
lives in vanity, and goes down to the pit, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lives to the end of life, becauſe man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
not God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is this evil in it; It makes
men altogether unwilling and unable to dye; as it
makes their lives unprofitable, ſo it makes their
deaths dreadful; what is the cauſe that men fear
death? Becauſe they did not remember God in
life; if they had remembred God, if they had
known God, and truſted in God, and walked with
God, they would not have been ſo fearful of death;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:43429:207"/>
but when men come to be made ſenſible that they
have ſpent no thoughts upon God, but upon their
luſts, and ſin, and ſo brought their dayes to an
end, they muſt needs fear to go to God; ſee then
how much evil there is in this great ſin of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, We hope that we do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God, God forbid that we ſhould forget him.
What? <hi>Forget God?</hi> We hope we ſhall never do
that while we live.</p>
               <p>O my friends, It is a harder matter to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God, then the world dream of; how many
thouſands in the world are there that forget God,
that would be loth to be told that they are forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God? And yet I fear will be found ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day; They that walk contrary in wayes of ſin,
they are forgetters of God, let them ſay what they
will; though they may have a way of worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and prayer to God, and hear of God, and read of
God, yet if they be found walking contrary to
God, ſuch men will be interpreted by God to be
forgetters of him. <hi>Conſider this all ye that forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
Why, they had many prayers, and did many good
works, are they forgetters of God? Yes, their
hearts were never upright with God, they never
truſted in the Name of God, they were never
found ſerving of God, ſo as they might pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of this great evil of forgetting God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By way of Exhortation, I beſeech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

This day Remember God. Remember him, and
Remember him in youth. I ſhall ſpeak a little to
each of theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I beſeech you Remember God, to
know God, to truſt in him, to love him, to obey
him, and to ſpend your thoughts upon him; let the
endeavours of your heart be after the Lord; This
is to Remember God. And O that God would
call upon you all, and call you up to ſuch a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him. O remember how worthy God is
to be remembred, and remember what God hath
done, that ſo the ſons of men might remember
him; and if after all this that God hath done, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the remembrance that God hath written of
himſelf in his Word, and upon his Works, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Ordinances and Providences, men ſhall be
found Forgetters of God, as all ſinners are; how
ſad will their condition be another day? You have
a memory for the world, and what, No remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God! God only worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
and of all things God only ſhut out! O my
friends, Take heed of this great ſin, this Mother
ſin, <hi>Forgetting God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I beſeech you to Remember thy
Creator in the dayes of thy youth; Young man
do not put off your remembrance of God; it may
be you will ſay to me, you will remember God
hereafter; that is folly: The Wiſe man teacheth
you better, &amp; giveth you better counſel; <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth;</hi> As much
as if he ſhould ſay, Remember now thy Creator,
in what part of your youth ſoever you be; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Now</hi> thy Creator; <hi>Now</hi> ſeek after the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:43429:208"/>
knowledge of Chriſt, if ten yeers old, <hi>Now</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God, if fifteen years old, if twenty yeers
old, <hi>Now</hi> Remember thy Creator; yea, if thirty
years old, and ſo to every Age to which the word
of the Lord comes, Even <hi>Now, Now</hi> remember
thy Creator.</p>
               <p>And O that young men and young women
would think upon the advantages that many have
by remembring God in youth; they were ſpoken
of before. And let me further tell you, for your
encouragement young men, that to remember God
betimes, it is a great prerogative, and a great
dignity to be the firſt in Chriſt; the Apoſtle
ſpeaks of ſome that were firſt in Chriſt, and he
ſpeaks honourably of them, <hi>Eph. 1. 12. That we
ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who first truſted
in Chriſt:</hi> And it was the honour of that people,
that were <hi>firſt</hi> in bringing back <hi>David;</hi> great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was put upon them that went out <hi>firſt</hi> to
meet <hi>David</hi> their King. And ſo to be the <hi>firſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
that go out to meet with Chriſt, the <hi>firſt</hi> that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, the <hi>firſt</hi> that cloſe with him, and believe
in him; this is a prerogative, and it is kindneſs
that God will never forget, <hi>Jer. 2. 2. Thus ſaith
the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth,
the love of thy eſpouſals, when thou wentest after
me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown,
the kindneſs of thy youth I will not forget, ſaith
God.</hi> And the Lord will ſay ſo to young men and
young women that are looking after Chriſt, and
remember him betimes; thou remembredſt me
in thy youth, and I will remember the kindneſs
of thy youth, when thou lefteſt all to follow me,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:43429:208"/>
thy vanity, thy comforts, thy contentments, that
other young men cloſed with, and followed after,
though they lead to deſtruction; this kindneſs of
thy youth Chriſt will remember to the very laſt
day.</p>
               <p>And let none that hear me this day, think that
they are too young, and 'tis not for them to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themſelves with ſuch matters, to remember
God, and to look after God; as young as you
have remembred God; <hi>Jeroboams</hi> childe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
God; <hi>Joſiah</hi> at ſixteen years of age ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſeek after the Lord: And I pray conſider,
youth go the grave as well as others; nay, more
die in their youth then in their old age: O that
young men would remember God betimes! And
there is none ſo young but muſt be accountable to
God; there is ſin enough to condemn the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
if not actual ſin, thou haſt a ſinful Nature, and
that is enough to condemn the youngeſt that hears
me this day. And therefore, O that the Lord
would perſwade young men to remember betimes
their Creator; and know that it will be your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the latter end: As the neglect of God in
youth will be a great deal of ſorrow, when God
ſmites, and comes to lay you upon the bed of
ſickneſs, and ready to give out your breath, then
it may be you will cry out, Lord, Remember me;
but how ſad will it be to reflect upon your ſelves,
and to think that you have not remembred God?
When as it hath been the comfort of many a poor
ſoul that their work hath been done, and when
they have lain upon their ſick bed, they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up themſelves willingly to God, having gotten
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:43429:209"/>
the knowledge of God, and gotten faith in Chriſt,
they are bleſſing God that their work is done for
them by Chriſt. O how ſweet and comfortable
will it be to you young men, when you come to
die, to ſee that your great work is done, and that
you have believed, and have nothing to do but to
die? <hi>Solomon</hi> was very pittiful to your ſouls young
men, and therefore he calls upon you to <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
your Creator in the dayes of your youth;</hi> And
in the bowels of Chriſt I ſpeak to you this day, to
ſtudy this leſſon of leſſons, To <hi>Remember Now
thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me ſay to old men, if young men had
need to remember God. Oh what cauſe have old
men to remember God? They that have lived
many years, and not remembred God, O it is high
time that thou ſhouldeſt make haſte, thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the grave, the land of forgetfulneſs, where
there is nothing can be done for eternity, when
once in the grave. O that God would perſwade
the Ancient! Such as have neglected to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God, that they would now remember their
Creator: and do not ſay I have miſpent my youth,
and I fear my time is over, and there is no hope
for me, I had as good go on in my wayes of ſin;
O ſay not ſo; <hi>The thoughts of the Lord are not as
your thoughts, nor his wayes as your wayes, but as
the Heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are his
thoughts above yours, and his wayes above yours.</hi>
You have ſpent many years in ſin and vanity, and
forgotten God, and your thoughts have been upon
vanity it may be many years; but the thoughts of
the Lord to do good to his people, are from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:43429:209"/>
O that Now you would at laſt in your old
age remember God! Old men, I beſeech you to
remember your Creator, there is hope; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath God ſpared you ſo long? Reaſon ſo with
with your ſelves to encourage you to look to
Chriſt, when through Unbelief you ſay there is no
hope, you have walked in ſin, and God might
have cut you off, and it is infinite mercy that God
hath not cut you off; but ſeeing the Lord hath
ſpared me, ſurely I may hope, though I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
God in the dayes of my youth, yet ſay, I
will now remember my Creator, and ſeek after
faith in him. And know for thy comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
that there is infinite thoughts of
mercy in the Lord; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and
let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon him; and turn to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. O ſtay no longer, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no longer, for there is one evil day upon you,
the evil day of old age is upon you, and there is
another a coming: O Remember God, and make
haſte to do it quickly, before the Sun, and Moon,
and Stars be darkned, before the body return to
the earth, and the ſpirit to ſtand before God that
made it.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now come to preſs this duty upon
Gods own people; for there are many things that
may evidence that this Duty is neglected by
God's own people. What is the Cauſe of all the
dark and ſad apprehenſions of God to many of
God's own people? Why, Becauſe they have not
remembred God: What is the cauſe of all thoſe
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:43429:210"/>
diſtruſtful thoughts that do ariſe in the hearts of
God's own people? That our hearts are ready to
ſainct within us? That God is no more truſted for
the things of this life, and for the things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
Why all theſe diſtruſtful thoughts, they
ſpring from this root, <hi>not remembring God:</hi> when
the Diſciples did diſtruſt Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 16. 8,
9, 10.</hi> Why ſaith Chriſt, <hi>O ye of little faith, Why
reaſon ye among your ſelves, becauſe ye have brought
no broad?</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Do ye not yet underſtand,
neither remember the five loaves of the five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
and how many baskets ye took up?</hi> Verſe
10. <hi>Neither the ſeven loaves of the four thouſand,
and how many baskets ye took up.</hi> As if Chriſt had
ſaid to them, if ye had remembred me, and my
power, my works of providence, my former good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it were not poſſible that ye ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted,
but in that ye have ſo little faith, it is
evident that ye do not remember me, and what
I have done. Truly if at any time we diſtruſt God
for the fulfilling of any promiſe, it is becauſe we
do not remember God, we do not remember the
faithfulneſs of God in fulfilling Promiſes, we do
not remember the former experiences we have
had of the goodneſs of God, and of the power of
God; O how much diſtruſt is to be found in Gods
own people? And becauſe there is ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt,
it is evident that there is little remembrance
of God.</p>
               <p>Nay further, it appears that Gods own people
are guilty of this ſin, of <hi>Forgetting God;</hi> Becauſe
there is ſo much coldneſs and deadneſs in our
hearts to God. O how much deadneſs in heart
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43429:210"/>
and affection in the things of God? What little
Love? What poor, weak Breathings after God?
What little delight in the Lord? Whence comes
all this coldneſs of heart, this forſaking of our firſt
love? It comes from this root, becauſe we do
not Remember God; we do not remember that
he is altogether lovely and deſireable, we do not
remember that his wayes are beautiful; there is
much deadneſs and coldneſs even in God's own
people, and therefore there is little remembrance
of God.</p>
               <p>Nay further, It appears that God's own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are guilty of this ſin, becauſe there is ſo little
done for God by them, and ſo much done againſt
God; ſo many failings, ſo many breaches of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
ſo much ſcantneſs, ſo many haltings and
ſwervings in our walkings with God: Whence is
all this? but becauſe we do not remember God,
we do not remember what a God he is, we do not
remember the Rule that he hath given us to walk
by, we do not remember that he will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in Spirit and in Truth; little is done for
God, and that diſcovers that God is little remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>Nay further, How many vain thoughts lodge in
the hearts of God's own people? O! How do the
current of their thoughts run out to vanity? How
many crooked thoughts? How many fruitleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
ſinful thoughts? How few of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thoughts of the heart are ſpent upon God?
And whence is this? But becauſe God is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
               <p>Nay further, How little is God purſued after?
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:43429:211"/>
How little do we prize Communion with God?
How little delight in the preſence of God? How
little do we ſeek after the Image of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Chriſt? Whence is all this? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we do not remember that the enjoying of
God is the ſouls happineſs, and that the enjoying
of Chriſt is the ſouls perfection: ſo that by all this
it appears, that there is little remembrance of God
even among God's own people.</p>
               <p>And O what cauſe have we to take up a ſad
complaint againſt our ſelves, and every one to
ſmite upon his own breaſt, that we ſhould be ſo
negligent of this Duty of remembring God? O
what hath God done for many of his people? How
many, how dear, how precious are the thoughts of
God to his people? <hi>Pſal. 40. 5. Many, O Lord
my God, are thy wonderful works which thou haſt
done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward, they
cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: If I would
declare and ſpeak of them, they are more then can
be numbred.</hi> Now that God ſhould ſpend his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thoughts upon us, and we ſpend ſo few of
our choice thoughts upon God, O what an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
is this? O what hath God done that he
might remember us? He hath graven the names
of his people upon the palms of his hands, <hi>Iſa. 49.
16. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my
hands:</hi> For a man to be ſo careful to remember
his friend, as to cut his name upon his own fleſh,
that is love indeed; why God hath graven the
names of his people upon the palms of his hands,
that ſo he might remember them: Yea, he hath
taken upon him the relation of a Father, and hath
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:43429:211"/>
the bowels of a Mother;<note place="margin">Iſa, 49. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Can a woman forget her
ſucking childe, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion
on the ſon of her wombe? Yea, they may forget,
yet will I not forget thee.</hi> Now Brethren and
Chriſtian friends, the conſideration of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
us, ſhould make us to be aſhamed that
we ſhould think no more of him.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay to me, what is there in God
that we ſhould remember him?</p>
               <p>The Spouſe in her deſcription of Chriſt, ſaith
of him, <hi>that he is altogether lovely;</hi> ſo I may ſay
of God, he is altogether worthy to be remembred,
in his Nature, in his Eſſence, in his glorious Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Being; He is worthy to be remembred in all
his Attributes, his Wiſdome, his Power, his
Goodneſs, and Loving Kindneſs, his Faithfulneſs,
and his Truth, his Omniſciency and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
He is worthy to be remembred in all his
Works, for God he hath done them for that end,
that he might be remembred; both the works of
Creation, and works of Providence; He is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be remembred in his Word, every word of
the Lord is precious as gold that is purified ſeven
times. He is worthy to be remembred eſpecially
in his Son; and O that we might ſpend more of
the thoughts of our heart upon God, as he hath
revealed himſelf in his Son; His Name is Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and worthy to be remembred, <hi>(Jehovah, our
Righteouſneſs.)</hi> He is worthy to be remembred
in his Love and Free grace, in his Promiſes, in his
everlaſting Covenant made with poor creatures in
Chriſt; we need not ask what is in God that we
ſhould remember him, look where you will, and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:43429:212"/>
there is not any thing in God but is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance;
and therefore, O that the Lord
would ſtir us up to this duty, to remember the
Lord, to ſpend the precious thoughts of our hearts
more upon him. <hi>David</hi> is a pattern to all you that
fear the Lord, he was continually in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God, when he looked upon the works
of God, he remembred God; and when he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Providences of God, he remembred
God, yea he remembred God in the night ſeaſon,
<hi>Pſal. 63. 5, 6. My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with
marrow and fatneſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee
with joyful lips: When I remember thee upon my
bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was night and day ſpending the thoughts of his
heart upon God. And let me add ſomthing that
may provoke and ſtir us up to the practiſe of this
duty, to Remember God.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, This is the beginning of all good
whatſoever; as the Forgetting of God is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all ſin, ſo the Remembring of God is the
mother of all good; it is that which will make a
man gracious, and act graciouſly in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if he receive mercy, his heart is carried out
in thankfulneſs; if he be in affliction, he is able
to glorifie God, and to honour God in the loweſt
condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The more we Remember God, the
more ſhall we keep out baſe luſts and vain
thoughts; if the heart be not filled with the
thoughts of God, it will be filled with vain
thoughts; the memory it is the ſtore-houſe of the
ſoul, and if God be not laid up there, that which
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:43429:212"/>
is evil will be laid up; and therefore when the
ſoul ſtraggles from God, then vain thoughts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
it: The more that you remember God, the
leſs troubled with vain thoughts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let me tell you, that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
nor ſweetneſs like to that comfort that comes
into the ſoul by the Remembrance of God, <hi>Pſal.
63. 5, 6. My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and fatneſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with
joyful lips; when I remember thee upon my bed, and
meditate on thee in the night watches:</hi> It is as high
an expreſſion as can be of content and ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
which <hi>David</hi> met with in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God. O the ſweet comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that comes into a gracious heart in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, It is not ſo alwayes, the good
man <hi>Aſaph,</hi> he Remembred God, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<hi>Pſal. 77. 3.</hi> and therefore this doth diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
many a poor ſoul to turn to the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God: for <hi>Aſaph</hi> he was troubled, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
and terrified with the Remembrance of
God.</p>
               <p>But I anſwer, It was the good man's diſtemper,
that he <hi>Remembred God and was troubled,</hi> and he
afterward ſaw his own miſtake, and doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it; verſe 10. <hi>And I ſaid, this is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
but I will remember the yeers of the right
hand of the moſt High.</hi> What? Did I ſay that I
Remembred God and was troubled? <hi>This is my
Infirmity:</hi> It was not his Remembrance, but his
Forgetting of God that did trouble him; he did
not Remember God ſo as he ſhould have done;
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:43429:213"/>
He did not Remember God in his free grace, in
his promiſes, in his Son; had he thus Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
God, it would not have been trouble to him;
it may be many a poor ſoul thinks it is trouble to
Remember God, but this is a groſs miſtake, for if
we did Remember God as he is held forth in the
Goſpel, and in his Son, it would be as <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<hi>marrow</hi> and <hi>fatneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The heart being much in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of God, it doth enoble and put a high
price upon the thoughts; till then mens thoughts
are poor and vain, and no good comes of them;
the thoughts of the world periſh, the thouſand
thouſand thoughts that are in the heart, if not ſpent
on God, they are all periſhing thoughts; <hi>Pſal.
146. 4. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his
earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> But
now thoſe thoughts that are ſpent upon God, they
are excellent, living, and noble thoughts, thoughts
that ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever, thoughts that
ſhall run out into the great Ocean, and never be
buried, but you ſhall meet with them all again. O
excellent ſatisfying thoughts when ſpent on God!</p>
               <p>Fiftly, You that are God's people had need
Remember God more, for it is the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the righteous and the wicked; the
wicked may do the ſame works that the righteous
man doth, hear, and read, and pray; but all this is
without Remembring of God: he knows not God,
he truſts not God, he loves not God, he is diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to God: it is ſaid of the wicked, <hi>God is
not in all his thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. The great work
of the Goſpel is to deal with the thoughts of men,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:43429:213"/>
and bring them to a right order, to bring the
thoughts of the heart to a ſubjection to Chriſt;
<hi>2 Cor 10. 45. For the weapons of our warfare are
not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling
down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and
every high thing, that exalteth it ſelf againſt the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay further let me tell you, that this will be
the glory, and excellency, and happineſs of the
Saints in heaven, that they ſhall remember God
continually, and the thoughts of their heart ſhall
be eſtabliſhed in the remembrance of it; they
ſhall not turn aſide from thinking upon God, they
ſhall have no more vain thoughts, no more idle
thoughts, but the thoughts of the heart ſhall run
out to eternity in the remembrance of him, and
never forget him more.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The more we Remember God, the more
of God ſhall we meet with in every duty, in every
providence, and in every way; there is ſuch a
gracious promiſe in <hi>Iſa. 64. 5. Thou meeteſt him
that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that
remember thee in thy wayes:</hi> See here the promiſe
is, That <hi>he will meet thoſe that remember him in his
wayes;</hi> not to a man that walking outwardly in
God's wayes, but to him that walketh with God,
and that hath the thoughts of his heart ſpent upon
God, it is God that he eyeth, and it is God that
he ſeeks communion with, it is ſuch a ſoul that
God will meet, as doth thus remember him in his
wayes.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome poor ſoul is afraid to look
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:43429:214"/>
toward God, it cries out. O I am ſo troubled with
vain thoughts, and ſinful thoughts, with a dead
heart, and a looſe heart, and I cannot remember
the Lord.</p>
               <p>Why if thy ſoul be turned to the Lord in truth,
the Lord will fulfil this his promiſe; if thou ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
about the work, and give up thy ſelf to wain
upon God in the Ordinance, thou ſhalt have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him, God will meet thee, and if God
meet thee, then thy vain thoughts will vaniſh.</p>
               <p>But may ſome ſoul ſay, my thoughts are worſe
then vain thoughts, my thoughts are ſinful thoughts
blaſphemous thoughts, which are ſuggeſted into
my minde even at that time when I ſhould have
communion with God, that I dare ſcarce look
toward God, I dare ſcarce remember him.</p>
               <p>Why, yet do not give over thy duty, what-ever
thoughts ſhould be ſuggeſted into thy minde, but
know for thy comfort, that thoſe ſinful thoughts,
and blaſphemous thoughts which are caſt in by
Sathan, they ſhall not be laid to thy charge, if thy
ſoul abhor them; it is true, if the heart did cloſe
with them, and nouriſh them, then they become
the ſouls; but when the ſoul abhors them, and
caſts them out, and cries to Chriſt againſt them, it
is not the ſouls ſin; therefore do not neglect thy
duty becauſe of theſe vain thoughts, but ſet thy
face to ſeek the Lord, and remember and know
that the Lord will make good his word, he <hi>will
meet thee,</hi> and when God meets thee, all theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and curſed thoughts ſhall be caſt out. And thus
you have heard Brethren, what encouragement
there is to remember God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:43429:214"/>
But you will ſay, It is a great Duty, and much
depends upon it, how ſhall I be helped to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God aright?</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Helps to remember God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note> Be often looking upon the <hi>Book of the
Creature,</hi> upon the works of Creation; and look
upon them for this very end, that thou mayeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God; for there is a Remembrance of
God upon all creatures, and if we be wiſe, we may
make a ſpiritual improvement, and be led to the
Remembrance of God, by looking into the Book
of the Creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look into the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and conſult
with that, for there hath God declared his Name,
his glorious Name is written in his Word; there
are Letters that God hath written with his owne
hand, God hath ſubſcribed, <hi>I Jeſus teſtifie theſe
things.</hi> There is the hand of God and of
Chriſt in the Book of the Scripture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou wouldeſt Remember God, converſe
with the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wait upon God in every <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
for all Ordinances are given for this end, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God; the Word, the Supper, every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God is given, that ſo the ſoul might ſee
God, and Remember him; and therefore when
thou waiteſt upon God in any Ordinance, let this
be the end that thou propoundeſt to thy ſoul, to
Remember God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Lay up all the <hi>Love-tokens</hi> of God;
What-ever <hi>Experience</hi> thou haſt met with from
God in making ſupply to thy wants, comforting of
thee, ſupporting of thee, theſe are tokens that
come from God; and the mercy that he ſheweth
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43429:215"/>
thee, it is for this end, that thou mayeſt Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
him; and therefore lay up all the experiences
that thou haſt met withal, for they will help thee
to Remember God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Labour to get your hearts eſtabliſhed
and aſſured in the <hi>Knowledge of Gods love</hi> to thee,
that thou mayeſt come to the knowledge of this,
that God is thy Friend, thy Father, thy neareſt and
deareſt relation; for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore the ſoul knows this,
the more it will Remember God. It is not poſſible
that a childe ſhould forget a loving Father, that a
Wife ſhould forget a loving and tender Husband.
O when a ſoul comes to know this, that God is my
Father, my Husband, this will help the ſoul to a
ſweet Remembrance of God.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Look up to the Lord to <hi>increaſe thy love
to him;</hi> for the more love to God, the more thou
wilt Remember God; but where there is little
love to God, there is little Remembrance of
God; and the reaſon that men Remember God
no more, is, becauſe there is ſo little love in their
hearts towards God; If a man loved his friend, he
would Remember him, and not forget him; O
therefore be aſhamed that no more love ſhould
be ſparkling in thy heart to God, when ſo much
love is flaming in the heart of Chriſt towards
thee. And therefore Brethren beg it of the Lord
that he would ſhed abroad more of his love in
your hearts, and blow up thy ſpark to a flame, that
thy ſoul may be fill'd with a conſtant Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Ure thy ſoul to <hi>holy meditation, and
thinking upon God</hi> laſt at night, and firſt in the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:43429:215"/>
morning, it will be a great help to keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Remembrance of God in the ſoul: O let thy
waking thoughts be toward the Lord; Think of
his Works of his Attributes, of his Son: there is
enough for men to ſpend millions of thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore let ſome be ſpent upon God: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon
as man wakes in the morning, there are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of thoughts ſtrive who ſhal get in firſt, there
ſtands God, and Chriſt, and the World, and they
which get in firſt, have a great advantage to keep
in the ſoul all the day long; if the world gets in
firſt, the heart is made worldly; but when God
and Chriſt is let in firſt, the heart is kept in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
frame all the day long; and the more that
your meditations are ſpent upon God, the more
Remembrance will you have of God.</p>
               <p>And now Brethren you have ſeen your duty, and
your neglect of duty, for which you have cauſe to
be humbled; and we have ſeen what cauſe we
have to Remember God, and what a great benefit
comes in by Remembring God; and we have ſeen
what may be helpful to our ſouls in this duty. Now
let us look to the Spirit of the Lord to make them
helps; for we have need of all helps, till we ſhall
come where the ſoul ſhall Remember God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
and never forget him.</p>

               <p>Now that we may underſtand the nature of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Hope, and the uſe of it, he ſets it forth to

Hope it is of that uſe to the ſoul, that an
Anchor is to a Ship; as an Anchor is to ſtay the

eye of God; the Lord hath a hand in ruling them,
the ſea, though boiſterous, yet it is before the
Throne.</p>
               <p>And further, it is a <hi>Sea of glaſs</hi> like unto chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal;
there is held forth what this world is before
the Lord, it is glaſs, and it is tranſparent, even as
chryſtal; to the eye of God the world lies open,
and he ſees every thing that is done in it: In a
chryſtal glaſs the leaſt more and ſpot is ſeen by
the eye of man; ſo the world before the Lord, and
to the eye of the Lord, 'tis like to a chryſtal glaſs,
though the world in it ſelf be never ſo muddy, and
never ſo filthy, yet the Lord ſees all, he ſees that
which is at the bottome of the ſea; he ſees into
the bottome of mens hearts, he ſees into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of every mans actions and intentions, there
is not any thing in any man's ſpirit and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but it is clear before the Lord, he ſees it as
thorow chryſtal.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee it confirmed by Scripture, that
this world it is as the <hi>Sea,</hi> and a believing ſoul that
is in the world, he is upon a ſea, as a ſhip upon the
ſea.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſhew you firſt, In what reſpect the
world is as a <hi>Sea</hi> to a believing ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That every Believer is as a ſhip up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſea.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, In what reſpect the world is as the
Sea. Why,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, The ſea is no place <hi>to dwell upon;</hi>
no man builds upon the ſea: the ſea is only for
paſſage to paſs over unto another land, it is for
tranſportation from one country to another, but no
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:43429:218"/>
man dwells upon the ſea. Truly ſo is this world
the world is not to be continued in, it is not for
you to abide long in, you are not to dwell here, it
were the fondeſt thing in the world to think of
building a houſe upon the ſea; truly ſo fond a
thing is it to imagine to continue here long, yet
how deeply is this rooted in the heart of man, and
how little do they think that they are paſſing over
the ſea into another world, how little is this
thought upon and remembred? The Saints of old
they have confeſſed, that they <hi>were Pilgrims and
ſtrangers here, and</hi> that they <hi>had here no abiding
City, but they looked for one to come, whoſe Builder
and Maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11. 10, 13.</p>
               <p>God's people are not at home here, this is no
place to dwell in; here are Tents, but no abiding
City, there is no Manſion here upon the ſea of this
world, the manſions are in heaven, <hi>In my fathers
houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John 14. 2.</hi>
And it is made as a diſcovery of an unſound Heart,
the deſcription of a wicked man, that he dreams
of continuance here, and doth not look upon the
world as a Sea, <hi>Pſal. 49. 11. Their inward thought
is, that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their
dwelling places to all generations; they call their
lands after their own names.</hi>

               <p>It is folly to think of continuing here, the ſea is
no place to dwell in, neither is this world any
place to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Sea is a moſt <hi>unconſtant place,</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:43429:218"/>
the waves of the Sea are full of unconſtancy, full
of Inſtability; a great deal of inſtability is alſo in
the things of this world: The ſea it is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
it is alwayes in ſome troubled motion, there
is no reſt in the Sea, the waters they are riſing and
falling, ebbing and flowing, it is continually in an
unſetled condition: Truly thus is the world, and
all the things of the world, they are full of inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
there is nothing here that continueth: He
that had experience of all theſe things, cries out,
<hi>Vanity of vanity;</hi> that was the beſt he found in the
world, and in the comforts of the world; it is an
unſetled condition that God's own people are in
while upon earth, there is nothing that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long, all things vaniſh, and are gone in a
moment, there is as much inſtability in all things
here below, as in the waves of the Sea; See what
the Wiſe-man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ. 1. 4.</hi> and ſo on, <hi>One

               <p>And ſo it may be ſaid of all the comforts of this
world, they are very unſtable; yea man himſelf
he is full of inſtability, he never continues in one
ſtay, even the beſt of men; ſomtimes he is up,
and ſomtimes down; abundance of inſtability in
their ſpirits and converſations, in their comforts

and enjoyments; in every thing like to the wave<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, The Sea is a <hi>Raging enemy,</hi> it is full
of rage; they that are upon the ſea, they meet

               <p>Truly thus it is with the ſtate of God's people
while in the earth, it is their portion to be toſſed
up and down, even as upon the waves of the Sea.
<hi>Joh</hi> cries out of his toſſings to and fro, <hi>Job 7. 4.
When I lie down, I ſay, When ſhall I ariſe, and the
night be gone?</hi> And <hi>I am full of toſſings to and fro
unto the dawning of the day:</hi> O what perplexities
do God's people meet withal both in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward man, ſomtimes lifted up, and
ſomtimes caſt down? <hi>Thou haſt lifted me up</hi> (ſaith
<hi>David) and cast me down,</hi> Pſal. 102. 10. So <hi>Jonah,</hi>
he was lifted up, he had communion with God,
and by and by caſt down into the bottome of the
Sea. O what a raging enemy is the Sea, when
the four winds ſtrive upon it? Truly there are
dangerous winds that do ſtir up the rage of this
Sea, and make this world ſo boiſterous to God's
own people: The devil raiſeth a wind, yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all the four winds ſtrive together; tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:43429:219"/>
of all ſorts, as Chriſt was exerciſed with, ſo
are the people of God: The devil raiſeth many a
croſs wind to drive them back again, that if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they might not look toward God and Chriſt:
And there are winds that do ariſe out of their
own bowels, many times the wind of manifold
corruptions diſturb, the wind of paſſion, the wind
of pride, the wind of vanity, the wind of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
and O what diſturbances do theſe winds
make that do ariſe out of their own bowels? There
is ſuch a combuſtion, that the poor ſoul is forced
to run to Chriſt, and cry out, O Lord, rebuke theſe
diſturbers: And if Chriſt ſhould not ariſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them, the ſoul would be over-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuch is the rage of this Sea when the winds ſtrive
upon it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Sea is <hi>full of ſands, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſplitting Rocks.</hi> Truly ſo is this world, there
is the rock of perſecution, and many a goodly
ſhip is ſplit upon that rock; there is the rock of
offences, many are offended at the ways of Chriſt,
and offended at the people of Chriſt, and ſo ſplit
upon that rock.</p>
               <p>This world is full of rocks, and full of Sands; it
is true, if Chriſt be in the ſhip, the paſſengers
ſhall not be loſt, though the ſhip may be ſplit, and
all the burden of the ſhip may be loft. The Saints
that have been ſplit upon the rock of perſecution,
they have loſt all their comforts, and their lives
too (for the Name of Chriſt) in the Sea of this
world; but though they have loſt their ſhip, the
body, and all their loading, yet their ſouls have
been ſaved, and are arrived ſafe in heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:43429:220"/>
Fiftly, The Sea is <hi>full of Pyrats and Robbers:</hi>
The world is not without theſe dangers to God's
own people; there are many robbers that lye in
wait to rob and take away all their loading; the
devil lies in wait to take away from the people of
God all their precious loading that they have
been trading for, but they ſhall carry it home to
heaven in ſpite of all the devils in hell; yea, their
own hearts are robbers and pyrats, &amp; a man's own
heart will do him more hurt then all his enemies
beſide, a vain heart, a worldly heart, a frothy heart,
an unbelieving heart, theſe would rob us of all our
comforts whatſoever, and take away all the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Commander of the Sea, and he is nigh with a
Convoy, and he will guard every believing ſoul
through all theſe robbers, and carry them ſafe to
heaven.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The waters of the Sea are <hi>very ſalt and
brackiſh,</hi> no man can drink the Sea water without
prejudice: Even ſo is this world, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of it, they are all ſalt and bitter, and it is not
poſſible that they ſhould ſatisfie and quench the
thirſt of any poor ſoul. How many men do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves, they think that the world
ſhould ſatisfie their deſire, and therefore their
deſires are ſo eager after the world, but they ſhall
finde another day that they are in an error; the
waters of the Sea cannot quench their thirſt; a
gracious heart will ſay ſo, and he knows it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that it is better for him to drink of the
waters of life; and therefore he cries out, Lord,
theſe are all ſour waters, yea the beſt comforts
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:43429:220"/>
have ſome mixture of ſalt and bitterneſs; Lord,
give me evermore to drink of thoſe waters of life
that run at thy right hand for evermore: It is true
the men of this world that know no better, they
drink freely of this ſalt water, becauſe they know
not what ſweet waters are; but that ſoul that
hath taſted of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, and how
good the Lord is, that ſoul cannot be ſatisfied with
all the comforts of this life, but looks only to
Chriſt, that he may ſatisfie his deſire. And ſo you
have ſeen in theſe ſix particulars, that this world
to a believing ſoul is as the Sea. That's the firſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is as a ſhip up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea of this World.</note> Every Believer is as a ſhip upon

are ſet forth from the world, and from ſin, and
they are bound to the Land of Promiſe; that's
the ſtate of every Believer, he is as a ſhip upon
the Sea. Indeed Chriſt is the Builder of this
ſhip, Chriſt is the Owner of this ſhip, it is Chriſt
that lancheth the ſhip, and that loads the ſhip, all
the precious Commodities that a believing ſoul is
carrying home with him, it is Chriſt's; he hath
the great Venture in every believing ſoul, and if
it ſhould miſcarry, Chriſt ſhould have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
loſs, for he hath the greateſt Venture in the
ſhip; and becauſe the Venture is Chriſts,
therefore Chriſt will go Maſter in the ſhip; his
preſence ſhall be with his people all the time of
their continuance upon the face of this earth, he
will not leave them till he hath brought them into
the Haven of reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:43429:221"/>
But I ſhall follow the Metaphor in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
briefly thus.
Firſt, The Ship at Sea cannot move without
a Wind.
Secondly, It cannot reſt without an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A ſhip at ſea cannot <hi>move without a wind.</hi>
Many times it lies a long time for a wind, and
when the wind blows, then the ſhip moves, but
it cannot move without a wind; and truly ſo it is
with the ſouls of God's people, they cannot move
without a wind, they are bound for heaven, but
they cannot move the leaſt without the ſpirit of
of Chriſt, though they have never ſo many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
and never ſo many Ordinances and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
yet if the Spirit of Chriſt doth not help the
ſoul forward, the ſoul is becalmed, and cannot
move: It is true, the ſhip at ſea may be ready,
they may turn the Sayls to the Windward, but not
move till the wind blow; and ſo a believing ſoul
may do ſomthing when once the Spirit of Chriſt is
in it, the ſoul may ſtand waiting for Chriſt, and
be breathing after Chriſt, but till the Spirit of
Chriſt ſhall breath upon the ſoul, and fill the ſayls
of the ſoul, it is not poſſible that it ſhould rid any
way: And therefore the people of God have
found, that it hath been for their advantage to
cry out for the breathings of the Spirit of Chriſt;
ſo the Spouſe in <hi>Cant 4. 16. Awake, O North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
and come thou South, Blow upon my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
that the Spices thereof may flow out.</hi> But</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:43429:221"/>
Secondly, The ſhip cannot <hi>reſt without an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor;</hi>
no more can any poor ſoul reſt without this
Anchor of Hope; this anchor of hope is that
which ſtayes the ſoul upon God, and keeps up the
ſoul that it faint not, and ſink not; It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>If our hopes were only
in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> If
we had not a better hope and anchor then the men
of this world have, that have only hope for the
things of this life. But this ſaving <hi>Hope,</hi> which is
the ſiſter of Faith, that looks to the good things
laid up in the Promiſe, it is that which ſtays the
ſoul, and keeps it ſafe and ſtedfaſt in the midſt of
all ſtorms whatſoever: If a ſhip lye at Anchor, it
may ride ſafe at midnight, though never ſo dark;
And truly that ſoul that hath caſt anchor upon
Chriſt, it may ride ſafe in the darkeſt time, in the
ſaddeſt condition that can befal it, while upon the
face of the earth, this great Sea; If a ſhip hath a
good anchor, ſhe rideth ſafe in the midſt of the
greateſt raging ſea, though the winds riſe, though
the waves be never ſo high: This anchor of hope
it cauſeth a ſoul to ride ſafe in the midſt of all
temptations; Hope keeps the heart up, <hi>Rom. 5.
2. By whom alſo we have acceſs by faith into this
grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in the hope of
the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 3.</hi> And not only ſo, but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 4.</hi> And patience, experience; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hope.</p>
               <p>Becauſe we have this hope, therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:43429:222"/>
in tribulation, in the midſt of all ſtorms we
rejoyce; we can ſing for joy, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
did at midnight, becauſe we have Hope for our
anchor, our ſhip ſhall ride ſafe in the midſt of
this Sea.</p>
               <p>But for Application, briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> It lets us ſee the miſery of all men
out of Chriſt; they that are without Chriſt,
are without hope; the Apoſtle puts them
together, <hi>Eph. 2. 12. That at that time ye were
without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants
of Promiſe; having no hope, and without God in
the world.</hi> They that have no Intereſt in Chriſt,
have no hopes to do their ſouls good another day;
they may have the hope of the hypocrite, that is
like the ſpiders web that will periſh; but they
have no true, ſolid, well-grounded hope.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad condition for a ſhip to be at ſea, and
have no Anchor; wicked men are at ſea as well
as God's people, and if you have no anchor of hope
to ſtay your ſouls when ſtorms ſhall ariſe, and the
wrath of God ariſe againſt you, how ſad will your
conditions be? And truly thus it is with the
greateſt part of the men of the world, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is ſad, though they do not lay it to heart;
their ſhip is at ſea, toſſed up and down, and have
no anchor: Every man out of Chriſt, either he
hath no hope, no anchor; or ſecondly, If he hath
hope, his hope is not ſure and ſtedfaſt, it is no firm
hope; or thirdly, his hope is not caſt upon a
good ground; and if ſo, it is not poſſible that
the ſhip ſhould be ſafe when the ſtorms ariſe; for
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:43429:222"/>
it is a very rotten place that moſt men out of
Chriſt do caſt the anchor of their hopes upon;
moſt men caſt their anchor downward, but this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
of hope muſt be caſt upward; it never takes
place when it is caſt downward, it hath no ground
to faſten upon.</p>
               <p>But when it is caſt within the Vail, it takes hold
upon the rock, upon God, and Chriſt, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that is more ſure then heaven and earth;
but moſt men caſt their anchor downward, their
hopes is for the things of this life, and that hope
will not hold.</p>
               <p>And ſome caſt the anchor of their hope upon
themſelves, and that is a poor ground to caſt this
anchor upon; the anchor of moſt men that
live under the Goſpel, that are not brought
home to Chriſt, their Anchor is caſt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
upon ſome works, ſome duties, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
upon ſomthing that they have done;
truly this is a rotten ground, and this hope will not
ſtand you in ſtead: there is no anchor will hold
but that which is caſt upward within the Vail,
therefore dear friends, I beſeech you examine
whether you have that anchor that will hold, have
you this hope that is caſt within the Vail? O! that
God would cauſe you to look after this hope, you
will not truſt your bodies at Sea in a ſhip that hath
no anchor, you will ſay it is as much as your lives
are worth if a ſtorm ſhould ariſe: Will you not truſt
your bodies where there is no anchor, and will you
truſt your ſouls where there is no anchor? Yet this
is the folly of thouſands, thoſe that are called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
they will truſt their ſouls at ſea without
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:43429:223"/>
an anchor. Alas! What will they do when the
ſtorms ſhall ariſe, when, when the wrath of God
ſhall ariſe, what will you do? O! that God would
cauſe you to come to Chriſt, that you may have
this anchor that is ſure and ſtedfaſt. Thats the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> Let not God's people wonder that
they meet with ſtorms, temptations, tryals, and
afflictions, and at the rage of men againſt you:
Why, you are like a Ship at Sea, and a ſhip at Sea
hath prepared for a ſtorme, if the waves do beat
upon them, they are prepared for it, they are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up and down the ſea, and yet they hope they
ſhall come to land: And therefore you that fear
the Lord, do not wonder at your temptations and
tryals, and that the wrath of men is againſt you,
this is the place for ſtorms, heaven is the place of
reſt; the Lord by this would imbitter the world
to you, he will make you know that the world is
bitter, and that heaven is ſweet; O! How ſweet
will heaven be when the ſoul ſhall come out of the
midſt of great ſtorms, and dark nights, and many
perplexities of ſpirits, many toſſings in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
both outward and inward; the Lord by
theſe ſtorms will make heaven very ſweet unto
you; heaven is the place of reſt, though this be
the place of trouble, and therefore do not wonder
at it. That's the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> What a mercy is it that God's people
are kept and preſerved any moment; It is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to be kept at ſea, every man will ſay ſo; but
eſpecially to be kept and preſerved when the ſea
rages, there is no heart almoſt ſo hard, but will
be affected with ſuch a mercy, to be kept in the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:43429:223"/>
midſt of a ſtorm, when they expect to make their
grave in the deeps, this is a wonder; and O what
a mercy is it that God's people are kept in this
tempeſtuous world; it is a wonder that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are not broken, and that your ſpirits are not
broken, and that your comforts are not broken,
when ſo many winds ſtrive upon the face of the
earth, this ſea; it is a great mercy to be kept, and
therefore acknowledge it to the praiſe of God; it
doth appear, and the Lord doth make it evident,
that the ſea is before the Throne. If the ſea were
not before the Throne of God; God's people
ſhould be ſwallowed up every moment, the rage
of men and of devils would ſwallow them up; but
the ſea is before the Throne, before the eye of
God; and therefore wonder that you are ſafe in
this raging ſea.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 4.</note> It calls upon you that are the Lord's
people to watch and pray, for you are at ſea; he
that will not pray in a ſtorm, he will never pray,
the worſt of men will pray hard in a ſtorm: The
heathen Mariners, <hi>Jonah 1. 5. Then the Mariners
were afraid, and cryed every man unto his god:</hi>
therefore there is a Proverb, That <hi>men go to Sea
to learn to pray:</hi> Truly, the Lord ſends his people
to ſea for this end, that he might learn you to pray
and cry mightily to him; the Saints ſhall not need
to pray when they come in heaven, there all their
deſires ſhall be ſatisfied, and they ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and therefore no need to pray: But the
Lord he ſends you into the ſea of this world, that
he might learn you to pray, and he raiſes many
ſtorms for this end, that ſo you might cry mightily
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:43429:224"/>
to the Lord: The Diſciples when in a ſtorm, they
cryed, <hi>Lord, ſave us, we periſh:</hi> Brethren, you are

the ſoul ſhall be ſaved in the day of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I now come to conſider what is the Uſe and
the Excellency of this Grace of Hope. It is an
Anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt, though it is not alwayes
ſure to ſenſe, not alwayes ſure in apprehenſion.
The hope of the Saints may have its ſhakings, and
it may ſeem ſometimes to be cut off in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
but it is ſure and ſtedfaſt in reſpect of
the ground of it, in reſpect of that ſure hold it
hath upon God and Chriſt, it hath ſure hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is within the Vail. And it is ſure
in reſpect of the event of it; The Event and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
of a Believers hope is alwayes ſure, it can no
more be diſappointed of his hope, then the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his hope (which is Chriſt) can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
but that which a believing ſoul hath in
hope, it is as ſure as if he had it in hand already.
<hi>Lo, This is our God, we have waited for him, and he
will ſave us,</hi> ſaith the Church.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine then is this,
That the beleiving ſoul hath Hope for a ſure
and ſtedfaſt Anchor.<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus,
This Grace of Hope it is a ſure and ſtedfaſt
Anchor to every believing heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is plain in the Text,</hi> Which hope we have as
an Anchor both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Point, I ſhall ſhew you,
Firſt, What this Hope is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Make it out to you, That this
Hope is the ſouls Anchor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:43429:226"/>
Thirdly, That this Anchor of the ſoul is ſure
and ſtedfaſt. And that will make way
for Application.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, Our work is to enquire, What this
<hi>Hope is.</hi> You may take this deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>It is the work of the ſpirit of Chriſt upon the
heart, whereby it is raiſed in expectation of thoſe
good things that faith believes, and which God
hath promiſed.</p>
               <p>We ſhall open the parts of it, that we may
come to know what this ſaving Hope is, that is the
Anchor of a believing ſoul.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all you have the efficient cauſe of
this hope,<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of true hope is God.</note> and that is the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> it is not
all the world that can raiſe a poor dejected heart
to hope in God, it is not all the comforts of the
world, nor comforters in the world, that can make
any poor drooping heart to caſt this Anchor of
Hope in heaven; and therefore when the Apoſtle
doth deſcribe the condition of Natural men, he
ſaith of them, That <hi>they are without God, without
Christ, and without Hope.</hi> This is the ſtate of
every man by Nature, he hath not the leaſt dram
of ſaving hope, till the Spirit of Chriſt come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to
work upon the heart. And therefore God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>God of Hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. <hi>Now the God
of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that you may abound in hope, through the power of
the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here you ſee the efficient cauſe,
it is the work of God to raiſe up the heart to hope
in himſelf, and it is the Spirit of Chriſt that muſt
cauſe the ſoul to abound in hope; <hi>That you may
abound in hope, through the power of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:43429:226"/>
And in <hi>Pſal. 22.</hi> ſpeaking there in the perſon of
Chriſt, he confeſſeth that it was his Father that
did cauſe him to hope, <hi>Pſal. 22. 9. But thou art
he that took me out of the womb, thou didſt make me
hope when I was upon my mothers breaſts.</hi> It was
thou Lord that didſt <hi>cauſe me to hope.</hi> God only is
the efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of hope.</note> For the Formal Cauſe of this Hope,
we ſaid it is <hi>an Expectation of the ſoul,</hi> it takes its
riſe from faith, what faith believeth, that hope
expects, and waits upon God for the fulfilling of;
It is an <hi>Expectation of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Expectation it is,
Firſt, A patient Expectation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An ardent Expectation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A confident Expectation. All which
do expreſs the Nature of ſaving Hope.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, It is a <hi>Patient Expectation,</hi> it cauſeth
the ſoul to wait patiently for the fulfilling of the
Promiſe, to ſit down at the feet of Chriſt, and
wait, even all its dayes, for the fulfilling of the
Promiſe; and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.
10. 36. For you have need of patience, that after
you have done the Will of God, you may inherit the
Promiſe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, your hope will
not hold out, if you have not patience, God hath
given you a promiſe, but God doth not preſently
fulfil the promiſe; and therefore that you may
hope till the Promiſe be fulfilled, you have need
of patience; and truly, <hi>Hope</hi> is nothing elſe but
<hi>Patience lengthned out.</hi> It is a patient Expectation.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43429:227"/>
Secondly, It is an <hi>Ardent Expectation;</hi> What
the believing ſoul doth hope for, it is earneſtly
carried out after; it is ſuch an expectation as doth
make the ſoul exceedingly Intent, and cauſe it to
look every way, round about, for the fulfilling of
that which it hopes for; it is an earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Rom. 8. 19, 20, 21.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 19.</hi> For the earneſt expectation of the
creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 20.</hi> For the creature was made ſubject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath
ſubjected the ſame in hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 21.</hi> Becauſe the creature alſo ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the bondage of corruption, into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liberty of the children of God.</p>
               <p>The whole creation hath a hope to be delivered
from that bondage which the ſin of man brought
upon it; and becauſe there is a hope, there is an
<hi>earneſt expectation,</hi> and the earneſt expectation
waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God.
And truly where there is ſaving hope, it will cauſe
the ſoul to look after the fulfilling of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
it waits earneſtly, and groans earneſtly for
the fulfilling of thoſe Promiſes that it waits for:
It is an ardent expectation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>Confident Expectation;</hi> though
indeed it is true, the hope of the beſt Saints may
flag, yet when hope doth work like it ſelf, and act
like it ſelf, it acts <hi>confidently;</hi> it is accompanied
with holy confidence and boldneſs toward God;
when hope is ſtrengthned, then it acts <hi>confidently,</hi>
and confidence is nothing elſe then hope ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:43429:227"/>
That is the ſecond particular. You have
ſeen the efficient and formal cauſe of this hope.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">What is the object of hope.</note> What is the <hi>Object</hi> of this <hi>Hope?</hi> I
told you that it was an expectation of thoſe good
things that God hath promiſed; what God hath
promiſed, that hope looks for the fulfilling of, all
outward comforts that are needful refreſhments
in their way; (Protection, Deliverance, Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the Increaſe of Grace, and the Carrying
on of the work of God in the heart) what-ever is
laid up in the Promiſe, that hope waits for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of; but more eſpecially, the Object of a
Believers hope it is <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. <hi>In
hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lye,
promiſed before the world began.</hi> And in <hi>Tit. 3. 7.
That being juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made
Heirs, according to the hope of Eternal Life.</hi> So that
Eternal life is the Object of a Believers hope.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of hope.</note> We have the concomitant of Hope,
and that is <hi>Faith;</hi> It is an expectation of thoſe
good things which faith believes that God hath
promiſed; ſo you ſee how Hope ſtands towards
Faith, they are twins, as it were, they are born
and brought forth together; Faith is the Elder
ſiſter, faith believes that the promiſe is true, and
hope looks for the fulfilling of the Promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
faith believes it; They grow up together,
they are nouriſhed together, and they flouriſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and they languiſh together; when faith
is ſick, hope is infirm, and when faith is lively,
hope is active; yea, they will expire together:
when a believing ſoul ſhall come into the boſome
of Chriſt, no need of faith and hope. Faith that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:43429:228"/>
looks to the truth of the promiſe, and hope looks
to the good of the promiſe, that is the difference
between faith and hope; Faith cloſes with the
Promiſe becauſe it is true, and Hope that cleaves
to it, and expects the fulfilling of it, becauſe it
is a ſutable good which God hath promiſed; ſo
that by the opening of this deſcription of hope,
you may in part ſee what that hope is which will
be as an Anchor to a man's ſoul; That's the firſt
particular.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, I ſhall make it out unto you, that
this hope is the Anchor of the ſoul; and I ſhall
ſhew you that it is of the ſame uſe to the ſoul that
the Anchor is to the ſhip.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, The Anchor is uſeful in time of
ſtorms, the Anchor doth keep the ſhip from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
driven up and down with various winds; if it
were not for the Anchor, the ſhip would ſomtimes
be carried back again after it hath gone a great
way in its Voyage: of the ſame uſe is Hope to a
believing ſoul, it is exceeding uſeful in time of
temptation, when contrary winds blow, even ſuch
winds as would drive the ſoul back again, if it
were not for the Anchor of Hope: It is ſaid of
Chriſt, <hi>That for the joy that was ſet before him,
he endured the Croſs, deſpiſed the ſhame;</hi> and that
we bear up againſt the ſtrong winds of temptation,
and againſt all the diſcouragements that we meet
with, it is by this Anchor of Hope; if it were not
for the hope of joy and glory in heaven, it were
not poſſible that a ſoul ſhould bear up againſt ſo
many winds of temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:43429:228"/>
Secondly, The Anchor keeps the ſhip from
toſſing: When the waves roar, the Anchor is then
exceeding uſeful, it keeps the ſhip from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
for though it may be moved, yet not
removed, becauſe the Anchor is ſure; though the
waves riſe never ſo high, and be never ſo boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
yet if they caſt Anchor, the Mariners lay
them down to ſleep, they are ſecure, becauſe they
have caſt Anchor. And of that uſe is this Grace
of hope to a believing ſoul, the waves many times
riſe high, afflictions, perſecutions, <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of it, <hi>Pſal. 38. 12. They alſo that ſeek after
my life, lay ſnares for me; and they that ſeek my
hurt, ſpeak miſchievous things, and imagine deceit
all the day long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 13.</hi> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and
I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</p>
               <p>Verſe 15. <hi>For in thee, O Lord, do I hope, Thou
wilt hear, O Lord my God.</hi> I was not moved by
this (ſaith he) I caſt anchor in thee, O Lord <hi>In thee
O Lord, do I hope, thou wilt hear me, O Lord my
God:</hi> He caſt Anchor in God, and then he lies
down and reſts: And ſo in <hi>Pſal. 42.</hi> There were
many waves that did riſe very high in his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and what doth he do? Why, he caſts anchor
in God, as in verſe <hi>11. Why art thou caſt down, O
my ſoul? And why art thou diſquieted within me?
Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is
the health of my countenance, and my God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hope
ſtill in God,</hi> caſt thy Anchor there, and then
reſt, for I ſhall yet ſee the time to praiſe him, I
ſhall overcome all ſtorms, and ſhall live to ſee a
c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lm and therefore O my ſoul caſt anchor in God,
hope thou in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:43429:229"/>
Thirdly, The Anchor keeps the ſhip from
ſplitting many times upon the ſands and rocks;
when they are very neer danger, almoſt running
upon a rock, the caſting out of an Anchor ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth deliver them. Hope is of the ſame
uſe to a believing ſoul, it keeps the poor ſoul from
ſplitting upon many diſcouraging rocks that are in
the way to heaven, <hi>Pſal. 27. 13. I had fainted,
unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord
in the Land of the living:</hi> If it had not been for
the Anchor of hope, I had ſplit, I had fainted, and
my ſoul had been ſplit, but I believed to ſee the
goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living;
the anchor of hope, it is that which keeps the ſoul
from ſplitting upon the rocks.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The anchor keeps the ſhip cloſe to
the place where the Anchor is caſt, that it ſhall
not be removed far from that place; ſo the grace
of hope in this reſpect is alſo uſeful, it keeps the
heart cloſe to God and Chriſt, that is the benefit
of this anchor of hope: the men of the world
that have not hope in Chriſt, they live at a great
diſtance from God and Chriſt, they dwell at a
great diſtance from heaven, they are far from
God; God is not in all their thoughts, becauſe
they have not this Anchor of hope; if the anchor
of their hope were caſt in heaven, it were not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that their ſouls ſhould be at a diſtance from
God; the more there is hope, the more nigher
God; it is want of this lively hope that men are
ſo far from God. That's the fourth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Anchor is made ſure by a Cable
that is faſtned to it; and ſo the hope of a believing
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:43429:229"/>
ſoul will do no good without a Cable, now this
Cable it is the word of Promiſe, it is the ſure word
of the Lord that keeps the ſoul faſt. If a Ship
have a hundred anchors at Sea, if they be not faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a Cable, they will do no good: and truly
ſo is hope if it hath not a Cable; if men pretend
to have hope, and that hope not faſtned upon the
word of the Lord, ſo faſt as it is caſt, it will be
loſt. But the hope of a believing ſoul is faſtned
upon the word of the Lord, the promiſe of the
Lord, and therefore it will hold.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The Sea-man caſts his Anchor at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he doth not know whether his anchor will
reach the bottome or no, he doth not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Cable be long enough, or whether his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
will take hold or no, and he doth not know
whether his anchor will hold when it hath taken
hold, yet notwithſtanding all, he makes a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
when he hath need to caſt his anchor: and ſo
it is with a believing ſoul, when a ſoul comes firſt
to God, he makes a deſperate venture, he ſees his
faith is weak, and his hope weak, and he doth not
know whether it will take hold of the rock or no,
will not my expectation fail? All this is objected,
but the believing ſoul makes a venture, faith is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and it makes a venture, he ſees that there
lies a neceſſity upon it, if I do not caſt anchor, I
periſh, the winds blow hard, and I ſee a rock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, a gulf, and if I do not caſt anchor, I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and if I caſt anchor, it may be my anchor will
hold, I have an invitation to it; <hi>Who is among you
that walketh in darkneſs, and ſees no light, let him
truſt in the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10.
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:43429:230"/>
though it be in a ſtorm at midnight; let him caſt
anchor upon me (ſaith God) let him truſt in the
Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God; this
the poor ſoul hears, and being encouraged by the
Word of the Lord, it caſt anchor, and makes a
deſperate venture. That's the ſixt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The anchor is uſeful, not only in a
ſtorm, but the anchor is uſeful in a calm, when the
ſhip at Sea is be calmed, and cannot ſayl, they caſt
anchor; and ſo this anchor of hope it is needful in
a calm, for if it were not for this anchor of hope,
a believing ſoul could not have any ſettlement in
a calm, though a man hath never ſo much for the
preſent, if he hath not hopes that his goods ſhall
be increaſed, his heart will be diſquieted; and
ſo hope is uſeful in the greateſt calm, to hope that
the preſent good that they have ſhall not be loſt,
that that meaſure of grace and ſpirit that the Lord
hath given them, ſhall be carried on from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to another, till he hath perfected it; if it
were not for this, the heart could not have any
peace in the greateſt of his enjoyments. And thus
you have ſeen the ſecond particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I have ſhewn you what ſaving hope is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this ſaving hope is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt particular is,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of a believing ſoul is ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</note> To ſhew you
that this anchor of a believing ſoul is ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt:
And it will appear in theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is made of good mettle, it is that which
will not bow nor break, it is not as the hope of an
hypocrite; the hope of an hypocrite is compared
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:43429:230"/>
to a ſpiders web, that breaks preſently; the ſpiders
web it is a poor thing to hold a ſhip faſt in a ſtorm;
but this ſaving Hope that the Spirit of Chriſt doth
work in the heart of believers, it is made of good
mettle, it was not digged out of their own bowels,
but fetcht from Chriſt, it is Chriſt that is the
ſtore-houſe of all grace, it is made of gold, of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
gold, <hi>Their faith is more precious then gold,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, and ſo their hope is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
then gold, and more firm and ſolid then
gold, the matter of it is ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is well wrought, and therefore it
muſt needs be ſure and ſtedfaſt, for it is an anchor
of Chriſt's own working; <hi>The God of hope ſill you
with all joy and peace in believing, that you may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in hope, through the power of the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
Rom. 15. 13. and ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet.
1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead:</hi> The hope
of the Saints it is a grace that is of God's own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting,
it is an anchor of Chriſt's own making,
and that which comes out of the hand of Chriſt,
muſt needs be ſure and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is ſure and ſtedfaſt, for the Cable
that holds it is ſure and ſtedfaſt, and that is the
Word of the Lord; now the Word of the Lord,
which is the Cable that a believers hope is faſtned
unto, it is twiſted of many precious promiſes, all
being twiſted together, muſt needs be ſtrong, the
leaſt of them is ſtronger then heaven and earth;
<hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs, but not one jot or tittle
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:43429:231"/>
of the word of the Lord ſhall fail, till all be fulfilled.</hi>
The promiſes they are the cable which a believing
ſouls anchor is faſtned unto, and therefore it is ſure
and ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is caſt upon a ſure ground. What
is the ground that a believers hope is caſt upon. I
anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The ground that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hope is faſtned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> It is faſtned upon Jeſus Chriſt; firſt,
upon Chriſt crucified, upon the <hi>death of Christ,</hi>
upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, by which Chriſt
hath made ſatisfaction for ſin, and brought in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
righteouſneſs, to cover the nakedneſs of
poor creatures, their love is faſtned upon the
wounds of Chriſt, the ſufferings of Chriſt. That's
the firſt ground for a believers hope to faſten
upon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Anchor of a believers hope it
faſtens upon the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3.
<hi>Bleſſed be God that hath begotten us again to a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is a
main ground for hope to faſten upon, the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Jeſus Chriſt, the poor ſoul looks to
Chriſt, Chriſt dead and riſen, and in that Chriſt
roſe from the grave, he hath given full ſatisfaction
to his Father, he hath paid the debt, and is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon for his people, that come to him by
faith; ſo that the reſurrection of Chriſt doth
ſtrengthen the faith of the ſoul exceedingly, it
gives the ſoul aſſurance that it ſhall be accepted
with God the Father, becauſe Chriſt is riſen again.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It faſtens alſo upon the <hi>Interceſſion of
Jeſus Chriſt. He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all
that come to God by him, for he ever liveth to make
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:43429:231"/>
Interceſſion for them.</hi> Now this gives great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to a poor ſoul that is made ſenſible
of his own loſt condition, of being far off from
God, it would fain draw nigh, and know not
which way to come; when this is diſcovered, that
Chriſt ſits in heaven to plead for poor ſouls, and
to make Interceſſion for all that come to God by
him, this cauſes the ſoul to give a venture to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the ſoul faſtens upon Chriſt, ſo
alſo it faſtens upon God the Father by Chriſt, it
goes to the Fathers, and takes hold of him. Firſt,
It faſtens upon the <hi>free Grace</hi> of the Father, that
infinite <hi>everlaſting love</hi> which did finde out the
way of Redemption for poor creatures, that love
which gave Chriſt at firſt, and which gives poor
creatures to Chriſt, and which tenders Chriſt in
the everlaſting Goſpel, there the anchor of hope
takes hold. Secondly, Hope takes hold of the
<hi>ſtrength of God:</hi> He is a God mighty in ſtrength,
he can overcome all difficulties, all enemies that
are betwixt him and my ſoul, he can overcome all
my unworthineſs, all my provocations, yea he can
overcome himſelf, his own wrath and diſpleaſure,
that which no creature can do; this being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a poor ſoul that is in a ſad doubting conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this helps (through grace) to draw the ſoul to
Chriſt, and to faſten it upon God. Thirdly, It
faſtens alſo upon the <hi>unchangeableneſs of God,</hi> and
this gives a ſure hold to the anchor of hope: <hi>He
is not as man that he ſhould lye;</hi> Who is it that
hath ſpoken? Who is it that tenders Chriſt to
poor creatures? It is not the word of him that is
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:43429:232"/>
the true and faithful witneſs? Is it not the ſtrength
of Iſrael that cannot lye, nor as the ſons of men,
that he ſhould repent: Now when the Lord doth
thus preſent his Son and Himſelf to a poor ſoul,
Chriſt in his death, his reſurrection, aſcention, his
interceſſion, and his own free grace and love, his
ſtrength, his faithfulneſs, this becomes a ſure
ground for hope to faſten upon, and ſo you have
ſeen the third thing handled.</p>
               <p>A word of Application and I have done.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note> It lets us ſee the ſad condition of
all men that are without Hope, you will ſay they
are in a ſad condition that are at ſea without an
anchor, and truly this is the condition of many
men, they are in a ſad condition, for they are
without hope; and O that men would now lay it
to heart to ſee what a ſad condition they are in
without this anchor of ſaving Hope, you that are
without hope, it is not poſſible you ſhould ſtand in
a ſtorm, however you may be quiet in a calm, it is
not poſſible that you ſhould bear up in time of
ſtorm, and therefore though men may ſeem to look
towards God, and ſeem to make a progreſs in
God's wayes, if there be not an anchor of Hope,
they will be driven back again, croſs winds will
ariſe at ſea, and if you have not this anchor of
hope in Chriſt, and in the Father's free grace, they
will be driven back again, without hope it is not
poſſible you ſhould be neer unto God, and keep
nigh unto God; and what a miſerable condition
is it to be without God in the world? Truly, ſo
long as you are without true ſaving hope, you are
without God in the world; ſo long as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:43429:232"/>
without hope, they are in a heartleſs and liſtleſs
condition, where there is no hope, there is no
endeavour; What is the reaſon that men are ſo
ſlothful in looking after God? It is becauſe that
their hearts are not eſtabliſhed by hope in Chriſt,
and in the Fathers free grace; where there is no
hope, there can be no right endeavour; if hope
fail, all endeavours fail.</p>
               <p>Nay further, while men are without hope, they
muſt needs be in a ſinful polluted condition, for it
is hope that purgeth the ſoul, and purifieth the
heart; Having this hope, let us cleanſe our ſelves,
and he that hath this hope, he is pure, even as he
is pure; he looks after purity, as God is pure: that
men go on to defile themſelves, and to work all
manner of iniquity, it is becauſe that they have
no true hope toward God: Truly this doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that many men have no hope in God, becauſe
they live at ſuch a diſtance from God, and are not
kept cloſe to God; nay, they are contented to
live at a diſtance from God, and will not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſeeking after Chriſt: Wherefore I beſeech
you think upon it, what a ſad condition it is to be
at Sea without an anchor, your hearts would melt
within you to ſee a ſhip driven with ſtorms upon
the rocks, and no anchor to caſt out; yet this is
the condition of many thouſands in the world,
they are at ſea, and ready to ſplit upon the rocks,
and no anchor of hope; O that the Lord would
make many a heart ſenſible of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> As it is ſad to be without hope, ſo it
is more ſad to have a deceitful hope; for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
of hope is the greateſt torment that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:43429:233"/>
can befal a poor creature; better never to have
hope, then to have hope fruſtrated, to be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
the diſappointment of hope proves ſhame
and confuſion of face to men, <hi>Job 6. 20.</hi> they were
confounded becauſe they had hoped, they came
thither, and were aſhamed, they were deceived
of their expectation, and were confounded. Better
never to have hope, then to be diſappointed of
your hope: and in <hi>Job 11. 20.</hi> the hope of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt, it
ſhall be gone in a moment; as a man in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he breaths forth his ſpirit, and gives up the
ghoſt, ſo the hope of a wicked man ſoon periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Now look to your hope, that you may not
have ſuch hope as will be like the giving up of the
ghoſt, examine your hope, ſee whether it be ſuch
hope as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, that will be as an
anchor to the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt; whence
did your hope ariſe, I pray examine that, whether
it was from your ſelves, or from Chriſt; if your
hope be from any thing in your ſelves, it is hope
that will not hold, it is not ſure and ſtedfaſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what was the efficient cauſe of your hope,
how was this hope begotten in you? Did you ſee
that it was out of the hand of Chriſt, and that it
was begotten in you by the mighty power of God?
Did the Lord cauſe you to ſee that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that you ſhould create hope in your ſelves, til
Chriſt come &amp; beget hope in you? Know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if it were not a hope of Chriſt's begetting, it
is an anchor that will not hold. Again, examine
what it was that faſtned your hope, Was it the
word of the Lord that made you to hope, the ſure
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:43429:233"/>
word of promiſe? Was it the word of man, or the
word of the Lord, if it were any thing but the word
of the Lord that made you to hope, your hope
will not hold. Examine alſo upon what ground
your hope is caſt, Is it caſt upon the arm of fleſh,
or upon the arm of the Lord; what-ever hope is
caſt upon the arm of fleſh will not hold. Examine
alſo whether your hope be caſt upon the free grace
of God, or upon the things of the world, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
in the world, there are thouſands in the
world that caſt the anchor of their hope upon the
mammon of this world, becauſe God hath proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the world, and given them abundance
of theſe outward good things, therefore they hope
that God loveth them, and will give them another
world; but if your anchor of hope be caſt upon
your gold, or your great eſtate, and not-upon the
free grace of God, it will deceive you. Upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it be caſt beſide God and Chriſt, it will not
hold; if it be caſt upon your duties, your deſires,
and good meanings, and endeavours, your prayers,
and tears, your charity, if the anchor of your hope
be caſt upon theſe, it will not hold; yea, if it be
caſt upon your graces, your hope will not hold:
for whatſoever is made the ground of hope beſide
Chriſt, is the arm of fleſh, even grace, and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of grace in the ſoul, they become fleſh, if
made the ground of our hope. Now I beſeech you
look to your hope, for certainly the hope of moſt
men is not of the right ſtamp, what-ever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
How do many deceive themſelves, God is
not in all their thoughts, nor in any of their wayes,
and yet have hope toward God. You ſay you have
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:43429:234"/>
hope in God, and yet your hope doth not purifie
your hearts, but as wicked as ever, walking in the
wayes of your own heart, and ſatisfying your own
luſts, what-ever theſe men pretend, they have not
hope of the right ſtamp, their hope is but as the
ſpiders web, or as the giving up of the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> Let me exhort you all to look after this
ſaving lively hope, for it is that which will keep
your hearts from breaking in the evil time, at one
time or other the heart will break, if men have not
this ſaving hope; therefore ſeek after this ſaving
hope, for it will keep you up in the midſt of ſtorms,
in the midſt of evils, and eſtabliſh you in the midſt
of good, it will do you good in a ſtorm, and it will
be uſeful to you in a calm; you can never take
comfort in the good things you enjoy, and your
hearts cannot be eſtabliſhed in peace, if not
grounded in hope; therefore look after this live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope, this anchor of the ſoul; yea ſoul, wouldſt
thou dwell with God, and live neer God, and live
upon him continually? O then caſt the anchor of
your hope in God, true hope will hold your ſouls
cloſe to him, that you ſhall not depart from him.
Yea, would you have your hearts made more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
purified, and ſanctified, and get victory over
your corruptions? O then ſeek after this ſaving
hope; for that man that hath his hope caſt on God,
and Chriſt, that man is moſt free from corruption,
and moſt active for God; true hope it will make
you able to ſuffer, it will make you able to rejoyce
in tribulation; why now, doſt thou deſire all this?
why then ſeek after this lively hope.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will ſay unto me, how ſhall
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:43429:234"/>
we obtain this hope? I ſee it is exceeding uſeful,
and of abſolute neceſſity, how ſhall we come by it?
where ſhall we have this anchor to ſtay our ſouls?</p>
               <p>For anſwer.<note place="margin">How to obtain true hope.</note> Firſt, Look to the free grace of
God in Chriſt for it, 'tis he that doth beget this
grace of hope in his people; look to thoſe tenders
that free grace makes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God holds forth his ſelf,
and Son, and pardon, and life to poor creatures;
Free grace makes a render of all this unto you, and
therefore look to this free grace, that ſo you may
have that hope which ſhall not be confounded and
aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look to Chriſt for it eſpecially, look
to the reſurrection of Chriſt; that place <hi>1 Pet. 1.
3. Bleſſed be God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath
begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Chriſt is riſen
from the dead, he hath paid the debt, and brought
in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and therefore look to
the reſurrection of Chriſt, for by eying that, this
lively hope may be begotten in you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Look to the promiſe, to the word of
the Lord; the word of the Lord is written that
you might have hope, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. For whatſoever
things were written aforetime, were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of
the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> The Scripture is
written that we might believe, and in believing
might have eternal life, and therefore conſult with
the word of the Lord. You that deſire to have
hope ſtrengthned, look to the word and promiſes,
and behold the freeneſs of them, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:43429:235"/>
of God in them. O ſtudy the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
much, and beg that the Spirit of the Lord
may ſhine in them, and give you a ſight in them,
and ſo this hope may be begotten in you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Look to thoſe patterns and examples
of free grace that the Lord ſet forth for you to
look upon; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 16. ſaith,
<hi>He was a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him to life everlaſting:</hi> That the Lord
ſhould reconcile ſuch an enemy, and ſet his love
upon him that was injurious to the Saints, one that
thought he had ſinned ſo much as that he had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinned
mercy, yet ſaith he, I obtained grace, that
might be a pattern of mercy; and therefore look
to thoſe patterns of grace and mercy that the Lord
hath ſet forth before you, that ſo you may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to come and hope in his mercy.</p>
               <p>And to conclude all, do not go on deſperately
any longer, and do not ſay as they ſaid, <hi>Jer. 2. 25.
But thou ſaidſt there is no hope; No, for I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſtrangers, and after them will I go.</hi> They reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to go on in the imaginations of their own
heart, they ſaid there was no hope, and they would
do evil as they had done. O let not this be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of any poor ſoul, for though you have no
hope for the preſent, you are invited to come to
Chriſt that you may have hope; The word of the
Lord is come to you that you might have hope, and
thoſe patterns of free grace are ſet before you,
that you might have hope. O that the Lord
would make you more intent in your ſpirits, in
looking after this anchor of hope; What will
you do another day, when ſtorms ariſe, and to have
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:43429:235"/>
no anchor? It will be a moſt ſad condition for a
poor ſoul, to ſee it ſelf ready to ſplit, and to have
no hope, no anchor to ſtay upon. O! who would
venture to Sea without an anchor? If you have
no anchor when ſtorms ariſe, you will be at your
wits end. O that God betimes (before it be too
late) would make you as wiſe for your ſouls, as you
would be for your bodies.</p>
