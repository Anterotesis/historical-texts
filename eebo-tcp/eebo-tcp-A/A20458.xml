            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Geometrie for the certayntie thereof haue suche a priuiledge as fewe other Sciences, béeing so fortified with Demonstration that no Precepte or Rule thereof for the veritie can be reproued, yet least some, either of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce or malice shoulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it vnprofitable, not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to any necessarie vse in a publike Weale, I thought good somewhat to say thereof, and firste the sentence of <hi>Plato</hi> written at the entrie into his Schole commeth to my remembraunce, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. therby excluding al such as were ignoraunt of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie as vnable or vnméete to attayn higher secrets or misteries of Philosophie. <hi>Aristotle</hi> also intreating of Morall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, in the fifth Booke of his <hi>Ethikes,</hi> with geometricall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures most beautifully paynteth out Iustice, discerning and seuerally comparing sundrie partes thereof with Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Arithmeticall proportions. But his Interpreters, whose works are yet extante, for want of skill in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, haue so blemished, darkned and defaced his meaning, that scarcely any resemblance thereof shall to the Reader appeare.
<pb facs="tcp:11955:4"/>
In sundrie other his works also of naturall Philosophie, as the <hi>Physikes, Meteores, de Coelo &amp; Mundo. &amp;c.</hi> ye shal finde sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> that without <hi>Geometrie</hi> may not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be vnderstanded. And to leue Philosophie, how necessarie it is to attayne exacte knowledge in <hi>Astronomie, Musike, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue, Cosmographie</hi> and <hi>Nauigation,</hi> with many other Sciences and faculties, who so meanely trauayleth therein shall soone finde. But to omitte talking of <hi>Geometrie</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and to speake priuately of this Treatize, I thinke good first to open the order and effect thereof, and then somewhat to saye of the applyances. Like as euery body geometricall is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with <hi>Superficies,</hi> and euery <hi>Superficies</hi> inclosed with lines, so that it consisteth of these thrée, <hi>Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profunditie,</hi> and without consideration of these thrée no solide may be measured: so is this Treatise also diuided into thrée Bookes. The first entreating of lines sheweth sundry meanes to measure all maner lengthes, heightes, distances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundities. The seconde termed <hi>Planimetra</hi> settes foorth diuerse meanes and rules to measure manyfolde superficies, playne Conuex and Concaue, whether they be compounde with straighte or circulare lines, or mixte of bothe. In the thirde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Stereometria,</hi> is sette out the exacte mensuration of sundry solides, replenished with a number of rules and preceptes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of <hi>Euclide, Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Appolonius Pergeus</hi> his <hi>Conykes,</hi> wherein the Reader shall not a little delighte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the finenesse and subtiltie of their inuentions, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he indeuor himselfe to search out the reason, cause and demonstration of them. And nowe somewhat to speake of the commoditie of these conclusions, as the skilfull in Architecture can applye the <hi>Stereometria</hi> to serue his turne in preordinance and forecasting both of the charges, quantities and proportion of all parcels necessarily appertayning to any kinde of buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: so <hi>Planimetra</hi> maye serue for disposing all manner grounde plattes of Cities, Townes, Fortes, Castles, Pallaces
<pb facs="tcp:11955:5"/>
or other edifices. The Marshall of the fielde shall also moste spéedely thereby appoynt place conuenient for his Campe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing euery parte thereof according to the number of his men, horse, cariage. &amp;c. Also in suruaying, parting and diuiding of Lands and woods, it is most requisite aswell for exact as spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye dispatch therin, and therof we haue notable recorde in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories how much this science auayled the Egiptians when as by the inundation of <hi>Nylus</hi> their whole countrey was so drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that with slime of the water all their Bounds and marks were defaced: Yet certayne wise men ayded with knowledge in this science, founde out and distributed to euery man his owne. The other parte named <hi>Longimetra</hi> the ingeniouse practizioner wil apply to <hi>Topographie,</hi> fortification, conducting of mines vnder the earth, and shooting of greate ordinance. So that as there is no kinde of man, of what vocation or degrée so euer he be, but shall finde matter both to exercise his witte and diuersly to pleasure him selfe, so surely for a gentleman especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that professech the warres, aswell for discoueries made by sea, as fortification, placing of Campes, &amp; conducting of Armies on the lande, how necessarie it is to be able exactly to describe the true plattes, symetrie and porportion of Fortes, campes, townes and countryes, coastes &amp; harboroughes, I thinke there are none so vnskilfull, but will confesse these Geometricall mensurations most requisite. But if any there be so rude, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte and vnlearned, or so much blinded with selfe liking, that can not be content to acknowledge any thing requisite in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite souldier that is wanting in them selues (for suche surely they are that moste arrogantly will maintayne this fonde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) let them but regard and marke the renoumed Captaine <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who had this knowledge in such high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that he seldome or neuer in his manifoulde conquests wold attempt any thing, whether it wer fort, toune or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, but first he would haue the exacte <hi>Topographie</hi> therof, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon

It is also to be wayed how this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of highnesse and lownesse is to be accompted, some suppose that all places lying in a straight leuel line from the spring hed, are of one heigth, which opinion is erronious, because the water (being an heauy body as the earth is) presseth and tendeth alway to the center. And in all his courses (being not violently forced contrary to his nature) moueth downeward, or at the least vniformly and equodistantly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that centre. Wherby it is manifest that no spring can of his own nature run in leuel or right line fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hed, for this equidistant course to the centre, is an arke or portion of a circle. But euery leuel right line (considering it is a contingent or touch line) is caryed aboue the circumference, and the farther it is extended, the farther dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te it is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Centre, so that either the water must make his course vpward vtterly contrary to his nature, or else it shall decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel right line. In déede the globe of the earth &amp; water being so great, any smal Arke or portion of their Circumference will not sensibly differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a straight line.

it is not possible for the water naturally to runne thither.

Yt may séeme superfluous more to write of these matters, yet to finishe this treatise, I thinke it not amisse to shew how you may ioyne these thrée in one, whereby you shall frame an instrument of such perfection, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner altitude, latitude, longitude, or profunditie can offer it selfe, howsoeuer it be situate, which you may not both readely and most exactly measure. You shall therfore first prepare some large foure square pullished plate of Latin, wherein you may describe your Geometrical square, his sides diuided in 1200 parts at the lest, with index and sightes as was before shewed: describing also within the same square the <hi>Planisphere</hi> or circle called <hi>Theodelitus,</hi> then must you vppon an other fine pullished plate, drawe your Quadrant, or rather a semicircle diuided iustly into 180 grades, and within the same a double scale: euery side contayning at the leste an 120 partes, finally, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the dimetient thereof two sightes perpendicularly reared, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quedistantly persed, so as the line visuall may passe parallele to that dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.
