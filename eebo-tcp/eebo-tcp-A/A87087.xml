         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The laſt proceedings from the Scots Army</head>
            <p>MAach the 25 and 26 there was a great fight neere Sunderland, there was of the Scots about 300 wounded, ſome of them ſlain, and others ſince dead to the number of about 60, this was all the loſſe we ſuſtained in that fight, which was within ſome 2 miles of the north of Sunderland: But of the Earl of Newcaſtles men there were ſlain at the leaſt 1500 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which were divers of great quality: Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduke Langdale</hi> was ſlain and divers of great note, ſome of them his Excellencie Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> gave them the credit of an honourable buriall according to their degree a,mongſt which were at the leaſt 30 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, Majors, Captains, and Lievtenants, beſides other Officers, and there were taken priſoners from the enemie almoſt a hundred. They retreated towards Newcaſtle, the Scots purſued them very cloſe, Then the Earle of Newcaſtles Forces ſpread themſelves and diſperced towards Cheſtry ſtreete and ſo to Durham, and quartered towards Biſhop Auckland, and Branſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pith to ſee it they could rally their men, but the Scots ſtill purſued them, cleering the way up the River as they went.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155102:3"/>March the twentie ſeventh, the Scots marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lumley Caſtle to cleer the River for Coals, his Excellencie the Lord Generall having then eight pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance carried from the ſhips, for before hee had only two peeces, ſave only his ſmall pieces wherewith good execution was done.</p>
            <p>From the twentie ſeventh of March, to the end of the moneth, the Scots were and ſo are ſtill in purſuit of the enemie: the Earle of Newcaſtle all this while: not having taken a man of the Scots Armie to my knowledge, but there are daily many that deſert the enemie, and come into us both from Newcaſtle, and alſo from the Armie, ſeven or eight everie day: ſome daies more, who take the Covenant and join with our forces: there hath thus come in at the leaſt 200 and more come in daily: declaring that they were forced againſt their wils to fight under the Earl of Newcaſtle, and that in the fight the Earl of Newcaſtles horſe did force them to fight, and kept them in with their Canes and Swords: &amp; hurt, piſtold, and ſlue many that retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and they do alſo affirm, that there are many more in the Earle of Newcaſtles Armie that would faine come away, if they had an opportunitie.</p>
            <p>Since there hath been many skirmiſhes, but none conſiderable before the date hereof, but the Scots ſtill purſue the enemie to prevent them as much as they can from Rallying.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are come from Morpeth, and are all at Sunderland. The laſt of the Commiſſioners came to Sunderland this preſent Munday, being the firſt of April: which is a place where is great ſtore of proviſion, ſo that from thence Thurſday before, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="tcp:155102:3"/>
               <hi>Leſhley</hi> removed his Quarters, and carried away bag and baggage: only 3000 he left for that Garriſon, and another neere it, and hath fortified the Town verie well, and ſecured all places as he leaves them. But an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of the enemie lying towards Lumly Caſtle; hath hindred the Lighters from carrying the Coals to the ſhips; but there was a Convoy to have gone with them to the ſhips, had not the battle prevented, but there is no doubt but the enemie will be removed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, and Coals ſent ſpeedily to London: There are about 120 ſhips that ride in Sunderland Harbour for Coals, and there is ſo great a quantitie of Coals alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die above the ground at the Pits readie to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that they are not to be valued: there is ſo vaſt a quantitie: and the Commiſſioners are reſolved upon this courſe, to ſerve thoſe ſhips firſt with Coals that bring proviſion; which is but reaſon, their being ſuch want of proviſion amongſt our men, not only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Armie; but alſo to encourage others that come for coals thither to bring proviſion with them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho: Glenham</hi> is in Newcaſtle, but few co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderable men of note, nor as ſome that come out from thence to our men, certifie not above 120 Souldiers beſides the Inhabitants, and they have denied the Earle of Newcaſtle to come in or any of his Forcrs: more then what are in the Town already, till they ſee who ſhall win the field.</p>
            <p>The Town begins to be much ſtraitned of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are out of hope to have any relieſe, eſpecially ſince the Earl of Newcaſtle is driven Southward, and the Scots compaſſe the Town both by Sea and Land, in Northumberland and in the Biſhodrick, and they
<pb facs="tcp:155102:4"/>
are blockt up by water, our Forces commanding the River.</p>
            <p>The Scots are every day at Gatehead; which they take great care to prevent the enemie from burning themſelves being poſſeſt thereof, but the enemies Works there are all pulled down and demoliſhed, only a partie are placed to prevent the enemie from iſſuing out of the Town to deſtroy thoſe Suburbs, and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at Gatehead.</p>
            <p>By all probabilitie, it is not any ways likely that Newcaſtle can hold out long; and the Scots doe daily expect when they will found a parley about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up thereof.</p>
            <p>Generall <hi>Leſhley</hi> is marched towards Durham, and the Maqueſſe of <hi>Argile</hi> goes along with him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobilitie: purſuing the Earle of Newcaſtle. A Regiment lies at Blyth, and two Regiments at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, who doe often iſſue out to face Newcaſtle, and to keep the Countrie from being further waſted and ſpoiled by the enemy.</p>
            <p>There are two Regiments that lie at Sunderland, and a Regiment about a mile off: In Sunderland are about 100 priſoners of the Earl of Newcaſtles Forces, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, Captains and other Officers, for common men, they turn them away and will not charge themſelves with keeping of ſuch only thoſe of note.</p>
            <p>Generall <hi>Leſhley</hi> is ſtill in purſuit of the Enemie, not permitting them to rally.</p>
