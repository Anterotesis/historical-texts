            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are this day met together to
humble ourselves for our sins
before God, and to implore his
mercy to this Nation, in the
Preserving our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi>
our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Lives,</hi>
and in Blessing the present Publick Counsels in
order thereunto.</p>
            <p>And never was a work of this nature more
seasonable or more necessary than at this time,
and to us of this Kingdom: For as our <hi>sins</hi> were
never greater, never cried louder to Heaven for
Vengeance, so the <hi>Judgments</hi> they deserve did
never more visibly threaten us than they do at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98157:3"/>
this Day. Insomuch that if our circumstances
be duly considered, we may have just reason to
apprehend, that our Saviour in the <hi>way</hi> of his
<hi>Providence</hi> does now speak to the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> the same words, that he ordered
St. <hi>John</hi> by the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Letter</hi> to speak to the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Ephesus. Remember from whence thou art fallen,
and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come
unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out
of his place, except thou repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as also the other six
Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> to each of which St. <hi>John</hi> by
the command of our Saviour doth here address
a several Epistle, were at the time when these
Letters were dictated very flourishing Churches,
favoured as much with the especial presence and
influence of Christ, as ever any Churches were.</p>
            <p>This appears from the Preface to this Epistle
in the first Verse of this Chapter, wherein Christ
the Author of the Epistle is described, as <hi>holding
the seven Stars in his right hand, and walking in the
midst of the seven Golden Candlesticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>seven Stars</hi> are the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>seven
Churches</hi> as he himself Interprets them,<note place="margin">Cap. i. 20.</note> that is,
according to the sence of all Antiquity, The
<hi>Bishops</hi> the <hi>Presidents,</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> of those
Churches. His <hi>holding them in his hand,</hi> is his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and directing them for the good of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98157:3"/>
people. The <hi>seven Golden Candlesticks</hi> in the
midst of which he walked,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> are, as he himself
likewise expounds them, the <hi>seven Churches</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as being the places where those <hi>Stars,</hi>
those <hi>Lights</hi> did shine. And his <hi>walking among
those Candlesticks</hi> is his presence in those Churches,
Encouraging or Reproving, Rewarding or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the members of them as there was cause,
having the power in his hands, either to continue
those Lights among them, or to remove them
to another place.</p>
            <p>I insist on the Explication of this passage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it lets us <hi>in to</hi> the meaning of the phrase
that we meet with in the Text of <hi>removing the
Candlestick out of its place,</hi> which from hence we
plainly see to be the <hi>Un-Churching</hi> any people, the
withdrawing the Light of the Gospel from them.</p>
            <p>Well, But this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to which
the Epistle I am now concerned in was written,
how much soever Christ had done for them, had
it seems made but a bad requital of his kindnesses.<note place="margin">Cap. ii. 2, 3.</note>
At first indeed they had walked very worthily,
and are much commended by our Saviour, for
their <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but
now they were fallen to a great degree of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and remissness.</p>
            <p>It is true they at this time continued Orthodox
in their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> they did both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98157:4"/>
know and profess the true Religion, and were
Zealous against false Doctrines, which also our
Saviour takes notice of and commends them for,
<hi>This,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V, 6.</note> saith he, <hi>thou hast, That thou hatest the deeds
of the</hi> Nicolaitans <hi>which I also hate,</hi> but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
so offended was he with the <hi>Loss
of their first Love,</hi> the decay of <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
among them, that he threatens them solemnly
in the Text, <hi>That if they did not repent, and do the
first works, he would remove their Candlestick out of
its place,</hi> that is, as I said, he would withdraw
from them his <hi>presence</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of his <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a brief account of my Text as to the
first design and litteral meaning of it, that is,
as it concerns the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
leave to make such Application of it to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as may be subservient to the ends designed
in the Solemnity of this Day.</p>
            <p>And we have warrant enough to make such an
<hi>Application;</hi> for let us not flatter ourselves, what
is here <hi>Reproved,</hi> and what is here <hi>Threatened,</hi>
hath not such a peculiar respect to the particular
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but that it doth equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
all Churches so far as they fall under the
same Character. Which whether we at this day
day do or no, it is fit we should seriously examine
ourselves about.</p>
            <p>Here are three things considerable in the Text.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98157:4"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> a great <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Guilt,</hi> supposed. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
a great <hi>Judgment</hi> denounced for that <hi>Guilt,</hi> no less
than the <hi>Un-Churching</hi> of that people that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the means prescribed for the
averting that Judgment, <hi>viz. Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Application of the Text shall proceed
upon the same Heads, that is,</p>
            <p>I shall <hi>first</hi> desire leave to enquire, whether
we of this Nation, at this day, for our manifold
<hi>sins</hi> and <hi>guilt,</hi> may not be judged to be in as bad or
worse circumstances than the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
in the Text, and consequently have not just reason
to fear the same <hi>Judgment</hi> that they are here
threatned with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall consider the <hi>Judgment</hi> here
threatened, how grievous a one it is, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
how great an argument the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it ought to be to us all to <hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall speak somthing of this <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
how it ought to be exprest, if we would
thereby prevent the <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first of these points, which
concerns our <hi>sin</hi> and our <hi>guilt,</hi> to make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the <hi>Spiritual Maladies</hi> and Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that this Nation groans under, those <hi>publick
grievances</hi> by which the Holy Spirit of God is
provoked to withdraw himself from us, and to
give us up to the Power and Dominion of other
Masters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98157:5"/>
This I must confess, is a very melancholy
and unpleasing Argument, but yet very necessary
to be insisted on, and that very freely too: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
upon such an occasion as this; and most of
all, when I speak to those whose Concernment,
and whose Care it is to inspect these Matters, and
from whom we hope for a Cure of our Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>It is here taken notice of the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
to her commendation, that she retained the
truth <hi>of the Christian Doctrine</hi> in opposition to the
<hi>Heresies</hi> of those times, and this, God be thanked,
may be spoke of us at this day, we are not much
degenerated from the purity of Christianity as to
Doctrinals. Our Church may vie with all the
Churches in the world, for Orthodoxy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Primitive Church in matters of
Faith.</p>
            <p>And, blessed be Gods Name, this Light is not
put under a Bushel. There is perhaps no Church
since the Apostles time wherein the <hi>Divine-Truth</hi>
hath been more publickly and more purely
taught, or the <hi>Sacraments</hi> more rightly and duely
Administred than among us, and no Church
wherein <hi>Knowledg</hi> has more abounded among
all the members of it than it does now in Ours.</p>
            <p>But the thing that is charged upon the Church
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> is their corrnption in Manners, and
this is the point we are now concerned in, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98157:5"/>
which tis fit the whole Nation should examine
themselves upon, and deeply lay to heart.</p>
            <p>Though we still keep up the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi>
yet have we not in a great measure lost the <hi>power</hi>
thereof? Though the Principles which our Church
<hi>Owneth</hi> and <hi>Professeth</hi> be excellently good; Yet
do not many of us horribly contradict them in
our <hi>Practices?</hi> Is there not a visible decay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Piety to be observed among us, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Vice and Wickedness of all sorts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading
the face of the Land?</p>
            <p>I speak not here of the faults of this or the other
particular person, for we know there was never
any Age nor any Religion that was free from
such, but I speak of the National sins, the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vices of the Times, the miscarriages that
are so prevailing and so common that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
guilt is contracted by them, and the whole
people may justly share in the punishment of
them.</p>
            <p>I must confess, to speak strictly, the Degrees
and Proportions in which any Age grows better
or worse than those that went before it, are not
easily to be measured, unless we could live the
space of several Ages, and out of our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
make observations and remarks upon
them. All that we have to make our estimate
by, is the Histories and Records that are left us
of the state of former Ages with which we may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98157:6"/>
compare our own; But yet this way is often very
fallacious, because it is the common humour and
custom of men, even of those that transmit the
Memoires of their own Times to Posterity, still
to complain of their own Times most, and to
prefer the former Ages before that in which
they live.</p>
            <p>Upon this consideration I shall not be forward
to draw a comparison between the former times
and ours in order to the shewing how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our <hi>sins</hi> are than of those that went before us,
and consequently how much riper we are now
for <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most certain it is, That God, as he has done
to the Sea, so has he to every Nation, <hi>set its bounds</hi>
of wickedness <hi>beyond which they shall not pass;</hi> and
when their iniquities are at full he will not fail
to repay vengeance into their Bosom. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi>
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many other Nations I might
name have been said instances of this kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>But when a Nation is come to that Fatal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
none knows but God, and whether we are
not already very near it we cannot tell, but we
ought infinitely to fear.</p>
            <p>Too evident it is, that things are in a very
bad posture among us, and our sins are grown
to that height, that it is a Miracle of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
patience and long-suffering that we are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98157:6"/>
not already consumed. Let us be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>If the prevailing of <hi>Atheism</hi> in a Land, and
the contempt of God and Religion:</p>
            <p>If open <hi>Lewdness</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality</hi>
of all kinds:</p>
            <p>If the turning <hi>Religion</hi> into a mere piece of
<hi>Formality,</hi> and <hi>outward profession:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> in a
Church:</p>
            <p>And lastly, if our general <hi>Unthankfulness</hi> for
and <hi>Unprofitableness</hi> under the means of Grace,
and the many mercies and privileges that have
been vouchsafed us.</p>
            <p>If any or all of these sins can provoke God to
forsake a Nation and give it up to ruin (and yet
these sins are both in the Scripture, and by the
ordinary course of Gods providence especially
markt out for such) then are we of this Nation
at this time in a very deplorable condition, and
are to expect Judgment without Mercy, unless
it be prevented by a speedy Reformation.</p>
            <p>For <hi>first</hi> of all, was there ever more <hi>Atheism</hi> and
<hi>Irreligion</hi> in a <hi>Christian</hi> Nation, at least in a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Christian</hi> Nation; or more countenance
given to such <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> as directly
tend thereto than now among us!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98157:7"/>
There are not many perhaps that dare in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
terms affirm <hi>That there is no God,</hi> because
they know it is not safe so to do: But many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it by consequence, by asserting such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from whence it must necessarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>For what is the consequence of such Doctrines
as these; That there is nothing but <hi>Body</hi> in the
world, and that the very Notion of a <hi>Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal</hi>
Being implies a contradiction; That
there is nothing <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Unjust, Virtuous</hi> or <hi>Vitious</hi>
in itself, but as it is made so by the Laws of the
Kingdom. That all things come to pass by a
<hi>Fatal Necessity,</hi> and that no man is so <hi>free</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi>
as to be capable of Rewards and Punishments
for his Actions: What is the result of these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
but the necessary introducing of <hi>Atheism</hi>
and the banishing <hi>Religion</hi> from among men?
It being upon these Principles, not only a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
impetinent, but an absurd contradictious
thing.</p>
            <p>And yet are not these the avowed Principles
of too many among us, and those too that are
the great pretenders to <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Philosophy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what has been the effect of such <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy?</hi>
Why suitable enough to the Notions of it.
You may meet with those that make no scruple
to scoff at God and every thing that relates to the
other world, and to turn into <hi>Ridicule</hi> every thing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98157:7"/>
that is Sacred. And he is accounted the <hi>Great
Spirit</hi> that <hi>thinks</hi> freely, and dares <hi>speak</hi> boldly
what he <hi>thinks.</hi> And if a man will set up for a
<hi>Wit</hi> he cannot take a more effectual course to gain
him that Reputation in many Companies, than
to be confident and peremptory in contradicting
the common Sentiments of men as to <hi>Religion,</hi>
To be able to <hi>Burlesque</hi> the Scriptures humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
To be dexterous in imploying Religious
Phrases to Scurrilous Purposes, and to Baffle
and Droll out of countenance those that stand
up for the Reputation of Sacred things.</p>
            <p>As the world goes, it is a piece of <hi>virtue</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a God and Providence, and future Rewards
and Punishments, with the other Principles of
Natural Religion; They do very well that go
thus far. But as for <hi>Instituted Reveald</hi> Religion,
for instance <hi>Christianity,</hi> How many are there
that think themselves no way concerned in it,
but hold it in the same rank with <hi>Judaism</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanism?</hi>
And if they profess <hi>that</hi> rather than
either of <hi>these,</hi> it is only because they were born
and bred up in it; It is the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi>
where they live; but if either of the other should
be set up in the place of it, they would as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
conform to that.</p>
            <p>One would think that such men as these should
not be found in a <hi>Country</hi> that calls itself <hi>Christian,</hi>
much less in a <hi>Christian Country</hi> that calls itself <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98157:8"/>
And yet such is the <hi>infelicity</hi> and the <hi>fault</hi>
of ours, that men of these Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do abound among us. O Blessed God!
Whither shall we come at last if timely care be
not taken of these things?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> If to the <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi>
that reigns among us we add the open <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Debauchery</hi> that is every where to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in our days, how much blacker will our
guilt appear?</p>
            <p>Where is that Antient <hi>Seriousness</hi> and <hi>Reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Modesty</hi> that heretofore has been thought
not only essential to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi>
but <hi>Natural</hi> to the <hi>Temper</hi> of an <hi>Englishman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alass! We seem to have changed not only our
<hi>Religion</hi> but our <hi>Climate</hi> too. And may for Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness
and Luxury, for Pride and Vanity and
Idleness compare with the antient <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> and
do perhaps out-strip several of our present neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Nations, though of a worse Religion.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, so much are we degenerated
from the antient strictness of Christianity, That
those things that would not have been named
among the first Christians without horror and
banishing out of their Society all those that did
them, are frequently practised among us. And
those Vices that even in the worse times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
the Actors were affraid or ashamed to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98157:8"/>
own, are now made a matter of Sport and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
a <hi>Trick</hi> of <hi>Youth,</hi> a <hi>Humour,</hi> or a <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
What was then a deed of darkness, is now
too often done in the face of the Sun, and the
persons concerned in the wickedness are so far
from blushing at their guilt, that they relate their
own actions as a pleasant entertainment for their
Company.</p>
            <p>O the Riots and Drunkenness; the Frauds
and Cousenage; the Filthy and Lewd speeches;
the Whoredoms and Adulteries; the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Oaths and Imprecations that are dayly
without any regret, any sense of shame, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
among us.</p>
            <p>We seem to have lost not only the virtue of
<hi>Modesty</hi> but of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> too (if so <hi>bad</hi> a thing
may be called by so <hi>good</hi> a name.) Those Vices
and Lewdnesses which heretofore sought corners
and wore a Mask do now appear with a naked
Face.</p>
            <p>It is true, It is to be hoped, That the greatest
part of us are not guilty of such Crimes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities
as we speak of: But this does not
wholly excuse us; For we are all faulty in this,
That these kind of Vices are not sufficiently
branded and put out of countenance. They
pass under <hi>easie,</hi> not to say, <hi>Creditable</hi> names.
And so little a sense have we of them that a man
may keep his Reputation among us though he be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98157:9"/>
never so Vicious, supposing that his Vices be of
the Mode of the Country. This very thing
without our personal guilt makes the <hi>sin a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
sin;</hi> and God will Visit these things upon us,
except we Repent.</p>
            <p>But to make up the measure of our Iniquities,
we can in the <hi>Third</hi> place live after this dissolute
rate, and yet at the same time many of us think
ourselves <hi>Religious:</hi> we increase the guilt of our
<hi>Prophaneness</hi> by joyning <hi>Formality</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>If we would disclaim all Religion when we
led such wretchedly careless and sensual lives, it
would in some respects be more tolerable: For
then Christianity would not suffer by us, It
would get no <hi>Odium,</hi> no Ignominy in the world,
It would not be an occasion to men to turn Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists:</p>
            <p>But to live <hi>Un-Christian</hi> lives and yet to call
ourselves <hi>Christians:</hi> Nay to make our <hi>Religion</hi> a
Sanctuary for our <hi>Vices,</hi> and to think that we
may the more freely Indulge ourselves in them
because we are of the Right Religion; This is
intolerable, and extremely aggravates the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of our practices. And yet this is a fault
that we of this Nation are notoriously guilty
of.</p>
            <p>We often make Religion to consist in Opinion
and outward Profession. If we have but once
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98157:9"/>
joined ourselves to that party of Christians
which we think is the Right and do Espouse all
their <hi>Controversies</hi> and are Zealous in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of their particular <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are distinguished from the other <hi>Sects</hi>
that are in being among us, we think we are
true <hi>Saints,</hi> let our <hi>Morals</hi> be what they will.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Religion</hi> that is every where too
much in Fashion. If for instance I have Listed
my self a Member of some <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(as there is great variety of them) If I be
but true to the Principles of my <hi>Church,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
in opposing those that are not of my
Way; and constant in my attendance upon the
<hi>Brethren</hi> at their <hi>Assemblies:</hi> This Zeal of mine
will excuse a multitude of my other Failings:
And though I now and then use indirect ways of
Dealing in my Calling; Though I be Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and Censorious; Though I affront Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and live in a constant Disobedience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Laws of it, yet my fervour for that
which I take to be the <hi>True Religion</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
I stand in to the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>God</hi> will bear me
out as to these matters.</p>
            <p>On the other side, If I be a Member of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I am too often apt to think
my self in a fair way to Heaven, if I be but <hi>Stout</hi>
for the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> against the <hi>Sectaries,</hi>
and punctual in observing the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98157:10"/>
               <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and now and then come to the <hi>Sacrament;</hi>
Though it may be I have nothing of the True
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christianity in me, nothing of
that Sobriety and Meekness, and Charity, and
inward Devotion that our Saviour doth indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
require of all his followers.</p>
            <p>Nay so far from that it may be I think'tis no
matter how I live, if I be but a good <hi>Subject</hi> to the
<hi>King</hi> and a true <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Nay it is
well if don't go further, it is well if I don't make
<hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> an essential Character of a
man that is right in his Principles; it is well if I
don't brand seriousness of Conversation, and a
care of ones words and actions with the name
of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and reproach every one as a <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
that will not Swear and Drink and take those
Un-Christian Liberties that I do.</p>
            <p>You know there are such men as these fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be found in all the several <hi>Sects</hi> and
<hi>Ways</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> among us. But O! What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Christianity all the while.</p>
            <p>This sure cannot be thy Religion, O Blessed
Jesus! since it is so unlike both thy Actions and
thy Doctrines: Thou never placedst any virtue
or praise in <hi>Knowing</hi> but in <hi>Doing;</hi> In being of this
or the other particular external <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi>
but in <hi>believing</hi> thy <hi>Gospel</hi> and <hi>following</hi> thy <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
in Mortifying our Lusts, and leading a life
of Peaceableness, and Obedience, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98157:10"/>
and all manner of inward Holiness and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>How our Brethren of the <hi>Separation</hi> will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of their Members that are of this temper,
I know not; But as to all those that pretend to be
of our Communion, and yet live scandalous
lives, and think that their owning themselves
for the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> will make Atonement
for their Immoralities, It is to be feared they
have done us more hurt than ever they will do us
good. And unless they would Reform, it may
perhaps be wished that we were rid of them: Let
them declare themselves <hi>Fanaticks, Papists,</hi> Any
thing, rather than Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though by their Recession and going over
to the Enemies Camp we might possibly be so
weakened that we could not support ourselves,
but must be forced to fall under our Adversaries;
Yet I do not know whether even then the
Church would not be the better for it. And,
it would perhaps be more desireable to live
in a mean, low, afflicted condition without
such Company, than to govern the world with
it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These are not all the Maladies
which this distressed <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> labours
under: There is another Wound that is as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98157:11"/>
Wide and Bleeds as much as any of the rest:
And which, if timely care be not taken of it, may
cause her expiration as soon as any other.</p>
            <p>I mean the Unnatural, Un-Christian <hi>Feuds</hi>
and <hi>Divisions</hi> that are amongst us, our Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rent and torn into so many <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and the cruel and bitter <hi>Animosities</hi> with which
each party does prosecute the other. And all this,
if men would consider, for Little things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
things certainly not worth all this heat,
things that the Wisest and Best of the several
dissenting parties confess to be indifferent.</p>
            <p>O! How do men by these foolish and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Divisions weaken the common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
that all pretend at least to be concerned
for? What advantages are hereby given to the
Adversaries?</p>
            <p>It is likely indeed that as They first set on
foot, so They still continue to foment these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
They laugh at this opportunity of
making Proselytes to their Religion; and a
plentiful Harvest they have hereby Reaped to
themselves.</p>
            <p>But where is our wisdom in the mean time?
Have men no more understanding than to be
still hot and eager in their contentions about a
shadow, when there is an Enemy at the Gate,
that is in a fair way to take from us the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98157:11"/>
Some indeed may be apt to dispute which side
ought to comply, Whether the <hi>Dissenters</hi> ought
to come over to the <hi>Established Church,</hi> or the
<hi>Church</hi> to them? It is not now a time fully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the Merits of that Cause. But this may be
truly said, If men would be honest and sincere,
and mix no passion or worldly concernment
with their Religion, the Point would soon be
Decided on the Churches side.</p>
            <p>Every man that calls himself a <hi>Protestant</hi>
would think himself obliged to obey Lawful
Authority in all things where he was convinced
their commands were not Unlawful. And if
he could not with a safe Conscience come up to
it in <hi>all things,</hi> he would come up as far as he
could. And as for those things that he was not
satisfied about, as he would not Condemn or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Those that were persuaded, or practised o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
so neither would he raise any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in the Church by joyning himself to an
opposite Party.</p>
            <p>And on the other side Those that did Conform
to the Church in <hi>all things</hi> would not withdraw
their Charity from their fellow Christians for not
doing so much as They. Though they differed
from them in several Opinions, yet they would
joyn hands with them in all Christian Offices of
Mutual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and in a joynt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98157:12"/>
But alas! Things are not thus with us. And I
note it as a fault for which we ought deeply to
be affected this Day; And if men did duely weigh
the <hi>sinfulness</hi> and the <hi>danger</hi> that all <hi>Schisms</hi> and
<hi>Separations</hi> of this kind do bring upon a Nation,
they would be thus affected.</p>
            <p>If human conjectures about the Reasons and
Causes of Divine Judgments may be allowed,
it will appear from History and Experience that
there has been as much War and blood-shed
caused in the world; as many Nations desolated,
as many Churches Ruined, by the malignity
and evil influence of this <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> as any
other.</p>
            <p>And if ever God in judgment shall think fit
to give over this flourishing <hi>Church</hi> of ours as a
prey to that mighty <hi>Hunter,</hi> that would erect an
Universal <hi>Spiritual Monarchy</hi> to himself upon the
Ruines of all the particular <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
we should have good Reason to believe
that the unnecessary <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Quarrels</hi> among
ourselves had a great hand in bringing on the
<hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all appearance we of this Nation might be
Impregnable, as to our <hi>Religion,</hi> if those Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
amongst us, who have been so long sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Communion of our National
Church would once return into its bosom; that
we might all heartily join together in <hi>Loving</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98157:12"/>
               <hi>Assisting</hi> one another, and <hi>Opposing</hi> the publick
<hi>Adversary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Fifthly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> If the state of our <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Nation</hi> was not near so bad as I have now
represented it, Yet there is another thing still
that <hi>all,</hi> even the <hi>best</hi> of us, have reason to be
sensible of and to mourn for; as that which of
it self is sufficient to bring destruction upon us.
And that is our <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to God for his many
<hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Deliverances,</hi> and our <hi>Unprofitableness</hi>
under those <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> that he has been pleased
so long to afford us.</p>
            <p>I cannot call this a particular <hi>sin,</hi> It is, if you
will, an <hi>Aggravation</hi> of all the rest, or <hi>all</hi> of them
summed up together. However I give it a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
consideration, because it is a thing that
God has set a Mark upon, and has so far declared
his displeasure against it, that he has determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it a just cause to <hi>Un-people</hi> or <hi>Un-Church</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us that when a certain man
had Planted a Fig-Tree in his Vineyard and came
and sought Fruit thereon, and found none he said
unto the Dresser <hi>of his Vineyard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke xiii. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Behold these three
years I come seeking fruit on this Fig-Tree and find
none, cut it down it, why doth it cumber the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us apply this Parable to ourselves, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Reason of it will sufficiently prompt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98157:13"/>
us. Was ever <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> or <hi>Vineyard</hi> more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Planted, more carefully Drest, more richly
Manured, more securely Fenced, from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
of Beasts of Prey than our <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> our
<hi>Vineyard,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For of a Church
this Parable is necessarily to be understood.</p>
            <p>Is there any one of the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
that has been so regularly Reformed; that in
the first Constitution of it was Established upon
Principles so justifiable, so agreeable with the
Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> and the Civil
Rights of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as this Church of <hi>England</hi>
was?</p>
            <p>Is there any <hi>Protestant Church</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> whose
Articles of <hi>Faith;</hi> whose <hi>Discipline;</hi> whose Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Rites of <hi>Worship</hi> are more correspondent
to Antient <hi>Tradition</hi> and Catholick <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Practice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any <hi>Protestant Church</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> wherein
the Word of God has been taught more sincerely
and more to the edification of the people than
among us?</p>
            <p>Is there any <hi>Protestant Church</hi> that has more
comfortably lived under their own <hi>Vines</hi> and their
own <hi>Fig-Trees,</hi> has more freely enjoyed all the
benefits and privileges that either <hi>Religion</hi> or their
<hi>Birthright</hi> could Intitle them to, than we have
done?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98157:13"/>
Is there any <hi>Protestant Church</hi> that has been
preserved so miraculously, that hath received so
many wonderful deliverances from Enemies of
all sorts; Enemies of the <hi>Hills</hi> and of the <hi>Vallies:</hi>
and yet notwithstanding all; notwithstanding the
contrivances of <hi>false Brethren</hi> within ourselves,
and the assaults of the <hi>Publick Adversaries</hi> abroad,
does still not only continue in Being, but Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
also, as God be thanked we do at this Day?</p>
            <p>The care that God hath taken of this Nation
hath been wonderful; his Providences towards
us are to be admired for the Rareness and the
Graciousness of them. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
               </gap>mnd therefore justly may
the Lord of the Vineyard after all this Care, all
these Providences, expect some good Fruit from
us proportionable to his Kindness to us. And
long has he waited for it.</p>
            <p>But what Fruits have we produced after all
these great opportunities and this great patience?
Can we really say, that we now are <hi>Better</hi> than
our <hi>Fore-Fathers</hi> of the Reformation, who perhaps
had not more light, certainly had not that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of Gods Mercies and Deliverances that we
have? I am affraid our Hearts will give it Against
us.</p>
            <p>Can we say that we are not worse than
they? That we have at least made as good an
use and improvement of the Talents that have
been committed to us as they did? It is to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98157:14"/>
be feared we shall be cast upon this Point also.</p>
            <p>Our own experience will tell us, if we have
lived any considerable time in the world, That
even since our remembrance, Though God hath
more and more both heaped his <hi>Favours</hi> and his
<hi>Severities</hi> upon us, yet we have grown worse and
worse.</p>
            <p>His Mercies have not Melted us; His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have not Reclaimed us; He hath done all
that is Possible both by <hi>Gentle</hi> and <hi>Severe</hi> Methods
to bring us to a sense of our Duty, but We like the
<hi>Deaf Adder have stopped our Ears; and have not
hearkned to the voice of the Charmer, though he charmed
never so wisely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What therefore, these things considered, can
we expect, but that God should pass the same
Sentence upon this Unthankful, this Irreclaimable
People of <hi>England,</hi> that the Lord of the <hi>Vineyard</hi>
passed upon the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> in the Parable: <hi>Cut it
down, why doth it cumber the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, If you will take it in the words of the
Prophet, what should hinder or what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
but that God should speak to us (that is,
decree upon us) what he did to his beloved peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the fifth of <hi>Isaiahs</hi> Prophecy, <hi>O Inhabitants
of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and men of</hi> Judah, <hi>judg I pray you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and my Vineyard. What could I have done
more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then when I looked that it should bring forth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98157:14"/>
Grapes, brought it forth Wild Grapes? And now
go to, I will tell you what I will do with my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
I will take away the hedg thereof and it shall
be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof and it
shall be troden down, and I will lay it wast, it shall
not be pruned or digged, but there shall come up briers
and thorns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Judgment</hi> that is here threatened in
the Text, which I now come in the <hi>Second</hi> place
more particularly to consider.</p>
            <p>A grievous Judgment without doubt it is, and
the greatest that can fall upon any Nation; For
so much as our <hi>Souls</hi> are of greater concernment
to us than our <hi>Bodies:</hi> So much are <hi>Spiritual</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to be preferred before <hi>Temporal:</hi> And so
much the greater misery is it for any people to be
deprived of them than of the other.</p>
            <p>For that Nation that was once Gods own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people to be abandoned by him, and to be
layed in common with the rest of the world
that are under the <hi>Prince of the power of the Air;</hi>
For that Nation that once enjoyed the influences
of Gods presence, and the Light of the Truth,
and the benefits of his Ordinances, now to be
stript of all these; To be without God, without
Light, without the Ordinary means of saving
their Souls; O what more deplorable condition
can be imagined!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98157:15"/>
And yet thus severe hath God been with many
Nations, thus when their sins have cryed loud,
and the sinners have been impudent, and all
Methods of amendment have been ineffectual,
God hath in anger <hi>Removed their Candlestick</hi> from
among them.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> which Christ thus threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
in the Text, Nay all the other six Churches
of <hi>Asia</hi> to which the Epistles are sent, are sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this. Once most flourishing Churches
they were, even the very Paradise of the Lord,
but now they lie wast and desolate, over run with
Ignorance and Barbarity and <hi>Mahometanism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Africa</hi> which is not now more fruitful of
Monsters, than it was once of excellently Wise
and Learned men; That <hi>Africa</hi> which formerly
afforded us our <hi>Clemens,</hi> onr <hi>Origen,</hi> our <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
our <hi>Cyprian,</hi> our <hi>Augustine,</hi> and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Lights in the Church of God; That
Famous <hi>Africa</hi> in whose soyl Christianity did
thrive so prodigiously, and could boast of so
many Flourishing Churches, Alas, is now a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.
<hi>The wild Boars have broken into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
and eaten it up, and it brings forth nothing but
briers and thorns:</hi> To use the words of the Prophet.</p>
            <p>And who knows but God may suddainly
make this Church and Nation, This our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which <hi>Jeshurm</hi>-like is <hi>waxed fat and grown
proud, and has kicked against God,</hi> such another
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98157:15"/>
example of the Vengeance of this Kind.</p>
            <p>It is true, in all appearance there is no danger
of having our <hi>Candlestick</hi> removed from us in the
same sense or manner that those Churches I have
instanced in, had theirs. We have no apprehensions
that either <hi>Mahometanism</hi> or <hi>Paganism</hi> will come
into these Kingdoms: At least not in our days.</p>
            <p>It is another kind of removal of our <hi>Candlestick</hi>
that we have reason to fear; It is another Religion
nigher at hand that is most likely to displace our
<hi>Candlestick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You all know what Religion I mean, It is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
that most threatens us. It is that restless busie
Religion that has made so much disturbance in
Christendom; that has always been and is still
so active by all means just or unjust, by fraud or
force to insinuate it self into all places. It is this
we ought to have the most apprehensions of.</p>
            <p>It is true those that are of this Religion do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Name of Christ, and we do not deny them
the Title of a Christian Church; But of all sorts
of Christianity this seems to be the worst, and
next to the being of no Church, it is the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable
to be of This.</p>
            <p>And for all the specious Titles of <hi>Visible</hi> and
<hi>Perpetual</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> which they
would amuse us with; If we did seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a kind of <hi>Religion</hi> we now enjoy, and
what a kind of <hi>Religion</hi> will come in the place of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98157:16"/>
it, if ever they get their will of us, we should
sadly reflect upon the Change. And for all we
continued a Christian Country, Yet we should
lament over ourselves that our <hi>Candlestick was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of its place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe there are few here but sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what a kind of Religion this is, and
what you are to expect from it: But yet I will
beg leave to give a brief account of some of the
Articles of it. Not to instruct you, but to give
you occasion to consider how well it will sute
with us of this Kingdom, or indeed with Any
that would be Christians after the way of Christs
Institution.</p>
            <p>It is a Religion, whose avowed Principles are
to keep their people in ignorance as much as they
can. For with them <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of
Devotion.</hi> And if you do but blindly <hi>Believe</hi> as
the Church <hi>Believes,</hi> and blindly <hi>Obey</hi> what is
imposed upon you, you are good <hi>Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Religion, in which you will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to have any <hi>Prayers</hi> in <hi>public</hi> that you can
understand. When you come to Church, you
may entertain yourselves with saying over your
<hi>Rosary</hi> (which is a solemn set of Praiers contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Ten</hi> addresses to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> for <hi>One</hi> to
our <hi>Lord</hi>) and other <hi>Private</hi> Prayers, if you have
them: But joyn in the <hi>Publick</hi> Service with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98157:16"/>
Minister you cannot, unless you understand <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Religion, into which as soon as you enter
you must give up your Bibles. For the people
must not read the Scripture without especial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and not at all of that Translation you
now have of it.</p>
            <p>It is a Religion that Robs you of half the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
For you must never be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Cup in the Lords Supper; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Institution of our Lord in express
words: And notwithstanding the Practice of the
Primitive Church to the contrary.</p>
            <p>It is a Religion, in which you are so far from
being permitted <hi>to try all things and to hold to that
which is good,</hi> according to the Apostles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
That you must wholly submit your reason
and understanding to the Dictates of an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judg, even so far, (if one of their greatest
Authors say true) to be bound to believe <hi>Virtue</hi> to
be <hi>Bad,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. lib. 4. cap. 5.</note> and <hi>Vice</hi> to be <hi>Good,</hi> if it shall please his
<hi>Holiness</hi> to say so</p>
            <p>Nay, It is a Religion in which you shall not
be allowed to believe your very <hi>Senses.</hi> For
though four of your five Senses tell you that one
of the Consecrated Elements in the Sacrament is
a piece of Bread, yet you are obliged under pain
of Damnation to believe that it is not so; But the
very Body of Christ that was Crucified at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and is now in Heaven; and which upon this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98157:17"/>
supposition must be Actually and Separately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in a thousand distant places at once every day.</p>
            <p>It is a Religion that will bring you back to the
Old <hi>Paganish Idolatry:</hi> Or to that which is as near
it as can be. For as the Old Heathens had their
inferior <hi>Deities,</hi> their <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Hero's</hi> to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
between God and them: So will you
have your several Saints and Patrons of the like
nature, which you must apply to for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
your Prayers to the Divine Majesty.
And as they had the <hi>Images</hi> of their Gods and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
to worship and fall down before; So
will you also for the same purpose have the <hi>Images</hi>
of the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and
the rest of the Saints.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Pagans were mightily reproved for
these things, both in the Scripture and by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians. And they made several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
and Apologies for their Practices. And
the very same doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now
make for her Invocation of Saints and Image-Worship.
But if the one were guilty of Idolatry
there is little doubt but the other are so also: For
there is not an hairs breadth difference between
the Pleas and Apologies that each party makes
for it self.</p>
            <p>Nay, It is a Religion that will engage you in
a more Unnatural Idolatry than ever the Pagans
were guilty of.<note place="margin">De Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Cicero</hi> that was a Heathen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98157:17"/>
and knew as much of that Religion as any
man living did; Yet affirms that there was none
so mad in any of the Religions of his time as to
pretend to eat his God. But yet this you must do
in that Religion every time you Receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
And the Priest does it every day when
he says Mass. For he eats that which himself and
you all must worship. And you are taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that what you worship in the Mass is God,
that is, the very <hi>Humanity</hi> of our Saviour united
personally to his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, In this Religion there are many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and conveniences pretended, that you
cannot really have in the Religion you now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.
But look you to them, whether they will
prove so in the event.</p>
            <p>The easie ways they have to reconcile sinners
to God, even after the most Vicious life, by the
means of the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Taught and Administred in that Church:
Together with the liberty you may take in the
choice of such a Confessor as you think will be
most favourable to your Case. Add to this, The
Virtue of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and <hi>Masses</hi> for the Dead.
As also the efficacy of <hi>Pilgrimages, Reliques</hi> and
<hi>Holy Garments,</hi> &amp;c. For the purging of <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these things put together may perhaps rid
you of a great many Uneasinesses and Scruples
and Pangs of Conscience, with which you might
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98157:18"/>
otherwise be troubled; and which would not be
so easily Cured in the Way that you are now in.
There is little doubt but upon the Commonly
received Principles of that Religion, you may go
to Heaven upon much easier Terms than you can
upon ours: But yet for all that, in a business of
such consequence as the Salvation of a mans Soul
is, It is good to make a serious enquiry whether
of the two Ways is the safer.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing in this Religion which
will not so easily go down with <hi>Englishmen:</hi> And
that is, That you cannot therein be any longer
good Subjects to your Prince, than his Holiness
will give you leave.</p>
            <p>If his Majesty should be a <hi>Heretic</hi> (as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his present Majesty is in their account) Nay,
In other Cases besides that of <hi>Heresie;</hi> the Pope
has power to Depose him, and Absolve his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Allegiance. And that not only
in the judgment of their most famous <hi>Casuists,</hi> and
by the Established Rules of their <hi>Canon Law,</hi> but
by the Decree of an Infallible <hi>General Council.</hi>
And it has been a frequent Practice of the Pope
to make use of his Power in this way.</p>
            <p>Nay, in this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> he needs not
stay for such pretences. For his Holiness (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon Record) has declared, that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is held in Fee of the Papacy. And that
whoever wears the Crown here is their <hi>Vassal,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98157:18"/>
and consequently may be turned out at pleasure.</p>
            <p>What the effects of these Doctrines have been,
we of this Kingdom have had sufficient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
since the Reformation; Not to mention the
troubles they have given us in former times. The
instances are so many and so very well known,
that I need not name them. But if they were all
forgot, The <hi>Late</hi> shall I say or the <hi>Present Popish
Plot</hi> for the taking away the life of His Sacred
Majesty, and Subverting the Protestant Religion
and the Established Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
now brought to light; This alone, though all
the other instances were worn out of memory,
would sufficiently shew us what we are to expect
from these <hi>Roman Principles,</hi> as to the security either
of our <hi>Prince,</hi> or our <hi>Liberties,</hi> or our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But blessed be Gods Name, that this Cursed
Design has been hitherto Defeated, and we are
here to Praise him for it, and to Pray to him for
a farther Discovery of it.</p>
            <p>And blessed be his Name, That he hath given
us this Remarkable evidence that he has not yet
abandoned us, notwithstanding our manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.
Certainly this extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God towards us, is one of the most
Comfortable Arguments that we can draw to
ourselves, That God has yet some Pitty for this
Nation: If we will but pitty ourselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98157:19"/>
And Lastly, blessed be Gods Name that this
Mercy has already had this good effect upon us,
That we are awakened into a more lively sense
of the manifold Iniquity and Mischief and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Popish Religion and Party.</p>
            <p>What is now further to be desired, but that the
Issue of things among us may be suitable to these
beginnings?</p>
            <p>God has once more given this Nation a great
Opportunity for the Establishing her Tottering
<hi>Candlestick,</hi> and who knows whether ever the like
will be offered again?</p>
            <p>It therefore infinitely concerns all of us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
You to whom the Managery of Publick
Affairs is committed, to improve this Present
Opportunity to the good purposes for which it
was given; That so this great Mercy and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God be not lost upon us.</p>
            <p>Offences may come. And we may be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
But as our Saviour said, <hi>Wo be to that
Man by whom the Offence cometh.</hi> Such a man will
never be able to answer it either to God, or his
Country, or at last to his own Conscience.</p>
            <p>O may God so inspire you with the Spirit of
Wisdom and Counsel; with Temper and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
with a Spirit so disengaged from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Ends, and Interests; So unbyassed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Faction; And so wholly intent upon the
Public Good, that you may be the blessed Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98157:19"/>
of Healing all the Distempers we groan
under; And of Deriving upon us those Blessings
which we this Day Pray for.</p>
            <p>That by your means <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of
<hi>Religion,</hi> as also <hi>Lewdness</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> of all
kinds may be so discouraged that they shall not
dare to appear with an open Face.</p>
            <p>That by your means a stop may be put to the
Scandalous <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> that are among
us; That if it be possible we may serve God
with one Heart and with one Mind.</p>
            <p>That by your means, not only the Person of
His Sacred Majesty, and the Rights of his Crown
may be secured against all wicked attempts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Papists or Others: But also that upon his
Head the Crown may be so Supported, and so
Flourish, that we may at least be in a condition
not to fear the Malice or the Power of any
Foreign Enemy.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that by your means as effectual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
as possible may be made: both for the
keeping out that <hi>Foreign Religion,</hi> which, as we
have seen, so little serves the ends of Christianity,
and so much disserves the Interest both of King
and People: And for the more firm Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> That so our present <hi>Candlestick</hi> may be
continued to our Posterity, and they as well as
we may have reason to bless God for You.</p>

But in Order to the procuring those great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
to the Kingdom: There is a duty necessary
to be performed by all of us in our <hi>private</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
which is here specified in the Text, <hi>viz.
Repentance. I will come unto thee quickly</hi> (says our
Saviour) <hi>and will remove thy Candlestick out of its
place, except thou Repent.</hi> Which <hi>Repentance,</hi> How it
ought to be performed by us, Is the <hi>Third</hi> and
Last thing I am to speak to.</p>
            <p>But because I would not exceed the ordinary
limits of a Sermon, I shall only mention the
Heads of those things which upon this Occasion
are proper to be insisted on.</p>
            <p>If we would <hi>Repent</hi> sincerely of our sins, so as to
do our parts towards the prevention of those <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
that hang over our heads, and the procuring
those <hi>Blessings</hi> we stand in need of: It will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that every one of us do deeply Humble
and Afflict our Souls before God for our <hi>own Sins,</hi>
the sins which we have in person committed;
Devoutly confessing them, and begging of God,
That when he makes inquisition for a <hi>National</hi>
guilt, he would not remember them, nor let the
publick suffer any thing upon our account.</p>
            <p>It is also necessary that we be duly sensible of
the <hi>Common Sins</hi> of others so as to <hi>Repent</hi> of them
also. Lamenting before God the Corruptions of
the Times: The Publick Fashionable Vices of
the Age. This was the Spirit of <hi>David</hi> who was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98157:21"/>
concern'd for the faults of others as well as his
own; <hi>Rivers of Tears</hi> (saith he) <hi>run down my Eyes
because men keep not thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, further, In order to a <hi>National Repentance,</hi>
We are obliged to confess to God the <hi>Sins</hi> of our
<hi>Forefathers,</hi> and pray for the forgiveness of them
also. What my own former <hi>private</hi> sins are to me at
present with respect to my <hi>personal</hi> Capacity; the
same are the sins of our <hi>Fathers</hi> to us all, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a Nation or People. We are to Repent
as well of the past as of the present sins of the
Land. This is the Rule that God himself hath
prescribed for a <hi>Publick Repentance.</hi> And for not
putting that Rule in Practice, the people of the
<hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time severely suffered.<note place="margin">Matth. xxiii. 35.</note> For
upon the <hi>Men of that Generation</hi> (as our Saviour
had threatened) <hi>was Revenged all the Righteous blood
shed in the Land from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>to the blood
of</hi> Zachariah. Though yet none of that blood
was shed by that Generation. Great reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have we at this day seriously to put up to God
that Petition which we so often repeat in our
<hi>Litany, Remember not Lord our Offences, nor the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of our Forefathers; but spare us good Lord, spare
thy people whom thou hast Redeemed with thy most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blood and be not angry with us forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to make this <hi>Repentance</hi> such as it ought to
be, there is further required a through <hi>Change</hi> in
our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Minds;</hi> So that as we Confess and
ask Pardon for the Faults of our Lives, we should
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98157:22"/>
also amend them. Without this all our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
Humiliation will signifie nothing.</p>
            <p>Nay, We must not only Reform <hi>Ourselves,</hi> but
do what we can in our Spheres towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of <hi>Others.</hi> And every one of us might
do a great deal, if we would; though it was but
in this one thing, In heartily discouraging <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
and <hi>Open</hi> sins where ever we meet with
them; So far as it may be done without breach
of Respect to our Superiors or Forfeiture of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prudence. If Vice had once an ill name in
the world; Was once generally stigmatized with
Reproach and Ignominy, it would quickly lose
its Empire, and thousands that are now the slaves
of it would become Proselytes to Virtue.</p>
            <p>But further if we truely fear the <hi>Judgment</hi> I
have been speaking of, and by our <hi>Repentance</hi>
would prevent it, Let us make this particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of that <hi>Repentance, viz.</hi> Let us set a great
Value upon the <hi>Religion</hi> we at present enjoy. Let
us in all our Actions shew a great Zeal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
for it, and do what we can both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the continuing and promoting it.</p>
            <p>If Every one of us in his way would but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
half that Zeal and Industry and Diligence
in the Cause of our Religion that we see our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
do; We should probably in a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time see a quite different Face of Things: And
should not only put a stop to their present Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but gain so much ground upon them as to cast
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98157:22"/>
them into despair of ever making a Conquest of
this Nation. But here is the misery, we are so
Confident and Secure of the goodness of our
Cause, that we think it will support itself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any help of ours. Let us in this Point learn
Wisdom from our Enemies.</p>
            <p>But especially let us practise heartily those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
which our Religion peculiarly Teaches as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to Popery. Let us be Meek, and Gentle, and
Long-Suffering, even to those that differ in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
from us. Let us hate all Tricks and Devices
and Equivocations, both in our Words and our
Carriage. Let us be Constantly and Inflexibly
Loyal to our Prince, and let no consideration in
the world make us violate our Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>To all which, Let us in the last place add our
earnest and constant Prayers to God, That he
would be pleased to take pity of us. To avert
the <hi>Judgments</hi> we are threatened with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the <hi>Mercies</hi> we have hitherto enjoyed. That
he would protect our <hi>Religion</hi> and make it to
flourish more and more. That he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Government,</hi> our <hi>Laws.</hi> And in
order thereunto, That he would Influence and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
all the Publick Councels, especially the great
<hi>Councel</hi> of the Nation now Assembled in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
That this <hi>Session</hi> of Theirs may have a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and a Glorious Issue. Which God of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
