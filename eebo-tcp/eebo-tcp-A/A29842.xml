            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> is <hi>Plaintiff;</hi> and it is a great advantage, that an <hi>Accuser</hi> hath over a <hi>Defender</hi>: not onely in that, he speaks <hi>first,</hi> which gets a <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi> as it were, of the hearer's <hi>Hearts</hi>; but because he hath commonly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of some <hi>notorious Crime</hi> for his <hi>Foundation,</hi> upon which every man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is apt to cast a Stone: where the <hi>Defender</hi> must himself alone not onely

And not to stand piling up of Authours; what thinks he of one, that may be <hi>Instar multorum,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Philosopher, Marcus Aurelius</hi>? Was not he a <hi>Writer</hi> of <hi>Note</hi>? Who in his excellent Book of <hi>Morality</hi> (for which we are beholding to our engraffed Country-man, a learned Issue of a most Learned Parent) hath so briefly, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52391:63"/>
yet so fully expressed the profit of <hi>Plays,</hi> that you must not think it tedious, if I set down his own words. <hi>Tragedies</hi> (saith he) <hi>were at first brought in, and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, to put men in minde of worldly Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Casualties, that these things in the ordinary course of Nature did so happen, that men, that were much pleased, and delighted by such accidents upon this Stage, would not by the same things, in a greater Stage, be grieved, and afflicted. After the Tragedie, the</hi> Comoedia Vetus, <hi>or antient Comedie was brought in; which had the liberty to inveigh against</hi> Personal Vices; <hi>being therefore, through this their Freedom, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speech, of very good use, and effect, to restrain men from pride, and arrogancie. After these, what were either the</hi> Media, <hi>or</hi> Nova Comaedia <hi>admitted for, but meerly, or for the most part, for the delight, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of curious, and excellent Imitation</hi>? Thus writes <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>: and what could he have spoken in so few words to a greater praise of <hi>Plays</hi>? And this he writes in his Book, I may say, of <hi>Mortified Moralitie</hi>; that one may be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52391:63"/>
sure, he speaks as he thinks: and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be suspected to flatter Sensuality. And what will the man say now to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Writers? What? but that, which we may say for him; that sure their Books had no <hi>Tables,</hi> and so he could not come to see what they said of <hi>Plays.</hi> Or perhaps for all his saying, he cares not much whether <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers be of his side, or no: but for <hi>Christian</hi> Writers, he is sure enough of them, to make his challenge good. But is not this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence past all patience, when (<hi>Fol.</hi> 763.) he hath named himself two <hi>Writers</hi> of <hi>Note, Molanus,</hi> and <hi>Lindanus</hi>; the one a <hi>Divinity Professour</hi>

               </gap>ustification of <hi>Plays</hi>? But you must allow him to except these, he meant so when he made his challenge. Well, be it so: what thinks he then of the <hi>Glory</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> the Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>? Was not he a <hi>Christian,</hi> and a <hi>Writer</hi> of <hi>Note</hi>?

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52391:64"/>
and you may well hear his words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering, because they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of bettering. <hi>Comedie</hi> (saith he) <hi>is an Imitation of the common Errours of our life, which the Comedian representeth in the most ridiculous, and scornfull sort, that may be, so as it is impossible, that any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder can be content to be such an one. Now, as, in Geometrie, the Oblique must be known as well as the Right; and, in Arithmetick, the Odd as well as the Even: so, in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Life, who seeth not the filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Evil wanteth a great foil to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the beauty of Virtue. This doth the Comedie handle so, in our private, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestical matters, that with hearing it we get as it were an Experience: what is to be looked for of a niggardly</hi> Demea, <hi>of a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Davus, <hi>of a flattering</hi> Gnatho, <hi>of a Vain-glorious</hi> Thraso, <hi>and not onely to know what effects are to be expected, but to know, who be such, by the signifying badg given them by the Comedian. And little reason hath any man to say, that men learn the Evil, by seeing it so set out; since (as I said before) there is no man living, but by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52391:64"/>
the force truth hath in Nature no sooner seeth these men play their parts, but he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in</hi> Pistrinum. <hi>Although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, the sack of his own faults lie so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his back, that he seeth not himself to dance the same measure: whereto nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that, the right use of</hi> Comedie <hi>will, I think, by no body be blamed: and much less of the high, and excellent</hi> Tragedie, <hi>that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greatest Wounds, and sheweth forth the Vlcers, that are covered with Tissue; that maketh</hi> Kings <hi>fear to be</hi> Tyrants, <hi>and</hi> Tyrants <hi>to manifest their</hi> Tyrannical <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; that, with stirring the Effects of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and Commiseration, teacheth the uncertainty of this world, and upon how weak Foundations Gilden roofs are builded.

the common man is drawn to love <hi>Virtue,</hi> not so much by the love of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> as by the love of <hi>Happiness,</hi> which grows out of <hi>Virtue</hi>; and to hate <hi>Vice,</hi> not so much for the hate of <hi>Vice,</hi> as for the hate of <hi>Miseries,</hi> that flow out of <hi>Vice:</hi> it must necessarily follow, that what doth most manifest such happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or such miseries, must needs, to <hi>Virtue,</hi> or from <hi>Vice,</hi> be most enforcing; but this effect is far better wrought by <hi>Plays,</hi> the <hi>Representation</hi> of life, then by the life it self: seeing life, being casual, and tedious, doth neither always answer to desert; nor yet is ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so it is the purpose of <hi>Plays</hi> to do it by <hi>Representation,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>Haec consicta arbitror à Poetis esse, ut ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fictos mores nostros, expressámque imaginem nostrae quotidianae vitae videamus: Plays,</hi> I conceive, were devised by <hi>Poets</hi> for this purpose; that in them, as in a <hi>Glass,</hi> we might see the maners, and very <hi>Image</hi> of our daily life. <hi>Plays</hi> indeed are <hi>Glasses</hi> of the Passages, and Actions of the world: and it is unhappy for <hi>Glasses,</hi> when they fall into the hands of <hi>Ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi> faces; for they may chance to lay the <hi>Ill favouredness</hi> of their faces upon the <hi>Glasses</hi>: and just so it is with this man; for he lays all the blame of the world's bad actions upon <hi>Plays,</hi> where he ought rather to lay all the blame of <hi>Plays</hi> bad actions upon the world: for, if the world were <hi>good, Plays</hi> would be <hi>good</hi>; but, if the world be bad, <hi>Plays</hi> are but the <hi>Glasses,</hi> they do but their kinde to represent it as it is; and therefore no fault of theirs, if they be bad too.</p>
            <p>But he cannot abide to hear talk of <hi>Representations,</hi> he finds no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

proving how necessary it is, that the multitude, who live by their labours should have Recreations allowed them to sweeten their pains: and that of all Recreations, hitherto invented, there is not any, for many Considerations, so worthy the embracing, as this of <hi>Plays</hi>: it is a <hi>general</hi> delight, general to <hi>Sex,</hi> to <hi>Age,</hi> to <hi>Quality</hi>; it is an <hi>innocent</hi> delight, innocent in <hi>Deed,</hi> and in <hi>Occasion</hi>; it is a <hi>cheap</hi> delight, it ventures nothing, and spends but little; it is a <hi>sociable</hi> delight, many do at once enjoy it, and all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it is a <hi>ready</hi> delight, without wast of time, or trouble of waiting; it is a <hi>refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> delight, it becalms the Spirits, where most other delights make the Pulses beat; it is a delight both to <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi>: and, of the Senses, more then one more then one way do at once partake it: and as for the <hi>Reasons,</hi> we may truly say of <hi>Plays,</hi> that they <hi>enlarge</hi> it by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses, quicken</hi> it by <hi>Conceits,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> it by <hi>Examples.</hi> These are some reasons of many, to shew there is just cause, why <hi>Plays</hi> should, and may delight us:
