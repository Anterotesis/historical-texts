         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Aboue all o ther prpfeſſiones the arte of vvarr is of moſte danger, ſoe the Souldier is to be verie earneſte to be devote, and of cleere conſcience, for he is more neerer dangeres of death then any o ther ſorte of men; and it is neceſſarie that he allwayes haue a prieſte not far of, for the ſoules health: To whome he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fess at all times and o cationes, a cordinge as time and neceſſitie shall require. In the choiſinge and keepinge of thies prieſtes the Captaines in conſcience are bounde to procure that they be verteouſe and of goode life, if o therwiſe, itt were far better not to have any at all.</p>
               <p>He is of neceſſitie to have a barber in his Company, and if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of goode skill in this arte, for beinge a verie neceſſarie inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If the wounde or hurte be dangerouſe, he is both in danger and trouble: This beinge ſuch a neceſſarie inſtrumente in warr and becauſe that Souldieres are men of libertie they fall often times into many diſgraces, excepte theyre Officeres have a ſpeciall care to prevente the neceſſarie remedies. For whiche and for many more dangeres they incurr, it is uerie neceſſarie they have a goode barber as before ſpoken. And if his pay be not able

Thies outewarde cinteries are never to retire, but when urgente and aſſured accaſion doe conſtraine them therunto, in ſeeinge the enemy a prochinge, (and not before) and untill they reviwe if it be foote or horſe. Or if they come in order of ſquadron or marchinge in ſingle file: After well reviwenge them, let them retire to the nexte cintery, and let the wourde pass very ſecretly from hande to hand til it come to the next watch, or let the pikeman goe forwarde with neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and the other ſtay vvith the firſte cintinell til they be conſtrained to retire to the nexte, and ſoe retire be litle and a litle, obſervinge ſtill the enemy, and with whate order they doe marche, and ſoe fall into theyre owne people, and informe of all of whate they have bothe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and hearde: And ſeeinge them come diſordered, thinckinge to fall uppon oures of aſoddaine beinge a ſleepe or in provided. Then oures to turne uppon them with full reſolution with the ſhort Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Phiſes which douptleſſe if as before they come, they ſhall finde them ſelves puſſeled and amaſed: Thies exploites require pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, valeor, ſilence, and brave reſolution.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie that the Sardgent mayor give order that uppon pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of deathe none doe preſume to give a falſe alarme vvithoute occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, excepte it be vvith order of the Superior. And in occaſiones of encounteres, skirmiſes, or aſſaultes vvith the enemy let the Sardgent mayor give order that none call for pouder but verie ſilente; for it is a thinge moſte odiouſe and of litle diſcretion, that the enemy ſhoulde knowe of oure vvantes in ſuch occaſiones: If neede require the pikes and raperes vvill ſerve in goode ſteede, if the Souldiores vvithe brave reſolution and determination doe a compliſh theyre obligationes, for vvhich extremities is required a prudent and brave conductor of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerouſe and reſolute determination.</p>
               <p>In all occaſiones in the filde where the enemy, is to be feared and ſuſpected, the Sardgent mayor is to give order that the outewarde cinteries of oures nexte unto the enemy doe take a ſpeciall care that none doe pass unto the enemy from oure campe; Which is rather to be ſuſpected then if one of the enemy came into oures, for ſuch as run unto the enemy they may be ſuſpected, that they goe with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe or ſecrett intelligence, if ſuch perſones can not be killed or tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, let theyre warninge by preſently given to his Captaine, and then preſently to the Sardgent mayor who at that inſtant ſhall comaund that noe Souldier of the watches who hath the wourde ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>A verie neceſſarie thinge it is in a Sardgent mayor to by carefull in ſeeinge that all the Souldieres of his Regimente be well armed, and that there may be noe eſcuſe in a compliſhinge theyre obligationes, in eſcuſinge that theyr armes are brocken or a mindinge.

               <p>When occaſion ſhall require that the Sardgent mayor woulde have oute of certaine Companies of his Regimente a quantitie of Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to be employed, this he is to demaunde of the Capitaines, who is to apointe and ordaine the number demaunded, and not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midle in takinge them otherwiſe, for the Captaine is he which is to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a compte and reaſon of the Souldieres of his Company, and the Sardgentr mayor in noe caſe is to intermidel in takinge them but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe which the Captaine ſhall apointe, for the Sardgente mayor hath no auctoritie to take them otherwiſe; Excepte they be on the watch, and that urgente occaſion ſhoulde be offered which requireth greate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. And in ſuch occaſiones the Officer beinge not preſente he may take them; and ſuch Souldieres as the Sardgente mayor ſhall demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the Captaine is to make no acceptiones, of all ſuch occaſiones as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re neceſſarie for his Majeſties ſervice: But he is not to intermidle in takinge from any Officer any priviledge a pertaininge to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones of his office, which if otherwiſe he ſhoulde preſume itt is a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and odiouſe thinge in warr.</p>

and none ought to trouble or moleſte them in there voyadge, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te they be ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>The Sardgent mayor is to take care that if his Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te in occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones which mighte happen they breake uppon the enemy, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we on the victorie, let none in paine of death fall a robbinge the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temen, nor none of the ſlaughter, which if any Officer finde them in that baſe acte in ſuch occaſiones, may execute this ſentence, beinge moſte baſe and odiouſe, but rather perſue the victorie, and keepe his order as behooveth an honorable Souldier of reſolute and noble minde to doe.</p>
               <p>In like maner in occaſiones to inter per force of armes into any towne citti or ſtronge place, the Sardgent mayor is to by verie, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante, and carefull, that noe Souldier of whateſoever qualitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: be permitted to inter into any houſe, eyther ro robb or ſteale till ſuch time as the enemy be wholie vanquiſed, that no danger nor execution of theyres might be feared, and that till all there furie be paſte, and that uppon paine of death, for otherwiſe they incurr greate danger, ſome leavinge theyre armes hire and theyre in divers places; of vvhich if the enemy take poceſſion they may eaſilie Maſter them; Of ſuche blinde ingnorance and covetouſe deſire of gaine, greate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace may reſulte.

               <p>For the executiones of rare exploites and brave interpriſes in warr is required prudente and brave conduction, and ſpecially that the Sardgent mayor be moſte earneſte to exercice the Officeres and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diores of his Regimente; whiche beinge ſoe practiſed in warr, greate expectationes mighte be hoped of them: Beinge exerſiſed in well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadgeinge theyre armes, obſervinge theyr order and not ſtiringe oute of the ſame when they marche, in knowinge who to fall into ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and obſerve the proclamationes given, and ordained be the Generall, nothinge ſoe dificill but that contuall uſe and exercice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth eaſie.</p>

               <p>Some houlde an opinion that in orderes of marchinge and framin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of ſquadrones the number par, is beſte, true it is that this number is good, but in the divitiones to fall oute of youvre march into ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, let none be ingnorante that they are to marche acordinge as the devition fauleth oute.

and if he wante any Souldier of thoſe of his diviſion, or if any come unto them more then the order given to adverice the Sardgent mayor, and for recompence of his punctualitie and care in acompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinge his obligation he ſhall gaine the benevolence of his Maſter de campe and Sardgent mayor, and in reaſon they oughte to have a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his punctuall care, and to prefer him into a greater office for his obedience and punctuallitie a monghſte other Sardgentes, and not once nor twice but ſtill makinge knowen his aproved partes, care and diligence in acompliſhinge the orderes of his Superiores, ſoe can he not by forgotten by the ſuperior officers till he by adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced for his undeniable care and obedience.</p>
                     <p>Moſte neceſſary it is for a Sargent mayor to be couriouſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte in executinge well his office, for in tyme of framinge of ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones the Judges of his errores are many, in time of framinge of ſquadrones, ſome Sardge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts mayores do fall into many errores, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of there litle exercice, and ſpecially for not applie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge them ſelves withe care and diligence bothe in the theorike and practike of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and ſpecially to by skilfull in Arithmeticke, whiche withe practice makethe eaſy many rare occurrantes in warrlike affaires, and ſuche as are not curiouſe in well appleinge them ſelves in learninge the rare and deepe curioſities of this arte do ſome times finde them ſelves pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſled and amaſed before there enemy in time of moſte neede: A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte unfitinge thinge it is for one to be ingnorante and unhabele in his office, ſoe i ſupoſe that ſuche as do not diligently apply them ſelves, can hardly reduce into perfection that, wherof he is ingnoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and knowethe not the arte, by dayly experience, we ſee that favor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> frendſhipp, enteres, and affection, hinderethe muche proſperity and goode ſucceſſes, and ſpecially in this noble arte of warr.</p>
                     <p>Many opiniones there are for the diviſiones of ſhott, and ſpecially when the enemy are ſtronge on horſe, and that youe have two thirde partes of ſhott, unto one of pikes, youre battell beinge empaled and girdeled proportionally withe ſhott, there will yett remayne goode ſtore of ſhott. The queſtion is how they ſhall be beſtowed to be ſafe from the fury of the horſe, the ſureſte and beſte way is to put them into the center of the battell of pikes, where they are more ſafe, and if any ſhott be killed or hurte youe can take at all times oute of the center as many as youe ſhall neede of.</p>
                     <p>For the framinge of thieſe battelles withe centeres i have already declared howe they oughte to be framed, and proporſionolly lined,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7362:88"/>
and if the enemy horſe ſhoulde chance of a ſodaine to chardge on yove, and that youe have no tyme to place the overpluſſe of youre ſhott in the center divide them betwixte the rankes of pikes all alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gſte from the fronte to the reare warde, ſo they ſhall by ſafe and yove can uſe them at any tyme when ocaſion ſhall require, but havinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligence that the enemy are ſtronge in horſe, and we feowe or none in ſuche ocaſiones i woule firſte bigin in framinge the cener of the overpluſſe of the ſhott, havinge oportunity for the ſame, and alſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve place for hurtemen in the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter and divide them into ſo many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples that they may of a ſodaine fall into ſquadron ſquare of men in the center, withoute any croſſinge alue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge there iuſte fronte and flanke and then divide the pikes into maniples to proportionally guarniſhe the center on every ſide or fronte of the ſame, and then divide in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the girdlinge ſhott that is lefte to guarniſh the 4 frontes of the battell of pikes, and center, this is the perfecte and right way, but when urgent neceſſity requireth the overpluſſe of ſhott may be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and divided betwexte the rankes of pikes as before ſett downe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſinge that the coulores is to goe in the center.</p>
                     <p>As the battell dothe marche on towardes the enemy and cominge once within reache of the musket then the firſte rankes of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of musketes are to marche in this maner; the firſte rankes ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge ſome two or three paces, forwarde havinge in the meane ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me made them ſelves ready, and cocked there matches, then with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines and expedition all thoſe of the firſte rankes (there musketes byenge uppon there reſtes or forkes) to diſcharge at once, permiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge other rankes to proceede, then preſently thoſe of the ſeconde ranke to ſtepe upp before the firſte ranke, as the battell or batallon do marche, and ſo to diſcharge as theyre former followes had don before, and then the thirde ranke before the ſeconde, and the four. the before the thirde, and ſoe all the other rankes conſequently wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the this kinde of double marche and at the traine of the laſte ranke thoſe of the firſte to folowe upp a gaine, and ſo conſequently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte.

                     <p>Sundry opiniones there are of compariſones betwext the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,

                  <p>In the ocurrantes and courſes of warr, greate and many are the conſiderationes required in the generall of an army, and in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of warr, in prudently preventinge manny materes of greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, of preſente and future ocationes (with aforcaſte prudente prevention) which otherwiſe bienge induced (do often fall oute to the greate diſcomodity of his Majeſties ſervice) in atemptes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honorable interpriſes and incounteres, to the greate decay of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline, whiche by dayly experience wee ſee, that for wante of prudente conductores of care truſte and fidelity, many honorable interpriſes are loſte, reſultinge of the litle perfection of many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres.</p>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:7362:140"/>A matter wourdie to be noted examined and prevented for the due orderinge of future ocaſiones, of whate reſulteth that ſo many oulde and experimented ſouldiores of the late reformaſiones in germany and lowe country wente on the countrary ſide to the greate diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the houſe of auſtria, ſence which time who many millo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were conſumed in raiſinge of neowe levies and recrutes for the furtherance of the warres of the lowe countries, yea to my judgemte as muche as mighte intertaine an invincible army of oulde and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented ſouldores, duly paied and ſatisfied. By dayly experience we ſee that thies neowe levies for the moſte parte, in ocaſiones of ſervice feowe were founde to aſiſte; whiche i haue noted and pitted often times, for bienge ſo greate alet to his Majeſties ſervice: The Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potente inlighten his Majeſties faithful miniſteres in preventinge in due time the conveniente courſe of a matter of ſo greate importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: And agreate enemy for the vnprofitable conſuminge of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties treaſure and <hi>Indies.</hi> Let none thinke that i diſalue recrutes and reforſinge of companies in theire due time and conveniente courſe, profitable to his Majeſties ſervice. Vndeniable it is that an army well diſciplined ordered contended, and conducted with prudente and braue comaunderes, though leſher in number are by all reaſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteres of the victorie, which all auctores that wrote of this arte do afir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and by dayly experience we finde to be true.</p>
                  <p>The ropoſe and ſecuritie of a Kingdom or ſtate dependes for the moſte parte in obſervinge goode lawes, goode warres, and continual practice of Military Diſcipline, wherof theire are very many probable examples, as plainely hapened to <hi>Anibal</hi> that renoomed Captaine of warr, and to the invincibel Romaines that at lenghte in neglectinge Military Diſcipline and exercice of armes was cauſe of theire perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when they leaſte feared of any a tempes of theire enemy, and that reſultinge for biengc wholie given to vice, regalitie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and forgetfull of all Military exercice.</p>
                  <p>Happie is that Kingdomme where goode lawes and goode diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is in continual vſe and exercice, and alwayes ready for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vice and malice of their enemy, ready for the alarme when it ſhall preſente, whiche offten happen when we leaſte thincke uppon.
