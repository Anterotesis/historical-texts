            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THese Papers accidentally falling into my hands,
'twere injustice to conceal them from the World,
when so much benefit may be reap'd from their
Publication; and though there are many Reasons to be
alledged for Printing so useful a Discourse, yet none was
so prevalent with me as the thoughts of doing our dead
Author Justice, at least as to that part of his Accusation
wherein he has been adjudg'd, if not professedly, yet a
well-wisher at least to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion; that
he was so to the Person he sends these following lines, is
evident from the Design of them, which was to bring
him over to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> a
Design, considering the Circumstances of those distracted
Times, so very seasonable and honest, that the D—
Himself was forc'd to acknowledge as much, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thank'd the Dr. for it, and had God given it its
due Effect, we might all have thank'd him too: But
however the Discourse may have miss'd of its aim where
intended; I hope it may not want some Proselytes of the
same Persuasion, for whose sake 'tis chiefly publish'd. As
to what concerns the Author himself, I shall be wholly
silent, the World labouring under too great a Prejudice
to hear his Panegyrick with Patience: The following
Tract, with his other Learned Writings are his best Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
but if any Mans Curiosity should lead him to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
desire of knowing his Character, if he pleases, he may
better take it from himself.</p>

            <p>THIS Discourse (or what else you please to call it)
was brought me by the <hi>Canterbury</hi> Carrier; your
<hi>R. H.</hi> will see in the loose Leaf join'd to this, how it
comes to be addressed to my Hands. The Author I have
known long since; he was Chaplain to my late Lord
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his Name is Dr. <hi>Samuel Parker,</hi>
(at present) Arch-Deacon of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> as I have not
had any Communication with him of any kind, these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, so the coming of this Treatise to my Hands is a
perfect Surprise; yet seeing the Subject matter of it is
that which we pray and contend for, I durst not but
commit it to this present Conveyance, beseeching Almighty
God to give a Blessing upon it.</p>

            <p>HAving been lately confin'd with a great Indisposition of Health,
and not knowing how the Divine Providence might be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to dispose of me, after I had setled my own private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
as well as I could, an Extravagant. Thought thrust it self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
upon me to leave a Legacy for His Royal Highness, which in
those better Intervals I enjoyed, I composed, and out of that eager
Zeal. I have for the true Settlement of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

peruse it, I submit it entirely to your Wisdom to dispose of it as
you please. And though I have no reason to expect any success from
so weak on Endeavor, yet the very <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat Addresses, or whether any at all, have been made
to Your Royal Highness by the Divines of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> for the Satisfaction of your Conscience,
I am altogether ignorant. Tho I cannot suppose
that none have been made, because I know great numbers of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men of our Communion, both Zealous for their Religion, and
also for Your Highnesses Service here, and Souls welfare hereafter.
But then this I have too much Reason to fear, that some of them may
not have taken that Method; nor have proceeded upon those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that they ought. For the Men that have ever since his Majesties
Return, been, or at least appeared, most forward, in defiance of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been so unhappy in their Zeal and Opposition
against it, as together with the Papal Usurpations, to dig up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Foundations of the Christian Church: or, at the same time that
they endeavor to pull down the Pope's present high and uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pretences, destroy all that Divine Authority that was vested by
our Blessed Saviour in the Apostles and their Successors, for the
Guidance and Government of Souls; so as to make every private
Person the only Judg of his own Faith, without any defence to the
Direction of his Spiritual Guides and Governors: which is in effect
no less than really to cancel that Promise that our Blessed Saviour
made to be assistant to them in the Execution of their Office, to
the End of the World; for if he make good his Promise, that alone
is more than enough to challenge the regular Submission of private
Christians to their Decrees, as they would not Rebel against our
Saviour's own Institution. This I know has been the great stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Block to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
neither pretends to, nor owns any such Power, as that of a living
Judge; but that it either resolves all its Authority into the State, or
leaves all its Members at their own entire liberty, to choose their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97311:5"/>
Religion as they please, without being accountable to the Church
for it.</p>
            <p>These, I must confess, are very common Opinions among us, but
then they are very new too, and as great Strangers to the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> as to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> being at first started about
his Majesties Return, when some young Men that had been fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Educated, seeing the Church of <hi>England</hi> Restored, and either
having a mind to its Preferments, or to bring themselves off from the
Principles of their Education, pretended that there was no such thing as
any particular Form of Church-Government, setled by our Saviour or
his Apostles; and therefore that it was left entirely to the power of the
Civil Magistrate to Establish what Form He Himself liked best. And
for that Reason, and for that alone, seeing his Majesty was pleased
to restore Episcopacy, they thought it their Duty to submit to that
as to all other Civil Laws and Constitutions. But, alas, these are not
Church, but State-Divines, and not only Traytors to the Liberties of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but profest Enemies to the very Being of a
Christian Church; which as such, subsists merely upon our Saviour's
own Charter and Institution, by virtue whereof all Christians are
bound to associate in a visible Society, and to submit to the Decrees
and Ordinances of those Governors that he hath set over it. This,
I say, is the first Principle of a Christian Church, and is owned by all
Men, that either own any such thing as a Church, or understand
what they mean by the word. So that the only true State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
in this Case between Church and Church, is to discover how
the Government of the Catholick Church was at first setled by our
Saviour: how it descended to after Ages, and who at this time stick
closest to the Primitive Institution.</p>
            <p>And for Your Highnesses full Satisfaction herein, I will make a
faithful Representation of the true State of the Primitive Church,
and then compare the present Constitution of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thereby shew how enormously
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithstanding all its high Pretences, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from it, and how honestly the Church of <hi>England</hi> endeavors
to keep to the original Platform; and when I have done this, I shall,
with all Humility, submit it to Your Royal Highnesses Wise and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Judgment: For I know that in matters relating to Your
Souls welfare, You design nothing but Truth, and the best way to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97311:5"/>
secure it. This I am assured of, not only from the fam'd Integrity,
and Generousness of Your Princely Temper, that scorns to admit of
the Alloy of Secular Interest into the great Concerns of Conscience,
but by that great Courage and Resolution You have shewn for the
Maintenance of Your present Perswasion (whatever that is) to
Your great Detriment and Disadvantage of Your Affairs in this
World. But though I think it most apparently Your present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to quit that Church, yet I think it too, a very Ignoble, as well
as Irreligious Attempt, to make that an Argument for it. And I
am afraid, That is one of the highest Prejudices that Your Royal
Highness may have conceived against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
some Men in it have insisted upon Your worldly Interest too much
in a point of Conscience. And yet if by a true and sincere Account
of things, I can bring Your Conscience over to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
though I shall not bring Your Conscience to Your Interest,
yet I shall make them meet: for if that were satisfied, it is obvious
on which side the Advantage lies. And though upon the Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Conscience being satisfied, Interest might be admitted as an
accessional Motive; yet I shall entirely wave all worldly Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and disdain any Assistance that is Foreign to the cause of
Religion, and if I did not, I am sure Your Highness would.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall only humbly crave leave to represent the
true State of the Christian Church, and from thence remonstrate
to Your Princely Wisdom, that Your Highness can have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
either as a Christian Man or a Christian Prince, to concern Your
Self for the Interest, or join with the Communion of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that on the contrary you have all the Reason in the World,
upon both Accounts, to love and value the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then Christianity supposes the Temporal Power of Princes,
Civil Government being setled in the World by the general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God antecedently to our Saviour's particular Institution.
And as he found it, so he left it, with an express declaimor of any
Pretence to it, in the first place declaring that the Kingdom that
he came to establish was not of this World: that is, that he was
not invested with any Temporal Jurisdiction. And the truth is,
if he had laid claim to any such Power, his Religion had stood upon
no better foundation than <hi>Mahumetanism</hi> it self, that was at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated,
and hath been hitherto maintained merely by the Power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97311:6"/>
of the Sword. But the Design of our Savior's Institution, was pure
and unmix'd Religion, and therefore abetted it Self and its Laws
with no other Sanctions than only the Rewards and Punishments
of the Life to come. And the same Power that he exercis'd himself,
he devolv'd upon his Apostles, from them to descend upon their
Successors to the End of the World; so that all their Power, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, is of the same Nature with that which himself claim'd
whilst on Earth, that is purely spiritual and void of all temporal
Coertion. And for this Reason it is evident, that if any Church
pretend to any such Power by Virtue of his Grant or Commission,
that it is not only a Contradiction to the Nature of Christianity,
but an Atheistical Abuse put upon the whole Design of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now upon this Supposition, there are and must be in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Commonwealths where Christianity is entertained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
two distinct Jurisdictions, so as that if one entrench upon or
invade the other, it is an equal Violation of Christianity; for if the
temporal Prince assume to himself the Exercise of that Power that is
peculiarly invested in the Officers of the Church, instead of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church he destroys it: when every Church, as a Church,
is capable of no other Government but what is purely spiritual, and
delegated to it by our Saviour's special Commission, after the full
Settlement of the Power of Princes. And the same Violation of
Christianity is it, if any of the Governors of the Church should
challenge any such Power by Virtue of our Savior's Authority, for
that were to turn a spiritual into a temporal Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now these two Powers being so plainly distinct both in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Original, they must continue so notwithstanding the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Church and State into one Society. For if the Prince take
upon him the sole Government of the Church as such, he acts not
only without but against our Savior's Commission, who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
that Power to another Order of Men; and if the Priest
challenge any temporal Jurisdiction as deriv'd from our Savior, he
in effect disclaims him, in that he becomes our Savior purely by
Virtue of his spiritual Power, and Supremacy over his Church; and
therefore to pretend to any other Power deriv'd from him as Head
of it, is another way of turning Christ into <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97311:6"/>
But tho the Civil Magistrate have no share of spiritual Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet hath he a Sovereign Supremacy over the Ecclesiastical State;
otherwise he would abate of his Power by the coming of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
into the World; which contradicts the first Principle of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, that it makes no Alteration as to Civil Rights: but
then this Power over the Church is purely civil too, and relates
only to the Ends of Peace and Government in this Life, and is the
same that every Prince would have had, tho our Savior had never
come into the World; but as for that which he hath peculiarly
granted, as he hath granted no part of it to the Civil Magistrate, so
it is plain that he hath designedly setled it upon another Order of
Men, and it is they alone that have any Right to exercise it. But
notwithstanding this new Power, they are never the less Subjects
than they were before; and therefore all Christian Princes have the
same Supremacy over all the Powers of the Church, as to the Ends
of Civil Government, and as far as concerns the Affairs of this Life,
as they could have had if there were no such Powers at all.</p>
            <p>The grand Difficulty in this Case is the Danger of Competition
between these two Powers; for if they happen to contradict each
other, as they too often do, Which shall over-rule? If a Man obey
his Prince contrary to the Prescription of his spiritual Guide, he may
endanger his Soul; if he obey the Bishop, he disobeys his Prince,
and so deservedly forfeits his Neck to Justice. But this Difficulty,
as big as it may appear, is clearly remov'd by this one Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That the Christian Church, and all the Authority in it, is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Cross of Christ, and that not only claims no Power
in this World, but obliges to an entire Submission to all the Powers
of it; so that no Opposition can lawfully be made, even to the most
unlawful Commands of Sovereign Princes, but all Christians are still
bound to do as they did in the Primitive Times, to lay down their
Lives with all manner of Meekness, if their Governors, whether
right or wrong, require it. This is the true and honest State of the
Christian Church, That every Christian Man be faithful to the Laws
of his Religion, and if he suffer for it he shall be compensated for it
with those Rewards that his Religion promises. So that in all Cases
of Competition both Powers so prevail, as to attain their respective
Ends. The Civil Power over-rules as to all Effects of this Life, and
being thus gently submitted to, secures the Peace and Quiet of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97311:7"/>
World, and that is the End for which it was instituted. And the
spiritual Power attains its Effect as to the World to come, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Souls of Men by their conscientious Loyalty to their
Religion; and that is all that it aims at, or pretends to; and every
Man that professeth Christianity, takes it up upon this Condition. So
that all Resistance to secular Powers upon pretence of Religion, is a
direct Contradiction to the nature of the Christian Faith, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
open Apostacy from Christianity to Mahumetanism: And that I
am afraid will prove a gross Blemish upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
it pretends to a Power not only equal, but superior to Princes: so
that the Popes, as the Vicars of Christ, may not only contend with
them by force of Arms, but may in some Cases depose them from
their Thrones; which if truly consider'd, is no less than rank Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy
against our blessed Savior, by turning his pure Religion into
an Artifice of secular Interest.</p>
            <p>But beside this, this Point of Competition is to be chiefly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by the Matter about which it is employ'd. If the Contest be
about an Article of Faith, or any Fundamental Rule of Religion, and
the Prince will interpose his Power, tho no Man is oblig'd to obey
him, because it is certain he never was entrusted with any such
Power by our Saviour, yet is he to be submitted to with all Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by virtue of the former Principle, that requires peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Government from Christians in all Cases, for the quiet of
the World. But if the Contest be about a Ritual of Worship, or
an emergent Rule of Discipline, about which the Governors of the
Church have a Power in themselves to make Canons and new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
yet are they indispensibly bound to submit the Exercise of
it to their Prince, because that's the first Principle of Christianity, as
far as they can without Violence to the Laws of their Religion, to
comport with Civil Government; so that tho this Power be seated
properly in the Church; yet out of that great Respect and Duty that
the Christian Law requires to Princes, they are bound to make use of
it with all Deference to Sovereign Authority; especially because the
Church is accountable to it for its peaceable Behavior in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and therefore ought to give Security that it will neither
disturb the State, nor invade the Sovereign Prerogative upon this
Pretence; which because it is possible for them to do, and some have
done, they are concern'd both in Duty and Modesty to submit all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97311:7"/>
their Proceedings to his Judgment. And this, as far as I understand,
is the true State of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Act commonly
called the Submission of the Clergy, in which they do not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ar grant away their Power of making Canons, but only for
preventing all future Jealousies in the State against them, they
give all the Assurance they can, that they will not presume to
publish their Decrees without their Sovereign Lord's Consent
and Approbation. This short Account is the true State of the
Bounds of Civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and that being
setled, the next thing to be considered, is to find out what was the
true and original Settlement of the Christian Church; and by that
we shall be able to inform our selves of the good or bad state of
any present Church, as it agrees, or disagrees with it.</p>
            <p>First then, there is no one thing more clear and evident in the
Christian Religion, than that our Saviour vested the whole Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Order with a Supremacy of Power over his Church, and
that they in pursuance of this his Divine Institution ordained Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to succeed them in their Supremacy of Power through all
following Ages.</p>
            <p>That the Apostles were superior to all other Officers in the
Church, is out of question, and granted on all hands; and that
the Bishops succeeded them, is as unquestionable, from all the
clearest Records of Antiquity; their Succession, especially in the
most famous Churches, being derived by the most ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Apostles themselves, and was as easily and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to those Men that have transmitted it to us, as any
learned Man may know the Succession of the Archbishops of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> from the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> to this time.</p>
            <p>But as this Power was at first given to the Apostles, so was
it equally divided among them; so that every one exercis'd su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power within the Bounds of his own Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Epist. 52.</note>
and all together in the Catholick Church; or as
<hi>S. Cyprian</hi> states it, that as there was but one Church
founded by Christ throughout all the World, but this Church
was made up of several distinct Members, so was there but one
Episcopacy, and that consists in the Agreement and unanimous
care of all Christian Bishops: So that the whole Body of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97311:8"/>
Church was governed by the whole Body of the Apostles and
their Successors, but the several parts of it were allotted to the
Charge of single Bishops, who governed them with particular
Care, but so as to have regard to the Peace and Unity of the
Whole. This is the only Notion that this wise and good Man
(than whom there is not a more eminent Example for both upon
Record) seems in all his Writings to have had of the Catholick
Church. And as for the Apostles, who were the first Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
of it, I cannot find the least Footsteps in all the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
of any particular Prerogative granted to one above the rest.
It is true indeed that our Savior often addresses himself to <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
in particular, but then it is evident, that this is done upon
particular Occasions, and as evident too, that all the great things
that are occasionally spoken of him, are in the Scripture ascrib'd
to all the other Apostles. Thus whereas <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. our Savior
gives him the Keys of Heaven, upon his confessing him to be
the Messias, He vests all the Apostles with the same Power, and
that with particular solemnity, <hi>Iohn</hi> xx. 21. And whereas he stiles
<hi>S. Peter</hi> the Rock, or Foundation, upon which he would build
his Church, the same Title is given to all the Apostles in other
Scriptures, as <hi>Ephes. ii. 20. Built upon the Foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Prophets, Iesus Christ himself being the chief Corner
Stone.</hi> And <hi>Revel. xxi. 14. The Wall of the City had twelve Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
upon which were the Names of the twelve Apostles of the
Lamb.</hi> And in all the Gospels, unless when he applies himself
particularly to <hi>S. Peter</hi> upon the Occasion of his Zeal, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
in the Faith, our Savior invests them all with an equal
Power, especially when he gave them their grand Commission
to convert all Nations, <hi>Matth. xxviii.</hi> 19, 20. So that the Men
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> strein the Scriptures with too forc'd a
Violence, when out of such slight and accidental Occasions of
our Savior's particular Speeches to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> they would settle
such great and high Privileges upon his Person, so as to make
him sovereign Lord of all the other Apostles, and sole Monarch
of the Universal Church. This Foundation is too slight for the
Weight of so great a Building, and so big a Claim requires some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a clearer Evidence of Title; and if our Savior had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97311:8"/>
any such absolute Sovereignty to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and made that
the Fundamental Principle of his Church, certainly he would
have declared it a little more expresly, and not have left so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Point to be merely surmis'd out of occasional Discourses, of
which there are such easie and obvious Reasons to be given,
without his ever intending any such design: So that in truth to
make so much Noise as the <hi>Romanists</hi> do about the personal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> upon such poor and slender Pretences, is at once
to impose upon the Wisdom of God, as if he had laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of his Church so slightly, and to affront the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Men, as if they thought them so weak as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to any thing by such poor and precarious Arguings.</p>
            <p>But yet however I will grant more than can with any decent
modesty be demanded from these Texts, and yield that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
designed some considerable Precedency to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> above
all the other Apostles. Yet what is this to that omnipotent
Sovereignty that his Holiness challenges over the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church, who takes upon himself not only the supreme, but
almost the sole Disposal of it; whereas it is too well known, that
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> after the Privileges granted to him, was commanded
by an Order of the other Apostles, <hi>Acts viii.</hi> 14. which could
never have been done, if his Power had been Monarchical over
them all. Neither do we find him any where exercising any such
Sovereignty over them; for tho by reason of his ready Faculty
of Speech he was usually the first Speaker, yet we do no where
find, that he either challeng'd or practis'd any other Precedency.
So that tho he was the first that delivered his Opinion in the
Council of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet it was <hi>S. Iames</hi> that determined and
pronounced the Decree, in that he was Bishop of the Place, as
is undeniably evident from the most undoubted Records of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
Which yet he ought not to have done, if <hi>S. Peter</hi> had
been endued with the same Superiority over all the rest of the
Apostles, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> challenges over all the other
Bishops of the Christian Church. But not to insist upon these
remote and obscure Footsteps of <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s Primacy in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
I will freely grant him out of the Holy Text it self some
considerable Precedency: tho when I have done that too, what
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97311:9"/>
is it to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than it is to the Bishop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or the Bishops of several other Places, in
which <hi>S. Peter</hi> first planted the Christian Faith: so that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of all those Places have as fair a Title to be <hi>S. Peter</hi>'s
Successors as the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet this great point I
shall be so civil as to admit, and grant that the peculiar Right
of Succession to the Privileges of <hi>S. Peter</hi> (if any such there
were) was appropriated to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> but still, What is
this to that universal Jurisdiction that is challenged by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of this to this See, as the supreme and infallible Governors of
the Catholick Church? For after all other Disputes, 'tis this that
is the only dividing Point between us; 'tis this that is the only
Fundamental Article of their Church; 'tis this for which they
load us so heavily with their honorable Titles of Hereticks and
Schismaticks. And so no doubt are we, if his Holiness be vested
by Divine <hi>Right,</hi> with that universal Supremacy that he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
over the whole Christian Church. In a word, if we take
this one Controversie away, I, for my part, know no other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
as to Ecclesiastical Constitution. But now if this one Point of
the Supremacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> were the great Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Christian Faith, (as it must be, if his pretences to it
by divine Right are true) it is a very strange thing that there
should not be so much as the shadow of any such Authority in
all the Records of the Primitive Church. Is it not very odd, that
when so many Controversies were started in the Christian Church,
both in the Apostles own time, and in the Ages next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
following, and that when Almighty God had appointed
<hi>S. Peter</hi> and his Successors in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the certain and
undoubted Judges for ending all Controversies, that yet none
of the Apostles or Primitive Doctors of the Christian Church,
that labor'd so much against Schisms, Heresies, and Divisions,
should ever so much as think of or mention such an effectual nay
infallible Remedy against them all? One Appeal to the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> had put an End to all further Trouble, and certainly
had God vested him with that Power over the whole Christian
Church, they could never have been so stupid, as never to have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97311:9"/>
taken any notice of it, And yet we find not the least mention of
it for many hundred years, after the settlement of Christianity in
the World. And perhaps the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of it, had it not been first put into their Heads by the
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by whom it was (as I shall shew in the
sequel of this Discourse) first claimed. Some small glimmerings
indeed we meet with of some honorary Preeminence or Dignity
allowed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the score of its being the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
City, and by reason of the great resort to it, of its being one
of the most competent Witnesses of the true Tradition of Christianity:
But that it should have any Jurisdiction over any other Churches
out of its own Province, much more such an universal power over
all Churches in the World as is now challeng'd, is a Notion so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
strange and unknown to all Antiquity, that the bare silence
of it alone is an irrefragable demonstration of the Novelty of the
Pretence. But for the greater Evidence of this thing (which
indeed is the first point of Controversie between us) I shall make
bold as briefly as I can, to give Your Royal Highness a true and
impartial account of the State of the Christian Church from the
beginning: and then of the several and gradual Alterations that
were by Ecclesiastical Constitutions made in it in after times: and
lastly how, and how late the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> climb'd up to that
infinite Authority, that they have for some Ages exercised, and
still claim over the Christian Church. And when I have done all
this, I may safely leave it to Your Royal Highnesses Princely
Wisdom to judge, what Obligation You can have in Conscience to
leave the Communion of the <hi>Britannick</hi> Church for that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the first place, there is nothing more evident in all
the Records of the Primitive Church, than that the Apostles and
first Doctors of the Christian Faith modell'd the first Settlement
of Churches according to the then present State and Division of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For though our blessed Saviour settled the
Supreme Government of his Church upon his holy Apostles and
their Successors, yet he no where prescribed the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of every Man's Jurisdiction, but left it, as indeed the Nature
of the thing required, to Humane Prudence ot divide the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
among themselves, as they should judge most convenient for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97311:10"/>
the Advantage of their common Christianity. And accordingly
we find from the very beginning, that they formed the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Churches, according to the Civil Judicatures of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
common Prudence directing them so to do, not only for the
more speedy Propagation of Christianity by the resort of all People
to the Metropolis of the Province, which they therefore constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Mother Church of it, but that whenever the Powers of the
World should come in to own Christianity, the better Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
might be maintain'd between the States, Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
And beside this by making the Head City of every Province
the Metropolis of the Church within that Province, upon which the
inferior Cities depended as the Centre of Communion, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
admirably secur'd the Unity of the whole Body, while every Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Church exercised ordinary Jurisdiction within it self, but was
bound, either in cases of great Difficulty, or such as concerned the
common Christianity, to have recourse to the Mother-Church.</p>
            <p>And this was apparently, the Original of the Privilege and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
of some Churches above others from the beginning; not
that they ever pretended to any Sovereignty over them in their
particular Jurisdictions, but only as the Centre of Ecclesiastical
Unity, so as to decide Controversies, whenever any inferior
Church appealed to them for their Advice, or to summon Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and preside over them in all Debates that concerned common
Christianity. And that this Distribution of Provinces and Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
was setled by the Apostles, seems evident from their own
Writings, who every where describe the bounds of Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Constitution of the Empire. Thus St. <hi>Peter</hi> directs
his Epistle to the several Churches of the Christian <hi>Iews,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to so many several Provinces, <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi>
and <hi>Bythinia,</hi> which as they were distinct Provinces in the
Civil Division of the Empire, so were they from that time
forward, so many distinct Provincial Sees, in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church. And nothing is more obvious in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than that whenever he makes mention of any
Church, he either calls it by the name of the Province it self, or
the Metropolis or Head City of it. And as this design of conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ecclesiastical State to the Civil, was first set on foot by the
Apostles; so was it carefully prosecuted by their Successors, of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97311:10"/>
which we have an eminent Instance in the Apostolical Canons,
(which though they were not compiled by the Apostles themselves,
yet they were by Apostolical Men, and such as immediately suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
them) where it is decreed in the 34 Canon, That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of every Nation should acknowledge their Primate or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,
and honor him as their Head, and do nothing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Christian Church wthout his consent, nor he without
theirs. Now that this was prescribed by the Apostles themselves,
is evident in that, as this Canon was made a very short time after
their Decease, so it is not a new Law, but a Ratification of an old
Custom, as indeed most of the Apostolical Canons seem to be.
This was apparently the Constitution of the Christian Churches in
all places of the Empire for the first three hundred years, or the
whole interval of time from our Saviour to <hi>Constantine,</hi> that as
every City was governed by its own Bishop, so was every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
by its own Metropolitan in his Synod of Bishops, of which
there are many Instances in the Records of the Church, though
I shall mention but one, as the most eminent of all, and that is,
the several Synods that were called about the Paschal Controversie,
not long after the time of the Apostles themselves: which as it was
canvassed all the World over, so was it debated in so many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synods in each whereof the Metropolitan presided; in
<hi>Palestin, Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea;</hi> in <hi>Pontus, Palma</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Armastris;</hi> in the Proconsular <hi>Asia, Policrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi>
in <hi>Italy, Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> in <hi>France, Irenaeus</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Lyons;</hi> where every Synod judged for it self, and made its own
Decrees, only <hi>Victor</hi> would have been meddling with the Church
of <hi>Asia,</hi> though as far as appears from records, not from any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he pretended to over it, but out of an intemperate Zeal
for his own Opinion. But in this he is quickly check'd by the
other Churches especially that of <hi>France,</hi> though of the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
with himself as to the matter of the Controversie, as he
would not break the Unity of the Christian Church, which was
to be maintained by no other means, than keeping up the Rights
of every part of it. And this they admirably preserved by their
communicatory Letters between Church and Church, so as no
Member of one Church might be admitted to Communion with
another without his Letters Testimonial, whereby it was so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97311:11"/>
that whosoever was Excommunicate out of a particular
Church, was shut out of the Church Catholick. Neither could a
Bishop exercise any part of his Office in any other Diocese than his
own, much less any other Province; and if he did, his own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan
was obliged to throw him out of Communion, and all
other not to take him in. And this was the occasion of that sixth
famous Canon of the first Council of <hi>Nice</hi> under <hi>Constantine</hi> the
Great, that confirms to the three great Churches of <hi>Rome, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> their ancient Privileges and Preeminences.
For though some learned Men both within and without the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> have been pleased to dispute that the Power here abetted
in this Canon was Patriarchical, and not merely Metropolitical, yet
that it was not Patriarchical is notoriously evident, because there
is not the least mention of any such Office in all the Records of the
Christian Church before the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> which was above
an hundred years after that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and yet this <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirms the old, and accustomed Rights of Churches. And
that this power was Metropolitical, is manifest, because it was
made purely in pursuance of the fore-mentioned <hi>34th</hi> Apostolical
Canon, that requires the Subjection of all other inferior Bishops
to their National or Provincial Bishops. The occasion of it was
this, That <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicapolis,</hi> within the Province of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> being deposed by his Metropolitan in a Synod of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
as for divers other Crimes, so particularly for Sacrificing to
Idols, notwithstanding that takes upon him to Ordain new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
himself, and so violates all the Preeminences of his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,
both by slighting his Censure, and invading his Power. Now
complaint hereof being brought to the Council, they decree that
the ancient Prerogatives of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Churches within its Province, shall be kept as inviolable as
those of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the same for <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and not only so in those
great Sees, but in all other Provinces whatsoever, for so the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
expresly runs, that not only at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> but that in all other
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Provinces their ancient Privileges should be preserved.
So that here is nothing peculiar to these three great Cities deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
because the Jurisdictions of all other Provinces that were in
force at that time, were as much ratified by the same Authority
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97311:11"/>
and that was only this, That whatever Superiority greater Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
had by long Custom enjoyed over less, should stand confirmed
for the time to come. And accordingly we find it decreed in the
second Canon of the second general Council held at <hi>Constantinople</hi>
as a clear Interpretation of the sixth Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should contain themselves within the known Circuit of their
Jurisdiction, and not thrust themselves into other Diocesses, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> should be confin'd within the
Diocese of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Antiochia</hi> within that of the East, and that
the Churches of <hi>Asia, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Thracia,</hi> should enjoy the antient
Power of Government within themselves, as well as those that
had invaded their Right; this being the occasion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the Council, that <hi>Miletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> had made
<hi>Gregory Nazienzen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> had done the same for <hi>Maximus,</hi> whereas <hi>Constantinople</hi>
was in <hi>Thrace,</hi> that was a Diocese by it self in the Civil Division
of the Empire, and therefore exempt from the Jurisdiction of those
great Prelates, having the same supreme and independent Power
within it self, as they had within their Provinces, as had also the
lesser <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> which that they might not be encroach'd
upon, or swallowed up by their Potent Neighbors, were here guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and settled by the Decree of the Council in the Possession of
their ancient Rights, against all future Invasions. And the same
Decree we find in the next general Council held at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
the eighth, upon the like occasion, the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon him to Ordain in the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that was an head
Province by it self; This Usurpation therefore the Council severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
censures and forbids, and withal orders that no Metropolitan
should challenge any further extent of Jurisdiction that he could
not prove by long and immemorial Prescription, lest under the
Pretence of their Priestly Office, they should introduce a secular
Sovereignty into the Church.</p>
            <p>Infinite are the Instances in the Records of the Church of the
Metropolitical Supremacy of Churches, but these that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
alledged are enough to shew the true Primitive and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Constitution of the Christian Church, which lasted the same
even as to the bounds of Jurisdiction till the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97311:12"/>
Great. But the casting the Civil Government of the Empire into
a new Model, gave occasion to the Church in pursuance of its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Rule of conforming to the Civil Government, to add to the
old Ecclesiastical Hierarchy; for the whole Empire being divided
into thirteen Diocesses, each Diocese containing many Provinces,
in all to the number of 120, and every Province several inferior
Cities. And therefore as every City had its Judge for Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
so had it its Bishop for Ecclesiastical, and every Province
its President, so its Metropolitan; and every Diocese, which then
contained several Provinces, its Lieutenant, so its Primate. Which
indeed was nothing else, but raising up a superior Order of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans
in conformity to the new Model of Civil Government;
and therefore was at first nothing else but an honorary Title that
gave them Precedency to the Metropolitans, but not Jurisdiction
over them. For the very first time that we meet with any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any such Order in the Church is in the second Canon of the
second general Council held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> under <hi>Theodosius</hi> the
Great, where at the same time that it institutes this new kind of
Dignity, it secures the old Jurisdiction of Metropolitans. So that
notwithstanding this new Order was brought over their heads in
conformity to the Empire, yet was every Metropolitan Church to
be governed by it self, and its own Synod, in the same manner as
it was accustomed of old, and was confirmed by the decree of the
Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Which Council positively asserts the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Power, to every Metropolitan within his own Province.
And therefore all the Preeminence of this new Order of Men above
them could consist in nothing but Title and Dignity. And it is
sufficiently known to all that know any thing of the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Church that they had their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> their
Preeminences of Respect, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their Preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Power and Authority. And it was usual upon particular
occasions to give the former without conferring the latter, as the
great Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gave to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Honor, because it was the Mother of all Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving it any Metropolitical Jurisdiction, for that was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
entirely for the Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> which after the Destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been made the Civil Metropolis of <hi>Palestin</hi> by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97311:12"/>
Emperor <hi>Vespasian,</hi> so this present Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of
which we are speaking in the Canon next following that we last
mentioned, gives the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Preeminencies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
next to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
because <hi>Constantinople</hi> was new <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet gives it nothing of
Metropolitical Power, because it expresly confirms the old Rights
of the three Metropolitans of <hi>Asia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> to which
it belonged, in the Canon immediately foregoing. In short, all the
Privileges of the ancient Metropolitans were divided into two sorts,
those of Honour and those of Power; the former the Fathers
of this Council gave to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to the new Imperial City, but neither could nor would
give any thing of the latter; because that was not to be done
without violating and alienating the real Rights and Priviledges
of other Men. But yet however, when once they had gor an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Title, it easily made way to advance themselves to an higher
Power, insomuch that in a short time after he swallow'd up all
the three Metropolitans of <hi>Thrace, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> into his own
Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>And now this superior Order of Primates to Metropolitans,
being thus set up by Ecclesiastical Constitution, it in a little
time made way for the Patriarchical Dignity; the Title where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was at first borrowed from the wandring Jews of those times,
who wherever they settled in any considerable Number, after
their dispersion from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> chose a supreme Governour,
whom they stil'd their Patriarch; but about the fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or somewhat after, this Title and Authority was taken from
the Jews, and applyed to the new <hi>supra</hi>-Metropolitan Bishops,
that it seems as yet had obtain'd no peculiar Name in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. Thus <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Historian of the Church at
that time, reckons up <hi>Nectarius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Helladius</hi> of
<hi>Pontus, Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyssa, Ottreius</hi> of <hi>Melitina, Amphilochius</hi> of
<hi>Iconium, Optimus</hi> of the <hi>Pisidian Antioch, Timotheus</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
Pelagius</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and many more.
Tho in a little time the Title came to be appropriated to the
five most eminent Sees, <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and they were made superior, not only
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97311:13"/>
in Title, but in Jurisdiction to all Metropolitans within their
Diocess, because it seems, those Cities being the five chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the World, had their Claims to higher Dignity in the
civil Government than all others. <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> the head City of <hi>Africk,</hi> and Seat of the Great
<hi>Ptolomys; Antiochia,</hi> Queen of the East, and Seat of the Great
<hi>Seleucus</hi> and his Successors; <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Mother City of all
Christian Churches; and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the new <hi>Rome</hi> of the
Empire, that had at that time over-topt old <hi>Rome</hi> in Greatness
and Authority. Now the Rights that were peculiar to these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
above Metropolitans, were these,</p>
            <p>First, that wherever they presided, they had many Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans
under their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they only had right to ordain the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans
within their own Patriarchate, as Metropolitans had Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
within their own Province.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that as Metropolitans had power to call the Bishops
of their Province to Synods, so had Patriarchs to call their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that they were the supreme Judicature within their
own Patriarchates, no farther appeal being to be made from a
Patriarch.</p>
            <p>And thus was the Church for a long time govern'd, every
Patriarch enjoying supreme Power within his own Precincts,
and no farther; insomuch that the Rule was adopted into the
imperial Law, <hi>A Patriarcha non datur Appellatio;</hi> No Appeal
from a Patriarch; and yet that alone is a plain Bar to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of the Pope, or any other, over the whole Christian
Church.</p>
            <p>But then, as for the Bounds of Jurisdiction, they still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Division of the State; and there it so happen'd, that
the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho for the sake of the old imperial City,
he had Precedency in Honor above all the rest, had one of
the narrowest Jurisdictions of all, his Patriarchate extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at the farthest, not beyond <hi>Italy</hi> and the adjacent Islands;
tho according to the true account, it was not at first above
half so great, <hi>Italy</hi> being divided into two Parts under two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97311:13"/>
one residing at <hi>Rome,</hi> who governed the Suburbica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Provinces, so call'd, because of their lying nearest to the
City; the other at <hi>Milain,</hi> who govern'd the more remote Parts.
And after the same manner was the Government of the Church
divided into the <hi>Roman</hi> Diocess, that was subject to the Bishops
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Italic</hi> Diocess, of which <hi>Milain</hi> was the Head;
over which we do not find that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time, ever pretended any Patriarchical Supremacy; nay, on
the contrary, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was ordained in the Year of our
Lord 555. Bishop thereof, by a Synod of Bishops of the <hi>Italic</hi>
Diocess, which he could not have been, had the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
been his Patriarch, the power of Ordination being the chief
Branch of Patriarchical Jurisdiction. But how great or little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was the Circuit of his Patriarchate, it was limited within
certain Bounds, as the other Patriarchates were. And as the
Patriarchs were Supreme within their own Diocess, so were
most of the Metropolitans within their own Province: For tho
where Patriarchs were erected, the Metropolitans, within the
compass of their Patriarchate, were subject to them, yet all the
other Metropolitans of the Christian Church enjoy'd their own
antient Supremacy, and continued, as they were before, Head-Churches,
exercising Supreme Power within themselves: Of
which there were great Numbers in the World, and some of
as large Jurisdiction as the Patriarchates, especially in <hi>Asia.</hi>
But as for the Patriarchate of <hi>Rome,</hi> it never extended its Power
beyond <hi>Italy,</hi> and its adjacent Islands: And therefore it is very
observable, that the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> care not
that it should be known to the Christian World: So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
all their Brags of Universal Pastorship, when they come
to make it out, their Manuscripts still fail them. <hi>Carolus à
Sancto Paulo</hi> hath taken most Pains of any in this Argument,
and hath done well enough in other Parts; but when he comes
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there his Manuscript is so worn out
and defective, that it was not worth publishing.</p>
            <p>Now doth not this look oddly, that their Books should fail
them thus, only in their own Cause; and doth it not rather
give suspicion, that themselves are too well aware, that they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97311:14"/>
would do them no real kindness. However, it is a very prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
thing, for a Man to pretend to a Title to a great Estate
by virtue of some antient Writings, and yet when he comes to
try his Title, should only plead, that indeed such Writings there
once were, but that they are now so impair'd that they are not
legible. And yet, this is the very Case of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
here. All Christendom, at least the Western Empire, ought to
be subject to him as their Patriarch. Why so? Because he ever
was so. How doth that appear? By the ancient <hi>Notitiae</hi> of the
Church. Produce them. So we can for all the other Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates,
but those that concern the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
lost. Are they so? Then you have lost the Evidence of
your Title, and for ought you do, or can know, never had any.</p>
            <p>But instead of this shifting and prevaricating that we meet
with in the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is not long
since publish'd by a very learned and a very honest
Gentleman of our own Church and Nation,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Beveridge.</hi>
               </note> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Description of all the Patriarchates, out of an ancient
and authentic Manuscript, which reckons to the Patriarchate of
<hi>Rome,</hi> only <hi>Italy</hi> and the adjacent Islands; but not a syllable
of <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Gaul,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or any other of the
large Territories in <hi>Europe;</hi> which, if they had belonged to this
Patriarchate at that time, could never have been omitted in this
exact Catalogue, that hath so carefully set down every petty
City in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this posture stood the Government of the Church for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, without any considerable Alteration: For tho some
of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> would have been usurping upon the
Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> by pretending to a Right of Appeals from
them, they were repulsed with great Shame and Dishonour.
And were it not that I am unwilling to trouble Your Highness
with any more Disputes, than what concerns our own Church
with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is nothing more easie than to
shew, that this Controversie with the <hi>African</hi> Churches is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Instance of both the Frauds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and
of other Churches abhorring his remotest aim at any Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
But tho he missed his design at that time, his Successors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97311:14"/>
were ever after watchful of all other Opportunities to compass
it: And to that purpose they happen'd to have two very lucky
Advantages; the first was the fatal Division of the Empire into
East and West, from whence S. <hi>Gregory Nazienzen,</hi> a Man both
wise and pious, foretold a more fatal Division in the Church;
and accordingly, in a little time it came to pass, that the whole
Body of it was divided into East and West, as well as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
and the Division was quickly heightned by the mutual
Jealousies of the Emperors, who would not suffer the Bishops
under one Government, to repair to Councils conven'd under
the other: And that in a short time grew to alienations of
Minds; so that they kept their Councils apart, and if any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the East repair'd to a Synod of the West, and so for
the contrary, He was look'd upon as a Betrayer of his own
Church. And this was the occasion of the after-greatness of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in these Western Parts; because that alone
of all the five Patriarchates happen'd to go along with the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Empire. For having no Competitor for the Supremacy,
or so much as the equality of Power in the Western Church,
it was no hard matter to advance it self to any degree of
Power that it pleased to challenge, especially when the Western
Churches were forward enough of themselves to advance its
Dignity, for the Honor of their own Patriarchate, in opposition
to that of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> which being the Seat of the Empire,
and enjoying the Favor of the Emporors, soon over top'd all
the other Eastern Patriarchates; so that all the Competition that
remain'd was between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Till at last in
the Sixth Century, <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> first obtained
of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor, the Title of Universal Bishop, which
very Title was quickly and vehemently oppos'd by <hi>Gregory</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Piece of Antichristian Pride and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
But <hi>Mauritius</hi> being murdered by <hi>Phocas,</hi> and <hi>Cyriacus</hi>
then Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being fallen under the new Tyrant's
Disfavor, for declaring against his execrable Murder, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome</hi> seizes that Opportunity to flatter and caress him
in all his Wickedness; for which Civility the Usurper takes the
Title of Universal Bishop, and settles it upon the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:97311:15"/>
And when once they had obtained the Title, they resolv'd to
make it good, by gaining the Power too. Tho by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they encroach'd upon other Churches, it is not at all to
my purpose here to represent, it is enough to have shewn the
late Original of the Title, which was never given them till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
600 Years after our Saviour.</p>
            <p>This then being the true and real state of all the Christian
Church, the Conclusion plainly makes it self, as to any <hi>English</hi>
Christian's Obligation to communicate with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as it is the indispensible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of every Man to joyn in visible Communion with the Society
of the Church, so is the first visible Society of the Church set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in the Communion of the Bishop of the Diocess. And
thence evident it is, that the first Duty of every Christian, as
to external Communion with the Church, is to joyn in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Bishop of the Place where he lives. For if
our Saviour setled the Government of the Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and if the Episcopal Order succeeded them in their Office,
then hath every Bishop Apostolical Authority. And then is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian Man bound to submit to his Bishop, as to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
from whence the Bishop derives the Succession of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Authority. So that the Episcopal Society is the first
visible Communion of the Christian Church, and a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Member of the Church-Catholic, by joyning in visible
Communion with the Church-Episcopal; for it is impossible to
be a Member of the Universal Church, without being first a
Member of some particular Church, both because the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church is made up of the Combination of particular Churches,
and because there is no way of Communicating in the Offices
of Religion, but under some limited Societies. The Bishop then
in every Diocess is, as Successor in the Apostolical Office, Head
of the Communion within his own Diocess, and for that Reason,
the ordinary Judge and Guide to all Christians within his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
So false is that Calumny, of which the Romanists
pretend to make so much Advantage against the Constitution
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that She doth not so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any living Judge of Faith: For what Judge She owns,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97311:15"/>
as to the Catholic Church, I may shew in its proper place. But
as for every particular Christian, She commits him to the Care
of his Bishop, as his ordinary Guide and Governour in the things
that concern his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now if this be the setled Constitution of the Christian Church,
as it was from the beginning, I cannot understand how any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
can leave the Communion of his own Bishop, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with any other, without being guilty of Schism against the
Church that he lives in.</p>
            <p>For tho he may advise with any other Bishop about the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of his Soul, and follow his Advice as a Friend; yet by the
original Constitution of the Church, none but his own Bishop
can have any authoritative Commission for his Guidance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
So easie is the Answer to that solemn Question,
Who is the living Judge and Guide of your Faith? For if it be
put to a private Christian, it is plain, that from the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Catholic Church, as it was setled by the Apostles,
that it is the Bishop under whom he lives, to whom God hath
committed the ordinary means of the Salvation of his Flock,
and promised to be assistant to him and the Successors in his
Office to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>This is the first visible Society or Communion of a Christian
Church, and was evidently laid and design'd by our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in his Institution of the Episcopal Office. The next is
founded upon Apostolical Prescription, and that is the Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bishops of a Province with their Metropolitan; for
in the Plantation of Churches, as they cut out the Communion
of Christians into particular Bishopricks, so they again united
the several Bishopricks of every Nation into one Communion
under one Head; who as he is superior to every single Bishop
within his Resort; so is he is his Synod of Bishops Supreme Judge
of all Controversies within the Province. These Provincial As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
I have shewn, were the highest Power of the Primitive
Church in all Places; neither indeed (setting aside the Promise
of divine Assistance to them) is there need of any further Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
upon humane accounts; for the Controversives in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
are not so monstrously difficult, but that a competent Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97311:16"/>
of grave and sober Men, may determine well enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
calling together all the wise Men in the World; and if Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are not sufficient to decide any Controversie, I know not what
Number is. And as this was the standing ordinary Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the first Ages of the Church, so the Christians of those
Times suppos'd the means of Salvation sufficiently secur'd in such
Hands, and certainly, that which was sufficient to them, is so
to us.</p>
            <p>And as this was the highest Government in the Church for
the first three Hundred Years, so those more diffusive Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
that were afterward summon'd, and that we call general
Councils, were really of the same nature; for as a Provincial
Assembly was national, so were these Imperial, and therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
but to one civil Government. So that as the Empire was
indeed but one great Kingdom, so was the Church in it but one
great Province, they being both under the same extent of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
And this is the true Use of Councils, whether greater
or less, by the Decree of the Representatives of Churches to bind
those Churches that they represent. And that is but a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing in all Societies, that they should be determin'd by
their Governours, especially when they are set over them by the
appointment of God himself. Neither is it so very material,
how large Councils are, as to their Obligation; for whether
they be greater or less, they equally bind all that are involv'd
within the compass of their Authority. And tho there may be
greater Presumption in the Decrees of the greater Councils, yet
are they for the most part meetings rather of Grandeur than
Necessity, but especially those that we call General Councils, are
now so difficult to be summon'd, that they are become almost
impracticable. Whilst indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire stood entire, it
was not so hard to convene them, yet even then was it a Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of so much Time and Charges as made it too burthensom
to be born, by any thing less than the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, and that
too in very rare and extraordinary Cases.</p>
            <p>But if so, it could never then be intended for the standing and
perpetual Government of the Christian Church. But now that
<hi>Christendom</hi> is divided into so many civil Governments, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97311:16"/>
are so great and so many, through the various Interests
of Princes, either to promote or hinder it, as to render it next to
impossible. Tho if it could be fairly had, the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
would not refuse her Concurrence in it, both as being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Goodness of her Cause, in that she owns no other
Rule of her Reformation, but the Practice of the Primitive and
Apostolick Church, and as well knowing that the greatest part
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would as willingly rid themselves of those
Abuses that have been put upon them by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
we have done. And this the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Bishops had
carried through, even in that pack'd Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> had not
the Pope poured in a number of Titular <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
them. But it is none of my present Business to rake into
the Faults of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> 'tis enough to my purpose to
vindicate the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Granting
therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a pure and uncorrupted
Church, yet because it is a Foreign Church, no Man can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any Obligation, to leave the Communion of his own to joyn
with that.</p>
            <p>In this one point I fix the State of this whole Address, and
say nothing at present to persuade any Person that lives within
the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to forsake that; my
only Concernment is with the Members of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
to keep them to their own Church, according to the Rule
from the Beginning. If it be objected, That the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
be a narrow Thing in comparison of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
I answer, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not pretend to be
the Church Catholick, but only a Member of it: and in that
Station it is as large a Church as any were in the Primitive Times.
Neither then did the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> consist
in an Union of all Churches, under one Head, but in brotherly
Love and Correspondence with one another: and for that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is ready to offer it to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
or any other, upon the old Condition, that they will give her
leave to admonish them of their Faults and Miscarriages, as
Churches did one another of old. But this is a Civility that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is too proud to accept of; it must be all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97311:17"/>
or it will be none at all. It allows no Equals in Communion,
and condescends to no Treaty but upon Terms of absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
neither is it content to enslave all its Neighbors to its
own imperious Decrees, unless they be submitted to as the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Dictates of God himself. Now this seems too much for
Men to swallow that have any sense or care of their Salvation:
for by this means the whole Faith of <hi>Christendom</hi> shall be left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
at the Disposal of one single Person, and the Pope alone
shall be the whole <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> This I say seems too much
to venture upon one single Security, especially unless it were
confirmed by some clearer Commission than those remote and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Texts of Scripture that are alledg'd for the Papal Supremacy.
But to return from the Pope to the Church; As the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Churches was conform'd to the civil Government,
so indeed no other is practicable. For upon that Supposition,
that Christianity makes no Abatement as to the civil Rights of
Men, especially of Princes; provincial Churches cannot be justly
extended beyond the Dominion of the State; because in that case
if Metropolitans or Patriarchs have power to call their Subject-Bishops
to Councils, the King's Subjects may be summoned out
of his Dominions without his leave, which is not only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish,
but to destroy his Power over his own Subjects; for
when they are out of his Dominions they are none of his. So that
the very State of Christianity naturally implies, as it would not
be inconsistent with it self, the Conformity of the Church to the
State in its bounds of Jurisdiction. And this is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that known Saying of one of the Fathers, <hi>That the Church
is in the Commonwealth, and not the Commonwealth in the Church;</hi>
for the Civil Government being first constituted, and the Church
being afterwards taken into it, it must for that Reason keep it
self within it, otherwise it breaks down its old Bounds of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But beside that the Nature of Government confines every
Church within the Prince's Dominions in which it is; so it is
highly convenient, if not absolutely necessary, to the due and
effectual Exercise of Discipline, that the Society of the Church
be confined within some moderate Circuit of Government: for
great Governments are slow and unweildy in their Motions; the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97311:17"/>
very distance of Place makes all Proceedings uneasie, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
difficult; and of this our Nation was sufficiently sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
when all Ecclesiastical Appeals were carried to <hi>Rome;</hi> the
Journey was tedious and chargable; and by reason of the distance
of Witnesses, and other Inconveniences, Proceedings infinitely
dilatory, I might say endless, Causes depending there from Age
to Age: this is too notorious, from the sad and open Complaints
of those Times; and I my self enjoy a small Office in this Church,
wherein my Predecessors had a Suit for a Privilege belonging to it,
hanging in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for some hundreds of Years, till
the very time of the Dissolution of the Pope's Power.</p>
            <p>These are intolerable Grievances to Mankind, and heavier Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
than were ever imposed upon them by the most barbarous
civil Government. If therefore his Holiness will challenge a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
over all Christian Churches, let him not exercise his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in ordinary Causes, that is contrary to all the Canons of
the Church and Quiet of the World. We will not contend with
him about his Patriarchical Preheminence, if that would give him
Satisfaction, tho we know he hath not the least pretence of any
claim to it over us. But when under that Pretext he takes to
himself the Office of Universal Bishop, that is, to be all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of Christendom, 'tis that exorbitant Usurpation that is not
our Complaint alone, but the universal Complaint of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it self. And therefore if he would keep within his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical
Bounds and Privileges, which yet he enjoys not by divine
Right but humane Institution, we would give him all that Respect
and Reverence that is due to the Primacy of his See. But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Brotherly Communion with us, nothing less will serve
his Turn than absolute Dominion over us, and if Submission to
that must be made our only Title to the Catholick Church, as
if we had no Right to Christianity but by Subjection to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome:</hi> these cannot but seem too hard Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
or if they are not, it is enough that they are unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable;
or if they are not so, it is enough that they are not
necessary. And that they are not, is evident from the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
where I have demonstrated, that the first Duty of every
Christian, as a Member of the Christian Church, is to joyn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97311:18"/>
with his own Bishop, as the first Political Society of a
Church. And that the next is a Combination of all the Bishops
within one civil Government under one Metropolitan. That
this Polity was set on foot by the Apostles themselves, and
every where put in practice in the Primitive Church; that the
Ecclesiastical Province cannot extend beyond the Precincts of the
Civil without infringing the Authority of Sovereign Princes, and
therefore, that no foreign Prelate can have or exercise any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Power over his Majesty's Subjects, because that would
give them Power to command them out of his Dominions: So
plainly doth the Nature of Civil Government set Bounds to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Societies; which one thing, if duely consider'd, must
cut off all Claims of Papal Supremacy over this Church, because,
by virtue of it he would have such a kind of Power over His
Majesty's Subjects, as the Christian Religion doth by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any its Officers. And as this was the Settlement of National
Churches from the beginning of Christianity, so is it the present
Constitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is or would be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by its Metropolitan in his Synod of Bishops subject to one
Civil Government.</p>
            <p>And as this is all the Political Society that a Christian Church
is capable of, so all the Communion that it can have with other
Churches, consists in brotherly Love and mutual Correspondence.
And this way was the Christian Church, in the first Ages of it,
preserv'd in competent Peace and Unity. And whatever other
Power was afterward erected in the Church, was founded upon
humane Institution, and therefore is alterable in it self, at least
not necessary to the Being of a Christian Church. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
were the several Patriarchates; so that whatever Power the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> can challenge by virtue of his Patriarchical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
is of an humane Original, and so not necessary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of a Christian Church.</p>
            <p>Nay, tho he once had such a Power, yet upon the Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Civil and Ecclesiastical Government that gave it him,
it ceases with it. For it was granted him by the Emperors, and
Imperial Councils, and so extended only to the Subjects of the
Empire; for they could not give him any Power in other Princes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97311:18"/>
Dominions. The Empire therefore being broken into many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Kingdoms, the Patriarchate dissolves with it, because
otherwise a Foreigner would have an Authority in all Princes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
to the Prejudice of the Sovereign Power, which is the first
thing that Christianity disclaims, and therefore is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with it. But however if the Pope have his old Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
Power still, he had it not of old over us, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have it now, and though he have, yet it is but of Humane
Institution. And then we are a true Church without it, and if
we are, then can no Man be obliged in Conscience to forsake the
Communion of this Church, that is setled as all other Churches
were by the Apostles, to join with one another, only for the sake
of some alteration made in it by Humane Authority.</p>
            <p>And thus having truly and impartially laid before Your Royal
Highness the State of the Christian Church, especially as to the
prime Controversie between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Guide of Faith, I have so great
confidence in the Power of Truth, over an upright and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Mind, as to flatter my self with some Hopes of settling
Your Royal Highnesses Conscience in the Communion of this
truly ancient and Apostolical Church. Nay, I hope not only
to see You a Zealous Son, but an eminent Patron of the best,
but most abused Church in the Christian World, so as to be the
principal Author of rescuing her from those horrid Indignities
and Oppressions that she daily suffers from the Barbarity of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Atheism and Profaneness.</p>
            <p>But whatever the Success of this small Endeavor may prove,
it is not a little Satisfaction that I reap, from having done my
Duty to Your Royal Highness and mine own Conscience. For
I have no other design than to promote the Salvation of Your
Soul and my own. But though I am so fully conscious to my self
of mine own Integrity, yet when I reflect upon what I have done,
I blush and am confounded in my self at the Presumption of
obtruding my crude Thoughts upon the Wisdom of a Mighty
Prince, and therefore had utterly stisled them after they were
finished, had not the great Fame of Your Highnesses Princely
Candor emboldned me to present them, as being at least secure
of a gracious Pardon to a well-meant Presumption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97311:19"/>
I intended, when I had shewn the No-Necessity of Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon his own Terms, because
its Pretences are a manifest Usurpation upon the Christian Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the next place to have represented the gross Abuse that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
puts upon Christianity, by pretending some way or other,
directly or indirectly, to a temporal Power over Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
whereas to pretend to it, by virtue of any Power deriv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from our Saviour, only over Subjects, is no less than Blasphemy
my against him; but over Princes, it adds to that Rebellon. (So
that how many Notes soever there may be of a true Church
this is an infallible Note of a false one). But then considering
with my self that Your Royal Highness is the second Branch of
an Imperial Family, and Heir to several Crowns, I thought my
self obliged, according to my Resolution declar'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to wave the Advantage of this Argument: because Your
Highness is here a Party, and it concerns Your worldly Interest
more nearly than Your Conscience, to which alone I have made
bold to make this Address, and in it I assure my self, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the Kingdoms in the World would weigh nothing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without giving Your Royal Highness any farther trouble
more than once more of craving Pardon for this great Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;</p>
            <p>I shall submit the Consideration of the Premises to Your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
