            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE drift of this Treatise is, to shew a godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, (who is already assured of Gods fauor, and knowes he shall haue abundant happinesse when he dies, in Heauen) how hee may support his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21323:9"/>
heart with sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, against all the miseries can assault him from the time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, till his death. For this purpose I shall breake open a Mine of Treasure: for I intend from all parts of the booke of God to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and set before thee those rich promises, which God hath there recorded, to be as Wells of comfort vpon all occasions.</p>
            <p>Two things must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity bee granted. The one is, that though wee haue gotten the assurance of Gods fauour and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the power and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21323:9"/>
guilt of our sinnes; yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things will still aile vs, and oppose our consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We shall meete with temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all sorts, reproches, aduersaries, trouble of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and such like. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that there can bee no such discouragement, difficulty, or affliction, but in the Word of God we may haue a sure consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or direction for it, able euery way abundantly to sustaine vs.</p>
            <p>But before I enter vpon the vnfolding of this great Roll of promises, I must preface about fiue things,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21323:10"/>
which tend to make vs more fit to receiue them.</p>
            <p>First, it will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to consider brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worth of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; <note place="margin">The worth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> they are called the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches of Christ,</hi> to assure vs that he is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 6. 9.</note> rich man, that hath his heart stored with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God wel applied. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3.</note> that they are <hi>great, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises,</hi> which God hath giuen to vs. Promises in our hearts, are better then pearles or precious stones in our chests. They are the inheritance God giues to his people in this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21323:10"/>
life, and therefore they are called <hi>the heyres of promise;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> a greater portion then any King on earth can giue to his childe. The very kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Records of these promises, was a great prerogatiue to the Iewish <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> nation: and it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a singular happinesse for the Gentiles, that they may now <hi>partake of those promises.</hi> Little doe wee <note place="margin">Eph 3. 6.</note> know what wrong we doe to our soules, when wee keepe them ignorant of the promises; and it is one of the greatest offices vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, to dispense these promises to man.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21323:11"/>
2. <hi>Tim. 1. 1. Titus.</hi> 1. 1. 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2</note> vpon the explication of the promises, I must <note place="margin">To whom the promises belong.</note> likewise tell you, to whom they belong, and who they are that haue interest in them: For all vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, that liue in their sins without repentance, are <hi>strangers from the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>of promise. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the bond-woman</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> 
               <hi>haue no part in the testament of Grace:</hi> onely they that are Christs, haue the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the promises in <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 22.</note> Christ. <hi>The children of God are the heyres of promise.</hi> Men must haue <hi>godlinesse,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21323:11"/>
that haue the promises ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this life, or that to come. In short, all those that haue repented them <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 8.</note> of their sinne, and belieue in Iesus Christ, may come to these promises with large hearts, as knowing that they reade and heare that which they haue clear and full interest in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning the <note place="margin">3 The vse of the promises.</note> vse these promises may be put vnto all our life long: They will driue away griefe, discouragement, or feares, that at any time may seize vpon vs: They will sweeten all our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: they will exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21323:12"/>
nurse vp, and confirme our faith, and further, they will haue a singular vse in preseruing vs against the inticements of the profits, pleasures, and lusts of the world, and against the cares of this life. Our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the feete of our soules, and with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises wee may bee daily shod; so as neyther thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares pricke vs, nor foule pleasures defile vs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. The Gospel shewes vs still a better proiect, when the Deuill or the world intice vs. And a true reason why many times wee are not able to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21323:12"/>
resist inticements, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our hearts are not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the promises, which else would shew vs so much sweetnesse, as all other things would seeme but base in comparison of them. When we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the pleasures of sinne, if wee haue not a more delightfull proiect to offer to our hearts, it is easie for vs to be seduced. And further, these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses soundly studied and laid vp in our hearts, will breed cheerefulnesse of spirit, and that contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which makes godlines <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 7. 8.</note> to be so great gaine. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21323:13"/>
besides, they will daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in vs all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to well-doing, and they doe also set out mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously the glory and splendor of Gods loue, power, presence, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and grace toward vs. What shall I say? the promises giue vs euen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon earth, and set out the incomparable gaine of true godlinesse; yea, by them we approch so neere vnto God, that as <hi>Peter</hi> saith; <hi>By them we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Diuine nature.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth thing which I would preface about, is, concerning the infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21323:13"/>
of these promises: For <note place="margin">The infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the promises pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by 13. wayes.</note> that may much enflame in vs the desire to store our hearts with them, (hauing heard of their worth,) if we likewise be fully assured concerning the certaine accomplishment of all the good which is contained in them. I suppose, no man doubts, but that if it could be made good, that a poor Christian might haue all those excellent things which are contained in all the promises of the Bible, he were in a matchlesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. Now there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which may put vs out of all doubt in that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21323:14"/>
point; marke them heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for they may do thee singular good.</p>
            <p>First, obserue that the promises are in some scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called in the singular number, the <hi>Promise:</hi> and <note place="margin">1 They are all but as one promise.</note> why so? As for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so to assure thee, it is as sure and as easie for God to fulfil al that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse contained in al those promises, as if they were but one onely promise.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Consider <hi>the Nature</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 From the nature of God.</note> 
               <hi>of God, hee cannot lye,</hi> it is impossible for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his word, he may as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily deny himselfe. If God haue said it, it must needes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21323:14"/>
come to passe. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vsed in this point, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The <hi>antiquity</hi> of these <note place="margin">3 From the antiquity of them.</note> promises much adde to our assurance. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. saith, that these promises were made <hi>before the world was:</hi> and hitherto in all this time God neuer failed of one word of his goodnes.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We haue the <hi>writing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4 Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods writing.</note> of God to shew for them, they are vpon Record in the Scripture: and shall we mistrust when we haue Gods owne hand to shew for it? <hi>His word is true, and righteous altogether, Ps.</hi> 19. 8</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21323:15"/>
5 Yea, we haue <hi>the oath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5 From Gods oath.</note> 
               <hi>of GOD too, that by two things, in which it is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for God to change, the heyres of promise might haue abundant consolation,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they make recourse vnto the promises, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 17. 18.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Wee haue these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <note place="margin">6 From the messengers sent about them.</note> 
               <hi>preached</hi> vnto vs by Ambassadors sent of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>at the commandement of God,</hi> who hath enioyned them to make it <hi>manifest,</hi> that God will bee as good as his word in all those, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Yea Christ Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">7 From the Ministery of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> did imploy his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21323:15"/>
to assure and <hi>confirme the promises made before to the Fathers,</hi> as the Apostle shewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Yet more; wee haue <note place="margin">8 From the death of the Testator.</note> 
               <hi>the bloud of Christ,</hi> and the death of the <hi>Testator,</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this new Testament, and all the promises con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 16. so as in Christ they are now all, <hi>yea and Amen:</hi> there can bee no nay nor deniall of them; they well may be now pleaded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Court of the Iustice of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The <hi>Anointing</hi> that is vpon vs, may assure vs, &amp; establish vs. Was there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21323:16"/>
euer any King anointed of God to be a King, that <note place="margin">9 From our Anointing.</note> made doubt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Why? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of God is vpon our hearts, the graces of the spirit powred out vpon vs, are our assurance, that God will not with-hold from vs our regall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, if wee seeke them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. 21.</p>
            <p n="10">10 It is some setling to <note place="margin">10 From the extent of the promises.</note> vs, to consider the extent of the right to those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: For God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted no sort of men, but in Christ they may get to haue their part in those promises, as the Apostle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21323:16"/>
shewes, <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 27. 28. 29.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The Law was the <note place="margin">11 From the time of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note> onely thing that might hinder vs of the enioying of the promises.

            <p n="12">12 We haue the seale <note place="margin">The promise sealed foure wayes.</note> of GOD to this writing: now God hath sealed four waies.</p>
            <p>First, in his <hi>Counsell:</hi> the <note place="margin">1 In his Counsell.</note> booke of his eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was written within, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21323:17"/>
without, and it had seuen seales, to signifie that it was perfectly ratified, and though none in heauen and earth could reade it, yet for our comforts wee know, that the Lambe of the tribe of Iuda, the Lord Iesus Christ our Sauiour, hath opened it now, and made it manifest, <hi>Reuel. 5. 1. 2. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 In his <hi>Sonne:</hi> for <hi>him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 In his Son</note> 
               <hi>hath God the Father sealed, Iohn.</hi> 6. 27. God made all sure when hee sent out Christ; he sealed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in all things, that concerned the happinesse both of Iewes &amp; Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:21323:17"/>
3 In his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and <note place="margin">3 In his Spirit.</note> thus all the belieuers are said to be <hi>sealed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Promise:</hi> and this is Gods priuy Seale.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God hath sealed to all his promises in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <note place="margin">4 In the Sacraments.</note> which are giuen vs as Gods broad Seales, and outward tokens and pledges to confirme our Faith.</p>
            <p n="13">13 We haue the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience also of all the saints, <note place="margin">13 For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> who in all ages found God as good as his word, and had euer reason to say as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>In the Lord will we praise his word, Psalm.</hi> 56. 10.

               <hi>Thus of the fourth point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 A fift thing I would preface about, is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certaine rules to bee <note place="margin">6 Rules to be obserued if we will profit by the Promises.</note> obserued, if we would euer receiue the sound profit of these promises, and so wee must looke to sixe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>First, when wee come to these promises, we must renounce our own merits, &amp; all opinion of our owne worthinesse, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from our hearts, that all the grace we find in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21323:18"/>
promises, is in &amp; through Iesus Christ. All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 20. Rom. 4. 14.</note> are yea and Amen through him, and onely in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When wee haue the promises laid open before vs, we must beleeue them, <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 22. Rom. 4. 16.</note> and apply them to our selues, or else they will doe vs no good.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We must be further carefull to <hi>hide them in our hearts,</hi> &amp; to commit them to memory, that wee may be often thinking of them, and musing vpon them. It will not serue the turn that wee haue them written in the Bible, or in our note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bookes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21323:19"/>
but wee must get them written in our hearts too: wee must bee at the <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 11</note> paines to acquaint our selues distinctly with them, and to fill our heads with store of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When any thing ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, we must <hi>flye to him for refuge,</hi> and cast the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of our hope</hi> vpon them, that God himselfe may see <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> that our hearts are bent to trust vpon his Word.</p>
            <p n="5">5 We must neuer <hi>cast away our confidence in them,</hi> but wait with patience, and not limit God to the time, or manner, or meanes of accomplishment, but hold

            <argument>
               <p>The diuision of the Promises.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Promises may bee diuided into three parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">3 Sorts of Promises. 1 Priuiledges</note> as shew the <hi>Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of the godly aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; and that is one chiefe way by which the Lord doth refresh the hearts of his people, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring them in generall of such &amp; such prerogatiues, which hee will confirme
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21323:20"/>
vpon them, and vpon none but them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">2. Comforts in affliction.</note> 
               <hi>comforts;</hi> that is, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which do foretell what goodnes the Lord will shew to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in affliction. For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-vnto belong all those promises which are giuen of purpose for the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and supporting of the godly in all their trialls.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third part may <note place="margin">3. Rewards of certaine graces.</note> containe such <hi>Promises,</hi> as are made to certaine <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Graces</hi> in the godly, as promises made to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, faith, trusting in God, or such like. It is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21323:21"/>
sort of promises, which I intend here more at large to intreat of. I would shew what variety of comforts there are, with which a godly man may inflame his heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the seuerall distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may fall vpon him, and these may be thus subdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>All afflictions are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward, or inward: <note place="margin">Sorts of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> For outward afflictions, it were too tedious, and to little purpose to gather comforts against euery particular crosse, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one head may suffice for the Generall, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21323:21"/>
               <hi>promises or consolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Now, because godly people are oftentimes more troubled with the stormes and reproches of the world, which are cast vpon them for well-doing, then with the ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of life; therefore I would in the second place gather the <hi>comforts against reproches,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I would adde in the third place, <hi>consolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst aduersaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for inward afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they are the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the spirit of man, and arise eyther from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21323:22"/>
temptations of Sathan, or from the trouble of the conscience vnsatisfied in diuers scruples. I would therfore in the fourth place shew how wee might bee <hi>comforted against the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sathan;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science ariseth vsually ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the burthen of our daily infirmities, or from the feare of our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away: I would in the fifth place shew how we may <hi>bee comforted against our daily infirmities;</hi> and then in the last place I would vnfold those <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that may assure vs of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21323:22"/>

            <p>THe first sort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are such as in general shew the happinesse of the godly in all estates of life; these I call <hi>priuiledges.</hi> These are such comforts as are not restrained vnto some certaine time, but are such as he is inriched with all at all times: These we ought to know as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21323:24"/>
of all the rest, and wee should striue to haue them perfectly in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, so as any time we could number them if need were.</p>
            <p>Euery godly Christian hath twelue priuiledges, <note place="margin">12 Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the godly.</note> wherein hee excels all the men of this world.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first is, <hi>the loue and fauour of God,</hi> the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">The loue of God.</note> grace of God toward him; this is the foundation of all his happinesse: and if <note place="margin">Eze. 36. 28 Ioh. 14. 21.</note> hee could order his owne heart aright, hee could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see that hee could not be miserable, so long as he was in fauor with his God.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21323:24"/>
If the fauour of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be so much accounted of; what reckoning is to be made of Gods fauour, who is Lord of Lords? yea King of all Kings, and the more should a Christian fill his heart with ioying in this prerogatiue, if hee consider three properties <note place="margin">3 Properties in Gods loue.</note> in the loue of God. For first, it is a <hi>free loue,</hi> hee <note place="margin">1. It is free.</note> stands not vpon desert: he is gracious, looking vpon his owne goodnesse, and not on ours, <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 4. Secondly, it is an <hi>eternall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. It is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> 
               <hi>loue,</hi> and vnchangeable, God will neuer bee weary of louing him, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31. 3.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21323:25"/>
His louing kindnesse is better then life; for it lasts vnto all eternity, without alteration: The fauour of man in this world is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Kings may extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loath, whom they yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while loued with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirest affection; but in God there is no shadow of changing, hee loues with an euerlasting loue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3 It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</note> it is <hi>infinitely immense,</hi> and great, no affection in any, or in all the creatures in this world, if they could be fastned vpon one man, can reach to the thousand part of Gods loue to vs, <hi>Ephes. 2. 47. Esay</hi> 49. 15. 16.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21323:25"/>
This light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance shining vpon vs, makes vs at all times more rich then they, that are encreased most in corne and wine, and oyle, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 7. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second is, the <note place="margin">The second priuiledge is the giuing of Christ to them.</note> 
               <hi>donation of Christ; Christ</hi> is his, God hath giuen him <hi>Christ, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. so as all <hi>Christ</hi> is his proper porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and how is <hi>Christ</hi> his? euen in all dearenesse of relation. He is his <hi>Prince,</hi> his <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> his <hi>Lord,</hi> his <hi>Master,</hi> his <hi>Friend,</hi> his <hi>Brother, &amp;c.</hi> All these titles are giuen to <hi>Christ,</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21323:26"/>
he is all that, which those things could shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out. No father, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, friend, could so loue their childe, brother, or friend, as <hi>Christ</hi> loues the <hi>Christian.</hi> No Lord, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Prince, can so prefer, prouide, or care for their seruants or subiects, as <hi>Christ</hi> cares for the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Look what the fauor or power of any of those, or al those could doe, Christ is, &amp; wil become much more vnto the godly Christian.</p>

our owne particulars, that wee had obtained pardon and remission of all our sinnes.</p>
            <p>The fift priuiledge is, the <hi>inhabitation of the Holie</hi>

               <hi>Ghost.</hi> The soule and body of a Christian, is the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the Spirit of God doth verily and truly dwell within the brest of a Christian, and that not in a naked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; but the holy Ghost is there, to <hi>teach him to guide him into all truth,</hi> to <hi>tell him</hi> when hee is ready to goe out of the way, <hi>on the right hand,</hi> or on <hi>the left,</hi> and to <hi>comfort him</hi> in

all distresses, and to <hi>seale</hi> the promises to his heart, and to <hi>anoint</hi> him with the oyle of true knowledge and grace, and to bee as a pledge and <hi>earnest</hi> of his inheritance looked for from heauen, and to <hi>teach him to pray, when he knowes not how to pray for himselfe;</hi> and many other excellent benefits hee reapeth from this spirit of God, <hi>whom the world cannot receiue.</hi> Hee hath for this respect a very <hi>spring</hi> of knowledge, and ioy and grace in his belly.</p>

            <p>The ninth priuiledge is, <note place="margin">The ninth is the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Angels.</note>

whatsoeuer in the whole earth is good for him, shal not bee with-held from him, <hi>Math. 3. 7. Psal.</hi> 84. 12. Outward prosperity hee is sure of, so farre as it is good for him, <hi>Iob 8. 7. Psalme</hi> 37. 5.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>HItherto of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges. Now it followeth, that I should open those conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that may support the hearts of men against al the distresses of this life. And first I would shew, how the Lord is pleased to comfort his seruants in seueral Scriptures, against all the outward afflictions
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21323:32"/>
may befall his seruants in this world.</p>
            <p>By outward afflictions I meane such as these; <note place="margin">What meant by outward afflictions.</note> wants, losses, wrongs, troubles, exile, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, sicknesse, feares, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, or any other thing, wherewith the life of man is molested in any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now there are many <note place="margin">The godly man may comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against afflictions, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, 1 Of the commonnes of them.</note> excellent waies of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant comforts against these, or any of these, as</p>
            <p n="1">1 First, if we consider but the commonnesse of them, <hi>all things fall alike</hi> in these things, <hi>Eccles. 9. 2, 3. Euery man that is born of a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21323:32"/>
woman, hath but few daies, and is full of trouble, Iob</hi> 14. 1. Christ hath no Disciple but he is told aforehand, <hi>He must take up his Crosse, and that daily, Luk.</hi> 9. 24. There can bee no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or may accompany the nature of man, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. The same afflictions are accomplished vpon our brethren which are through the world, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. And <hi>we haue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> &amp; greatest worthies of the Lord, <hi>for an example of suffering, Iam. 5. 10. And all the godly must through many tribulations enter into
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21323:33"/>
the Kingdome of God, Acts</hi> 14. 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">Of Gods knowledge of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses and desires.</note> that God takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of vs, and of all our trialls: <hi>The Lord knowes the way of the righteous, Psalm.</hi> 1. 6. None of our griefes are hid from him, <hi>All our desires are before him, and our groning is not hid from him, Psalm.</hi> 38. 9. and hee <hi>knowes our soules in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Psal.</hi> 31. 7. And as hee takes notice of al our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, so he takes notice of all that is good in vs: <hi>Hee knowes them that</hi> are pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and <hi>trust in him, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">

3 Thirdly, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Of Gods compassion.</note> the wonderfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of God in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his people: hee doth <hi>not willingly afflict,</hi> but regards vs with pitty, and with loue thinkes of redeeming vs, and sends <hi>the Angell of his presence to</hi> comfort and <hi>saue vs,</hi> and <hi>in all our afflictions is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> with vs, <hi>Isay</hi> 63. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">Of Gods high estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vs.</note> the high estimation that God holds of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, notwithstanding their afflictions. Crosses may make men loue vs the lesse, but they doe not a iot discommend vs before
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21323:34"/>
God. He can take notice of his seruants in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, as well as if they did shine in the greatest outward splendor in the world. This is the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that God speakes to vs (euen when he corrects) as to his children; and for that reason wee <hi>should not refuse his chastning, Hebr. 12. 6. Prou.</hi> 3. 11. We may <hi>be honourable in Gods sight,</hi> though wee bee in a most forlorne and despised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the world: Wee may, I say, be precious in Gods sight, and greatly beloued, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 4. 56. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> shewes, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21323:34"/>
a poore seruant, when hee suffers hard words, and ill vsage from his froward Master, doth herein finde acceptation with GOD, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 19. 20. Now this is an instance beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: For, what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more vile, then of a seruant? and what crosses were likely to be disregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God sooner, then these domesticall indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? and yet wee see a proofe of the regard and loue of God euen in those things.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, if we consider <note place="margin">Of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Christ.</note> the victory of Christ ouer the world: Our Sauiour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21323:35"/>
vseth this as a consolation; he tels his Disciples, <hi>In the world they shall haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but</hi> he wold haue them <hi>be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, he hath ouer come the world,</hi> so as now they shall neuer be hurt by their trobles. Their crosses may be too hard for them to master, but Christ can order them so, as in him they shall haue victory ouer them. But of this more afterwards, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 33.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixtly, If wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Of the holy Ghost com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting vs.</note> the presence of the holy Ghost, he is giuen of Christ and the Father to bee our <hi>Comforter,</hi> and <hi>as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21323:35"/>
our afflictions abound, so shall our consolations also, Ioh. 14. 16. 2. Cor.</hi> 1. 4. Now, how shall a man be dismaied, that hath Gods spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, to harten him, and assist him, and refresh him, and make glad his heart?</p>
            <p n="7">7 Seuenthly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">Of the issue out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> the issue out of all troubles; <hi>Many may be the troubles of the righteous, but God will deliuer them out of all, Psal.</hi> 34. 19. If GOD make vs sore, he will make whole: if he <hi>wound,</hi> he will <hi>binde vs vp</hi> againe: <hi>In sixe troubles he shal deliuer them, and in seuen there shall no euil touch them, Iob</hi> 5. 18. 19.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21323:36"/>
               <hi>God will giue his people rest from the daies of aduersity, till the pit be digged for the wicked,</hi> Psal. 94. 13. <hi>Light is sowne for the righteous, &amp; gladnesse for the vpright in heart, Psal.</hi> 97. 11. It is well said, It is <hi>sown;</hi> For though God do not presently giue vs ease and comfort, yet the Haruest will come, if with patience wee rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and be truely sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and keepe his way: God will <hi>settle his people, as in the former dayes,</hi> and it may bee, doe better vnto them, then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 11. For <hi>Gods thoughts towards his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21323:36"/>
people, are thoughts of peace, and not of euill, to giue an expected end, Ierem.</hi> 29. 11. so as <hi>Gods seruants shal sing for ioy of heart, when wicked men howle for vexation of spirit, Esay</hi> 65. 14.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Eightly, If wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the wonderfull care <note place="margin">Of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our afflictions.</note> of God about the measure of our crosses: <hi>For God will not lay vpon man more then right, that hee should enter into iudgement with God, Iob</hi> 34. 23. Therefore <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> should not feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God will not make a full and final end of him, as he will of the Nations, <hi>but will correct him in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

not leauing him wholly vnpunished, Ieremy.</hi> 46. 28. God doth <hi>waite to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> to his people; hee is <hi>a God of iudgement,</hi> and doth not consider what sin they haue committed to deserue affliction, but what strength they haue to beare it: <hi>After hee hath giuen them the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and the water of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, he will not restraine his mercies from them, Isay</hi> 31. 18, 20.

For reproches; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, there is neede of <note place="margin">Men need comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches.</note> consolations, more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against them, because naturally men stumble at it, when they see Religion censured and scorned, and it hardens many men, when their hearts are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with this preiudice, that they <hi>heare this way euery where ilspoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of.</hi> Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men are dismaid at the disgrace of sincerity in the generall.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21323:41"/>
heare or see what others suffer. And it is manifest, that the best men haue bin put to a great plunge when they haue beene la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with reproches. This makes <hi>Ieremy</hi> so vnquiet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 18, 21. Now there <note place="margin">Thou maist comfort thy selfe in the consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> are many wayes, by which a Christian may establish his owne heart against all the scornes and reproches of the men of this world.</p>
            <p n="1">1 First, if they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God takes notice of all the wrongs of that <note place="margin">Of the notice God takes of them.</note> kinde done vnto them. Thus <hi>Dauid, O Lord, thou hast known my reproch, and my shame, and my dishonor,

mine aduersities are all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, Psal.</hi> 69. 19. It ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his heart, but to talke with GOD, and tell him, that he knowes his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

you are but trauelers here, why turne you againe at the barking of euery dog? yea, these reproches signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that wicked men doe see some glory of God shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in you, which they striue by all meanes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie &amp; despise, being vext in their hearts at it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 God will certainely <note place="margin">Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those men that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch thee.</note> take an order with all that reproch his people.

               <hi>Sol.</hi> Thou knowest not how GOD dealeth with them, God can iudge them secretly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them insensibly, so as the world shall take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, as the <hi>moth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp the garment,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any great rent, <hi>Isay</hi> 51. 8. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21323:51"/>
they are exhorted in that place, not to feare the reproch. Secondly, what knowest thou what God will yet doe with them? For God hath pleaded the cause of his seruants many times, by bringing strange iudgements vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. This <hi>Pashur</hi> shall bee made <hi>Magor-missabib,</hi> that is, a <hi>terrour round about,</hi> &amp; all that heare it, shall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20. 3.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21323:51"/>
much bitternesse, as if I were guilty, and there is none to comfort or pitty mee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> So was <hi>Iob</hi> deeply censured by his godly friends: and so was <hi>Paul</hi> of his owne hearers, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 10. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> was forsaken in his wrongs, so as none would comfort him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 20.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Ob.</hi> But yet one thing much troubles me, that is, that since these slanders, the hand of God hath bin vpon mee in diuers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iudgements, and this makes people to thinke, sure I am guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21323:52"/>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> So they thought of <hi>Paul</hi> when the Viper fell on his hand, being a man that was before accused, and now sent as it were a prisoner, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. so they iudged of <hi>Dauid</hi> when hee was sicke, that <hi>some euill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease did cleaue to him, Psal.</hi> 41. 8. Yea, this was our Lord Iesus Christs case; <hi>For they iudged him as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and smitten of GOD, Esay</hi> 53. 4.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Ob.</hi> But the things obiected against mee are so foule, that when I heare those things spoken of publikely, or priuately, I blush, &amp; that may cause me
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21323:52"/>
to be thought to be guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solu.</hi> This was <hi>Dauids</hi> case being innocent; hee saith, <hi>Shame couered his face when he bore reproch,</hi> Psal. 69. 7. <hi>and his confusion was continually before him; and the shame of his face couered him, for the voyce of him that reprocheth and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by reason of the enemy,</hi> Psal. 44. 14. 16.</p>

               <p>Shewing how the godly may comfort themselues against their aduersaries.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HItherto of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations against reproches: Now it followeth, that I should shew how a Christian may comfort himselfe against his aduersaries, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him in his course of <note place="margin">Hee may comfort himself from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 1 Of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the godly.</note> godlines, and so there are many arguments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his condition
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21323:55"/>
as it is common to all the godly: For this may stay a mans hart to know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that <hi>euery man that will liue godly,</hi> shal be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and <hi>must suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second may bee taken from the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</note> of God herein: and this stands of two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. First, that God from all eternity hath decreed euery mans sufferings this way. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> lesseneth the thought of the crosse, by pleading that <hi>God had appointed them thereunto,</hi> meaning by his eternall decree, 1. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 33. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21323:55"/>
that GOD hath likewise appointed the end, and measure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance out of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the Church is comforted, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 10. If it were grieuous to them to know that the Deuill should raise vp wicked men, that should cast them into prison, yet this may refresh them, that GOD hath set the time when they shall come forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. It shall bee but for ten daies: It shall neyther bee so long as the Deuill and wicked men would haueit, for then they must neuer come out; nor so
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21323:56"/>
little a while, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wold haue it; for then they would neuer comein, or stay but awhile: but God will rule by determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time for their good.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third may be taken from the refuge wee may <note place="margin">Of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in God.</note> haue in God: wee may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make our recourse to God in all our wrongs, who hath promised to be <hi>our refuge, euen our refuge in due time, Psal.</hi> 9. 9. If God will receiue vs, and heare our moanes, &amp; vndertake our protection, it should be no great thing for vs to indure the oppositions of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21323:56"/>
vnreasonable men.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth may bee taken from the prediction <note place="margin">Of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Christ.</note> of Christ: wee haue beene told before plainely what we should expect. Wee may haue peace in Christ, but hee hath fore-told it, that <hi>in the world wee shall haue trouble, Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. yea, that wee must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide <hi>to take vp our crosse daily, Luke</hi> 9. 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fift may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note> from the deliuerance GOD hath promised vs; for thus he assures vs, <hi>The hand of the Lord shall bee known towards his seruants, and his indignation towards
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21323:57"/>
their</hi> &amp; <hi>his enemies,</hi> Isay 66 14. for that God that will be <hi>the strength of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in their trouble,</hi> will be <hi>their saluation out of their troubles:</hi> he will help them and deliuer them, <hi>hee will deliuer them from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; saue them because they trust in him,</hi> Psalme 37. 39, 40. <hi>This glory of the Lord shall bee knowne and feared from the East to the West,</hi> that if <hi>the enemy come like a floud, the Spirit of the Lord shall chase him away,</hi> Isay 59 19. <hi>Therfore feare not thou, O worm Iacob, for thus saith the Lord, I am thy GOD, I will sustaine thee with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21323:57"/>
right hand of my Iustice: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all they that prouoke thee shall be ashamed, they shall be as nothing: the men of thy strife shall perish,</hi> Isay. 41. 10 11. For the Lord knoweth <hi>how to deliuer the godly out of temptation, and to reserue the vniust to the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be punished, 2. Peter 2. 9. GOD will deliuer the poore when he crieth, the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die also, and him that hath no helper,</hi> Psal. 72. 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The sixt may be taken <note place="margin">Of Gods iudgement vpon our aduersaries.</note> from the certaine iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God that shall fall vpon their aduersaries: <hi>The men of thy strife shall perish, and they that warre
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21323:58"/>
against thee, shall bee as a thing of nought: They shall seeke them &amp; not find them, Isa. 41. 11. 12. All these cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses will the Lord lay vpon their enemies, and vpon them that hate them &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them,</hi> Deut. 30. 7. <hi>All those euill neighbours that touch the Inheritance of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, God will plucke them out of their land, and plucke his people from among them,</hi> Ier. 12. 14. <hi>The wicked draw their swords, and bend their bowes against the godly; but their sword shall enter into their owne heart, and their bowe shall be broken; for the armes of the wicked shall bee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21323:58"/>
broken, and the Lord will vphold the iust, Psal.</hi> 37. 14. 15. 17. And besides, for their full paiment, they are reserued vnto the day of Iudgement to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The seuenth may be <note place="margin">Of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and consequents.</note> taken from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of this oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For first, hereby wee giue our testimony to Christ and the Gospell, when we <hi>partake of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Gospel, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 8. Secondly, these oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions doe as much good for the present, when Gods seruants fall into
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21323:59"/>
these troubles, the fruite will be, it will <hi>trie them, and purge them, and make them white, till their time be come, for there is a time appointed, Dan.</hi> 11. 35. 36. Thirdly, God may turne the hearts of the wicked, and make them of <hi>Lyons and Tygers,</hi> to become <hi>Lambes, and no more to do hurt in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lord,</hi> Isay 11. <hi>The Wolfe and the Lambe may come to feede together, and the Lion eate straw like the Bullocke,</hi> Isay. 65. 25.</p>
            <p>Lastly, wee shall gaine <note place="margin">Of our owne gaine by them.</note> exceedingly by these suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for wee are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if wee suffer with

Christ, we shall reign with him in another World, 2. <hi>Timo.</hi> 2. 11. 12.

            <p>HItherto of outward afflictions, and the comforts against them. The inward afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions follow, and heere in the first place come tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be considered of, euen those conflicts which men haue in their soules with euill Angels.</p>
            <p>Three things must bee <note place="margin">3. Things taken for granted.</note> granted concerning temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:21323:60"/>
1 First, that the doctrine of temptations is obscure, because the disease lies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the soule, and is such as the vnregenerate world hath little care of, or iudgement in.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, that when God leaues his children to be tried by this afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; softens their harts to feele this combat with Deuils, it doth wonderfully amaze and disquiet them, and therefore this is a point needfull to be handled.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that there is sure remedy in the word of God, euen for this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:21323:61"/>
Now, because this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of temptations is somwhat obscure, I would, before I entreat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts against them, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 How many waies Sathan tempts men.</item>
               <item>2 To what things hee tempts.</item>
               <item>3 What are vsually the occasions hee takes of tempting.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the first, Sathan <note place="margin">Sathan tempts vs fiue waies.</note> tempts vs diuers waies.</p>
            <p n="1">1 One is, when hee <hi>tempts God against vs,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to bring God out of liking with vs. Thus he insinuated the dispraises
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21323:61"/>
of <hi>Iob</hi> to God, <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 1. and 2. And thus Sathan <hi>stood at the right hand of</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua <hi>the high Priest, to resist him before the Angell of the Couenant,</hi> Zachar. 3. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another way is, when he appears in some shape, and by voyce, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies terrifies men.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When he brings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses vpon mens bodies, or other heauy calamities, and thus also hee tempted <hi>Iob</hi> by GODS permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When he stirs vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to tempt vs: thus hee stirred vp <hi>Peter</hi> to tempt Christ, and disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21323:62"/>
him from his suffring, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. And thus hee tempted the Woman by meanes of the Serpent: and thus also hee imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wicked men, daily to tempt by euill counsell &amp; inticements.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The last and most v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall way is by iniecting, exciting, or suggesting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill internally within our spirit. This is that kind of temptation I heere especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meane.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the second, that wee may finde out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of temptations, and the things whereabout Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than workes, we may refer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21323:62"/>
all the temptations to three sorts. <note place="margin">3. Sorts of temptations by suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first sort of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are <hi>temptations to blasphemy:</hi> and thus hee tempts when hee suggests monstrous things against God, or the word of God, or the prouidence of God, or the like.</p>
            <p>The second sort are, <note place="margin">2. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sinnes.</note> 
               <hi>temptations to particular sinnes,</hi> as when he tempts to the deniall of Christ, as hee did <hi>Peter,</hi> and so hee tempts to lusts of all sorts. And so the Deuill is the <hi>father of lust, Iohn</hi> 8. 44. and euill Angels are <hi>spirituall wickednes, Ephes.</hi> 6. 13. and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21323:63"/>
thus also he tempts to rage or reuenge; and therefore the Apostle implies in his speech about anger, that to giue place to wrath, is to giue place to the Deuill, who vsually excites those violent passions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26. And thus also hee tempts to couetousnes, in respect of which sinne, the Deuill is said to <hi>enter into Iudas:</hi> And thus also hee tempts to lying, as in the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Acts</hi> 5. and so he tempts men to murther, either of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or of others.</p>
            <p>The third kind of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">3. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</note> is, <hi>the temptation to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21323:63"/>
despaire,</hi> which is, when he perswades with men to despaire of all mercy in God. Thus he made <hi>Iudas</hi> despaire: and into some degree of despaire for the time was <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe entred, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.
<q>Thus of the sorts of temptations.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Now it is wonderfull <note place="margin">9. Occasions of templati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> necessary in the third place to take notice of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of temptations. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than vsually tempts not, but vpon some aduantage giuen him, &amp; so there are many things, which as it were, <hi>tempt the Deuill to tempt men,</hi> as</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:21323:64"/>
First, <hi>solitarinesse:</hi> the Diuell watched to finde <note place="margin">Solitarines.</note> the woman alone from her husband, and then set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. Such persons as loue solitarinesse, loue not their owne soules; for they giue great aduantage to Sathan to assault them and circumuent them, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should take heede of it.</p>
            <p>The second occasion is <hi>security,</hi> when the Deuill <note place="margin">Security.</note> spies that men be carelesse, and keepe no watch ouer their owne hearts, and are rechlesse in their courses, and goe from day to day, and feare not euill, then he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21323:64"/>
lies in wait to assault, by iniecting some vile or base temptation to sinne.</p>
            <p>The third occasion is <hi>Pride;</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Pride.</note> lifted vp with the consideration of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, then doth Sathan take his aduantage, and set vpon him with his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, euen some vile temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: when we take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make our selues great in our owne eies, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the pleasing thoughts of high opinion, and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, if God doe not greatly guard vs, wee are neere some desperate as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of Sathan.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:21323:65"/>
The fourth occasion is <hi>anger.</hi> The Deuill seldome <note place="margin">Anger.</note> forbeares to enter into the heart of the wrathfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when anger hath set open the doore, as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before out of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
            <p>The fift occasion is <hi>dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with euill thoughts,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5. Dalliance with euill thoughts.</note> when the Deuill sees vs play with contemplatiue wickednesse, and be well content to let our thoghts runne vpon sinful proiects or imaginations of sinnes, which perhaps wee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not euer to commit.

            <p>THe consolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temptations follow.</p>
            <p>A Christian, that feeles himselfe assaulted by the Deuill, may raise vp in his thoughts diuers contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, able to succour <note place="margin">He may comfort him selfe from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly.</note> him in his distresses: as</p>
            <p n="1">1 First, if hee consider that this is the case of all the godly, to be tempted: It is no new thing which

hath befallen him. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> comforts the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, No temptation hath befallen you, but what accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the nature of man, 1. Cor.</hi> 10. 13. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> hartens them to whom he writes, by this argument: <hi>The same afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are accomplished vpon your brethren that are in the world, 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 9. This also the Apostle to the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans affirmes, that those <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickednesses are found euen in the most heauenly places on earth, Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. The Apostles themselues were not free from this combat, &amp; therefore <hi>Paul</hi>

saith, <hi>Wee wrestle with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Cor. 10. 13. 2. Cor.</hi> 12. 9.

            <p>Secondly, Christ hath <note place="margin">2 His victory ouer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</note> atchieued an admirable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer these principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, and hath triumphed ouer them, and made a shew of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is in <note place="margin">3 His sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie.</note> Christ a sympathy and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling. He is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our infirmities, and doth much compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate our case, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he hath made intercession, and <hi>praied for</hi>

               <hi>vs, that our faith might not faile.</hi> For that which hee assured to <hi>Peter,</hi> hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth

               <hi>He will tread down Sathan,</hi> Rom. 16. 20. <hi>He will stablish vs, after wee haue suffered a while,</hi> 1.

            <p n="6">6 If he consider the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of temptation, it is <note place="margin">Of the effects.</note> the schoole of Christ to traine vs vp in spirituall souldierly, they cannot hurt vs, they make vs more humble, 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 8. 9.

            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But it seemes, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are a grieuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, because we are taught to pray against them in a speciall manner in the Lords praier, which shews that my estate is miserable, in that I am ledde into temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, that wee <note place="margin">How wee may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> must pray against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; that it is a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet no other, then sicknesse, pouerty, or the like: and therefore we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21323:71"/>
are not to pray against them simply, but with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Gods will; only we must pray absolutely to be deliuered from the euill of temptation, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words doe restraine or correct the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But when I am tempted, how may I know that I am not ouercome of the temptation?</p>

If thou abhorthem as soon as they come in, and giue no manner of consent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, thou art free. For Christ himselfe was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21323:71"/>
by euill cogitations cast into his minde: (for <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Apostle saith) <hi>He was tempted in like manner as wee are,</hi> and yet he was not guilty of the euill of the temptation. It is true, that for the most part wee are infected in some degree or other by it: but yet it is not impossible for man to bee free from the euill of temptation, as that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shewes.</p>
            <p>But secondly, thou maist <note place="margin">Two signes.</note> know whether thou be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome or no, by two signes. For first, if thou feele the temptation to be an affliction to thee, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21323:72"/>
account it an euil day, and art burthened vnder it, as if it were a very buffeting of thy body, thou art yet safe: The Deuill hath no victory, thou art not ledde captiue, all this while <hi>Paul</hi> was worse feared then hurt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. 8. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, all the while thou resistest by prayer, &amp; wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlest, with it, and keepest thy spirituall weapons in thy hands, thou art the conqueror, for thou art as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of God. <hi>If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, the Deuill will flye from thee</hi> in due time. Thou art neuer ouercome, till the temptation please thee, &amp;

thou resoluest to make no resistance spiritually, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what if I bee ouercome? am I not in a desperate condition, if the temptation haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ouer me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Thy case is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but not desperate: for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the temptation, and though it cost them many teares, yet they were recouered.

1 For the first, there are many waies, by which a Christian may fence his heart against the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements that arise from the sence of daily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

The vine is not the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of Trees, and yet is more fruitfull in pleasing fruit, then many other trees, not of the field only, but of the garden also.

            <p>
               <hi>Solu.</hi> There are many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts against ignorance.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is a speciall promise <note place="margin">8.

            <p n="2">2 God hath promised to <hi>leade thee by a way which

thou hast not knowne:</hi> Hee will preserue thee by his knowledge, though thou be vnacquainted with the way thy selfe. He that led his people from Babel to Sion, when they scarce knew a foote of that long way, will lead thee in the streight way from earth to heauen, if thou seeke a way of GOD as they did, <hi>Isay</hi> 42. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Wee haue such an <hi>High Priest, as knowes how to haue compassion on the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</hi> Hee that required that property of the High Priest in the Law, will much more expresse it

            <p n="4">4 This must bee thy glory, and the crowne of reioycing, that though thou be ignorant of many things, yet thou <hi>knowest God, and Christ</hi> crucified, and <hi>this is eternall life, Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The Ministers of the Gospell are ours, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we attend vpon the Word, and continue in it, wee shall know the truth: their instructions shall bee daily distilled into thy heart like drops of raine, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. 23.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Solu.</hi> It is true; <hi>Where vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion faileth, the people faint,</hi> but yet:</p>
            <p n="1">1 After God <hi>hath giuen you the bread of affliction, &amp; the water of aduersity, hee will restore teachers, and no more restraine instructions,</hi> Esay 30. 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Though thou see no way of helpe, yet thou knowest not how God can prouide; <hi>He can open Riuers on the tops of mountaines,</hi> and he maketh the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a standing poole, when his people thirst and

            <p>Now that there may be the more aboundant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto our harts in this case of infirmities. I will open two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that doe meete with the most obiections of our hearts.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. <note place="margin">The full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the words in Exod. 34. 6. 7.</note> 6. 7. where the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth the goodnesse of

his nature, that all men may take notice of it, and giue him the praise of his rich grace, where hee so describeth the Lord, that in his titles hee giueth an answere to many obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Ob.</hi> If thou say thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities may alienate the Lord from thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solu.</hi> He answers, that hee is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> alwaies the same, vnchangeable. Hee will not alter his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, but loue thee to the end, &amp; for the more assurance, hee repeated that title twice, because he knowes, we most doubt of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21323:88"/>
that, and haue most neede to be succoured with that Argument, as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our comfort.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ob.</hi> If thou say thou hast strong inclinations to sinne, or strange tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or many aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and discouragements?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solu.</hi> He answers, he is <hi>God,</hi> or strong; to signifie that nothing shall hinder the worke of his grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee, but hee will keepe thee by his power, and make his grace suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ob.</hi> If thou say hee is of pure eyes, and cannot
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21323:89"/>
but discerne thy faults, and sinne is sinne in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> He answers, that he is <hi>mercifull.</hi>

               <p>Shewing how a godly man may comfort himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the feare of falling away.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HItherto of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts against our daily infirmities. The consolations against the feare of our falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way follow.</p>
            <p>Wee may three waies comfort our selues against this feare, namely, if wee consider God, or Christ, or our selues.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In God there are two things of excellent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, both of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21323:96"/>
in the Scriptures. The first is, that hee hath vndertaken to preserue vs from falling away. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond shewes vs distinctly, how he will performe this.</p>
            <p>For the first, that GOD will keepe vs from falling away, we haue four things to assure vs.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>the promises of God</hi> directly to that end: for he assures vs, that <hi>his Elect shall enioy the worke of their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Four things may assure vs that God will keep vs from falling away.</note> 
               <hi>hands, and shall not labour in vaine,</hi> Esay 65. 22. 23. <hi>The smoking weeke shall not be quenched, nor the bruised</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 His promises</note> 
               <hi>reed broken.</hi> Esay 42. <hi>Not one of them shall bee lacking</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:21323:96"/>
in the whole flocke, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>God will build them, and not plucke them downe, hee will plant them, and not pull them vp.</hi> Ierem. 24. 6. <hi>He will confirme vs,</hi> in and to the end, <hi>that we may bee blamelesse in the Day of our Lord Iesus Christ: for God is faithfull, who hath called vs to the fellowship of his Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 8. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 His decree.</note> 
               <hi>of GOD,</hi> concerning which the Apostle saith, <hi>That the foundation of God remaineth sure: he knoweth who are his.</hi> Though <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet none that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21323:97"/>
the name of the Lord, and depart from iniquity, can neuer bee lost, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the attributes of God: and so there bee <note place="margin">3. Three attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in God viz.</note> three things in God may wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully settle vs against this feare. The one is, <hi>his faithfulnesse.</hi> The other is <note place="margin">His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note> 
               <hi>his power.</hi> The third is his <hi>immutable loue:</hi> All three are laid to pawne for the performance of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, &amp; so pleaded in Scripture. For his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the Apostle therethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce concludes, that the godly shall bee confirmed to the end, as was alleadged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21323:97"/>
1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and so hee reasoneth, writing to the Thessalonians: <hi>The Lord is faithfull, who shall stablish you, and keepe you from euill,</hi> 2. Thess. 3. 3. And of the power of God these places speake, <hi>Wee are kept</hi> 
               <note place="margin">His power.</note> 
               <hi>by the power of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 5. <hi>I know</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) whom I haue beleeued, and I am perswaded that hee is able to keepe that which I haue committed to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that day,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 12 <hi>Now vnto him that is able to keep you from falling</hi> (saith <hi>Iude) and to preserue you faultlesse before the presence of his glory, with exceeding
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21323:98"/>
ioy. To the onely wise God our Sauiour, be glory, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, Dominion and Power, now and euer,</hi> Iude 24. And <note place="margin">His loue.</note> for the loue of God, that it is vnchangeable, there is apparant proofe. <hi>Whom he loueth, hee loueth to the end,</hi> Iohn 13. 1. so as wee may bee confident in this, that <hi>hee which hath begun a good worke in vs, will performe it till the day of Christ,</hi> Philip. 1. 6.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wee haue the <note place="margin">4 His seale.</note> seale of God for it, and he hath giuen vs earnest, that wee shall certainely enioy the inheritance purchased for vs. And thus euery
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21323:98"/>
one that beleeueth, is <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> which also is <hi>our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, Ephes.</hi> 1. 14. 15. and therefore we shall bee sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
            <p>Now for the second; If any aske how GOD will do this?</p>
            <p>I answer, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shewes how this will be performed thus: For</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>God will not cast off his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What God will doe to keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling away</note> 
               <hi>people,</hi> he will neuer forsake his inheritance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 14. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>For the Lord loueth iudgement, and for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the Saints, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are preserued for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> Psalm. 37. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:21323:99"/>
2 <hi>God will put his feare into their hearts, that they shall not depart from him:</hi> For this is his Couenant with his people, that <hi>Hee will not turne away from them to doe them good, and hee will put his feare into them, that they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him,</hi> Ierem. 32. 40, 41.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To make all the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, hee <hi>will put his Spirit into them, which shall leade them into all truth, and cause them to keep his statutes, and to doe them,</hi> Ioh. 14. Ezech. 36.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He will vphold them, and order their wayes, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21323:99"/>
keepe their feet, that they fall not. <hi>The steps of the good man are ordered by the Lord, &amp; hee delighteth in his way: Though he fall, hee shall not vtterly bee cast downe: for the Lord vpholdeth him with his hand,</hi> Psal. 37. 23. 24. <hi>Hee holdeth our soule in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moued,</hi> Psal. 66. 9. <hi>Hee will keepe the feete of his Saints,</hi> 1. Sam. 2. 9.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, GOD will worke their workes for them, &amp; continually assist them with his presence, and blessings, <hi>Esay</hi> 26. <hi>Eze.</hi> 36. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. And thus of the comforts that we may
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21323:100"/>
gather from God.</p>
            <p>Now secondly, in Christ there are three things may minister much establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Three things in Christ may comfort vs.</note> in our hearts against this feare.</p>
            <p n="1">1 His Intercession: he <note place="margin">1 His inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</note> hath specially praied for vs, that God would <hi>keepe vs from euill, Iohn</hi> 17. and therefore is <hi>able to saue vs to the vttermost, because hee euer loueth to make Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for vs,</hi> Hebr. 7. 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The consideration of <note place="margin">2 His office herein.</note> his office heerein. It is his worke to be <hi>Omega</hi> as well as <hi>Alpha,</hi> to be the <hi>finisher</hi> of our faith, as well as the <hi>author</hi> of it: He is the end
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21323:100"/>
as well as the <hi>beginning, Reu. 21. 6. Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The power of Christ, <note place="margin">3 His power.</note> 
               <hi>None can take vs out of his hand, Ioh.</hi> 10. &amp; as was said before, <hi>hee is able to saue vs to the vttermost,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.
<q>Thus of the consideration of Christ also.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now thirdly, in our selues wee may looke vpon three <note place="margin">3. Things in our selues may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs.</note> things, as wee are in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of grace.</p>
            <p>For first, we <hi>are borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to a liuely hope of an immortall inheritance reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for vs in Heauen:</hi> Our new birth intitles vs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and it is kept for vs, and our <hi>hope is liuely,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:21323:101"/>
Secondly, our seed abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vs: It cannot bee blotted out. Hee that is borne of God, sinneth not, because his seede remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in him, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, eternall life is begun in vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. Now if it bee life eternall, how can it end? How can we fall away from it? Naturall life may end, but Spiritual life can neuer end.</p>

               <p>Promises that concerne Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HItherto of promises that concerne affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as my purpose was but to fence the godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> setled in his iustification, against the grieuances which might befall him in respect of afflictions, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage heere: I shall end with the discourse of those promises, sauing that I will giue a taste of the last sort
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:21323:102"/>
of promises, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are encouragements to holy graces or duties.</p>
            <p>I will not instance in the promises made to the loue of God, to meekenesse, to such as seeke God, to the loue of the Word, and the like: But onely I will open the promises made to the prayers of the godly, and the rather, because Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are most troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their prayers.</p>
            <p>The promises that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <note place="margin">Those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to three heads.</note> prayer, may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to three heads; For eyther they are such as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs that God will heare the praiers of his seruants,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21323:102"/>
or they shew vs, what in prayer hee will heare: or else they describe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodnesse of God in the manner how he will heare. For the first, that the Lord will certainely heare prayer, these places of Scripture do most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably assure vs.</p>
            <p>Esay 58. 9. <hi>Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answere: thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.</hi>

shall ye aske me nothing: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily I say vnto you, whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my name, hee will giue it you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 For the second, it may much comfort vs, if we consider that God will not onely heare our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in generall, but our voyce, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 3.

            <p n="3">3 But in the third point appeares the wonder of his compassion: For</p>
