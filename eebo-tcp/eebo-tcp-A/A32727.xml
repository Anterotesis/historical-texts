            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Exerciſe of <hi>Arms;</hi> ſo is it of
great <hi>Utility,</hi> and <hi>Convenience,</hi> that
they likewiſe addict themſelves to
<hi>Commerce,</hi> by which means the
Benefits of the whole World are brought Home to-their
own doores: Beſide that by this Employment
alone, are acquired the Two Things which Wiſe men
accompt of all Others, the moſt Neceſſary to the well-being
of a Common-Wealth: That is to ſay; a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Induſtry</hi> of Minde, and Hardyneſſe of <hi>Body,</hi> which
never fayle to be accompanyed with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Plenty.</hi>
So that Queſtionleſſe, where <hi>Commerce</hi> does not flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
as well as other Profeſſions, and where Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons out of a Habit of Lazyneſſe, neglect at once
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54004:5"/>
the Nobleſt way of Employing their times, and the
faireſt occaſions of Advancing their Fortunes, That
Kingdome though otherwiſe never ſo Glorious wants
ſomething of being Compleatly happy. But in truth,
it is with <hi>Commerce,</hi> as with the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> that
Man or State, that would improve either of them, muſt
be at <hi>Quiet; Peace</hi> being the ſame thing to a <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of <hi>Minde</hi> is to each <hi>Individual.</hi>
What can be more Importune, or Unſeaſonable, then
in the middle of a <hi>Warr</hi> either Foreign, or Inteſtine,
when every Mans Duty calls upon him to defend his
Country; for People to be Undertaking of long Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Tranſporting themſelves into Remote Parts,
their Principal Obligation and Buſineſſe lying at
Home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſuch a Caſe as This, He that <hi>abſents</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from his Country, is in Conſtruction a <hi>Deſertor</hi> of
it, and turns That, which at another time, were an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and Laudable deſire of Benefit, into a Criminal
Avarice. The Broyles and Troubles of <hi>France</hi> for
theſe <hi>Hundred</hi> Years and upwards, are ſo well known,
that to tell the Story, were but needleſſely to revive
the Memory of thoſe Misfortunes, which we muſt
ſtrive to forget. It ſhall ſuffice therefore to Note, that
the State of <hi>France,</hi> having ſcaped ſo many Tempeſts,
and Rocks, was yet once again emplunged in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Warr at the Beginning of the Laſt Kings Reign,
upon the Point of Religion, which Affaire being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
determined, and the People Reduced to their
Obedience, without any Violence, either to their
Liberties, or Conſciences; there ſucceeded an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to Engage in a Conteſt with Strangers, which
proved to be One of the longeſt Warrs, that has been
known in <hi>France</hi> ſince the Foundation of This <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54004:5"/>
And though the Juſtice of the Cauſe: the Valour
of the Prince and the Wiſdome of his Councel, have
never fayled of being attended with Victory; Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that theſe Advantages have not been obteyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Infinite Care and Labour throughout the
whole Body of the State. So that it is no wonder,
if the <hi>French</hi> having ſo much to doe at <hi>Home,</hi> look'd
but little <hi>Abroad;</hi> Eſpecially, into the Buſineſſe of
<hi>Navigation,</hi> and <hi>Traffique,</hi> wherein our Neighbours
in the <hi>Interim</hi> have beſtowed ſo much ſtudy, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
and from whence they have likewiſe reaped ſo
much Reputation, and Profit. Some Private Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
indeed have been ſet a foot, and without that
Succeſſe, which the Undertakers promiſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
But this will not appear Strange at all, if we
conſider, that the greater Part of the Adventurers,
having other Affaires wherein they were more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Concerned, during our Troubles, did neither vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
perſue what they had begun, nor indeed ſo much
as take the Peyns, to keep the Frame of their Deſigne
in Order. But <hi>now</hi> that it has pleaſed God to give
<hi>France</hi> the Peace it has ſo long deſired, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Peace under the Government of a Prince,
whoſe wiſe Conduct and Steady Application to Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
are at once the Wonder, and the Jealouſie of all
<hi>Europe: Now</hi> I ſay, for our Country-men not to put
themſelves forward toward the Recovery of a Right
which they can never looſe, and toward the gaining to
themſelves, of thoſe ineſtimable Benefits, which their
Neighbours receive, by the Settlement of a glorious
<hi>Commerce,</hi> were to adminiſter juſt reaſon of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54004:6"/>
Now of all <hi>Commerces</hi> whatſoever throughout the
whole World, That of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> is One of the
moſt Rich and Conſiderable. From <hi>Thence</hi> it is (the
Sun being kinder to them, then to us) that we have our
Merchandize of greateſt Value, and that which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
the moſt, not onely to the Pleaſure of Life;
but alſo to Glory, and Magnificence. From <hi>Thence</hi> it
is, that we fetch our Gold, and Precious Stones, and
a Thouſand other Commodities, (both of a General
Eſteem, and a Certain Return) to which we are ſo
accuſtomed, that it is impoſſible for us to be without
them, as <hi>Silk, Cinamome, Pepper, Ginger Nutmegs, Cotton
Clothes, O<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">

Ivory, Frankinſence, Bezoar,</hi> &amp;c. So that having an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Neceſſity upon us, to make uſe of all theſe things,
why we ſhould not rather furniſh <hi>Our Selves,</hi> then
take them from <hi>Others,</hi> and apply that Profit hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to our own <hi>Country-men,</hi> which we have hitherto
allowed to <hi>Strangers,</hi> I cannot underſtand. Why
ſhould the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the
<hi>Danes</hi> Trade dayly to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> poſſeſſing there,
their <hi>Magazins,</hi> and their <hi>Forts;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> neither
the <hi>One,</hi> nor the <hi>Other?</hi> What does it ſignifie to us, that
we have ſo many good <hi>Ports,</hi> and <hi>Veſſels,</hi> ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<hi>Sea-men,</hi> ſo many brave <hi>Souldiers?</hi> To what
end is it in fine, that we Pride our ſelves to be Subjects
of the Prime <hi>Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe:</hi> If being ſo, we
dare not ſo much as ſhew our Heads in thoſe Places
where our Neighbours have Eſtabliſhed themſelves
with Power? Were it not in a manner better for us
to be without theſe Advantages then not to uſe them;
and to reſt where we are, for want of <hi>Ability</hi> to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then for want of <hi>Reſolution?</hi> Would it not be a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54004:6"/>
Shame to us, to make a difficulty of Attempting That
in a State of Security, which other People have carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on through all doubts, and Hazzards? And to ſtick at
the bare Croſſing of thoſe Seas, which Others ventured
upon, even before they were known? Is it, that we
lack either <hi>Induſtry,</hi> to make uſe of their <hi>Inventions,</hi>
or <hi>Courage,</hi> to follow their <hi>Example?</hi> Would we have
any thing more eaſie, then to reap the fruits of Others
Mens Travailes: or any ſtronger Aſſurance of a good
Event, then the Wealth, and Glory, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
that have tryed the Experiment.</p>
            <p>True it is, that there is a certain Glory, which is ſo

The <hi>Portuguez</hi> will be for ever Famous for their
Diſcoveries in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and even their Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
think it no diſhonour, to be thought the firſt
Projectors of That Enterprize. They ſay, that in the
Year 1420. <hi>Henry</hi> Duke <hi>de Viſeo,</hi> Son of King <hi>John</hi> the
Firſt, being eminently skill'd in the Mathematiques,
took up a ſtrong perſwaſion, that there muſt be of
neceſſity more <hi>Iſlands</hi> in That Ocean, then were yet
known, and ſo ſent out Certain Veſſels upon the
Search, which diſcovered the Iſle of <hi>Madera:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, Others ſayling along the Coaſt of <hi>Affrica,</hi>
made New Diſcoveries. Thus Deſigne, that had been
ſo luckily ſet afoot, was however Interrupted by the
Wars, during the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the Succeſſor of
<hi>John</hi> the Firſt, and of <hi>Alphonſus:</hi> but <hi>John</hi> the Second,
who ſucceeded <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> (in perſuance of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
Beginnings,) ſent out One <hi>Bartholomew Diaz</hi> in
1487. to skirt the whole Coaſt of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and He
it was, that Firſt doubled the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good-Hope;</hi> to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54004:7"/>
which at firſt he gave the Name of <hi>Cabo Tormentoſo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Storms, which are frequent thereabouts.
And this Name perchance would have continued, if
the King himſelf had not thought fit to Change it for
One of a better Omen, (the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good-Hope,)</hi> which
was grounded upon the Hope he had, that this new
Progreſſe would open a way to the Conqueſt of the
<hi>Oriental Indies,</hi> an Acquiſition, which he thirſted for,
with exceeding Paſſion. Yet before he would venture
his Shipping into ſo vaſt a Sea, diverſe Perſons were
ſent by Land to the <hi>Indies,</hi> to enform themſelves from
the beſt Pilots of the Country, in order to the Voyage;
But King <hi>John</hi> Dying upon the Preparative, left the
Conſummation of this great Work to his Succeſſour
<hi>Emanuel,</hi> who having ſufficiently Inſtructed himſelf,
as to the carrying of it forward, diſpatched away Four
Veſſels from <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1497. under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Vaſco de Gama,</hi> who in <hi>May</hi> following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
before <hi>Calicut</hi> having doubled the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi>
notwithſtanding the Storms he met with; and
the violent Importunities of his People, preſſing him
to return. After Two Years Abſence, he brought the
Newes himſelf of his Proſperous Voyage, and laid
the Foundation of greater Hopes to Come. In the
Year following, the King ſent thither again 14. Ships,
under the Charge of <hi>Pedro Alvarez,</hi> and after that,
diverſes other Fleets to ſecure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fortifie themſelves
in a Place, where they found ſo vaſt a Treaſure;
and thus it came to paſſe, that when the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
ſeized upon all the New Lands, upon the Weſt, the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> did the ſame in the Eaſt, and This was it,
that gave Occaſion to the Famous <hi>Partition</hi> made by
Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, who drawing an Imaginary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54004:7"/>
Line, from one Pole to the Other, (to paſs at a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Leagues from the <hi>Aſores)</hi> Adjudged to the
King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> all that which was on the Weſt-ſide of
the Line; not meddling with any of thoſe Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had upon the
Eaſt, which ſince the <hi>Voyage</hi> of <hi>Vaſco de Gama</hi> have
been Infinitely encreaſed. Thus did the Conſtant
Reſolution of theſe Princes ſurmount all Difficulties;
bringing both Glory to themſelves, and Happineſſe
to their Subjects. Thus did theſe new <hi>Argonauts</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
themſelves to the Conqueſt of the Reall Golden
Fleece: for in ſine, the <hi>Portuguez</hi> are Indebted to this
Navigation for almoſt all they are worth. This it is,
that has made them Famous in the World, and raiſed
them into an Eminent Reputation, although One not
onely of the Smalleſt, but of the leaſt Fruitfull King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is this Traffique, (which they
have now been ſole Maſters of a Hundred Years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire)
that has put them in Condition to carry ſo high
the Undertakings which we have ſeen in our dayes,
and they would finde it a very hard Matter to Cope,
even with the Enemy at their Gates, if it were not,
that the inexhauſtible Source of their <hi>Indian</hi> Treaſure,
and Trade from time to time ſupplyes them, for the
Expence of ſo long, and ſo dangerous a Warr.</p>
            <p>What has it been, but this very Navigation, and
Traffique, that has enabled the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to bear up
againſt the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> with Forces ſo unequall;
Nay and to become terrible to them, and to bring
them down at laſt to an Advantageous Peace? Since
that time it is, that this People, who had not onely the
<hi>Spanyards, Abroad;</hi> but the very Sea, and Earth at
<hi>Home</hi> to ſtruggle with, have in a deſpite of all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
made themſelves ſo Conſiderable, that they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54004:8"/>
begin now to diſpute Power, and Plenty, with the
greateſt part of their Neighbours. This Obſervation
is no more then Truth, their <hi>East-India</hi> Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known to be the Principall ſupport of their State,
and the moſt ſenſible cauſe of their Greatneſſe. In
the mean while, who would have Imagined that the
Union of a few Particular Merchants, that but in
1595. bethought themſelves of the very Project, and
did not Form this Grand Company till Six or Seaven
Years after, ſhould ever have raiſed them to that point
of Opulence, where they now ſtand? It is known, that
<hi>Communibus annis,</hi> there has been yearly 30, or 35. <hi>per
Cent.</hi> clear Gain to the Sharers; and it is an Eaſie
mater likewiſe, to make a near Calculation of their
Occaſional Expences, and yet all This deducted, when
they came to make a General Computation of the
Eſtate of the Company in the Year 1661. Reckoning
what they might have in ready <hi>Caſh,</hi> in <hi>Merchandize,</hi>
the value of their Shipping, Cannon, and what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
belongs, the Eſtimate upon the whole, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a Summe ſo Prodigious, that it almoſt exceeds
all poſſibility of Credit: Not accompting all this while,
that this Company poſſeſſes more Land in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
then the <hi>States of Holland</hi> have in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi>
and This is it, that Maintains for them Fourteen, or
Fifteen Thouſand Souldiers, to make good what
they have got, beſide Sea-men, and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which they employ up and down to the number of
near Fourſcore Thouſand Perſons, all ſubſiſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
So vaſt an encreaſe of Wealth from ſo ſmall
a Beginning would paſſe abſolutely for Fabulous, if
we did not both See, and know, that at this day the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> are the beſt monyed People of <hi>Europe;</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54004:8"/>
that in Their Country, an Inheritance is worth more,
then in any Other part of the World: An <hi>Eſtate</hi> in
<hi>Fee</hi> commonly Selling there at 60. Years Purchaſe,
and <hi>Lands</hi> in <hi>Soccage,</hi> at 50; Whereas Money goes
but at Three <hi>per Cent.</hi> (ſo much is it Cheaper then
other Goods:) And this does not proceed, I hope from
the Emprovement of their drayned <hi>Marſhes</hi> into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage;
nor from the Culture of their other Grounds
(which are certainly none of the Beſt) but barely from
their <hi>Traffique,</hi> and chiefly from That of the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> did the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> likewiſe adviſe upon the ſame deſigne, and
Formed a Company at <hi>London,</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.
This <hi>Company</hi> Set out Four Ships in the Year 1600,
which ſucceeded ſo well, that in a ſhort ſpace of time,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made Twenty Voyages thither. This <hi>new
Society</hi> was powerfully Protected, and Encouraged, by
his Majeſty of <hi>England;</hi> who in 1608. ſent Sir. <hi>William
Hawkins</hi> in the Quality of Embaſſadour to the great
<hi>Mogol</hi> (to demand a free Trade) in deſpite of all the
Obſtacles, which both the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> and the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
endeavored then to caſt in the way. In 1615. His
Majeſty ſent Sir <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> and after Him other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to the Kings of <hi>Iapan</hi> upon the ſame Errand,
who wrought ſo well upon the Humour of thoſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi>
that they not onely obteyned their deſires;
but gained ſo far upon the Affections of the People,
that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves, in order to their better
Welcome, would often pretend to be <hi>Engliſh-men.</hi> This
<hi>Company</hi> prevailed alſo with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for
great <hi>Privileges</hi> in his <hi>Territories,</hi> in Conſequence
of the Service they did him againſt the <hi>Portuguez</hi> about
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54004:9"/>
the Siege of <hi>Ormus.</hi> But it had been well, if they had
found him as juſt in the Execution, as he was Eaſie
in the Promiſe. However; be it as it will, This <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
has made it ſelf very Conſiderable in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and has at preſent diverſe Mony Tables there
under Two Principall <hi>Directors,</hi> or <hi>Preſidents;</hi> the
One of which has his Reſidence at <hi>Surat,</hi> and the Other
at <hi>Bantam,</hi> by whoſe Authority the Trade of thoſe
Parts is Menaged. Thus has the Induſtry, and Valour
of theſe People Eſtabliſht, and Mainteyned their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
againſt all Oppoſition, and though their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
have done their utmoſt to Cruſh their Deſigne,
and brought the difference even to an open and Bloody
Warr, they have gayned nothing but ſhame by the
Conteſt, without ever being able to hinder their
Courſe, and Progreſs, which indeed they had no
Colour at all to Endeavour to obſtruct.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> it's truth, Menage not ſo great a <hi>Trade,</hi>
in the <hi>Indies</hi> as the Reſt; neither are their Fleets there
ſo Numerous; but ſome Concernment they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the Voyage, and their Agents upon the Place;
and from time to time they ſend out Shipping thither.
Their Buſineſſe lies commonly in the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Bengala,</hi>
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and in certain <hi>Iſles</hi> of the
<hi>South,</hi> where they have rendred themſelves Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Famous <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Suede</hi>
thought himſelf obliged, as upon a point of Honour,
and Greatneſs, that His Subjects alſo ſhould Viſit the
<hi>Oriental-Indies,</hi> and other Parts of the World; and in
the very Inſtant, that this Prince (whoſe minde was
ſet upon <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Glory)</hi> was diſpoſing of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to enter <hi>Germany,</hi> and Contriving the Ruine of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54004:9"/>
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he had likewiſe in his <hi>Projects</hi> the
Forming of a <hi>Suediſh Company,</hi> for this great <hi>Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
Inviting his People to Intereſt themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as by his <hi>Letters-Patents,</hi> dated at <hi>Stockholme</hi> the 14th.
of <hi>June,</hi> 1626. is made to appear; but the Warr of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and the Death of this <hi>Great Prince</hi> coming
on ſoon after, would not permit him to ſee the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of this Deſign, which ſince that time has
been again renewed.</p>
            <p>All this Conſidered, what would the <hi>French</hi> Nation
have to ſay for themſelves, if they ſhould now let ſlip
the Opportunity of an Enterprize, that has rewarded
all that have ever Embarqued in it, with Reputation,
and Profit? If we have neglected it hitherto, it may
ſerve for an Excuſe, that we have not been hitherto in
Condition to attend it, by reaſon of our Conſtant
Troubles. But now that we are in a State of Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and Peace, what ſhall acquit us to Poſterity, it we
deferr it any Longer? It would be very ill done indeed
to envy our Neighbours the Fruits of their Honeſt, and
I awfull Induſtry; but it would not be well on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, to decline the ſame Means of Enriching our
ſelves, if it were but for the Conſervation of our
<hi>Common-Good,</hi> the Benefits of <hi>Commerce</hi> ſerving as a
Recompence of <hi>Their</hi> Labour, and Travail, while the
greater Part of <hi>Our</hi> People lye Lazing at Home, as of
no Uſe, and without Employment.</p>
            <p>But Men are not eaſily perſuaded to Engage upon
new Adventures, they are afraid, that things will not
prove to their mindes, and every man is unwilling to
make the firſt ſtep. Theſe thoughts doubtles might well
enough have become the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> that had a vaſt Sea
before them, and were to paſſe into another <hi>Climate,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54004:10"/>
and under other Stars, without any knowledge of the
Courſe they were to ſteer. This Apprehenſion might
have been pardoned alſo in the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
lay in a Country, where their Mortall Enemies
were Maſters, and where they were in mere danger
from the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> then either from <hi>Storms,</hi> or the
<hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves. But now that the former of
theſe has led the way to this Fortunate Land, and the
Latter has diſabuſed us, as to any fear of erill from
thoſe that were there before us, we muſt be willfully
blinde, not to agree upon an Advantage ſo Certain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Accompt, and ſo eaſy to obteyn. For whether
<hi>France</hi> be more Potent, or not, then any other Nation,
that Trades to the <hi>Indies</hi> is not the Queſtion; neither
can it be diſputed, whether the <hi>French</hi> have not as
good Commodity for this <hi>Traffique</hi> as any other People,
if it be conſidered, that we are poſſeſſed already beyond
the <hi>Cape of Good-Hope,</hi> of the Iſland of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> or
<hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> the Largeſt Iſland of all That Sea, being
no leſs then <hi>Seven Hundred Leagues</hi> in <hi>Compaſs,</hi> and in
the moſt agreeable <hi>Climate</hi> of all <hi>India.</hi> The Aire is
ſo Temperate, that the ſame Clothes which we wear
here in the <hi>Spring,</hi> may ſerve there the whole year
through; and Experience tells us, that the <hi>Heats</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> are more troubleſome; then thoſe of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
The <hi>Soyle</hi> is proper for all ſorts of <hi>Grain,</hi> and
<hi>Trees,</hi> and askes nothing but dreſſing to be Admirable.
There is no need of carrying Proviſions thither, as to
other Iſlands, for the ſupport of the <hi>Colonyes;</hi> for the
Abundance of every thing being ſo great, that the
Country produces enough for it Self, and to Spare.
The <hi>Waters</hi> are Excellent, the <hi>Fruits</hi> delicious, and
without <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> the Place may be Improved into a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54004:10"/>
               <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Over and above This, there are <hi>Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mines</hi>
in ſuch Plenty, that in great falls of Rain, and
Ravages of Water, the <hi>Veins</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
all along the Coaſt, and upon the Mountains.
The Inhabitants are of a Diſpoſition tractable enough,
and with good Uſage ready, and willing to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in any ſervice; being a People Humble, and
Obedient, and of a Humour farr differing from Thoſe
of the Country, and of the Iſlands further up in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> who will not upon any Terms Subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Labour: Whereas Theſe on the Contrary,
both love it themſelves, and take pleaſure to ſee the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> Work. The Country is ſhared among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
petty Kings, who are ſtill making War One up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other, and from whoſe diſagreements we
might eaſily take a Riſe to an Abſolute Eſtabliſhment
of our ſelves among them. Beyond this Place the
Trading lyes open without difficulty into <hi>India, China,
Japan,</hi> and more Commodiouſly yet to the Coaſts of
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Territories</hi> of the <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Abiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins;</hi>
(where <hi>Commerce</hi> is ſcarce underſtood) to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fola;</hi>
where are the Richeſt <hi>Gold-Mines</hi> upon the Face
of the Earth, to <hi>Quama Melinda,</hi> to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and
throughout the <hi>Perſian Gulph.</hi> In a word, there is
not any where a fitter Place for a General <hi>Magazin</hi> of
all Commodities, to be brought from thoſe Parts into
<hi>Europe,</hi> then is This Iſland. But this Convenience
ſhould not yet hinder us from Planting alſo in other
Places, where it may be expedient for the Good of our
Affairs; and ſuch a Place we have in our Eye, where
no Perſon as yet Inhabits, which we have now in our
Power to Seize upon, and where the greateſt <hi>Commerce</hi>
might be Eſtabliſhed, that has been yet known in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54004:11"/>
World. (Where this Place is ſhall be declared in fit
ſeaſon) So that it is our Part now, not to let ſo many
favourable Concurrences ſlip through our fingers, and
to looſe the Benefit of ſo faire an Occaſion. We are
apt to admire the good Fortune of Our Neighbours,
and it deſerves it. But 'tis not enough barely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
unleſſe we alſo Emulate it; Eſpecially, having
ſo many Encouragements to promiſe our ſelves a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
at leaſt Equal, if not Superiour to any, that have
gone before us. Beſides there is a great part of the
World, that remains ſtill unknow, Vaſt <hi>Regions,</hi>
that are not yet diſcovered: So that although Others
have had the good Fortune to have preceded us, we
may yet have the Honour to carry the Buſineſſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they have done. But as it ſeems neceſſary
for the bringing of this great deſign to Effect that
we ſhould follow the Example of other People, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a <hi>Company</hi> among our ſelves for the <hi>Navigation</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and that we muſt needs do the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
this Right to acknowledg, that their <hi>Society</hi> is
both the Richeſt and the beſt Read in the Myſtery of
that <hi>Commerce</hi> of all; that have ever Medled with it.
It will not be amiſſe to look into the Conſtitution of
that Company, and the manner of their Proceedings,
that any Man may the better Judge, Whether we
have any Reaſon or no, to doubt of doing as much, as
they have done before us.</p>
            <p>THe Warr betwixt <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> having Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
one Part of the <hi>Hollanders Commerce,</hi> without
which they would have had much adoe to ſubſiſt.
Certain Merchants of <hi>Zealand</hi> Aſſociated among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54004:11"/>
in the Year 1592. To go and trade in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and particularly in ſuch places, where the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> had nothing to do: but to avoid the Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being too near the Line, they reſolved to
ſearch a Paſſage toward the <hi>North,</hi> and ſo to Coaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Tartary,</hi> and <hi>Cathay,</hi> and from thence to fall into
<hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Voyage not ſucceeding
to their wiſh, they joyned themſelves afterwards with
ſome Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and All together E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipp'd
a ſmall Fleet of Four Veſſells, which they
ſent forth to <hi>India</hi> by the Ordinary way, under the
Command of one <hi>Cornelius Aoutman,</hi> who having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
long at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> had learned from the <hi>Portuguez</hi> the
Secret of this <hi>Navigation.</hi> In 1595. they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and at the End of Two Years, and Four Months
Returned, without making any Profit of their Voyage.
This little diſappointment did not hinder them from
forming at the ſame time a <hi>Second Company,</hi> in the
ſame Town of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and theſe Two <hi>Companies</hi>
being United, ſet forth a Fleet of <hi>Eight</hi> Ships, that
went out in 1598. while a Third Company in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were making Ready for the ſame deſigne. In the
Year 1599. Certain Other Merchants of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
(the moſt part of them <hi>Brabanders)</hi> framed yet
Another <hi>Company</hi> apart from all the Reſt, which ſent

<hi>Company</hi> ſet out Two more, which Joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>Six</hi> other of the Firſt <hi>Company,</hi> and theſe

<hi>Companies,</hi> not waiting for their Return Equipp'd
<hi>Thirteen</hi> Veſſells (the Firſt Company <hi>Nine,</hi> and the

1601. putting the Profits of the Firſt Voyage, into
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54004:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a <hi>Stock</hi> for a ſecond <hi>Equipage.</hi> There were at that

that were Modelling of <hi>Companies</hi> ſeparate from the
Reſt (which Encreaſing in this manner gave greatly
to fear, that one would ſpoyle the Other;) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>States</hi> foreſeeing what diſorder this Diviſion

there to draw them all into one <hi>Company,</hi> in
which Propoſition the Parties Concerned did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce,
and ſo there was Conſtituted one <hi>Generall
Company</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt-Indian Navigation,</hi> with a Grant,

By this Grant, it was left free for all Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

and they are now Soliciting to renew their Privilege
again for a further Term.</p>
            <p>The firſt Sum of <hi>Six Millions,</hi> and <hi>Six Hundred
Thouſand Livres</hi> was Employed upon the Equipping of
a Fleet of <hi>Fourteen</hi> Sayle, that ſet out in <hi>February,</hi>
1603. and after that, of Another of <hi>Thirteen</hi> that
Departed in the <hi>December</hi> following. Till then,
the Perſons Intereſſed, made no Benefit at all of their
Adventure, for being divided into ſo many Private
<hi>Companies,</hi> they were faine to lay out all their Gaines
upon a Stronger <hi>Equipage.</hi> But upon the Return of
theſe <hi>Two</hi> Fleets, the Profit was ſo great, that in 1605.
the <hi>Company</hi> got <hi>Fifteen,</hi> for a <hi>Hundred;</hi> and in 1606. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
five,</hi> for a <hi>Hundred.</hi> So that in this ſhort time, they
wanted but <hi>Ten</hi> in the <hi>Hundred</hi> of Reimburſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
their <hi>Original Summe.</hi> In this Interim, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
did not ſlacken at all in their Preparations, and
Proviſions. They Treated with the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, built
<hi>Fortreſſes,</hi> and every where enlarged their <hi>Conqueſts,</hi>
which vaſt expences notwithſtanding, it appeared in
<hi>May</hi> 1613. that every man was Reimburſed his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi>
and had over and above, a <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>ſixty,
Profit.</hi> As for example; He that in 1602. put <hi>Foure
Thouſand Tranks</hi> into the <hi>Stock</hi> of the <hi>Company,</hi> had
Received in 1613. <hi>Ten thouſand</hi> and <hi>Four hundred</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and yet his Original good in the <hi>Common-ſtock.</hi>
And this <hi>Gain</hi> has been ſo much Augmented ſince that
time, that there are few Years, wherein they get leſſe,
then 30. <hi>per Cent.</hi> In 1661. They gained 40. In 1662.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54004:13"/>
there was no diſtribution at all, by reaſon of <hi>Four</hi> ſhips
loſt, which they have never heard of ſince; beſide the
extraordinary Charge they were at for the Seige of
<hi>Cochin;</hi> but in 1663. they had 30. again <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Company</hi> at every <hi>Ten</hi> Yeares End makes a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Inventory</hi> of the whole Buſineſs, and by That,
which was made in 1661. it was found to be in
Poſſeſſion of the Immenſe Wealth above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Company</hi> has not only Enriched <hi>Particulars;</hi> but
the Advantages, which the Body of the <hi>Re-Publique</hi>
draws continually from it, are almoſt ineſtimable.
In the Firſt Place, all Commodities, that are brought
from the <hi>Indies</hi> into the <hi>States</hi> Ports, pay at Leaſt <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> and before they come into <hi>France,</hi>
are unladen in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they pay all their Rights
of IN and OUT (before they come to us) ariſing to
<hi>Six per Cent.</hi> and <hi>One per Cent.</hi> more for the Duties of
<hi>Convoy,</hi> which <hi>Seaven per Cent.</hi> go clear to the <hi>Re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
beſide <hi>Two</hi> in the <hi>Hundred</hi> more for <hi>Factorage;</hi>
and the Charge of <hi>Merchandizes:</hi> So that upon this
Reckoning, we pay <hi>Twelve per Cent.</hi> more for <hi>Indian</hi>
Commodities, then they would Coſt us, if we fetched
them our Selves. Whence it followes, that our <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociants,</hi>
making the ſame Profit of theſe Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
which the <hi>Holland Company</hi> does, might be able
to furniſh us at <hi>Twelve</hi> in the <hi>Hundred</hi> better Cheap,
then Others; becauſe we ſhould ſave the Duties, that
are now paid in <hi>Holland;</hi> (an Expence that every Year
draws Vaſt Summs out of <hi>France,</hi> where are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
at leaſt a <hi>Third</hi> Part of what the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
bring out of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54004:13"/>
A Second Advantage, which the <hi>States</hi> draw from
this <hi>Company,</hi> is, that upon Every Renewing of their
Grant, it makes them a Conſiderable <hi>Preſent.</hi> The
Laſt (as we have ſaid already) amounting to no leſſe
then <hi>Sixteen Hundred Thouſand Livres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third Place, it maintaines at leaſt <hi>Fourſcore
Thouſand</hi> Men, the Greater Part whereof would
otherwiſe be a Burthen to the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Laſt, and the moſt Important Conſideration
is, that this Company, in weakning the <hi>Commerce</hi> of
the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who were a long time under the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his <hi>Catholique</hi> Majeſty, did alſo weaken the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy (their great Enemy) and by that
Means made their way to a Peace.</p>
            <p>They Equipp every year for this Voyage <hi>Twelve</hi>
fair Ships; from <hi>Eight hundred,</hi> to <hi>Fourteen hundred
Tun,</hi> which depart at ſeveral Seaſons; and every year
preciſely at the End of <hi>June,</hi> there Return as many,
or thereabouts. The <hi>Company,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> uſually
in the Month of <hi>May</hi> ſend out their Men of Warr to
meet them, Partly as a <hi>Convoy,</hi> and to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Enemies, and partly to relieve them with
Freſh Men, and other Neceſſaries, as they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Principal Place, which this <hi>Company</hi> has in
the <hi>Indies</hi> is Called <hi>Batavia,</hi> a Town, that they have
built (in the Iſland of <hi>Java Major,</hi> not far from <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
they have there their <hi>Magazins,</hi> and Stores of all
the Commodities; which they bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> from
the ſeveral Countries of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of <hi>Japan,</hi> of <hi>China,</hi>
and of Other Kingdomes. They have alſo <hi>Colombo</hi> in
the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which they have lately taken from
the <hi>Portuguez</hi> (This Iſland furniſhes the whole World
with <hi>Cinamome.)</hi> In Fine, they poſſeſſe diverſe other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54004:14"/>
Places, even from the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of <hi>China,</hi> and they have Reckoned a good while
ſince, <hi>Seaven</hi> and <hi>Thirty Magazins,</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<hi>Forts,</hi> which they had in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Greater Advantage and Liberty of their
<hi>Commerce,</hi> they have their <hi>Agents</hi> about all the Kings of
thoſe Quarters, as the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi>
the Kings of <hi>China, Japan, Cochinchine,</hi> and diverſe
Others. See now to what degree of Greatneſſe this
<hi>Company</hi> is Arrived: a <hi>Society</hi> of Particular Merchants,
Low enough at Firſt, both in Fortune, and every way
Elſe; but now Advanced, not only beyond their
Hopes, but their very Pretences.</p>
            <p>But there is not any thing which a <hi>Company,</hi> of this
Condition, by <hi>Union, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> may not
accompliſh. This Truth being ſo clear, and the ſame
Advantages now offered us, ſhall we not make uſe of
them? Or ſhall we rather acknowledge to the World,
that we want <hi>Unitie, Addreſſe,</hi> or <hi>Courage?</hi> The <hi>Laſt</hi>
is a Reproach, which our very Enemies will never
faſten upon us,; Nor with any Colour of Reaſon will
it be pretended, that we want <hi>Addreſſe.</hi> For (to ſpeak
in this Place only of <hi>Navigation)</hi> It is certain, that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Seamen cannot be deſired then ours are, and the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> know That well enough, who make uſe of
the <hi>French</hi> more then of any other Nation, and finde
themſelves better Served with <hi>Them,</hi> then with their
<hi>Own.</hi> As to the Point of <hi>Union</hi> (not to diſſemble the
Matter) without doubt, we are there too blame, and
'tis a fault of our Nation, which Certainly deſerves
our greateſt Care to Redreſſe. To ſay the Truth,
What a Shame is it, that the <hi>French;</hi> the People of all
the World the moſt accompliſh'd, a Nation with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54004:14"/>
whom <hi>Valour, Magnificence, Good Nature, Civilitie,
Learning,</hi> the <hi>Liberal Arts</hi> ſeem in a Manner, to have
choſen their Abode. That <hi>Theſe</hi> People, I ſay, ſhould
be ſo hardly brought to endure One Another; that
their <hi>Societies</hi> ſhould be ſo unconſtant, their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo difficult; that the moſt hopefull Affairs in the
World ſhould periſh even in their Hands, by I know
not what Fatality of this <hi>Lightneſſe;</hi> without which
diſcord among themſelves, it were almoſt impoſſible
to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Hollanders</hi> began their Company, how
many were there even of an Ordinary Condition,
that ſold themſelves to their very Houſhold-Stuffe for
the furniſhing of a <hi>Stock</hi> to begin withall; becauſe of
the Honour, and Benefit which they foreſaw, would
accrue to their Country. And ſhall the <hi>French</hi> having
ſo many other Excellent Qualities faile at Laſt in ſo
Material a Point, as to be wanting in their Zeale, and
duty to the Glory, and Well-being of the <hi>Publique.</hi> I
dare promiſe my ſelf This will never be; and ſince we
are now in an Age of <hi>wonders,</hi> that muſt give Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to all our Evills, and Renew our whole Frame:
Let us not leave the leaſt Mark of that Antient Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh;
but by a Conſtant kindneſſe among our Selves,
and a true and dutifull Love of our Country give the
World to know, that our Great, and Incomparable
Prince has Influenced his People, and Inſpired them
with a Virtue, which they never had before.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we doe then? will ſome ſay? Our
Buſineſſe in the firſt Place, muſt be (as is already ſaid)
to Compoſe a Society of diverſe Perſons, that will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
Contribute to the Execution of our deſign;
which Society ſhall carry the Name of THE
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54004:15"/>
FRENCH COMPANY for the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERCE
of the EAST—INDIES.</p>
            <p>Our next Work muſt be to Equip a Fleet, and to
go directly, and make a <hi>Deſcent</hi> upon our Iſand of
<hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> which we may do without any Reſiſtance,
and begin there with a Conſiderable Eſtabliſhment,
which from time to time ſhall be ſupported, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ſtrong <hi>Colonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt then reſolve to carry thither, onely men
of Honeſty and Courage, not Criminals redeemed
from the Gibbet, or the Galleys, nor Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for Debauchery or Lewdneſſe. Part of theſe
People ſhall be Employed in Tilling the Ground,
(which will be a matter of exceeding Benefit) while
the Reſt ſhall be making themſelves Maſters of the
Principall Poſts of the Country, and ſecuring of Ports,
whereof there are diverſe in This Iſland, capable of
Two or Three Hundred Veſſels, to Ride without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Thus much for the <hi>Praeliminaries</hi> of our great
Commerce.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that this Propoſition will not
pleaſe all People, and ſome will tell you perhaps, that
the <hi>French</hi> have been at <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> already; and
<hi>What did they there?</hi> They will tell you too, that
Monſieur <hi>Flacourt</hi> (who was the Director of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that was then made,) has ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
the Vanity of This Project; in a Relation that
he has publiſhed upon This Subject. Well! But are
we now to learn, that a Buſineſſe, that has Miſcarried
at One time, may ſucceed at Another? How many
great Enterprizes, do we finde in Story, that have
Required ſeveral Tryalls to bring them to Perfection.
The firſt <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that Planted in the <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54004:15"/>
were all ſlain; and yet this diſaſter did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Undertakers from ſending more. The
<hi>Engliſh Colonies</hi> in <hi>Virginia</hi> have been Four or Five
times deſtroyed; and yet This has not made them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the Country. To come once again to the
Example of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> The Firſt ſtep, they ſet
toward their <hi>Indian</hi> Adventure (endeavouring to find
out a new Paſſage) was moſt unfortunate to them.
The Second time; tis true, they got thither; but they
made Nothing of their Voyage. Did they give it over
for That? No, by no means. They returned a Third,
a Fourth time, and at laſt gathered with Intereſt
the Fruits of their Perſeverance. But This is not all
neither; for the World muſt know, that there is a
large difference, betwixt the Buſineſs of <hi>Monſieur
Flacourt,</hi> and <hi>That</hi> which is <hi>Now</hi> in Queſtion. A
Large Difference, betwixt a <hi>Company</hi> Compoſed of a
Small Number of <hi>Private Perſons,</hi> and that wanted
<hi>Stock</hi> for the Accompliſhment of ſo great a deſigne,
and the <hi>Company,</hi> which is <hi>Now</hi> in Propoſal to be Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For after all; we are not without hope, that the
<hi>King</hi> himſelf, (who has ſo great an Affection, and
Tenderneſs for his People) Conſidering the Notable
Benefits, which this Enterprize will bring to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
will <hi>Himſelf</hi> I ſay, lend his Royall Support,
and rather then fayle, even Enter into a <hi>Participation</hi>
in the Deſigne: So that the Conſequence betwixt
<hi>Monſieur Flacourts</hi> Affaire; and <hi>This</hi> at preſent, holds
no Proportion. And This muſt be acknowledged too;
that (the Miſfortune Notwithſtanding, into which he
was caſt, by the Fault of the <hi>Company)</hi> he has been
ever known to ſay; Nay, and Publiquely to <hi>Declare,</hi>
and <hi>Print</hi> at the End of his Relation before Mentioned,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54004:16"/>
that a Conſiderable Settlement in <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> (which
muſt be Vigorouſly begun, and Wathchfully perſued,)
would bering an Advantage to the State of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Imagination: Conſidering the Goodneſſe, and
Fertility of the <hi>Country,</hi> the Gentle, and Induſtrious
diſpoſition of the <hi>People,</hi> and the Commodious <hi>Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>Iſland</hi> for the Entertainment of <hi>Commerce.</hi>
And This which we deliver is Supported by the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Teſtimony of ſo many Nations, newly come
from Thence; as <hi>Flemmins French, Hollanders, Engliſh;</hi>
that to diſpute the Point, were to offer violence to
Truth it ſelf. <hi>Monſieur Flacourt</hi> did not ſo much as
wiſh for More, then One Luſty Ship to be ſent every
Year from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.
What are <hi>We</hi> to expect then, that propoſe no
leſſe then <hi>Fourteen</hi> or <hi>Fifteen, at a Blow?</hi> The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
of <hi>Five Hundred Men</hi> thither was the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
or <hi>His</hi> Deſire, but <hi>We</hi> ſpeak of Carrying as
many <hi>Thouſands.</hi> The Disburſment of a <hi>Hundred</hi> and
<hi>Fifty Thouſand Livres</hi> upon an <hi>Equipage,</hi> was a Summe
that <hi>He</hi> had not the Confidence ſo much as to propoſe;
but <hi>We</hi> have in our Proſpect, the Expence of many
<hi>Millions.</hi> In a Word, <hi>His</hi> Reaſonings were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
to the Abilities of a <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Private Perſons;</hi>
but <hi>We</hi> ſpeak of Erecting a <hi>Company,</hi> whereof 'tis
poſſible, that his <hi>Majeſty Himſelf</hi> will not diſdain to be
a <hi>Member;</hi> and by his Royall <hi>Participation,</hi> Influence
it with a Certain Character, peculiar to the Dignity
of ſuch a Conſtitution. So that the Odds betwixt
<hi>Our Modell,</hi> and <hi>His</hi> is Evident, and that we ſhall be
able to carry our Buſineſs higher, then ever he could
have raiſed his Imagination. But let That go as it
will; of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> a Man may ſafely ſay,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54004:16"/>
that with a very little Care to Fortifie there, we may
have not onely one Place, but many, and thoſe of
greater Value, then all that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> can pretend
to be Maſters of in the <hi>Indies;</hi> take it either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>Place</hi> it Self, or the Convenience of <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.</hi>
Surely it cannot be denied to be Incomparably
more <hi>Commodious,</hi> and <hi>Safe,</hi> then <hi>Batavia</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of
<hi>Java,</hi> where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have pitcht their <hi>Principall
Reſidence.</hi> More <hi>Commodious</hi> doubtleſſe it is, as being
in a <hi>Gentle Climate,</hi> and having within it ſelf whatſoever
may honeſtly ſerve either to the Pleaſures, or Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of humane Life. Whereas on the <hi>Contrary,</hi>
there is ſcarce any thing to be gotten about <hi>Batavia;</hi>
but the <hi>Company</hi> is faine to fetch from afar off the very
<hi>Rice, Meat,</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Proviſions</hi> for <hi>Five</hi> and <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
or <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> Perſons, to their great Trouble,
and Expence. And then <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> is Certainly a
<hi>Safer</hi> Place; for the Natives of <hi>Java</hi> are a <hi>Brutal, Bold,
Warlike,</hi> and <hi>Stubborn</hi> People: By Profeſſion <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi>
and conſequently Haters, and Deſpiſers of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have for their Neighbour, on
the <hi>One</hi> ſide the King of <hi>Mataran,</hi> a Prince, that ſhews
himſelf now and then at their very Gates with a
<hi>Hundred Thouſand Men.</hi> On the <hi>Other</hi> ſide they have
the People of <hi>Bantam</hi> (a matter of <hi>Twelve Leagues</hi> from
<hi>Batavia)</hi> who have often done the ſame as the King of
<hi>Mataran.</hi> Whereas the Inhabitants of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> on
the Contrary, are of a <hi>Meek</hi> and <hi>Quiet humour,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
withall a Singular Inclination to receive the
Goſpel. So that one is more ſecure with a <hi>Hundred</hi>
Men in <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> then with above a <hi>Thouſand</hi> in
<hi>Java.</hi> But This is not all yet, that the Place is more
<hi>Delightful</hi> and <hi>Secure;</hi> but it lyes much better alſo for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54004:17"/>
               <hi>Traffique:</hi> for I cannot but take Notice of another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſuffer, in having
their General <hi>Magazin</hi> at <hi>Batavia.</hi> It lyes ſo far up in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> that it makes their Voyges <hi>long</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greous,</hi>
and a great part of them to no purpoſe. When
you have brought them within view of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi>
they have ſtill a <hi>Third</hi> Part of their Way further to
<hi>Batavia.</hi> And when they are <hi>There,</hi> they muſt come
back again the ſame way they went, and with the ſame
Windes, that would carry them into <hi>Europe;</hi> onely to
<hi>Traffique</hi> in the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Bengala,</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandel,</hi>
and <hi>Malabar,</hi> at <hi>Ceylon, Surat,</hi> in the <hi>Perſian
Gulf,</hi> and upon the Coaſts of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and after all
This, they muſt <hi>back again</hi> with their Merchandize for
<hi>Batavia,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> at Laſt they make their <hi>Cargaſons</hi>
for <hi>Holland.</hi> So that the very <hi>Situation</hi> of the Place
gives them the Trouble of paſſing the ſame way Two
or Three times over, whereas by Planting our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<hi>Magazin</hi> at <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> all the doubling would
be ſaved: For being There once, let us go which
way we will, either toward the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> the <hi>Gulph</hi> of
<hi>Bengala, China, Japan,</hi> or the moſt Remote <hi>Iſlands,</hi> we
are never out of our way; but when we ſhall have
made our Markets, and Carried our Commodities to
<hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> every hour of our Paſſage will have
brought us ſo much nearer Home. So that we ſhall
have nothing to Stop us, but foul Weather; None of
this <hi>back, and forward,</hi> this Turning, and Croſſing, to
make the way tedious. Take This along with you too,
that when you are once at <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> you are upon as
good a Breathing-Place as you would wiſh, with all
Conveniences about you, to refreſh your Men, and
follow your Courſe at Pleaſure: Whereas the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54004:17"/>
after they are once under way from <hi>Batavia,</hi>
meet with no ſuch Relief betwixt <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>Home:</hi>
(commonly a Seaven-Months Voyage) for want of
which, they are ſo miſerably Harraſſed with the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that a long time it takes them to recover it. And
there remains yet another Inconvenience; (from
which We are Exempt) that is; When they are come
into <hi>Our Seas,</hi> they dare not paſſe the <hi>Channell,</hi> for fear
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with whom they are at Variance, upon
the very point of the <hi>Indian-Trade;</hi> but away they go
on ſtill to the <hi>Northward,</hi> and ſo about <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
<hi>Scotland</hi> (a Matter of <hi>Four or Five Hundred Leagues
Compaſs)</hi> to fall at Laſt into their Own Country by the
way of the <hi>German Ocean</hi> (which is the true reaſon of
the <hi>Companies</hi> allowing an <hi>Augmentation</hi> of <hi>Three
Months Pay,</hi> to all the Officers and Seamen (upon this
Voyage) above their ordinary Wages.) So that they
have both Extremities of Heat and Cold to Encounter
in their Return. And we are now to preſume, that
the <hi>Company</hi> puts upon Accompt all theſe Rubbs, and
Stopps in the way, which make the Navigation both
more Hazzardous, and Expenſive, and Rate their
Commodities accordingly. This is enough ſaid, I
ſuppoſe to prove the <hi>Situation</hi> of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> better
then that of <hi>Java,</hi> and Conſequently, that the Matter
in hand is worth our Care.</p>
            <p>To Inſtance now in our <hi>Own Nation,</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
make no difficulty at all to adventure upon the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican
Iſles,</hi> as St. <hi>Chriſtopher, Martinique, Guadalupe,</hi>
and Others (where there are at leaſt <hi>Thirty Thouſand
Perſons)</hi> and yet theſe are Places, where there is no
Living without Succour from <hi>Abroad;</hi> and if the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> with whom they <hi>Traffique,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54004:18"/>

and with <hi>Slaves</hi> too, to order their Grounds, they
were not able to ſubſiſt Two Years to an End without
Extream Miſery; which would enforce them at laſt
to quit their Hold. From hence it proceeds, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> get away all their <hi>Sugar, Tobacco</hi>
and <hi>Indigo,</hi> with which they furniſh us afterward, at a
dear Rate; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> are they that reap the
leaſt Benefit of their own Labours. Taking This for
Granted, what can be clearer, then that we are under
a Groſſe, and moſt unreaſonable Prejudice, in rather
Chuſing to ſend out <hi>Colonies</hi> into Places, Subjected to
ſuch <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> then to Plant a Large and Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Iſland,</hi> fitted with all advantages, both for <hi>Plenty,
Pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Commerce:</hi> And all This, becauſe <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Flacourt</hi> failed in the buſineſſe; Becauſe a matter of
a <hi>Hundred, or Six Score Men</hi> Miſcarryed in it. (Even
by the fault of the very Company it ſelf) Theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould do well to obſerve, that we are now upon
another manner of deſign; upon an Enterprize not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of that great Prince, who will have the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to make Himſelf of the Party.</p>
            <p>I muſt expect now to be Queſtioned, by what <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
I talke at this Rate, and who made me an <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker?</hi>
Truly, I ſhall not take upon me beyond my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
but I think it may be very fairly preſumed,
that ſo accompliſhed a Prince, as his <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty</hi>
will never refuſe to Comfort, and Protect his People
in an Affair of this Weight; or ever fall ſhort of That
Affection, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have conſtantly
Manifeſted toward their Subjects upon the like Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A Man may ſay indeed, that His Majeſties daily
Acts are a Security to the Contrary; and he that ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54004:18"/>
conſider, that ſince the Year, 1658. the King has
ſtruck off <hi>Twenty Millions</hi> a Year in <hi>Taxes,</hi> and ſince
That, brought, down the Price of Salt: How that in
the Scarcity of, 1661. (which threatned us with an
Inevitable Famine) he did out of his Proper Coffers
provide for the Importation of Prodigious Quantities
of Grain, to relieve the Neceſsities of his People, (and
particularly of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Number made the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
the more dangerous. He I ſay, that ſhall duely
Conſider, what we have both ſeen, and taſted of <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his
Kinde, will never doubt of His Majeſties Propenſion
to further the Advancement of This <hi>Company</hi> to all
purpoſes Imaginable.</p>
            <p>If there were nothing elſe of Inducement in the
Thing, it would be ſufficient alone to prevaile upon his
Majeſty to ſee, that the Eſtabliſhment of this Great, and
Noble <hi>Commerce,</hi> by opening an Honeſt and Certain
Way of Livelyhood to the whole <hi>French Nation</hi> for the
Future, would inſenſibly wear out, and baniſh all
thoſe other Ignoble, and ſhifting wayes of Living,
which in Our dayes have been but too much in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and Credit. That this happy Abundance would
bring us again to a Sincerity in our dealings, and put
out of Countenance that <hi>Trade of Wrangling,</hi> which the
Inſatiable Greedineſſe of a Lazy ſort of Men has ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Higheſt degree of Iniquity. That it will be
a ſure way of <hi>Employment</hi> for thoſe that languiſh for
want of <hi>Buſineſſe,</hi> whoſe Induſtry is as good as Loſt,
when it is not Exerciſed. And in concluſion, that it
will be an Indubitable <hi>Relief</hi> to a World of Poor;
who have at preſent no other Cho<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, then either a
ſhamefull Beggery: or ſome Criminal Courſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
themſelves from it. So that ſince the Thing in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54004:19"/>
Queſtion, has no leſſe an Influence upon the <hi>Intereſt,</hi>
and <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> then upon the <hi>Profit</hi> of <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons:</hi> We may be confident of his Majeſties
Royall Favour and Aſſiſtance toward the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſo Glorious, and Beneficial a Work.</p>
            <p>TO come to the Point then, there muſt be firſt a
<hi>Fond,</hi> or <hi>Stock,</hi> of <hi>Six Millions</hi> to be laid out upon
the Equipage of <hi>Twelve,</hi> or <hi>Fourteen faire Ships,</hi> of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
from <hi>Eight Hundred,</hi> to <hi>Fourteen Hundred Tunn</hi>
for the Convenience of paſſing ſuch a Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
into our <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> as may take Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it in a handſome Faſhion.</p>
            <p>I would here propoſe that His Majeſty might be
humbly beſought, to put in for a <hi>Tenth part,</hi> and
I perſuade my ſelf it might be readily Obteyned.</p>
            <p>I am further Aſſured, that there are diverſe Perſons
of Eminent Condition in this Kingdome, that would
be willing to Venture Conſiderable Summs upon This
Bottome, in Caſe the Merchants, who ſhall firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
toward this Conſtitution, ſhall think it Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
And in this Caſe, I reckon upon <hi>Three Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as good as <hi>Rayſed;</hi> ſo that we are Advanced the
<hi>One Half already.</hi> And for the <hi>Other Moyety,</hi> I would
Recommend it to all Merchants, Burgers of Towns,
and in a more Eſpeciall manner to all that love the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Country, and deſire the Laudable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of their Proper Fortunes, to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſeriouſly of the Buſineſſe, and to make their
<hi>Zeal</hi> as Remarquable to the <hi>Preſent Age,</hi> as the <hi>Reward</hi>
of it will Render them in their Generations to <hi>Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54004:19"/>
For their further encouragement, I have great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe, that his Majeſty after his Engagement
for a <hi>Tenth</hi> in the firſt Expedition, will be prevailed
with to furniſh more for the <hi>Second, Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi>
if it ſhall be thought needfull.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty may be alſo ſupplicated to remit to this
Company, the <hi>One</hi> Half of his Rights of <hi>Entry</hi> and
<hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> throughout all <hi>France,</hi> for all <hi>Indian</hi> Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
Imported thither.</p>
            <p>In fine, upon a ſtrong preſumption, that the
King will ſhew himſelf in this, as in all other
Caſes; the <hi>Father of His People</hi> I flatter my ſelf
with a ſtrange hope, that his Majeſty may be
perſwaded to take upon Himſelf, the <hi>Riſque</hi> of the
Firſt <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> Years; which if it comes to paſſe,
let the world Judge by that ſignal Engagement, how
his Majeſty ſtands Affected to this Affair, and whether
the Opinion, which I have entertained concerning it,
be not ſomewhat more then the Viſion of a man, that
dreams waking.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Private</hi> Perſons, they ſhall have Liberty to
Intereſt themſelves in the <hi>Company</hi> for what ſumme
they pleaſe, till the <hi>Stock</hi> ſhall be <hi>Compleat;</hi> after
which no more ſhall be Admitted: And for the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
Raiſing of the ſum, His Majeſty ſhall be deſired,
that <hi>Strangers</hi> (as to that Particular) may have the ſame
Freedome with <hi>French-men</hi> themſelves: by virtue
whereof they ſhall ſtand <hi>Naturalized,</hi> without need of
any other <hi>Grace;</hi> Provided that their Engagement
exceed the ſum of <hi>Ten Thouſand Livres,</hi> in Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which Intereſt, their <hi>Kindred</hi> although <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
ſhall be qualified to inherit their Eſtates. And for
further Security, His Majeſty muſt be deſired to Grant,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54004:20"/>
that in caſe of any <hi>Rupture</hi> betwixt <hi>This Crown</hi> and the
<hi>States,</hi> whereof ſuch <hi>Strangers</hi> ſhall be <hi>Subjects,</hi> their
Goods ſhall not thereupon be Seized or Conſiſcated, in
Conſequence of the War.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Company</hi> ſhall then have its <hi>Directors;</hi> and to
take away all jealouſie from the Negotiants of being
one Oppreſſed by Another; theſe <hi>Directors</hi> ſhall be
choſen out of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Merchants</hi> onely, and the
whole <hi>Stock</hi> put into the Hands of <hi>One Perſon</hi> to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on their Part. And for the greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Strangers,</hi> and in Teſtimony of the Truſt, that
ſhall be repoſed in them, they ſhall be declared Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Directors</hi> of the <hi>Company;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that they bring in an Intereſt Correſpondent
thereunto and ſettle in <hi>France</hi> with their Families.</p>
            <p>The King muſt be ſupplicated again to permit, that
the Cauſes of the Company may in the Firſt Place be
brought before the next <hi>Conſulary Juſtice,</hi> and by <hi>Appeal</hi>
to the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, every man ſhall be free to Offer his Advice
for the Good of the Company: or, for the Security of
any of the Perſons therein concerned; and his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſhall be received with Reſpect, and followed ſo
far, as ſhall be found Expedient. I have now deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my thoughts upon This Subject, which have not
been hitherto unacceptable where ever I have impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> (thoſe Two Ignoble Paſſions,
and the Enemies of all great Undertakings,) will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap,
have the Power to work upon ſome eaſie Natures,
by their ill grounded and miſtaken Reaſons; which
(ſuch as they are) we ſhall frankly lay open, for the
ſervice of Thoſe who otherwiſe might poſſibly ſuffer

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54004:20"/>
The<hi> Firſt Objection </hi>is drawn from the Ordinary<hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi>of<hi> Events, </hi>which is the great<hi> Common-Place</hi>of ſuch as want<hi> Reſolution, </hi>who will tell you, that<hi>A Man can have no Aſſurance, that this New Navigation,
will ever come to what we Imagine: </hi>That<hi> Our Neighbours
being already in Poſſeſsion of the </hi>Indian<hi> Commerce, where
they are powerfully Setled, and Rooted in Familiarities with
the Natives, with whom they Trade, it will be a hard matter
to bring them over to us: And that </hi>in fine,<hi> being before-handed,
and having great Magazins, and Stores, they will
appoint their </hi>Factors<hi> perchance to beat down the Market,
and under-ſell us: So that we ſhall be quickly Reduced either
to throw off all; or Trade to Loſſe. </hi>All this is is eaſily
anſwered, and we will do it in Order.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Firſt Objection,</hi> I reckon, that it can never
Enter into the thought of a Man of Courage. Have
our <hi>Neighbours</hi> proſpered in This Navigation, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Hopes, and is it a Reaſonable Queſtion to
aske, whether <hi>We</hi> ſhall ſucceed, or No? It is without
diſpute, a point of falſe Prudence to doubt it. How
ſeldome is this ſame froward Wiſdome in the Right!
which requires more Certainty, then the thing will
bear; that would have the <hi>Future</hi> in <hi>Hand,</hi> and cannot
content it ſelf, with a <hi>well-Grounded Probability.</hi>
This was it, that made ſo many of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes
to reject the Propoſition of the Famous <hi>Columbus</hi> (of
which notwithſtanding, they ſaw afterwards, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to their Amazement (the firſt that boggled at
the deſign being the <hi>Genoeſes)</hi> He diſcourſed the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the King of <hi>Portugall;</hi> but he had as good have
ſaid nothing: And to as little Purpoſe was the Project
broken to the King of <hi>England;</hi> and to the <hi>French</hi> King
too: (as ſome ſay) and the Favourable Audience, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54004:21"/>
he had of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> would have ſignified
juſt as much as the Reſt, if a <hi>Private Man</hi> had not born
the Charge of his <hi>Firſt Expedition,</hi> by the Advance of
<hi>Sixteen thouſand Gold Ducats,</hi> that were Employed upon
it. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> has the ſame Obligation alſo,
for the Diſcovery of <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Three Private Perſons,</hi> that
joyned in the Deſign, which paſſed a while for an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
folly,</hi> till the Event made it appear to be an
Act of <hi>Profound Wiſdome.</hi> In the mean time, the
difference we here ſpeak of, was not without ſome
plauſible Appearance of Reaſon: the Thing being as
then in doubt; but with us 'tis another Caſe. The
Gaine is Certain, and the good Fortune which others
have had there already, tell us what we our Selves
are now to expect. In one word, if our deſign miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
tis our own Fault, and we cannot ſay, that the
Execution of it is not in our own Hands, without
Offence to <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Second Objection,</hi> which concerns the <hi>Vent</hi>
of our <hi>Merchandize;</hi> the Conceit is Idle: for Firſt,
the <hi>Company</hi> may be ſure of <hi>France;</hi> becauſe (as we
have proved already) <hi>They</hi> may afford their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
at <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> better Cheap
then the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> (Which riſes to more, then a Man
would Imagine, till he comes to Compute, that <hi>France
alone</hi> conſumes at leaſt a <hi>Third Part</hi> of what is brought
out of <hi>India.)</hi> But beſides, it will not enter into my
underſtanding, why <hi>Strangers</hi> ſhould not as ſoon buy
of <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, as of our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> Eſpecially, when their
<hi>Intereſt</hi> leads them to it; <hi>France</hi> being placed in the
very Heart of <hi>Europe,</hi> and Acceſſible on every ſide.
I ſhall ſay more, which is, that ſince <hi>Strangers</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
under an Obligation of dealing with us, for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54004:21"/>
               <hi>Four Principal Commodities,</hi> which we have in Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
(and which an <hi>Italian</hi> of great Authority, calls
the <hi>Four Load-Stones,</hi> that draw other Nations to us)
That is to ſay, CORN, WINE, SALT, and
HEMP; there is no doubt, but they that Traffique
with us for theſe Things, would be very well content
to take off our <hi>Indian</hi> Merchandize, as far as they have
Occaſion for it, all under One. Which would be very
much for the Merchants Eaſe to furniſh himſelf with
whatſoever he can deſire, at one, and the ſame Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
So that it is Rational to believe, not onely that
our <hi>Indian</hi> Merchandize will not be left upon our
Hands; but that we ſhall have a Quicker Sale for it,
then other People; and by this Means Recover the
great Traffique, which <hi>France</hi> had of Old before the
<hi>Portuguez</hi> found out the Navigation of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi>
for in thoſe dayes, all the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
was brought by <hi>Land</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> from <hi>Thence</hi>
by <hi>Sea</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> and There Diſtributed. In
Conſequence hereof, it is not unlikely that our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi>
whoſe beſt Card is their <hi>Commerce,</hi> will try all
the wayes in the World to <hi>Croſs us.</hi> And this is the
Foundation of the <hi>Third Objection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In truth it may very well be, and that they will not
ſtick even to pick their own Pockets, rather then we
ſhall fill ours, and ſhew <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a Thouſand Tricks, to make
us ſick of our Buſineſs. It is poſsible, that for a while
they will be content to ſet their Merchandize at an
under Rate, to Looſe a Little at preſent, to get the
more hereafter, and trifle away a Million or Two upon
the Experiment. But how long will this Frolick hold?
or can any man Imagine, that to do us a Miſchief,
they will reſolve abſolutely to ruine <hi>Themſelves?</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54004:22"/>
all, The Conſideration how far they would expoſe
themſelves upon this deſign to divert and diſcourage
us, ſerves onely to Confirme me in my Firſt opinion
of it. They are not a People to do great things to no
Purpoſe; nor would they throw away ſo much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
now, but in Order to the Conſervation of their
Future Intereſt. Again; They would not ſtickle ſo
hard for a ſmall Matter, and the very Induſtry they
uſe to hinder our Commerce, proves the Benefit
Conſiderable, if we carry it. So that this Objection is
ſo far from moving us to relinquiſh our Enterprize,
that on the other ſide it rayſes both our Hopes, and
Reſolutions to go thorough with it. To ſay all in a
word, if ſo great a Bleſsing does attend us, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Conſent, that all the Loſs, which ſhall befall the
Company, for the firſt <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Ten years</hi> may be made
good upon the ſtock which His Majeſtie ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to venture in the deſign. What have we then to
fear? Can it be, that a Party of <hi>Private Merchants</hi> (for
ſuch are our Neighbours Companies) ſhall have the
Power to <hi>ſink</hi> a deſign, which One of the <hi>Greateſt
Princes</hi> of the World has a mind to <hi>ſupport?</hi> A Prince,
who by the Admirable <hi>order</hi> of his <hi>Conduct;</hi> the <hi>Juſt
Adminiſtration</hi> of his <hi>Revenue,</hi> and by his fatherly <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
toward his <hi>People,</hi> has put himſelf into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to undertake without <hi>Fear,</hi> whatſoever may be
put in Execution with <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> No,
No, Our Neighbours are too wiſe to make ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an Experiment! Let us ſay rather, that they ſhall
ſee us take part of their <hi>Commerce,</hi> either with pleaſure,
as their Principal Allyes; or however without having
it in their Power to harm us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Scruple</hi> objected by ſome Particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54004:22"/>
from the Conſideration of certain unhappy Effects
of our paſt Troubles. The Prodigious Expences, which
the King was at, while he was forced to maintain a
War in all the parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> (which has now
brought us however to the moſt Glorious Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the State of <hi>France</hi> ever enjoyed) Thoſe
Expences I ſay, having obliged His Majeſty to call for
Supplies of mony now and then from his People, have
left in them certain dark Imaginations and Jealouſies,
that the <hi>Stock</hi> of the <hi>Company</hi> being a <hi>Publique Treaſure;</hi>
upon the Kings next occaſion, his Majeſty might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
ſeize it as his <hi>Own.</hi> So that it would be a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for Private Perſons to venture their Fortunes in a
Bottome, which the King may make himſelf Maſter
of at Pleaſure. But theſe are weak Heads God knows;
and That they ſay, is certainly unworthy, both of the
<hi>Proſperity</hi> of Our <hi>Affairs,</hi> and the <hi>Magnanimity</hi> of our
<hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> they ſay, <hi>may perchance lay hand upon the
Companies Stock, becauſe 'tis Publique Mony.</hi> But I ſay,
that the King will never do it for that very Reaſon. His
Majeſty has heretofore had great <hi>Warrs</hi> upon his hands,
his <hi>Treaſury drayned,</hi> and his <hi>Finances miſ-menaged,</hi> to
the great disſatisfaction of his People: but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of this Preſſing Neceſſity can any man ſay, that the
King ever Fingered any of the <hi>Publique Mony:</hi> was
his Majeſty ever known to Order the <hi>Receiver</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations</hi>
to Empty his Coffers in the hands of
his <hi>Treaſurers?</hi> Never had any Creature ſuch
a thought. For <hi>the Publique Treaſure is a kind
of Sacred Truſt,</hi> and it were a ſort of <hi>Sacriledge</hi>
to <hi>abuſe</hi> it, Why ſhould any man ſuſpect the King ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54004:23"/>
of ſo prophane a violence? And that he ſhould
take That <hi>now</hi> too, when his Coffers are full, which in
his greateſt Wants, he ever made a Conſcience to
meddle with? But it will be ſaid again, that the
world is uncertain, and all that is in it, and that the
greateſt Felicity imaginable cannot warrant it ſelf
from Misfortune. This is true, and I think no man
will diſpute the Humour and Caprice of Fortune;
but let us judge of things by probability (if not, by
ſomewhat more ſubſtantial.) We ſee, that moſt of
our Neighbours have their hands full at home; Others
are weak, and thoſe, whom we have found formerly
moſt to be feared, are now well enough ſatisfied to be
at peace with us. Let us conſider on the other hand,
the Power of our Prince, and the unmoveable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of that Power. In his Menage of <hi>Affairs of
State,</hi> his Majeſty is <hi>Aſsiduous,</hi> and <hi>Indefatigable.</hi> As
to the Ordering of his <hi>Finances,</hi> he looks after it <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
and underſtands the whole Buſineſs of his <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi>
no man better. If we turn our thoughts now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoſe Bleſsings, which Heaven has ſhowred
upon his Royal Perſon, that Clearneſs of Wit, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of Judgment, Vigour of Body, Health, Youth;
We have Reaſon to believe, (if we may believe any
thing in this World) that our good Fortune will be
long-lived, and that God will reward his Royalliety,
and Juſtice, with a Reign as Laſting as Happy, and
not refuſe to his <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> a Grace, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has ſometime beſtowed even upon <hi>Pagan Princes,</hi>
and Conferred upon the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Away
then with this Lewd diſtruſt, that Embitters all our
delights, and troubles our Heads, with the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54004:23"/>
of Evils which are never likely to concern us.
Let it never be Imagined, that a Prince ſo Generous
and Juſt, after the Solemn Eſtabliſhment of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
under the Seal of his Authority, can ever have
the thought to invade the Eſtates of Private Perſons,
putting themſelves under his Protection, and by ſo foul
a violence to blaſt the Glory of his Unſpotted Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In a Word, let not any man think, that his
Majeſties flouriſhing Condition can ever be Reduced
to ſtand in need of ſo <hi>hateful</hi> an <hi>Expedient,</hi> and after
that, ſo <hi>Unprofitable.</hi> For in fine, (to leave this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
nothing to ſay for it ſelf) I dare affirm, that if
the King both wanted Mony, and had a mind to ſeize
it, the Eſtate of the <hi>Company</hi> would be yet ſecure.
For let us look into <hi>Holland,</hi> and we ſhall find wherein
the <hi>wealth</hi> of theſe <hi>Companies</hi> Conſiſts. 'Tis true;
they have a world of <hi>Merchandize</hi> Diſpoſed of up and
down in their <hi>Magazines,</hi> both in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>
they have their <hi>Shipping,</hi> their <hi>Canon,</hi> and their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<hi>Equipages;</hi> but for <hi>Mony,</hi> alas, 'tis the leaſt part
of their Riches; and indeed their Caſh compared
with the Reſt, is ſcarce Conſiderable. Now I pray
you tell me, Were it not a pleaſant Project for a
King of <hi>France</hi> that had need of Mony, to make ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure
of all theſe Commodities, and that at Three or
Four Hundred Leagues diſtance, for the great Part.
Put Caſe, that he were to raiſe an <hi>Army</hi> to prevent an
<hi>Invaſion,</hi> and wanted Mony upon that Pinch; or to
pay off ſome <hi>Mutinous Troups;</hi> Were it not a ready
way think ye to ſend a Matter of a Hundred, or Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
Wagons to the Houſe of the <hi>Indian Company</hi> for
ſo many Load of <hi>Cinamome,</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs?</hi> do Princes
uſe to pay their <hi>Souldiers,</hi> with Baggs of <hi>Pepper,</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54004:24"/>
               <hi>Cloves?</hi> No! no, In ſuch Caſes, This will never do
their Buſineſs. In a State of <hi>Warr</hi> there muſt be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
in <hi>Kind,</hi> and not That, which <hi>makes</hi> Mony in a
time of <hi>Peace.</hi> Wherefore ſince the Eſtates of this
<hi>Company,</hi> will not lye in <hi>Caſh,</hi> which is the only Thing,
that <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rinces at ſome times may have Occaſion for: It
is manifeſt that this <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Authority-Royall</hi>
is nothing elſe, but a <hi>Chimera</hi> ſet up, to oppoſe the
growing Proſperity of this Nation.</p>
            <p>There is Another ſort of People, yet more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
But we ſhall anſwer them with the Reſt, and
they'l tell ye, (taking every thing at worſt) that we
are not ſure to be alwayes at <hi>Peace</hi> with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and if there ſhould happen a <hi>Warr,</hi> how much the
<hi>Companies Shipping</hi> would be expoſed to the <hi>Enemy,</hi> for
they make a great Queſtion, whether the State of
<hi>France,</hi> would ever concern themſelves ſo far in the
Quarrel, as their <hi>Neighbours</hi> do upon the like occaſion:
For, ſay they, <hi>Traffique</hi> being the <hi>Chief,</hi> and almoſt the
<hi>Onely Support</hi> of our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> it is their <hi>Intereſt</hi> to
maintain their <hi>Commerce</hi> with their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes:</hi>
Whereas <hi>France,</hi> that lives upon it ſelf, and has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſelf ſo ſure a Bottom of Strength, and Subſiſtence,
will not think it ſelf much the Poorer, for the Loſs of a
<hi>Merchants Fleet.</hi> So that the Kings buſineſs will be to
ſecure his <hi>Frontiers,</hi> and look to his <hi>Garriſons,</hi> without
charging himſelf with <hi>Armado's</hi> to protect <hi>Us</hi> in our
<hi>Trade.</hi> Sure theſe People do not heed what they ſay,
for they confute themſelves with their own Objections.
Do they confeſs, that our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> in a Country, not
ſo good as <hi>France,</hi> have yet kept up <hi>Their</hi> Trading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Oppoſers; and do they now Queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Majeſtie will uphold <hi>Us</hi> in <hi>Ours?</hi> What colour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54004:24"/>
have they for a Perſwaſion, that the ſtronger ſhould
not do That now, which they themſelves acknowledge
to have been done already by the Weaker? <hi>Not that
they make any doubt of the Kings</hi> Power, they'l tell ye;
<hi>but perhaps there will not be ſo much Care taken as
might be.</hi> They are Ignorant then it ſeems or would be
thought ſo, of what his Majeſty dos every day. I do not
ſpeak of his Univerſal Vigilance over all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but of the ſpecial care he takes for the Protecting
of his People in a <hi>Forreign Trade.</hi> They do not know I
perceive, that it coſts the King at leaſt <hi>Four Millions</hi> a
Year, to entertain a Liberty of <hi>Ordinary Commerce,</hi>
both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Ocean.</hi> And that it is upon
this Accompt, that his Majeſty is now at the Charge
of a <hi>Navy Royall,</hi> to ſuppreſſe the <hi>Corſares</hi> of <hi>Algiers:</hi>
That it is, for this very End, that he Entertains ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Squadron,</hi> to defend our Merchants from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of <hi>Gallicia.</hi> They are ſtrangers doubtleſſe to all
theſe things, without which, it were not poſſible they
ſhould fall foule upon ſo groſſe a Miſtake. Is it not
known, that his Majeſty does all This, for the ſupport
of a very <hi>Ordinary Traffique,</hi> and can any man Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that he will doe leſſe for the Maintenance of ſo
much a greater, and more <hi>Honourable Commerce?</hi> No
man can perſwade himſelfe, that the King would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the ſame Countenance and Aſſiſtance to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of a <hi>Company,</hi> wherein the whole <hi>State</hi> is Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which at this very day his Majeſty is pleaſed to
allow in Favour of <hi>Particular Merchants.</hi> We have
ſeen in times of Warr, what Peyns has been taken for
the Providing of our Frontiers; and a Battail fought
ſometimes, onely to hinder the taking of a ſmall Town,
or to ſecure a Paſſe upon a River. Much more then
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54004:25"/>
will his Majeſty provide for the ſafety of a Fleet, that
has the Prayers and Wiſhes of all <hi>France</hi> engaged in
the Venture. In a Word; if <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> be
the moſt <hi>Powerfull Motives</hi> of <hi>Humane Reſolutions;</hi> and
the <hi>Two Poles</hi> upon which are turned the Affaires of
<hi>Princes,</hi> as well as of <hi>Private Perſons,</hi> there can be no
Queſtion, but the King will Employ his Power upon
all occaſions to preſerve the <hi>Company</hi> from danger. For,
that it is his Majeſties <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſo to do, is clear; not
onely in regard of his <hi>Part</hi> in the <hi>Stock</hi> of the <hi>Company;</hi>
but by reaſon of the Infinite Number of <hi>Merchandizes,</hi>
and <hi>Merchants</hi> that this <hi>Traffique</hi> will draw into the
Kingdome, to the great Advantage of the <hi>Revenue</hi> of
his Majeſties <hi>Farmes,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes.</hi> So that a man may
rationally compute, that <hi>The</hi> Profit <hi>of this Commerce,
when it ſhall be once Eſtabliſhed, will be better to the King,
then the</hi> Two beſt Provinces <hi>in his Kingdome.</hi> Nor is it
leſſe manifeſt that his Majeſty is Engaged in <hi>Honour,</hi>
then in <hi>Intereſt;</hi> ſince without diſpute, it is a point of
<hi>Honour</hi> for a Prince not to ſuffer his People, to be
Cruſht in a Deſigne undertaken by his own Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Authority. So that to ask, if the King will
vigorouſly maintain us both in Peace, and War, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo many Conſiderations to engage him to it,
would be but a kinde of ſenſeleſſe, and unmannerly
Queſtion. If Neceſſity, which many times forces
great Actions from mean Perſons has been able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thoſe faire Reſolutions, which we admire in our
Neighbours: How much more ſhall the true Love of
Glory and Juſtice operate upon the Soules of Princes.
The firſt are carried on by a kinde of Violence: The
other govern their Actions by Choice and Reaſon.
Thoſe at the beſt, are but wiſe enough to avoid miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54004:25"/>
but theſe are the Ordinary Inſtruments of
our greateſt Good. Let us trouble our ſelves no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then about our Fleets, ſince they are under the
Care of One of the beſt Princes of the Univerſe: and
that Miraculous Power, which ſubjects all other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
to it ſelf, and attends him where ever he goes,
ſhall Influence our new Navigators, and protect them
both againſt Enemies, and Storms. Neither let it be
thought, that the Conqueſt which we ſhall make in his
Name, will be leſſe his Majeſties Care, then his
other Poſſeſſions: or that he will ever endure to have
his Lillies torn up, where ever they ſhall have taken
Root. There is a Certain inviſible Chain that Lincks
together the ſeverall Parts of the World, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo Remote, when they belong to the ſame Maſter:
So that 'tis not poſsible to ſhake the One, without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Other. It is then upon the Reſolution
and Power of his Majeſty, that we may Confidently
repoſe for the Iſſue of this Enterprize, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon a time, when this <hi>Great Monarch</hi> is in Effect,
the <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of all <hi>Europe;</hi> when all Princes make it
their Buſineſſe to preſerve his Friendſhip, and avoid
his diſpleaſure. What Queſtion is to be made; but
that the Reputation of his Greatneſſe will carry Good
Fortune and Succeſſe to our <hi>Colonies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joyn your ſelves then my Maſters, Joyn your ſelves
my Generous Countrymen in the purſuit of a Glorious
Diſcovery, which has onely been kept from you thus
long, by our paſt diſorders. A Diſcovery that ſhall
lead you to Advantages not to be numbred, and which
ſhall yet grow in the Hands of your Poſterity. A
Diſcovery in fine, that ſhall carry the Fame and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Your Armes into thoſe Quarters of the World,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54004:26"/>
where the <hi>French</hi> Nation it ſelf was never heard of.
No more therefore of theſe Reproachfull Jealouſies,
which are ſo unworthy of your ordinary Courage and
Virtue: but go on boldly under the Banner of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
LEWIS,</hi> and be aſſured, that as the Awe,

upon Other Nations, leaves you Nothing to feare from
<hi>Strangers:</hi> So from <hi>Himſelf,</hi> you are certain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
