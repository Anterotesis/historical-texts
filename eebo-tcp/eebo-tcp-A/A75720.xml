            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now ſomewhat above five years, ſince I pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the <hi>firſt Part</hi> of my THEATRUM CHEMICUM BRITANNICUM; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after which, my <hi>Studies</hi> of that <hi>Nature</hi> received moſt unfortunate <hi>Interruptions,</hi> from the <hi>Commencement</hi> of ſeveral vexatious <hi>Suits</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: But GOD, not onely enabled me to endure thoſe impetuous multiplied <hi>Stormes,</hi> but ſome few <hi>Moneths</hi> ſince, was pleaſed to ſweeten my <hi>long-Sufferings</hi> with a fair and peaceful <hi>Iſſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe my <hi>Studies</hi> in HERMETICK PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY, would not bear with the aforeſaid troubleſome <hi>Rubs, (She</hi> requiring a ſerene <hi>Minde,</hi> quiet <hi>Thoughts,</hi> unwearied <hi>Endeavours,</hi> indeed the whole <hi>Man,)</hi> I was with great unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs forced to lay them aſide: Yet, (that I might not tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118875:3"/>
All this while I well hoped to meet with <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Other,</hi> who (inclined to advance the honour of HERMES his <hi>Family)</hi> would have taken the pains of adding a <hi>Second Volume</hi> to my ſaid THEATRUM, in regard thoſe ſucceſſive <hi>Troubles</hi> (hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long and heavily upon me) had denied me the <hi>Leiſure:</hi> Nor were either my <hi>Invitations</hi> to it wanting, or the free <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution</hi> of whatever I had ſo painfully <hi>Collected,</hi> unoffered: to the end my <hi>Deſign</hi> (of letting the <hi>World</hi> ſee, what excellent <hi>Men</hi> we had once of our own <hi>Nation,</hi> famous as well for that kind of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as any other <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> of ſo tranſcendent a <hi>Secret;)</hi> might have been furthered: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, I hear of nothing (hitherto) done, nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaoured.</p>
            <p>But inſtead thereof, I lately met with a pretended <hi>Copy</hi> of the following <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> ready fitted for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> which (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on peruſal) I found mutilated with many <hi>Imperfections,</hi> much injured by ſeveral incongruous <hi>Additions,</hi> and they confeſt to be onely made up of ſome ſcattered <hi>Shreds</hi> and <hi>Fragments,</hi> collected from the whole <hi>Work;</hi> And beſides intended, that the <hi>World</hi> ſhould take it for the <hi>Child</hi> of one <hi>Eugenius Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didactus,</hi> being (by <hi>Re-baptization)</hi> called the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi>'s <hi>Crown,</hi> or <hi>Roſie-Crucian Phyſick;</hi> under which <hi>Titles</hi> notice hath been given of its coming <hi>abroad,</hi> by other <hi>Books</hi> ſince Publiſhed. All which conſidered, together with the <hi>Zeal</hi> I have for this noble <hi>Science,</hi> and <hi>Regret</hi> to ſee ſo able a <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> thereof thus boldly, thus nefariouſly robb'd and diſpoiled of his <hi>Honour;</hi> loth I was any longer to keep my <hi>Perfect Copy</hi> by me; and thereupon reſolved, rather to venture it abroad, (though unaccompanied,) to prevent the <hi>Injury</hi> would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be done our dead <hi>Author,</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> (I ſay unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, for my paſt and preſent <hi>Engagements,</hi> in finiſhing the <hi>Productions</hi> of ſome of thoſe <hi>Houres,</hi> I ſnatch'd from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of my late <hi>Diſturbances,</hi> will not afford me time to fit it with ſuch <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> as formerly I intended ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete one of the <hi>later Parts,</hi> of my above mentioned THEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRUM.) However, (conſidering the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Piece,)</hi> it will properly enough appear by it ſelf, and very well ſerve as a large <hi>Preface,</hi> to uſher forth the remaining <hi>Volumes,</hi> (or any

            <p>As for our <hi>Author,</hi> he was without doubt an ENGLISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN, but hath hitherto paſſed with us among the <hi>Anonymi,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> (his <hi>Off-ſpring)</hi> ſhews it ſelf ſufficiently <hi>Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> though the true <hi>Father</hi> thereof be as yet unknown. I have heard ſome notable <hi>Stories,</hi> and thoſe backt with perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> to make an eaſie Faith think the <hi>Providence</hi> very obſervable, that not onely furniſhed a laborious <hi>ſearcher</hi> into this myſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Work ſeems to be written about the beginning of the laſt (or end of the former) <hi>Century;</hi> The main drift of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> being from weighty and ſerious <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> to prove the <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of ſuch a thing as the PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS STONE: whereby is largely manifeſted, that <hi>Nature</hi> has exhibited greater <hi>Wonders</hi> to the view of the <hi>World,</hi> and as great things have been (and conſequently may be) performed by other weaker &amp; leſſer <hi>Means,</hi> where a <hi>due, friendly,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical conjunction</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> is fully underſtood. And yet howbeit (becauſe ſuch are <hi>familiar</hi> unto, and <hi>ordinary</hi> among us) we <hi>conſider</hi> them not. Tis a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> fraught with variety of excellent rational <hi>Matter,</hi> and fitted to the <hi>Learned</hi> as well as meaner <hi>Capacities;</hi> Nay, ſuch, as I boldly perſwade my ſelf, will fully ſatisfie <hi>both,</hi> beyond any thing yet extant of this <hi>Nature:</hi> and I believe many captious <hi>Arguments,</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed and urged, againſt the <hi>truth</hi> of this ſo <hi>infallible</hi> a <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> will here meet with ſatisfactory <hi>Solutions,</hi> and henceforth find no further place in any <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> ſavouring but of <hi>Sobriety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt alſo acquaint my <hi>Reader,</hi> that this piece was of ſo high a value with the induſtrious <hi>Doctor Everard,</hi> as it invited him to beſtow his pains in the <hi>Marginal Notes;</hi> wherein (like a skilful <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whoſe firſt <hi>operation</hi> is to make <hi>Hidden</hi> things <hi>Manifest)</hi> he drew forth and diſcovered, that which our <hi>Authors</hi> Magiſterial <hi>Pen</hi> thought fit to conceal; and having
<pb facs="tcp:118875:4"/>
obtained thoſe <hi>Notes</hi> (they being added to a <hi>Tranſcript</hi> of this <hi>Work,</hi> and both fairly written with the <hi>Doctors hand)</hi> from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intimate <hi>Friend</hi> (one extraordinary <hi>Learned,</hi> and a great <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> of our <hi>Nation)</hi> I was willing to make them <hi>publick</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>And now (I confeſs) notwithſtanding all this, I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, what I here <hi>publiſh,</hi> ſhould pleaſe every <hi>Palate;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Mens Writings</hi> is very much ſuitable to that of <hi>Money,</hi> which ſometimes paſſeth currant, and at other times is cryed down, or called in: To this I conſider, how we are not born with <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Appetites,</hi> that reliſh every thing alike; and that 'tis as poſſible to ſhape a <hi>Coat</hi> for the <hi>Moon,</hi> as to Print a Book that can pleaſe every <hi>Genius:</hi> ſuch and ſo various are the generality of our <hi>Inclinations!</hi> Beſides, I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>Men,</hi> both <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> diſtaſte or affect not ſome parts of <hi>Learning,</hi> and yet by a <hi>ſecret willingneſs,</hi> or <hi>natural force,</hi> are carried on in <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of other <hi>Branches</hi> thereof; And this I ſuppoſe partly growes from the neglect of a ſtrict and unbyaſſed <hi>Examination</hi> of their <hi>choyce,</hi> which (if made) would appear to proceed more from Affection than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But if any whoſe <hi>Ignorance</hi> in, or <hi>Diſaffection</hi> to this <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>laudable Science,</hi> ſhall think no better of the <hi>Work,</hi> then of a <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> [fit onely to be ſwept away:] I ſhall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs confidently hope it will fall into ſome other <hi>hands,</hi> that may conſider the curioſity of the <hi>Woofe,</hi> and eſteem it worthy their <hi>Contemplation,</hi> to obſerve how our <hi>Author</hi> (like that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Creature</hi> travelling with her <hi>Industry)</hi> hath compoſed a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> whoſe <hi>Excellencies</hi> will not diſcover themſelves to the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of a ſuperficial <hi>Eye,</hi> but onely the intent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Inquiſitor;</hi> And that ſuch may reap all poſſible <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> by their <hi>Labour,</hi> is the hearty deſire of</p>

other <hi>Wights</hi> (or living Creatures) that he was made for ſome notable end and purpoſe above the reſt; and ſo not for <hi>Pleaſure, Honour, Health,</hi> or enough of <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full outward things,</hi> which they call Riches, nor yet for any other matters, which other Wights void of Wit and Reaſon, ſeek and follow. Therefore a <hi>Man</hi> ought not to make any ſuch thing his End and Happineſs, unleſs he think it reaſon for the Maſter and better Workman, to learn of the Servant and worſer: For what other pattern and end have we in the world to follow? None at all; becauſe we are the beſt Creatures in the World.</p>
               <p>Then it is without the World, ſay you, and among the bleſſed Mindes <hi>[or Spirits]</hi> above and without all: Neither yet have we found it; for they be our <hi>Fellow-ſervants</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> under one <hi>Almighty King.</hi> Wherefore there remains nothing but <hi>GOD</hi> and his Happineſs to be ſought and ſet before us, not with hope to overtake and reach it, (that were madneſs) but with deſire to attain ſo much thereof, as the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Him and us will ſuffer. Or if the unmeaſureable and boundleſs <hi>[or infinite]</hi> Bleſſedneſs of <hi>GOD</hi> admit no compariſon; It were beſt (yea, and by the example of the beſt Men) to make the bounds of our BLISSE ſo much of the Bliſs of GOD, as our whole Power and Nature will hold and carry.</p>
               <p>Now then, if we knew that Divine Pattern and Bliſs of GOD, all were well: And this, as almoſt all other truth (eſpecially in caſe of Life and Manners, for the which it was chiefly written) by the witneſs and record of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> were each to be known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if that were not too ſtrange, and far off from this

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſithence both in this and all other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I mean not to lean over-much upon my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, becauſe a <hi>Man</hi> (eſpecially a <hi>young man)</hi> is apt to ſwerve, but to call other to counſel with me; and they can be no more but Men, at moſt endowed with ripe and ſound Reaſon and Judgement, in the courſe of <hi>Kinde [or Nature]</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> yet we will look, as near as we can, that they be ſtill ſquared by the Rule of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, to finde this Happineſs of <hi>Heaven</hi> among Men, to whom were it beſt to travel? Unto <hi>Poets,</hi> think you? No; becauſe they take their aim ſtill at a vain Mark <note n="b" place="margin">Terent. Prolog. in Andr. &amp; Plat. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118875:6"/>
have in hand, let us ſee what theſe Men hold, and how near they come to the right line of <hi>Truth,</hi> whereof we ſpake before.</p>
               <p>To begin with <hi>Plato,</hi> the Spring of this <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> his <hi>Bliſs,</hi> as he diſputes in <hi>Philaebus,</hi> as near as I could gather, out of ſo large and ſcattered a ſpeech, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>

                  <hi>delight in Colours, Concent, and ſome Smells, in Health, Wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> And again he ſaith in <hi>Theaetetus,</hi>

               <p>To let theſe two places ſerve for him, and to come to <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> As there are two ſorts of Men, one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to deal with others, which are called <hi>worldly-men;</hi> and another quite contrarily, bent to live alone, and to ſeek Knowledge, which are called <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> So he in his Book of <hi>Manners,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe be the beſt grounds of BLISSE, that ever

               <p>If the ſtall-fed <hi>Epicure</hi> may again be juſtly reproved, and reckoned as an impious perſon, whom never any heavenly Thoughts touched, for bringing <note n="h" place="margin">

Then to encounter him with his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Maſter, <hi>Plato;</hi> If that were the beſt Life, or the Life of GOD, why did GOD make the World? He lived ſo before, if that had been the beſt Life; <note n="i" place="margin">Plato in Timaeo.</note> But becauſe He was Good, He would have other enjoy his Goodneſs; and therefore he was buſie in Making, and is yet in Ruling the World: And yet indeed, it is no Buſineſs, as we reckon it, that is, no Care and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but an outward Deed and Action, clean contrary to the inward Deed of a <hi>muſing Minde,</hi> onely ſhooting at his own good Eſtate, which is <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if he deny all this, as it is like he will, becauſe, to encreaſe the heap of ſin, he grants no Beginning; then, what can be greater evidence than his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, one quite thwarting another, as croſs as may be? for in his <note n="k" place="margin">

               <p>Then we ſee, that in the judgement of theſe two great <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> where they be beſt adviſed, and in deed and truth, the Divine Pattern of BLISSE, which we ought to ſtrive unto, is no more, nor no leſs, than that worthy couple of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that band of Fellowſhip, which may never be parted and ſet aſunder.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, We have reared our BLISSE aloft, and made it a fair and goodly Work, but more fit for the dwelling of thoſe ſingle and clean <hi>Mindes [or Spirits]</hi> above, which they call Meſſengers, <hi>[or Angels]</hi> than for us Men, ſo buried here below in theſe earthly Bodies, as we be ſcarce able to look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> both in his Book of

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, I grant that this full and high pitch of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> (I mean that meaſure above ſet) is free and eaſie, to free and lively Spirits; but to us impoſſible without other outward means and helps, which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, ſhall not be counted as any part of the frame of BLISSE, needful to make up the whole; but, as it were, looſe and hang-by ſteps and ſtairs leading up unto it.</p>
               <p>Then if theſe be ſo needful as they be, it were as much need to lay them down, and in juſt account, which thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> do not; leſt if there be too few, our <hi>Happineſs</hi> ſhould halt; if again too many, the idle parts might in time infect and marre the reſt: As we may fear of <hi>Plato</hi> his firſt three Delights, although they be not hurtful of themſelves. Without more words, the juſt ſum is this.</p>
               <p>To obtain ſo much Happineſs, as our Nature is able to take and hold, the Body had need be firſt willing and obedient, and then ſtore of outward needful things to be at hand and ready: Theſe every Man knoweth. But for the Body, that is obedient when it is <hi>long-liv'd, healthful, young, clear and temperate:</hi> when all theſe helps flock together, we may be happy if we will; if any want, we ſhall never, do what we can, as we ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
               <p>Then let us marſhal, at laſt, theſe things in Order, and comparing BLISSE to a <hi>Family,</hi> make that loving

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118875:8"/>
paſſing all other Nations, as it is better and nearer to GOD, to work and do great wondrous things, than to behold and look upon them.</p>
               <p>For it is delivered to ancient and true Record, that one HERMES, a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> of that Country, a Man of rare and divine gifts in Knowledge, above all that ever were, found out a <hi>Medicine</hi> able to bring all men to that BLISSE aforeſaid, and left it behinde him in writing to his People; and that it was after him a long time by the <hi>wiſer ſort</hi> cloſely wrought and uſed, until at laſt it crept abroad, and ſtole into <hi>Arabia,</hi> when ſhe flouriſhed in Arms and Learning, and there got the Name which it now commonly keepeth of the PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSOPHERS STONE; And that from thence, in the ſame ſecret and diſguiſed manner (for it is the wont thereof, as becomes ſo deep a <hi>Secret)</hi> it hath travelled and ſpred it ſelf over all Nations, now and then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcovering it ſelf to a <hi>few</hi> of the better and wiſer Company.</p>
               <p>Then this is THE WAY TO BLISSE, which I mean to take: And withall to prove it no pleaſant Dream, and happy Tale, if it were true, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb goeth of it; but, as it is in <hi>Nature,</hi> an heroical and almoſt divine deed, ſcarce to be reached or matched with any words, ſo I vow it a true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Story, a thing often done, and again to be done as often.</p>
               <p>I am unfit, I grant, and unable to bear ſo great a Burthen, but that the great deſire I have both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Truth from ſlander, and to do good to them that love it, makes it light and eaſie: And again, this hope upholds me, That if I chance to ſtumble or faint

               <p>Well then, let us return to our purpoſe; There is a Nation of <hi>Wiſe-men,</hi> dwelling in a Soil as much more bleſſed [than yours] as yours is than theirs: That is, As they bide under ground, and you upon the face
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118875:13"/>
thereof, ſo theſe Men inhabit the edge &amp; skirt of <hi>Heaven;</hi> they daily See and Work many wondrous things, which you never ſaw nor made, becauſe you never mounted ſo high to come among them: If any one chance to fly away from you to thoſe heavenly Places, and after like experience to return, and make the like Reports, you give him like Rewards; Compare the reſt, I ſay no more; But if GOD would give you leave and power to aſcend unto thoſe high places, I mean, to thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Studies,</hi> you might quickly, by view of deep Cauſes, and Divine Secrets, and compariſon of one to another, not onely believe the <hi>bleſſed-Art,</hi> but alſo learn and perform the ſame.</p>
               <p>But they will not be rid ſo, and follow as faſt again another way: That whereas ſo many have been, and are daily ſeen to wear their lives in <hi>Alchimy,</hi> and to finde nothing that good is, but contrary for the moſt part, to wit, untimely and unordinary Death, Sickneſs, and Age, for <hi>Long-life, Health,</hi> and <hi>Youth;</hi> and alwayes Smoke for <hi>Gold,</hi> and Folly for <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> and very near as often, bad and lewd Conditions, for good and honeſt Natures; (for, by boiling themſelves long in ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſtuff, as though they were burnt in the Pots bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, they carry moſt commonly for ever after, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury ſmack thereof;) It is a plain ſign the Trade is vain, falſe, and deceitfull.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118875:13"/>
Cuſtom, (by his ſecret appointment) our kinde is grown out of kinde, and therefore may be reſtored, becauſe it is a miſ-leading, and no intent of Nature: (which fore-caſtings gave them occaſion to ſeek the remedy;) Yet they thought it unlawful, and ſet ſtraight againſt the Will of GOD, that all ſhould be reſtored; for that he ſeemed of purpoſe to have ſown Good and Bad, and great ſtore of both together, in ſuch ſort as we ſee them; leſt if all were alike, and in one ſtate of Happineſs, the great variety of buſineſs and ſtirring, and ſo the ſociety and Common-wealth among Men, ſhould be clean ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: Like as if the four firſt ſtriving <hi>Seeds</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all things are made and ſpring) were all alike, and one friend to another, all ſhould be ſtill and quiet, without Succeſſion, Change and Variety in the World, and ſo there ſhould be no World. For GOD, when he caſt his <hi>Minde</hi> upon the building of the World, he meant to make a goodly and beautiful Work, meet for the Power, Wiſdome and Pleaſure of ſuch a <hi>Builder,</hi> and therefore a ſtirring and changeable Work, becauſe there is no might nor cunning ſhewn, no delight taken in one ever-like or ſtill thing. But light footing, for ſpeed, is ever beſt in ſuch a ground; Let us away.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, by the example, and, as it were, by the ſecret blaſt and motion of GOD, after our Men had found this <hi>Reſtorative,</hi> and uſed it for the time, and meant to leave it, as becometh good Men, to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they took this way of Counſel, to lay it up ſafe in a ſtrong Caſtle as it were, in the which all the broad Gates, and common eaſie Entries, ſhould be faſt ſhut up and barred, leaving onely one little and ſecret back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door open, fore-fenced with a winding Maze, that the

               <p>And therefore it is, when godleſs and unlearned Men, hovering over Gain and Honour, preſume againſt <hi>Minerva</hi>'s will, to handle their Words, when the Things ſhould rather be handled, they wreſt and wring them a hundred wayes, (for, <note n="o" place="margin">

               <p>Then, if theſe Wayes and Fantaſies they practice, and ſet on work as faſt (as their Fingers itch) and miſs as faſt (as they muſt needs do;) ſhall they ſay they followed our Rules and Precepts, and put our Work in practiſe, and found them falſe? That were like as if a cunning <hi>Archer</hi> and <hi>Huntſman,</hi> had delivered dark Rules of <hi>Shooting</hi> and <hi>Hunting</hi> unto his Countrymen, and theſe by chance had fallen into the hands of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilde and untaught Nation, which ſimply miſ-led by miſ-taking his Drift and Meaning, had made them <hi>Ploughs</hi> to ſhoot in, and goared their <hi>Oxen</hi> to the game, and then miſſing of their purpoſe, cried out and blamed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118875:14"/>
the Arts of <hi>Shooting</hi> and <hi>Hunting,</hi> and ſought to blow Envy upon the Man that taught them; would not a Wiſe man judge, hold and deem, both theſe and them, and all other buſie-bodies, that ſo uſe to myne &amp; dig in other Mens dealings, to be ſent unto their own Trade and Buſineſs, wherefore they were made and faſhioned, and to let the reſt alone for the right owners? And for theſe of HERMES houſe, do not think they make claim, ſue and recover their own in open Court, as others uſe, (that were a way in ſuch a wicked World, to loſe Land, Life, and all together quickly) but in that ſecret ſort, which falleth not within the compaſs of your Reproof.</p>
               <p>Neither would I have you follow ſo hard, and be ſo earneſt upon the next Reaſon, That albeit our Men had cauſe to hide their Works and Practiſe, yet they would have ſhewed the fruit and effect thereof, advancing themſelves, as others do, to Honour and Pleaſure, and not have lived like the refuſe of the World, in ſuch mean plight and wretchedneſs; for that is the lighteſt of all other, though it ſeem the greateſt: If I liſt to rifle in the Rolls of ancient Records, I could eaſily finde and ſhew you, that although the moſt part, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, lived in this harmleſs and ſafe Eſtate, which I told you; yet ſome again were <hi>Kings,</hi> and Men of great Place and Dignity, (and yet I think by Remainder, and not by Purchaſe ſo) but I love not this kinde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; Let them that thirſt go to the Fountain, and us remember, that in the Houſhold of BLISSE, Riches are made but Servants, and not Maſters, and Rulers; becauſe they be for the moſt part unruly and ambitious, and for that cauſe they have no liberty granted them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118875:15"/>
but are injoyned to ſerve lowly their Betters, and to look no further; <note n="p" place="margin">

And again, if our <hi>Mindes</hi> are <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> it were meet to lead our own Life, before a ſtrangers; But laſt of all, which is worth all, becauſe GOD our onely Pattern, leadeth none other Life but this.</p>
               <p>I might be very large, if I liſt to ſeek about and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe this Matter: but here is enough to ſhew the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Reaſon our Men of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had, if it was in their choice, to chuſe this kinde of <hi>Life,</hi> which the World ſo deſpiſeth; But how if I could bring them in bereaved of all choice and free-will, and driven by force of Neceſſity to do the ſame? would not that ſtop the wideſt Mouthes, trow you, in all this laviſh Company? Let us know firſt that the <hi>Minde</hi> of Man, being come from that high City of <hi>Heaven,</hi> deſireth of her ſelf to live ſtill that <hi>heavenly Life,</hi> that is, the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Life</hi> above deſcribed; And if there be any lett, as there is lightly, it is in the weight and groſsneſs of our Bodies, over-weighing our <hi>Minde</hi> down to the Ground, and to all our own muddy Matters:—Then that our Men, after they have gotten this <hi>Golden Stone,</hi> ſo famous in the World, do not, as they think and would do,

ſtraightwayes run to their Coffers, but firſt and chiefly Gild their <hi>Bodies</hi> with it; wherefore after that by that mighty, fine, and temperate <hi>Medicine,</hi> they have ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out all Groſſneſs and Diſtemperature of the Body, the onely lets to Underſtanding, and good Manners, as we ſhall hear hereafter, and thereby left the <hi>Minde</hi> at large, and almoſt at her firſt freedom; ſhe, and ſo they together, laying aſide, and, as it were, caſting down all earthly Matters, muſt needs return to their own former Life again, ſo far I mean, as the Condition and State of <hi>Man</hi> will ſuffer. And ſo, put caſe you finde your own dark and dusky Eye-ſight ſo ſoon taken with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foul and vain worldly Beauty, yet you muſt not judge theſe <hi>heavenly Men</hi> thereby, but think the moſt ſharp and clear eye-ſight of their Underſtanding, eaſily able to ſee the blemiſh, and to avoid the bait of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love.</p>

               <p>But in ſuch variety of hard and ſlippery Matter, whence were it beſt to ſet out? which Way firſt to take? Were it not meet the means and helps unto BLISSE ſhould be firſt rid and cleared, before we come to BLISSE it ſelf? and among them to give <hi>Long Life</hi> the foremoſt place, if not for his worthineſs, yet for his behoof and neceſſity? being needful in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths and private perſons, firſt to ſeek to live, before to live well, though that, unto this end: Then let us ſee what is <hi>Long Life,</hi> and how all Men may reach unto it.</p>
               <p>But why do we make ſuch great haſte? we had need be ſlow and adviſed in ſo great a Matter, and to look, before we venture upon ſo long a Way, and of ſo many dayes Journey, that we be well provided and furniſhed of all things; wherein I hope, if I have not of my own, or if after the thrifty manner, when I am well ſtored my ſelf, yet I borrow to prevent lending, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I take upon truſt ſo much as ſhall ſerve this turn, it ſhall be no ſtain to my Credit; but rather deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſafe and wary way, to cut off occaſion of Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both at home and abroad: eſpecially if I take it up of ſuch Men, as are moſt famous and beſt beloved.

ſo well known and beloved in the World: But becauſe they be not, I will fly to the other ſide of <hi>Greece,</hi> and to the moſt renowned there, and beſt liked, <hi>Hippocrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom I doubt not to finde very free and willing in this Matter.

Now we know what <hi>Long Life</hi> is, and the Cauſe thereof, let us ſee whether all <hi>Men</hi> reach it or no; and then which way they may reach it.</p>

               <p>To be ſhort, both this, and that, and the third likewiſe, to wit, a cloſe fine Body and all, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be ſo that a <hi>Man</hi> in making is moſt far and finely mixt and broken, of all the lower <hi>Creatures,</hi> as we heard even now Decreed in the Councel of the beſt <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> For, if nought makes but <hi>Heat,</hi> then nought makes well but much <hi>Heat,</hi> if there be no other odds in <hi>Souls,</hi> as was ſaid above.

               <p>And this is natural Diſſolution, and Death of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> forcible Death and Deſtruction is by Diſeaſes, (to bar out other force, which no man can warrant) when either <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Meat,</hi> diſtemper'd in ſome quality, do feed and nouriſh ſome one their like beginning above the reſt, and make him ſtrong and able to vanquiſh them, and bring in the Jarre of that Muſical Conſent aforeſaid: As when by wateriſh <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> all the beginnings are changed into <hi>Water,</hi> the Hot and Dry, into a fiery temper, and ſo forth; or elſe when the Body wants the <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> which is owing and due unto him; which is quick <hi>Motion,</hi> to preſerve the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> in the fine frame and temper of <hi>Man,</hi> from the ſloth and idleneſs of the ſlow and ruſty <hi>Beginnings.</hi>

               <p>By which grounds laid, we ſee the way to uphold the temper of our <hi>Body,</hi> made plain and eaſie; No more but to feed and cheriſh it with clean and temperate <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Meat</hi> continually: that all the <hi>Beginnings</hi> ſerved and fed alike, one may not be more proud, ſtrong and able than another, to ſubdue the reſt, and overthrow the ſtate.

               <p>Then we ſee what the firſt <hi>Moiſture</hi> is, and how it excels the Food of the <hi>Body,</hi> and why it cannot be maintained by it, becauſe it is the moſt fine and aiery piece (for the reſt go every one his own way, to make his own part from whence he came) of all the <hi>Seed</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, wrought, purged, raiſed and refined, and then cloſely thickned, and driven up cloſe together, forty times more and above our <hi>Meat,</hi> which in one day is ended, and ready to be turned, and therefore unfit in any wiſe to increaſe and cleave to our firſt <hi>Moisture,</hi> the Food of <hi>Life,</hi> even as unmeet for all the world, as <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is to other <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Fatneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this, to come to the point, we have a plain Pattern (if we be Wiſe and Careful) and way to work the great Myſtery of <hi>Adjournment</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> for if it be ſo as I proved above, that all the Moiſture of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lieth in the maintenance of our <hi>Natural Heat;</hi> and it, as our <hi>Men,</hi> &amp; all <hi>Reaſon</hi> teacheth, followeth the ſteps of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118875:34"/>
common <hi>Fire,</hi> waxeth and waneth, is quick and faint, according to the ſtore of his <hi>Food</hi> and firſt <hi>Moiſture;</hi> then ſure if we can make an <hi>Oyl</hi> as fine and cloſe as this, nay in all points all one with this, it will eaſily mingle and joyn with our firſt <hi>Moiſture,</hi> and ſo feed, nouriſh and encreafe it, and <hi>Life</hi> withall; even in as good and plain Reaſon, as the ſame <hi>Oyl</hi> dropt in ſtill into the <hi>Fire,</hi> aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both Food and Flame together: yea, put caſe the ſame natural <hi>Fire</hi> of ours, ſhould not onely pair his ſtrength, for lack of <hi>Meat,</hi> and ſlack his force, but abate of bigneſs alſo, as ſome <hi>Phyſicians</hi> hold, yet there were no great hurt done; for this ſecond ſpark and ſlip of the great and common <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> being a piece of the finer part of the whole, (which is all one in all things) and fellow to his Like in us, when it is made free and looſe in this fine and <hi>Aethereal Medicine,</hi> would reſtore the Heap and mend the Matter.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we get the like fine <hi>Oyl</hi> and firſt <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture?</hi> the Matter is driven ſo far, that there is all the hardneſs. I ſhewed you the Pattern; even as <hi>Nature</hi> got the ſame before you, by the like <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>Seed,</hi> and by the like <hi>Heat</hi> and moving <hi>Workman:</hi> This by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof of all our <hi>Men</hi> is eaſie to be found, even any gentle, continual, equal, and moiſt, that is, any rotting Heat.

And this fault is not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but all by reaſon of the needleſs and hurtful Bowels in our Bodies, (as the <hi>Seedſman</hi> uſeth to ſow good and bad together) which being of the ſame kinde and quality with thoſe <hi>Humours,</hi> do hale and pull them ſtill unto them, (as all other parts and things do) for their food and nouriſhment: and ſo by the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118875:38"/>
to and fro, their greedineſs in pulling and holding, and a hundred ſuch like means, ſubject to great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances, have brought in as many miſchiefs; Whereas <hi>Nature,</hi> the great expeller of her <hi>Unlikes</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> if ſhe had her free choice and liberty, would otherwiſe with eaſe, and without hurt, expel thoſe <hi>Leavings,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo ſmall a number of the better ſort, in ſo clean a <hi>Diet.</hi> Nay, ſee the malice of thoſe Parts (thoſe Parts are <hi>Milt, Gall</hi> and <hi>Reins)</hi> if there be not ſufficient ſtore of other foul Meat at hand, like a poiſoned and purging <hi>Medicine,</hi> they uſe to draw good Juyces, and to make food of them.</p>

Wherefore to avoid the jarre and ill ſound of our often beating upon one thing, our <hi>Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> above declared, is it that feeds our hearts, that holdeth and perſerveth <hi>Youth;</hi> This is it, I ſay, that doth the deed, for many cauſes ſet down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I will ſend them that cannot come hither along the right way, back again to take all before them.</p>
               <p>But there is another thing, <hi>Motion,</hi> I mean, that helps to bear up the ſtate of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> which I ſcant touched there, and yet it ſhould be handled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe although it be not ſo needfull as the former, yet it cannot in any caſe be wanting: For as a Martiall Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, like unto <hi>Mars,</hi> (as we term it) and Valour it ſelf, loſeth his Glory and Brightneſſe in Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; So this <hi>Heat</hi> that rules our <hi>Body,</hi> though he be never ſo ſtrong and luſty, yet he cannot ſo ſoon reſt, as he decayes, and, as it were, ruſts with Idleneſſe: Nay, the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf, being (as I ſhewed above) an ayery and fiery temperature, muſt needs have quick <hi>Motion,</hi> as one of the two Pillars of his Eſtate; And therefore

               <p>Although, indeed, it be much harder not onely than his fellow, but then all the reſt that went before; yet we will not give it over now, and like an idle <hi>Poet, faint in the laſt Act of Life:</hi> wherefore let us go forward, and with all our endevour ſtrive to ſhew, that <hi>Youth</hi> long before loſt, though not eaſily, yet as well may

               <p>There be ſo many kindes of waxing <hi>Young</hi> again named in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and given to the nature of <hi>Wights,</hi> that it were good firſt to ſort them out, to ſay which we mean in this place, leſt our labour fall into their hands that can quickly miſtake. One of theſe wayes is by Name onely, and not in deed, as when the ſoft and bark-skinned <hi>Beaſts</hi> uſe by courſe of <hi>kinde,</hi> twice a year, at the Spring and Fall of the Leaf, to caſt off their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Coat and Skin, they ſay they put off <hi>Old Age,</hi> and wax <hi>Young</hi> again; when it is in truth, the putting on of <hi>Age</hi> rather, and decay of <hi>Nature,</hi> as appeareth to them that know the Cauſe, that even for very Cold and Drought, <note n="w" place="margin">

               <p>This is the ſecond way of waxing <hi>Young</hi> again, and as great an Extreme as that other, and as far from my meaning: Though there be divers Reports and Stories flown abroad, of <hi>Men</hi> that took the ſame race in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others, and found both good and bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, according (as a <hi>Man</hi> that favours it will think) as the Work was tended by them which were put in truſt. <hi>Medea</hi> ſped well, ſay they, in proof upon <hi>Jaſons</hi> father, and made him <hi>Young</hi> again, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, <hi>recoquendo;</hi>

But HERMES, and the <hi>Poet Virgil,</hi> and that <hi>Spaniſh Earl</hi> failed upon themſelves, as ſome hold, but as others hold, they had good luck, and came to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>What ſhould a <hi>Man</hi> ſay to this matter? Albeit I do not chuſe this kinde of Renewing, yet I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it without cauſe, and judge it for kinde impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for I ſee no Reaſon but that the Story of the <hi>Snake</hi> may be full eaſily true, becauſe it is bred by it ſelf, and of more unfit <hi>Stuff</hi> in the ſame manner; And for the reſt, all is one to <hi>Nature,</hi> if the <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> be meet and currant, having that her general <hi>Seed</hi> of begetting, (which I ſaid) was all one in all things, in her boſom ever ready, and thereby making yet (as we heard before) all ſeeded <hi>Plants</hi> without ſeed, ſomewhere; yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Wights,</hi> both Water and Land ones: And at firſt, when the <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>Womb,</hi> and her own <hi>Heat</hi> and all ſerved very fitly, having wrought <hi>Man</hi> and all, ſo.</p>
               <p>But now why is <hi>Seed</hi> given unto things?

ſhall ſwim out, at laſt quicken, and ariſe the ſame thing?

               </p>
               <p>After that the <hi>Five Wits</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> have thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and delivered up the Tidings to the threefold <hi>Glaſſe</hi> within the <hi>Brain,</hi> this by ſtirring and running up and down preſents and muſters them before the <hi>Minde,</hi> and ſhe by caſting her light and view, judgeth and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth. That we may eaſily gather two things needful to <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and good <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> firſt, ſuch a <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> or ſuch inward <hi>Spirits,</hi> as are able to receive and hold many ſhapes imprinted, that is, very clear, clean, and ſmooth <hi>Spirits,</hi> by the example of an <hi>Eye,</hi> that kindly Glaſs, or of an artificial one, which will eaſily take and ſhew, in that caſe, every little ſpot, ſhape, and faſhion ſet upon them; whereas, when they be dark,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118875:77"/>
foul, and uneven, they can take nothing, nor yet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them if they had them. Secondly, theſe <hi>Spirits</hi> had need be quick and lively, that is, hot, to be able by their ſwift running to and fro, to repreſent and ſhew them all apace, and eaſily, for the <hi>Minde</hi> doth all by matching and laying things together.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Heat</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>Quickneſs</hi> and ſtirring of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> appears in <hi>Sickneſs, Age,</hi> and <hi>ſound Sleep,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> more cleerly than needs any light of teaching. But how in <hi>Sleep?</hi> when the heat of the <hi>Spirits</hi> ſerving <hi>Wit,</hi> is either loaden with the clogging Fumes and Breaths of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> or ſpent either with Labour, or with Sweat, and ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding (for Reſt abates Heat, as I ever ſaid) or elſe lent for a time unto his fellow-ſervants, the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> for digeſtion ſake, then the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> be ſtill and quiet, and outward and inward <hi>Senſes, Wit,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> all ceaſe at once: But if the <hi>Meat</hi> (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the expence of <hi>Heat)</hi> was neither much, nor of an heavy and clogging kind, and ſo neither breathing out loading ſtuffe, nor needing forraign help to digeſt it, then our perceiving <hi>Spirits</hi> begin to take their own and Natural <hi>Heat</hi> again unto them, and to move a little before the <hi>Minde,</hi> whereby ſhe beholdeth ſome old ſhapes and ſhewes of things in their paſſing, which is called <hi>Dreaming.</hi> But in caſe they recover all that <hi>Heat,</hi> they beſtir themſelves apace, running to the out-ſide of the <hi>Body,</hi> and bringing back new tidings to the <hi>Minde,</hi> which when ſhe perceiveth, it is called <hi>Waking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the cauſe of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is clear at laſt, as we ſee, to wit, a clean and ſtirring Glaſs; and of <hi>Folly,</hi> when the ſame is foul and ſtill. If the Glaſſe be fouled all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118875:78"/>
over it cauſeth natural or willing <hi>folly,</hi> as in <hi>Fools, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and <hi>Drunkards:</hi> but if it be but here and there beſmeared and drawn, as it were, with dark ſtrokes and lines of foul humors, the ſhapes appear in the <hi>Minde</hi> even as the forms in a broken Glaſſe appear to the <hi>Eye,</hi> by halfs and confuſedly, and it maketh <hi>Madneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how came the <hi>Spirits</hi> of this inward Glaſs ſo foul and ſlow, when they are of themſelves (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Beams of an <hi>Heavenly Soul)</hi> both very clean, clear, quick, and lively? (But we need ſay no more but <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>foul</hi> alone, when theſe two qualities make or mar the whole work of perceiving; for if the <hi>Spirits</hi> be <hi>clear,</hi> it is a ſign they are in their own <hi>Nature,</hi> and ſo hot and quick withal; but if they be <hi>foul,</hi> it is a token their whole condition and property of <hi>Kinde</hi> is loſt and gone, and ſo, that ſtilneſs is come upon them alſo.) Neither is that <hi>aethereal</hi> thing, which is called by the name of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that carrieth the <hi>Soul</hi> and all his Beams down into the <hi>Body,</hi> and broketh (as I ſaid <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Supra pag.</hi> 32.</note> above) between them, foul or ſtill of it ſelf; (for <hi>Spirits</hi> are not, as ſome <hi>Leaches</hi> think, made of, but fed with the breaths of our <hi>Meat)</hi> but very fine, cleer and lively, as all <hi>Men</hi> grant of <hi>Aether.</hi> How then? Muſt it not needs follow, that all the cauſe of fail and want in this caſe ſpringeth from the <hi>Body,</hi> and from that part eſpecially where the <hi>Wits</hi> inhabit? If the naked Reaſon, brought in above, will not ſerve to content this matter, let us leade him forth clad with proof of Eye-ſight and Experiences, the plaineſt, greateſt, moſt filling and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Reaſon in the World.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Man</hi> alone doth paſſe all other <hi>Wights</hi> in <hi>Wit,</hi> for his Aiery and Fiery temper above them, as we heard

before; then if one <hi>Man</hi> goeth before another in <hi>Wit,</hi> it muſt needs follow from the ſame cauſe: Now, as <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> are cleer and quick, when <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are foul and ſlow, ſo are the <hi>Wights</hi> where they bear the ſway, affected both in <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> as appears in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Hart</hi> and the <hi>Toad,</hi> and all other wholſom and noiſom <hi>Wights.</hi> To go further, <note n="d" place="margin">Hipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>But how may this <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> be cured? All things in kind by the courſe of <hi>Kind,</hi> have both their higheſt and deepeſt pitch and end, and, as it were, their <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North</hi> turns, from whence they ſtill return and go back again, to avoid Infinity.

               <p>Then we ſee in this Matter how <hi>Nature</hi> inclines, and is ready to help her ſelf: and if <hi>Art</hi> would lend his hand, we may think the cure would be much more ſpeedy, and many parts of the time cut off and abated. And as we find in <hi>ſores</hi> and other lighter inward hurts, this done by ſlight means of ſlender <hi>Skill;</hi> ſo we may deem that by more mighty means, more great and mighty

               <p>But let us go further: If a good and fine <hi>Temper,</hi> through ill <hi>Diet,</hi> and paſſions of the <hi>Soul,</hi> hath often fallen from a good <hi>Wit,</hi> to a kind of <hi>Madneſs,</hi> ſcarce to be deſcried from the ſtate of an <hi>Ideot:</hi> then ſure through the contrary cauſe, a foul frame may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and riſe to <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by as good reaſon, as the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> hath any, eſpecially if thoſe contrary <hi>Paſsions</hi> and <hi>Diet</hi> be holpen and ſet forward by meet <hi>Medicines,</hi> which the <hi>Graecians</hi> know and teach, and wherewith they make great changes in <hi>Mens</hi> Bodies; But without all doubt and queſtion, if that our moſt fine, clear, and hot <hi>Aegyptian Cure-all</hi> came in place to help the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

than to be gone and travelled by the lovers of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Virtue;</hi> Wherefore, I would not wiſh them to arrive their counſels in any of thoſe places, but to ſeek to the Haven of HERMES, and of his <hi>ſons</hi> the wiſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> as to the onely one, ready, and eaſie way to all BLISSE and HAPPINESS.—Then we are come at laſt, to that which was the firſt intent and meaning of all this labour, that HERMES and the PHILOSOPHERS STONE and MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE is the true and ready way to BLISSE.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we prove this, unleſs we unlock the door of <hi>Secrets,</hi> and let in Light to theſe matters, which have been ever moſt cloſely kept, and hid in darkneſs?

               <p>For firſt, when his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> is much more great and mighty, and his <hi>Body</hi> a more fine and faſt <hi>Oil,</hi> that is, a more like and laſting Food of <hi>Life,</hi> it both upholdeth and ſtrengtheneth <hi>Life</hi> and Natural <hi>Heat</hi> the better, and ſo proves the better cauſe of <hi>Long Life</hi> and <hi>Youth:</hi> Then being more temperate, and that quality carried upon a finer and tougher, that is, a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Body,</hi> it is able with more eaſe and ſpeed to ſubdue his and our Enemies, the diſtempered <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and to cleanſe and clear, faſhion, and bring into good order and temper, the whole frame of our <hi>Body,</hi> and ſo procure <hi>Health, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> in better ſort, and in more full and heaped meaſure: for you muſt not think that a

               </head>
               <p>BUt how ſhall our <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> be able to ſubdue and turn ſo much of baſe <hi>Mettals</hi> with ſo little charge and travel, and ſo great return and gain as we have promiſed. It is for three cauſes: Firſt, for the <hi>fitneſs</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi> of the <hi>ſtuffe</hi> to be changed; and then for the great ſtore and ſtrength of the <hi>changing work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> (to ſend away the lighteſt ſtill firſt and foremoſt:) And laſtly, for his <hi>encreaſe</hi> in <hi>ſtore</hi> and <hi>quantity,</hi> which may be made either by ſowing or nouriſhing the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> without end and number, for <hi>ſowing</hi> firſt.</p>
               <p>There be ſundry ſorts of <hi>ſowing</hi> and making this our <hi>Medicine:</hi> One is an excellent way, but a bare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and lone way; becauſe if <hi>Gold</hi> can be made open and fit to be wrought, as behoves a <hi>ſeed</hi> within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the leſs contagion there is of unclean ſtuffe, the more excellent and mighty will he riſe again. This way, by deep and painful <hi>Wits</hi> hath been ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but very ſeldom, becauſe it is very hard, long, and irkſome, and therefore we will leave it alſo: but chiefly becauſe it croſſeth my purpoſe aboveſaid; for if he be ſowen alone, he cannot riſe encreaſed, whereas we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to augment his heap and quantity. Then there are two kindes of <hi>Grounds,</hi> and yet both one kinde,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118875:100"/>
which we may put unto him to corrupt him eaſily, and raiſe him again with encreaſe in quantity. One near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his <hi>Nature</hi> then another, one better then another; ſo much is enough for that. Now for the ſtore of ground fit to be laid about him, there is a choice better or worſe alſo: But that is no great matter, ſo you keep the meaſure and diſcretion which a common <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Then, if the <hi>ſtuff</hi> be ſo fit, let us ſee what the <hi>Worker</hi> is, not in ſtore which is done already, but in force and power. His <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is ſeen in two things, <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>colouring;</hi> for firſt he muſt mightily ſhew himſelf in purging and driving out all the groſs greaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>ſtuffe,</hi> and then when all is fine, clear, and cloſe, he ought to ſtretch himſelf at large, and to ſpread far forth in <hi>colour</hi> upon it; for albeit long and gentle purging by Concoction, of it ſelf, breeds and brings good colour, yet this our ſhort and violent <hi>heat</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118875:102"/>
doth not ſo, (as I ſhewed above in the diſcourſe of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>colouring)</hi> but muſt needes bring <hi>Colour</hi> with him already Coyned.</p>
               <p>So that when he purgeth the <hi>ſtuff</hi> under-hand, he draweth not out the foul and groſs <hi>ſtuff,</hi> and departs away from the work withal, as the foul purging <hi>Binders</hi> did; but being a clean and fine thing like the Nature of a <hi>Wight,</hi> he purgeth by <hi>Digestion</hi> and <hi>Expulſion,</hi> driving out the foul and unlike parts as <hi>Leavings,</hi> taking and imbodying with himſelf the fine and clean for her <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Nouriſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then let us ſee how this work of <hi>Purging</hi> is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that is all; and the <hi>Colour</hi> hangeth upon the ſame, and is done all under one, as we ſhall hear in the going out of this Treatiſe: If nothing purgeth but <hi>Heat</hi> through concoction, and this is ever to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured according to the need &amp; behoof of the <hi>Work</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand; and we muſt ſcour an hundred times as much <hi>ſtuff</hi> in one, or two, or three hours ſpace at moſt, (for that is their task) when we had need of a marvellous fiery <hi>Medicine</hi> (beſides the great outward <hi>Heat</hi> to prick him forward) ſcarce to be-found within the compaſs of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> It muſt ſhew it ſelf an hundred times fiercer then a <hi>Binder,</hi> which was ſcant able in longer <hi>time,</hi> and ſtronger <hi>heat,</hi> to ſcoure and purge one part, and as much of the ſame <hi>ſtuff.</hi>

forcibly then the extremely diſtempered, cold and dry <hi>Poyſons</hi> can work alone, and as faſt and faſter then they devour and deſtroy temporate <hi>bodies,</hi> theſe do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the contrary: Then what a <hi>Fire</hi> he is I ſhewed before, how full ſtuft with <hi>Heavenly ſpirits</hi> above all things, and ſo he is a <hi>Heavenly fire,</hi> which is much more effectual in power, and mightier in action then that other, by reaſon of his exceeding ſubtileneſs, able to pierce through <hi>Rocks</hi> and all things, where that other ſhall quickly ſtay.</p>
               <p>Admit it, ſay you, if that <hi>Heavenly fire</hi> were quick, free, and at full liberty: But it is faſt bound up in a hard <hi>Body;</hi> Then I will tell you all the Reaſon, bend your <hi>Wits</hi> unto it.<hi>—Gold,</hi> at firſt was full fraughted with the moſt piercing <hi>fire</hi> in the World; <hi>Art</hi> then came and wrought it into a moſt fine flowing <hi>Oyl,</hi> and ſo unbound it, and ſet it at full liberty; Not ſo freely indeed as in <hi>Heaven,</hi> but as can be an <hi>Earthly body,</hi> cloſely crowded up together, (which helps <hi>Heat,</hi> as we hear in a <hi>burning-glaſs)</hi> upon a moſt ſtrange and mighty <hi>Body,</hi> far above all things in the world; and laſtly, with a violent outward <hi>Fire,</hi> ſhe ſent all theſe a part away to work together. Judge then, you that have Judgement, whether it were not like to beſtir it ſelf, as luſtily as the <hi>Lightning?</hi> Compare; The <hi>Heat</hi> of the hot <hi>ſpirits</hi> is as great; and if it were not, yet their paſſing <hi>ſubtileneſs,</hi> would requite that matter eaſily, and make him even; yea and perhaps, when they be drawn and carried up cloſe together, make ſome odds and difference between them; But ſure the exceeding toughneſs of the <hi>Body</hi> (as we ſee in <hi>Iron</hi> &amp; the reſt) aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his <hi>heat</hi> greatly, and carrieth him far beyond it.</p>
