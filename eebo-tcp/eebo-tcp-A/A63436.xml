            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

becauſe that Cavaliers had very cunningly
ſent a report to thoſe tenne Troops, pretending
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35168:3"/>
that it came from the Lord Generall, the Earle
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that his Excellencie was within a mile
of the other ſide of the Towne, and would fall

               </gap>
which was a plot and a meere invention of the
Cavaleers, for thoſe ten troops to fall on, where
by they with all their Forces intended to cut of
theſe ten troops: His Excellencies Army being at
that time (which the Cevaleers knew very well)
five myles diſtant from WORCESTER, and had
marcht exceeding hard that day to come ſo nere,
for had our army been then within a myle of the
towne, we had taken all the Cavaleers.</p>
            <p>But to give a perfect and true relation of this
Fight, and what Commanders we loſt, I ſhall
give you a perticualr of their names, which I had

<hi>Burrell,</hi> Captaine <hi>Heale,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Fynes</hi>
were alſo in this Skirmiſh, but are come off well
with the loſſe onely of ſome troopers. As for
the number of our Common Horſe or troopers,
which were that Evening ſlaine, J cannot heare
bnt of twenty three and for the Cavaleers, it is
credibly reported, that they loſt ſome Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
for they wer ſeene to carry away foure dead
Corps, and it is reported for certaine, that Prince
<hi>Maurice</hi> brother to Prince <hi>Robert</hi> was dangerously

having encompaſſed our men. as it were in a

their whole body, and forct their paſſage, onely

ſo made their retreat good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35168:4"/>
And then the Cavaliers marched into the Towne,
and about twelve of the Clocke at night, ranne
quite away, and are gone to <hi>LUDLOVV,</hi>
not daring to ſtay the comming of our Army the

the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Army being

by the Breake of Day.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the whole Army gave a gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Commanders encouraging the Souldiers,
And the Souldiers Vowing to follow their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
Although a Report came into our
Campe, that Prince <hi>Robert</hi> would give us Battell
the next Morning, which was but a bravado of
theirs,</p>
            <p>Yet our men were no whit danted, but rather
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35168:4"/>
Encouraged and ſtronger in their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>And then every regiment returning to their
quarters, and paſſing on their Duty wiſhing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
minute the morning Starre to appeare.</p>
            <p>But before the time appointed for our Army
to march, we were prevented of our long hoped
wiſhes, by reaſon of a Petition which was ſent
from the Major, and Aldermen, of the City of
<hi>VVORCESTER,</hi> (by one Maſter <hi>Ray,</hi>
one of the Captaines of the Trained Bands of
<hi>VVORCESTER)</hi> to our Generall the
Earle of <hi>ESSEX,</hi> certifying him that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
were all gone out of <hi>VVORCESTER,</hi> at
twelve of that night, deſiring alſo in their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Earle would not be offended with
the Towne, for what they did was meerely through
compulſion, and feare of the Cavaliers, who had
done the Towne great injuries, as likewiſe moſt
places whereſoever they came.</p>
            <p>Thereupon our Generall taking into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
their Petition, committed the bearer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Ray</hi> to the cuſtody of one Capraine <hi>Mathews</hi>
a Captaine of his owne Regiment, till his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35168:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be further ſatisfied concerning the
truth of this Petition, leaſt it had, or might be
ſome plot to enſnare the Army, but within an
houre after we found Maſter <hi>Rayes</hi> Relation, and
the Petition to be very true, and ſo we marched
peaceably into <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where as yet we remain
untill we heare from his Majeſty: His Excellence
our Generall having ſent a Poſt with ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to deſire his Majeſty to returne to his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

J ſhall take the boldneſſe to preſent my ſervice.</p>
