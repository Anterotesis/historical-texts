            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note> IT's a hard Shift the present Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> among us, are brought to, that when other helps fail them, they take up with such a sort of Arguments, which how useful soever they may prove to make some men of Their Religion, have a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tendency to make others of None.</p>
            <p>Certainly were these persons as much concerned for the Truth of Christianity, as they are for their own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of it; or could defend those Corruptions in a better way, they would not put the case upon this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62487:4"/>
and had they the Scripture as much for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Supremacy and Infallibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is for its own sufficiency, the Trinity and Incarnation of our Blessed Saviour, we should have heard more of their Proofs from Scripture, than of <hi>Requests</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi> (the great Patron it seems of these Points) to prove from Scripture the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Incarnation.</p>
            <p>These Articles of the Christian Faith are an Argument worthy of a serious Consideration, if proposed by one that really needs, as well as he pretends to desire, Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But to have a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as our Author apparently is) personating an <hi>Arrian</hi> and other Hereticks, and in the face of the World re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Scripture-proof for those above-said Points of Catholick Doctrine: To have this thrust upon us afresh after the unrefuted Answers given to the First <hi>Request,</hi> the <hi>Catholick Dialogue,</hi> and the <hi>Plea for a Socinian,</hi> is no good sign, whatever he pretends, <hi>of one sincerely desirous of finding out the Truth</hi>; nor would it be worth the while to take up the Cause anew for his sake, who I am sensible is not to be satisfied in this way, were it not for some better End it may be useful to.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Address</hi> consists of several Proposals; which thus begin:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Address.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>There can be no doubt, but that the main Concern of Man in this Vale of Tears, is the Salvation of his Soul. If this be lost, he loses all; if this be gained, he gains all, and both for an Eternity. No body then can blame me, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solicitous to save my Soul, I have recourse to those, whose Learning must needs enable them, and whose Charity cannot but incline them to instruct me in this weighty Affair.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62487:4"/>
I therefore humbly beseech you, most Reverend and Learned Doctors of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to afford me a clear and satisfactory Solution of these following Doubts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>I desire to know, Whether all things necessary to Salvation are contained in Scripture? If not, where must I seek them? If they be, then they are either clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, so that there is no need of an Interpreter for the meaning of the words; or not. If there be no need of any such Interpreter, then I humbly ask what these Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to Salvation are, and in what Chapter and Verse of Scripture each of them may be found. For example; Is the belief of a Trinity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>For the clearer understanding of the whole, I shall divide it into several Questions.</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether all things necessary to Salvation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If there are things necessary to Salvation that are not contained in Scripture, the World is, for ought I see, at a great loss <hi>where to seek them:</hi> For nothing can be necessary to Salvation, which was not necessary in the Primitive, and will be so to all succeeding Ages. But where to find those things thus necessary, out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that have been of a date and Authority equal to it, I know none that have attempted the discovery: Nor could we ever yet be favoured with an account of <hi>what these Necessaries are, and where each of them may be found.</hi> So that Scripture must contain these Necessary things, or else we are left without any means of knowing them. And the Scripture must fail of its end, and we of the Salvation therein revealed, if that be not as sufficient in its kind to beget Faith in us, as Faith is to save us. For faith St. <hi>John</hi> 20.31. <hi>These things are written that ye
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62487:5"/>
might believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name.</hi> Nay, we are as much assured of this, as we are of its Divine Authority; for the same Apostle that saith, <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by Inspiration of God,</hi> doth immediately before as positively affirm, that <hi>the Scriptures are able to make us wise unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p>From which Consideration it was, that all doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Salvation were hereby to be resolved; which could not be, were not all things necessary to Salvation contained in it. So when that Question was put to our Saviour, <hi>Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> He answered, <hi>What is written in the Law? How readest thou? Thou knowest the Commandments,</hi> Luke 10.25, 26. Mark 10.17, 19. And that they had <hi>Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> was in his estimation sufficient to dispose them to Repent, without any other Revelation than was therein contained, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Till it can therefore be shewn, that the Scripture was not written to <hi>make</hi> men <hi>wise unto salvation</hi>; or that men might be wise to Salvation without knowing the things necessary to it: Till it can be proved that the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was not a Rule of Faith and Manners to the <hi>Jews</hi> in all points necessary to their Salvation; Or that both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Testament</hi> have not the same end, or not the same sufficiency to that End now to the Christian, as the <hi>Old Testament</hi> alone had to the Jewish Church; we have no reason to think the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in any thing necessary to Salvation, or that there is any other means provided by God to supply its deficiency therein.</p>
            <p>And in this Doctrine we are not alone, but have the concurrence of the most Authentick Writers of the Christian Church; of which sort in particular is that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62487:5"/>
memorable saying of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Doctr. Christ. l. 2. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>All things which concern Faith and Manners of Life, are found in those things which are plainly contained in Scripture.</hi> A Truth that the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their soberer thoughts do often acknowledg. So <hi>Antoninus</hi> A. B. of <hi>Florence, God,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath spoken but once,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sum. Part 3. Tit. 18. c. 3. ff. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and that in the Holy Scripture, and that so fully as to meet with all temptations, and all cases that may fall out, and all good works; that, as</hi> Gregory <hi>expounds it, he needs speak no more to us concerning any Necessary matter, seeing all things are found in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Whether all things necessary to Salvation are clearly contained in Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was, we have seen, the Opinion of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that not only all things thus necessary are contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but also that they are <hi>plainly</hi> therein contained. And yet neither that Father nor any of the same mind with him (as who was not then, and who is not now, except the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>) did ever thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all these Necessaries are expresly contained in Scripture, since an evident Consequence is equivalent to a plain and express Proposition; as it was <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.31, 32. Nor 2. do they understand by being <hi>clearly contained in Scripture,</hi> that all persons may <hi>immediately</hi> learn all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, by the <hi>meer reading</hi> of it (as our Author puts the Case) without the use of those means for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it, that God has appointed, and the nature of the thing requires; such as attention, consideration, and the assistance of Teaching Guides. For the plainness or clearness of the things to be learned and understood, and an Instructor to lead us to or help us in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, are not only consistent, but generally to be supposed. It's a good saying of one upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62487:6"/>
               <hi>That is not obscure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>White's</hi> Way to the true Church. Sect. 8. N. 2.</note> 
               <hi>which by ordinary means may be apprehended; but that is so which either hath no means at all to open it, or hath such as are not ordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither 3. can it be supposed that the Scriptures do so <hi>clearly</hi> contain all things necessary, as that nothing of that kind ever was, or can be excepted against; For they may be plain, and yet for some prevalent reasons it may not be confessed. They may again be plain, and yet not be understood to be so from several Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this proceeds from a natural Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, as it is in Children, and such as are of a very weak capacity. And yet even to such St. <hi>Austin</hi> supposes them to be intelligible,<note place="margin">Enarrat. in ps. 8.</note> 
               <hi>God having bowed down the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the capacity of Babes and Sucklings, that when proud men will not speak to their capacity, he himself might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes from moral Impediments, such as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and prepossessions, as it was with the Apostles who understood not our Saviour when he told them openly and plainly, again and again, that he <hi>must be killed,</hi> Mark 8.31, 32. 9.31, 32. Such again are vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as Pride and the Love of the World, Interest and Obstinacy, into which our Saviour resolved the <hi>Jews</hi> Infidelity, <hi>John</hi> 5.40, 44. Such are Partiality, Negligence, Sloth and Inconsideration.</p>
            <p>There are also Judicial Impediments, when for their contempt and obstinacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God sends men <hi>strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, that they should believe a lye,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.10, 11.</p>
            <p>But now where those and the like Impediments are not, but that men <hi>lay aside all malice, and all guile and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy, and as new born babes,</hi> in the Apostles Phrase, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the sincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. that they come with an honest heart, and use
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62487:6"/>
a competent diligence, with a Dependance upon God's assistance for the <hi>Wisdom</hi> he hath promised, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing necessary to Salvation (unless what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made so) but what is plainly taught in Scripture, and may be learn'd from it. But without this temper the plainest and most express words, and the necessary meaning of those words will not convince some men.</p>
            <p>As for Example, what more plain, than that in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> 20. there is a 2<hi>d</hi> Commandment distinct from the First? What more plain, than <hi>thou shalt not make to thee any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing, to bow down before it, or worship it?</hi> What more plain, than <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> Matth. 26.27. What more plain, than that Prayer is not to be in an <hi>Vnknown Tongue?</hi> 1 Cor. 14. Lastly, what more clear, than that <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make us wise unto Salvation?</hi> And yet we know where these things will not be confess'd. The Truth is, that as long as there are Prejudices and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and depraved Affections in mankind, Truth will be obscure: And <hi>the things that are easy,</hi>

            <p>I shall sum up what I have said in the words of St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who thus delivers himself upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>The Scriptures are easy to understand,</hi>

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What are these Necessaries to Salvation</hi>?</p>
            <p>Our Author offers Three Instances of such Necessaries as are not clearly revealed in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> The Trinity, the Incarnation of our Saviour, and the observation of the Lord's Day.</p>
            <p>Of the first of these he thus discourses.</p>

               <hi>For Example; Is the Belief of a</hi> Trinity, <hi>One God and Three Persons, necessary to Salvation? If it be, as the Creed of S.</hi> Athanasius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>assures us it is, in what Chapter and Verse of Scripture is it clearly expressed? If you send me to the</hi> 1 <hi>Epist. of S.</hi> John, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>where we read,</hi> There are Three who give Testimony in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and Holy Ghost, and these Three are One; <hi>or to the Gospel of S.</hi> John, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Ver.</hi> 50. I and my Father are One; <hi>I desire you to shew clearly out of Scripture, that the word</hi> One <hi>here signifies a strict Identity or Vnity of Substance, as the Church of</hi> England <hi>holds; not a meer Moral Vnion, as many Learned</hi> Arrians <hi>and others will have it, and as we all confess the same word signifies in S.</hi> John, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>where our Lord Prays that all Believers may be</hi> One, <hi>as he and his Father

are</hi> One; <hi>where certainly he cannot be supposed to mean</hi> One <hi>in Substance.

John'<hi>s Gospel, signifies a strict Identity; which notwithstanding I conceive ought to be, if all Necessaries to Salvation be clearly contained in Scripture. Now if the Belief of a</hi> Trinity <hi>be not necessary to Salvation, I desire it may be clearly owned in these or the like words:</hi> 'Tis not necessary for Salvation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Three Persons and one God, notwithstanding the Creed of S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and Definition of the first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> when the Church was in her Purity, not the least corrupted.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>The sum of our Author's Argument is this, That the Doctrine of the Trinity is not clearly contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because Unity in some places signifies not a Unity of Essence, but of Will; which way of arguing supposes that if a word be taken in two or more different senses, then the Scripture doth not clearly contain the things contained in those words.</p>
            <p>As for Example; the word, <hi>Door,</hi> is sometimes taken in Scripture in a proper sense, sometimes in a Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and being thus differently taken, we cannot accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, certainly know when it is to be understood Properly, and when Metaphorically; and must be at a perfect loss to understand, whether when our Saviour is called a <hi>Door, John</hi> 10.7. it's not meant properly; and when St. <hi>Peter</hi> is said to stand at the <hi>Door, John</hi> 18.16. it's not meant Metaphorically. Or to come nearer to our Author, the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> is sometimes taken for a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, sometimes for a Mystical Body; and therefore we cannot be certainly assured, whether when <hi>Joseph</hi> begg'd the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus, it's not to be understood of the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62487:8"/>
Body; and that when the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were <hi>given for the edifying the Body of Christ,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12. it's not to be understood of Christ's Natural Body.</p>
            <p>In this so difficult a case, <hi>which is absolutely necessary to be answer'd for the salvation of his Soul,</hi> p. 4. (if you will believe the Addresser) What is to be done? What in reason will content him? It's nothing less than this, That it be shewn, that in some <hi>Verse and Chapter in Scripture, we have these or the like words,—The Word</hi> One <hi>in St.</hi> John'<hi>s Epistle, signifies a strict Identity:</hi> And he might have gone on without end in the same way; and one as obstinate as himself, may say, Shew me some other Chapter and Verse, wherein it is said, that the word <hi>Door, John</hi> 10. is to be understood Metaphorically, and the word <hi>Body, Ephes.</hi> 4. is to be understood Mystically; or else it is apparent that we cannot know what <hi>Door,</hi> Proper or Metaphorical; or what <hi>Body,</hi> whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Mystical, is meant in those places; for, <hi>This ought to be, if these things are clearly contained in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Thought, for ought I know, peculiar to our Author, (for I don't find this <hi>Address</hi> comes out with other <hi>Allowance,</hi> than <hi>Printed for R. Taylor</hi>); and as I do not envy him the Glory of the Invention, so I shall leave him the satisfaction of self-enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Indeed his Friends the <hi>Learned Arrians</hi> went not his way in opposing the Trinity, nor the Orthodox in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it; and therefore if this Point was now to be argued, the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that hold with the Orthodox, and amongst other places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this of 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. for it, would say, that it's as plainly said, The Father, Word, and Holy Ghost are <hi>One,</hi> as that they are <hi>Three</hi>; and that tho Unity is sometimes taken in a Moral sense, as <hi>John</hi> 17.21. yet the arguing of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62487:8"/>
St. <hi>John</hi> in the former place, shews it not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the same sense as the latter; he making a plain difference betwixt the Unity that is betwixt the <hi>Three that bear record in Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Three that bear witness in Earth</hi>; for of the <hi>Three</hi> that bear Record in Heaven, it's said, <hi>They are one</hi>; but of the <hi>Three</hi> that bear witness on Earth, it's said, <hi>They agree in One.</hi> Now if it had been a mere Moral Union that was betwixt the Father, Word, and Holy Ghost (who are the <hi>Three in Heaven</hi>) it would have been as well said of them, as of the Spirit, the Water and the Blood (which are <hi>the Three in Earth</hi>) that they <hi>Agree in One.</hi> In like manner would the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> support the proof of this Article from <hi>John</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are One,</hi> and shew that it's to be understood of the Unity of Essence, and not of mere Will and Consent; because <hi>the Jews took up stones to stone him for blasphemy, and because that thou being a man, makest thy self God.</hi> But since there is a Union that may be betwixt God and Man without making man to be God, as it is <hi>John</hi> 17.21. it follows that neither did our Saviour speak, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> understand him to have spoken of a Moral, but a Natural Union; but for this let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the <hi>Addresser</hi> to the Second Part of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation compared,</hi> p. 10, 11. and Published the last Year.</p>

               <hi>Again, Is the Belief of the</hi> Incarnation <hi>necessary for Salvation? Where is it clearly expressed in Scripture? You refer me to</hi> S. John, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. The Word is made Flesh. <hi>But you know that many Learned Men,</hi> Nestorius <hi>and others,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62487:9"/>
denied that word to signifie a strict Incarnation, but either a Moral Vnion, or a meer external appearance of a Man, as those who held Christ not to have a real but a phantastick Body. Now be pleased to shew me in what Verse or Chapter it is clearly expressed, that the said words signifie a strict Incarnation? But if you deny the belief of this Mystery to be necessary to Salvation, own it, for our satisfaction, in these or the like words:</hi> It is not necessary for Salvation to believe, that the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity was made true Man. <hi>And if the Belief of neither</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>nor</hi> Incarnation <hi>are necessary, shew me what 'tis, and where expressed in Scripture.</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>Setting aside what the Opinion of <hi>Nestorius</hi> was (which our Author for ought I perceive understands not) the sum of what is said, amounts to this, That the Scripture is not clear in this Point; because, as he saith, <hi>Many learned Men,</hi> Nestorius <hi>and others, deny that word</hi> [he means that phrase] <hi>to signifie strict Incarnation.</hi> So that if a learned Man, or learned Men dispute the Point, that Point so disputed, or the words expressing it, cannot be clear, or the Sense certain. But I have before shewed that this is no reason against the perspicuity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in such a case, because nothing can be clearer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd than many of those things which are sometimes made matter of Disputation.</p>
            <p>As what can be clearer, than that Christ had a Body <hi>of Flesh and Bones?</hi> Yet there were some of our Authors <hi>Learned men,</hi> that held Christ was <hi>a meer external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a man; and not to have a real, but a phantastic Body.</hi> And the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>denial</hi> of his <hi>learned Men,</hi> do yet maintain the Incarnation of our blessed Saviour to be evidently delivered in the words, <hi>The word was</hi> (not <hi>is,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62487:9"/>
as he mistakes) <hi>made Flesh.</hi> For who was the <hi>Word,</hi> but he that is called <hi>God, ver.</hi> 1. that made all things? <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And what was <hi>his being made Flesh,</hi> but his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>made of</hi> the Seed of <hi>David? Rom.</hi> 1.3. And how was he made Flesh, but by being united to it, and becoming Man? Now if the Word, that was God, was the Word and not Man, before he was made Flesh; and when he was made Flesh, did not cease to be the Word, then there must be in him two Natures united, which is the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>His 3<hi>d</hi> Instance is, as he saith, <hi>in order to Practice,</hi> and the Query upon it, is,</p>

               <note place="margin">Address.</note>
               <hi>Then in order to Practice, I desire to know, whether it be necessary to Salvation, to keep holy the</hi> Lord's-Day, <hi>that is,</hi> Sunday <hi>and not</hi> Saturday. <hi>If it be, I desire to know in what Chapter and Verse it is clearly contained in Scripture; as also where the Abrogation of the</hi> Saturday <hi>is clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed? If it be not necessary for Salvation to keep holy the</hi> Lord's-Day, <hi>I desire your warrant for it in these or the like terms:</hi> It is not necessary to keep holy the Lord's-Day, that is, Sunday.</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>To this I answer, That the obligation to observe <hi>the Lord's-Day</hi> is more or less necessary or unnecessary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Institution of it; for such as the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, such is the Obligation. If it be of mere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Ecclesiastical institution, it may by the same Authority be altered as it was established: If of Divine Institution, it's not subject to humane arbitration. And if it be of Divine Institution, we must have it by the Revelation in Scripture, or else it cannot be Divine. And that it's established upon such Authority, I shall offer these considerations:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62487:10"/>
1. There is as much in the Reason of the thing for this peculiar Day to be observed in the Christian Church, as there was for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Church; for what the Moral <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to Man upon his Creation, and the Ceremonial <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Deut. 5.15. that is the <hi>First Day of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Week,</hi> or the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> to Christians, upon our Redemption by Christ, which was accomplished and testified in his Resurrection on that Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the Mark of Divine Institution set upon it, when that which was otherwise called <hi>the first Day of the week,</hi> was afterwards called <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> Rev. 1.10. It being usual in Scripture after that Times, Places, Things, and Persons were set apart for the Service of God by Divine Institution, to have his Name as a Mark of Propriety given to them: Thus we read of <hi>the Lord's Passover,</hi> Exod. 12.11. <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 20.10. <hi>The Temple of the Lord. The Lord's S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.20.</p>
            <p>Now I know not what Reason can be assigned, that when the Things thus dignified by this Title, are else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where of Divine Institution, and so named because of that Institution; that this Day should be called the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and not be of Divine, but Humane Institution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may observe further, That as the New World of Redemption began upon that Day, so upon the same Day did Christ solemnly consecrate the Christian Church by the Descent of the Holy-Ghost upon the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, 2. (as of old, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church was by a Cloud or Divine Appearance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11.) which they had the Promise of, and until which, they were not to depart from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to enter upon the work of gathering a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62487:10"/>
4. It was the Day which the Primitive Christians in the Apostolical times held their stated Assemblies upon for Divine Worship; as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.</p>
            <p>This may suffice for the first branch of his Query, <hi>I desire to know in what Chapter and Verse it is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next is, <hi>Where the Abrogation of the</hi> Saturday [he means the Sabbath] <hi>is clearly expressed?</hi> I may answer him, it's <hi>in</hi> the same <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi> where <hi>the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of</hi> Circumcision <hi>is clearly expressed.</hi> And when he can find out <hi>Chapter and Verse for</hi> the one, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to shew him <hi>Chapter and Verse</hi> for the other. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was no need of an express <hi>Abrogation</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; For Baptism being instituted by Christ as a means of Initiation into his Church; Circumcision that was the old way of admission, must fall in course, because the one was inconsistent with the other. So <hi>the Lord's Day</hi> being set a-part for the publick and solemn Worship of God in the Christian Church, the Sabbath that was before appointed for it, must in reason surrender to it. So the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Let no man judge you in meat, or drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of new-moons, or of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sabbath [days] which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</hi> Where the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tho in the plural, signifies the Seventh day, or Jewish Sabbath, as it doth <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.10, 12. and for the most part in the <hi>New-Testament:</hi> And which being <hi>a shadow,</hi> as well as <hi>Meats and Drinks, Holy-days</hi> and <hi>New-Moons,</hi> was with those, and for the same reasons, to cease by the coming of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Institution of Baptism abrogated Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and <hi>the Lord's Day</hi> abrogated <hi>the Sabbath</hi>; so we may certainly infer, that if the Sabbath was <hi>a shadow,</hi> and abrogated as such (which the Apostle here
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62487:11"/>
asserts) that there was some other day instituted in the place of it; (these things mutually inferring each other) and what that day is, I may leave to our Author's guess, without again going to <hi>Chapter and Verse.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Q. 4. Address.</note>
               <hi>If you say that everyone is only bound to believe what is clear to him in Scripture, reading it with Sincerity and Humility; then I must desire to know, What if I, reading Scripture</hi> Sincerely <hi>and with</hi> Humility, <hi>cannot find clearly expressed either the</hi> Trinity <hi>or</hi> Incarnation? <hi>will it not be necessary for the Salvation of my Soul to believe these two Mysteries?</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> do imply the due use of all the means a person hath in possession, for the finding out the Truth; such as diligent reading the Word of God, Prayers, and Consultation with such as are most able and fit to assist him: And where this temper is, and this course is taken, there will never be wanting what is necessary. <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. No man can believe but according to the motives of credibility, and the reasons he hath for his Faith. An obligation lies upon all to believe all things necessary to Salvation; but that is when they are proposed: and according to the Evidence, so we are to believe, and so only we can. And yet we do not say as this Writer words it, That <hi>Every one is only Bound to believe what is clear to him in Scripture.</hi> For the Obligation to believe, doth not depend upon his Understanding, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Revelation; his want of understanding may be taken as an excuse for his want of Faith, but doth not diminish his obligation to believe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62487:11"/>
3. No man shall answer for what he had not a power to do; and if he wants the Means, or fails of the End in a due use of those Means, it shall not be imputed to him, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin.</hi> I do not question, but as he that is truly sincere would believe if he was able, and could see into the strength of evidence for it, so that this ingenuous disposition of mind will be a reason for Almighty God to give him that Faith which is necessary, or to pardon the want of it; and if I was to chuse, I had rather be sincere and err in a Matter of Faith, than believe upon the full Conviction of the Truth, and yet not be sincere in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofession of it; being sensible that what is invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary is a less sin than what is voluntary; and that I shall suffer less for a fault in my Understanding, which I could not help, than for a fault in my Will, which I might. Therefore let a person first learn <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and <hi>read the Scripture sincerely and with Humility,</hi> and then he will be sure to find all Truths necessary to Salvation, so clearly and sufficiently expressed therein, that he will be thereby convinced of it; or if he fail in it, he may be sure his <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> will do more through the Grace and Mercy of God in Christ to save him, than the want of a Belief of some things otherwise necessary, can do to damn him.</p>

               <hi>But you tell me, That Necessaries to Salvation are either clear in Scripture, or evidently deduced out of Scripture. Very well.

               </note>What he here saith concerning <hi>Church-Guides,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> from Scripture, has been before in good part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and shall have a farther Reply. But I cannot but observe, before I proceed, how our Author doth all along rather design to amuse his Reader, than to come to the Point; of which there is not a Paragraph, but is an Evidence. As for Instance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He thus argues, <hi>If all things necessary to Salvation are contained in Scripture, then they are either clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, so that there is no need of an Interpreter for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62487:12"/>
the meaning of the words, or not,</hi> p. 1. Now he cannot but know, that <hi>an Interpreter for the meaning of the words,</hi> is no more denied by us, than it is sufficient for them; without he understands more by <hi>Meaning of the Words,</hi> than he cared his Reader should at first perceive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He argues again, <hi>Put the case I have recourse to Church-Guides, and they tell me I must believe those Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; is it Necessary I believe those</hi> Guides? — <hi>Am I bound because my Guides tell me I must do so?</hi> Now he knows that such <hi>Guides</hi> as <hi>it's necessary to believe,</hi> are the Guides they indeed would have, but we deny.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He proceeds, <hi>The evidence of the Deduction is either had immediately from the mere reading of Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help of Guides; or</hi> &amp;c. Now who ever said, that all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries are to be learned by all persons by <hi>the mere read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture</hi> without the use of Means, such as Attention, Consideration, Prayer, Interpreters, and Guides?</p>
            <p n="4">4. He then infers fallaciously, <hi>Or it cannot be had but by the help of Guides, and then the Scripture alone is not sufficient</hi>: For when the Scripture <hi>alone</hi> is said to be <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> it's meant so as to contain all things necessary to Salvation; it's sufficient as a Rule for all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Faith and Manners, so as to exclude the Necessity of any other Rule of that kind: But it's not so <hi>alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> as to exclude all Means by which it's to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He farther conceals himself, when after he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the case to <hi>Church-Guides,</hi> as if he would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of private and ordinary Teachers in the Church, he at last lodges it in the bosom of some stated and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Infallible and unerring Guide, as in the next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

Secondly, <hi>But if all Necssaries to Salvation be not clear enough in Scripture to be understood without an Interpreter, then it will be necessary to know who and where the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is. If you remit me to the Decision of the true Church, it will be necessary to know whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h is that Church. If you tell me all Christian Churches joined together, then it follows that I am bound to believe nothing but what all Christians agree in; for what they disagree in, cannot be the Sentiment or Decision of the whole Church, but only of a part of it. I am not then obliged to believe the</hi> Trinity; <hi>for the</hi> Arians, <hi>tho Christians, deny it. I am not obliged to believe the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, <hi>for many Christians deny that Christ was God made Man by a strict Incarnation, but only by a Moral Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, he was a Man who had the Authority of God, as his Plenipotentiary, and the like. Now then let me know on what all Christians agree, and let me have your Warrant that I am bound to believe neither the</hi> Trinity <hi>nor</hi> Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>nor any thing wherein all Christians do not agree. Now if you tell me I am obliged to stand to the Determination of one particular Church, or some and not all, tell me which, and why that or those more than others? What Church, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were particular Persons bound to follow Two hundred years ago before the</hi> Reformation?</p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>Our Author at first put the Question, <hi>Whether all things necessary to Salvation are contained in Scripture?</hi> And upon this he argues, <hi>If they be, then they are either clearly contained in it, so that there is no need of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter for the meaning of them, or not.</hi> If the Addresser could have gained the first Point, That <hi>all necessaries are not contained in Scripture,</hi> then the Case lay fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and it would follow (as he supposes) that there must be some external and speaking Authority from whence those Necessaries <hi>not contained in Scripture,</hi> are to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62487:13"/>
be received, and where they are to be fought: This is a Case he puts to the Question, <hi>If not, where must I seek them?</hi> But there he leaves it: Indeed it was a tender Point, because of late they would have us believe that they have Scripture for what they differ from us in; and then to talk of Necessaries not to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to instance in those Necessaries, would be to give up that Cause which they have so much laboured to support in that way; and to tell the World that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Treasurer of all those Necessaries, is a Doctrine not so suitable to the Genius of the present Age, as it was to others heretofore.</p>
            <p>But if that would not be yielded, That <hi>all Necessaries are not contained in Scripture,</hi> he then puts in with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That <hi>they are not so Clearly contained in it, as not to need an Interpreter</hi>; and if this be yielded, he would in his own opinion, save his Cause; for then he concludes there must be some Guide and Interpreter, and <hi>it will be necessary to know who and where the Interpreter is.</hi> Now if we may guess what kind of Interpreter or Guide it is that he would have, it's one that is necessary for all to believe, and whose Interpretation all are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; a Guide that is a Judg, and whose Judgment is absolute, final, and conclusive, into which all is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and from which there is no appeal; that is to teach <hi>all Necessaries to Salvation not contained in Scripture</hi>; and to interpret the meaning of those that are; without which we cannot know whether there be a Trinity, or our Saviour was Incarnate; and upon whose determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the Articles of our Faith do depend for their declaration. Here the Case is immutably fixed, says our Author, <hi>I must believe; it's necessary to believe; I am obliged to believe, and am bound to follow</hi>; as he puts the Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62487:14"/>
But now we that are for Ministerial Guides and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters that are appointed by God for the teaching his Church, and whose Office it is to teach them so as they may understand and judg for themselves, know nothing of such a Guide as he would introduce upon us; and we have reason to be cautious, when we find both the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle declaring against it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Not for that we have dominion over your Faith, but are helpers</hi>; and our Saviour warning us against such an Imposition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. <hi>Call no man master on earth, for one is your master.</hi> It's his Prerogative alone to challenge such an absolute submission from us; and it's a gross Usurpation in any other to claim and assume it: So that we may leave our Author to find out, <hi>Who, and where the Interpreter is</hi>; for we own no such Guide or Interpreter as he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon us, whether he means by it any particular Church, or any part or Society of that Church, or indeed any humane Authority whatsoever. And when he or his Partizans think it worth the while to undertake the proof of it, and shall as clearly prove it as the Trinity and Incarnation are from Scripture; we that profess the latter, and are as <hi>sincerely desirous of finding out the Truth</hi> as he can be, do promise him to own the former; and for this Reason, and that they may have a fair occasion offered to try their skill upon it, I shall put the Case a little forward.</p>
            <p>I am sensible our Author would take it in good part to have it granted that all things necessary to Salvation are not contained in Scripture, and to have it brought to his first Question, <hi>If so, where must I seek them?</hi> Or that, They are <hi>not clear enough in Scripture without an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter</hi>; that at least the next Question may be brought on, <hi>Who, and where the Interpreter is?</hi> And therefore to gratifie him as much as I can, I shall for the present
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62487:14"/>
suppose that all things necessary are not in Scripture; and then in his order and words, I ask, <hi>What those neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to Salvation are,</hi> that are not contained in Scripture, and <hi>where each of them may be found?</hi> Now he that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses this, must proceed upon the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (since no Church besides, that I know of, is of this mind.) And whither may we expect to be directed so soon as to the Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which contains the chief of those Doctrines they differ from other Churches in, and which are made as necessary to be received and believed, as the Articles of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, being by that Pope's Authority, in consequence of the Order of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> incorporated into one and the same <hi>Profession of Faith.</hi> By which means they are forced upon one of these two Difficulties, either to prove their new-coined Articles by Scripture as well as those of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; or to show that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed are no more to be proved from Scripture, without Tradition and the Churches Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than those of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>: The former they are never able to do, and all their attempts that way have proved vain and unsuccessful; and therefore they have taken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways for the latter, sometimes detracting from the Sufficiency or Perspicuity of Scripture, at other times exalting Tradition, and Church-Authority to an equality with it. For since all these Points are made by this means equally necessary to Salvation; and since it's as necessary to believe on pain of Damnation, That <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mother and Mistress of all Churches</hi>; and that <hi>the Body and Blood of Christ are truly, really, and substantially, together with his Soul and Divinity, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the whole Substance of the Bread is turned into the Body, and the whole Substance of the Wine into his Blood,</hi> &amp;c. Since it's as necessary to believe this, as the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62487:15"/>
Being of a God, the Trinity, and Incarnation of our Blessed Saviour, and that they are sensible they are not to be proved in the same way, they find themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give the same Authority to one as the other, and to bring down the Scripture to the Church, or exalt the Church to the Authority of Scripture. So that if we will look for things necessary, not contained in Scripture, we must have recourse to the Church, which can, as they say, ordain new Articles of Faith, and which whenever so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained are as much to be believed and received as those which have their Authority immediately from Scripture. And after our Author hath beat about, and done his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to loosen the Articles of our Faith from the written Revelation, and <hi>the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles</hi>; hither he would bring the Case, that we are <hi>obliged to stand to the Determination of one particular Church,</hi> as he insinuates, <hi>page</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>But now to return his own words upon him, <hi>If you remit me to the Decision of the true Church, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to know which is that Church.</hi> For since there are several pretenders, and there are <hi>Christian Arrians,</hi> as he saith, and many other Dissenters, how shall I find out this True Church, and <hi>why that more than others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it because she herself saith she is the True Church? All the rest claim the like Character of being a True Church; and besides; this is to demand the thing that is to be proved. Is it that she is like a City upon an Hill, or the Sun in the Firmament, to be known by a self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Light? Why is it not then as well known, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputably owned to be the true Church, and the only True Church, as a City to be a City, or the Sun to be the Sun? Is it to be found out by the Notes and Marks of the True Church? Then we must find out the Marks before we find out the Church that is to be known by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62487:15"/>
them. And then the pinching Question comes on, <hi>Where must I seek</hi> these Notes? It's to be feared that will lead us to the Scripture; and then we know what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Lastly, Are we to find out the Church by an Infallible Guide? Then we are to find such a Guide out of the Church; and that we have no direction where to seek, or by what Notes we may know it. Here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are left in a Maze to beat out the way, and they that have made the Church a Guide, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed no Guide to lead us to the Church. That is a Track we must find of our selves, there we must use our own simple Reason, Consideration, and Enquiry. So that how certain soever we may be when in the Church, we can never be infallibly certain which is the Church that <hi>we are bound to follow</hi>; because this kind of certainty is peculiar to the Church, and not to be had out of it.</p>
            <p>But since we have gone thus far upon Supposition, let us take it for granted once more, that the Church is upon the Hill visible and demonstrable, yet because the Church is a Collective Body, where is the Seat of that Infallible Authority, that I am to attend to, and finally to be determined by? Is it in every particular person? Then because Infallibility knows no degrees, I my self should in that Church be as Infallible as the Supreme Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor of it. Is it in one particular person, or in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council? <hi>Who, and where is it?</hi> Must I suspend till I know, or till all the parts of the Church agree in it? If you tell me <hi>all joyned together</hi> (as our Author has taught me to Reason) <hi>then it follows I am bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing</hi> of this kind, <hi>but what all agree in; for what they disagree in, cannot be the Sentiment or Decision of the whole Church, but only of a part of it. I am not then obliged to believe</hi> the Pope's Infallibility; for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62487:16"/>
of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Church, <hi>tho</hi> Papists <hi>deny it.</hi> Nor am I <hi>obliged to believe</hi> a Council Infallible without the Pope, because those at <hi>Rome deny it.</hi> And because what's a good Argument in one case, is good in another; let me have our Author's <hi>Warrant, that I am bound to believe neither</hi> Infallible, since neither of these agree with the other. For certainly I am no more <hi>obliged to believe the</hi> Infallibility of their Church, which they do thus disagree in, than our Author would perswade us that we are <hi>not obliged to believe the Trinity,</hi> because <hi>the Arrians, tho Christians, deny it.</hi> But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the Seat of Infallibility be clear and evident; Yet how can I, that am at a vast distance of years or place from that Oracle, whatever it is, be infallibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that these that are put into my hands are the very Results and Decrees of that Authority? Or that this that I think, or am told, is the true and undoubted sense of them? Or (to speak modestly) How can I be as much assured of the Truth of these matters, as I am of the Authority and Sence of Scripture? Or that Christ hath not spoken as plainly and intelligibly in the Scriptures, as his Vicar or Substitutes have in any of their Canons and Decrees? So that tho the Church be Infallible, and I a Member of that Infallible Church; yet what will that Infallibility avail me, when I am without the doors of that Infallible Council, or out of the reach of the immediate Dictates of the Infallible Chair? And unless the spirit of Infallibility descends from the Chair to the meanest Priest who is to instruct and direct me; or is indorsed upon every Decree, and inspires every Article with its own unerring sense; I am not infallibly certain. And I may be no more certain of the true Doctrine of the Infallible Church, than I am of the sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under the Conduct of a Fallible Church; since the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62487:16"/>
immediate Authority I depend upon for the Doctrine, and the Sense of it, is all this while Fallible. As for example, I am told that there is such a Creed as that before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. that contains in it such Articles that every one is so bound to believe, as <hi>without the belief of which no Man can be saved:</hi> And I find in that Creed, that the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mother and Mistress of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> And yet how shall I be Infallibly assured, first, that there ever was such a person as Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 4th? or that he ever composed such a Creed? or that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Supremacy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is one of those Articles? The Pope I never saw, nor am like to see. A Council is a rare thing, and what they care not to hear of at <hi>Rome,</hi> and are able to do as well without as with it. And therefore where shall I be infallibly instructed in these matters? How shall I then be sure that the Article aforesaid is not to be understood, that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mistress</hi> of all Churches within the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diocess of <hi>Rome</hi> only? For here is a different use of the same Word; and if, in our Author's way of Arguing, a different use of the same word will render us uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attaining the sense contained in these words, it would be to little purpose to read the word without an Infallible Assistant always at hand to explain it clearly and certainly to us. So that if there be no better <hi>way to end the many Controversies of this Age,</hi> than what he calls <hi>the only and surest way,</hi> they are likely to continue for his time. And if their Church has no <hi>surer</hi> way to bring the Case to an issue, than this of exposing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to save themselves, they will as soon make men to quit all Religion, as that which they have, to be of theirs, of which they cannot be, but by subverting those Principles upon which the best Religion in the World, the Christian, is supported.</p>

            <p>The Difference betwixt the Protestant and Socinian Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, <hi>in Answer to the</hi> Potestant's Plea <hi>for</hi> a Socinian.</p>
            <p>All these Books, with several others to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpose, were Printed the last year; and if our Author had consulted them, as he ought, and had as <hi>sincerely</hi> read them, as he pretends to <hi>propose</hi> his <hi>doubts</hi>; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Confidence might, I am apt to think his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would not have found any just occasion to have made this <hi>Address,</hi> nor needed Another to Answer it.</p>
            <p>But it seems nothing less will satisfy our Author, than an Answer from <hi>the Ministers of the Church of</hi> England. It's not a <hi>particular</hi> person that he conceives sufficiently qualified to undertake his Case, and to rescue his <hi>Soul,</hi> which he is so <hi>solicitous to save</hi> out of this danger; and <hi>to instruct him in this weighty Affair.</hi> But it is <hi>their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Learned Body</hi> (as he fleeringly stiles them) that he presents his <hi>Address</hi> to; from whom he expects a <hi>Publick, and withal a Speedy Answer.</hi> He writes as if they were now in Convocation, or that they were all obliged through the Two Provinces forthwith to assemble about this important Case; and by one Solemn Act of theirs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62487:18"/>
to return <hi>an Answer to these Doubts, which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Salvation</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi> But because it's now not a season for this purpose, and 'twill be too long to stay till the days grow longer, and the ways better, I thought I might as well presume to try what might be done by a private hand, and he might as well accept of it, as he might <hi>Present an Address to the Ministers of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in behalf of himself and others,</hi> and at last subscribe in his own name with a, <hi>Sirs, Yours ever.</hi>
