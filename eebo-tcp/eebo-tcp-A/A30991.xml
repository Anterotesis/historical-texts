         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TESTIMONY

HIS
Antichriſtian and Fooliſh Pamphlet,
STILED,
Antichriſt's Transformations Within Diſcovered
by the Light Within.</head>
            <p>HAving lately ſeen a Book printed by <hi>J. B.</hi> intituled,
<hi>Antichriſt's Transformations Within diſcovered by the
Light Within,</hi> this Teſtimony aroſe in my Heart,
That Antichriſt's Transformations within is ſetting and would
ſet it ſelf above the Light within, in ſuch as have departed from
it in themſelves, amongſt whom is this <hi>J. B.</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who went out from us becauſe they were not of us, but
went out, and ſo are made manifeſt; who, had they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Light, they had not been puſhing at us and it; for
ſuch are at Unity with the Light, and in it, in ſweet Fellowſhip,
Peace and Communion one with another, and there is no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſtumbling in them becauſe they walk in the Light: And
theſe have been much oppoſed ſince they were a People, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the Light, in it to walk; and the Enemy hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
alwayes to diſperſe their gatherings, and to hedge up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45229:3"/>
their Path; and when the National Prieſts and others of all
ſorts, with their Weapons, could effect nothing, then have
there aroſe ſome amongſt our ſelves, who have ſpoke perverſe
things to draw after them; and ſo, this is no new thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would we have any ſtartled, or make a wrong Judgment
concerning, us or the bleſſed Light becauſe thereof, and ſo
make their Bonds ſtrong; for ſo you may read it was in the
Primitive Times: And thoſe are more ſubtil then others, in
that they have known ſomething of the Openings of the Truth,
whilſt in their firſt Love, Tenderneſs and Lowlineſs, unto
which it did open, which State they having loſt have made
uſe thereof to make War againſt the Light and the Dwellers
therein; and the Knowledge has puſt ſuch up who have fed
there, and departed from the Grace that humbleth and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
humble, out of Contention, and Strife, and Enmity, where
theſe dwell who ſpeak Evil of Dignities, and Deſpiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would pretend to give Honour to the Light, but
diſhonour and diſ-regard them that are the Meſſenger and were
the Bringers of the Glad-tidings thereof to their Ears, who

               </gap>e turned many to Righteouſneſs, who do and ſhall ſhine
forever and ever: And this Subtilty is ſeen, and this transformed
Angel of Light is diſcovered, though he come in that Name
and under the Pretence of Light, crying out againſt Man, and
calling it <hi>Man's Power</hi> and <hi>Man's Authority,</hi> as divided from
the Lord's Power and his Authority, even in thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of it, and live upon it, and act by it, and judge the
World through it; and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to honour the Light, which
has honoured them that have honoured it, and given them
Power, which hath reached through them even to Thouſands,
who are their Witneſſes they have uſed it to Edification and
not to Deſtruction: Neither have ſuch forced any, or exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Dominion over the Conſciences of any, as <hi>Rome</hi> and other
Chuches have done by their Coercive power and Penal Laws;
ſo none like to be ſo enſnared by their Power and Authority
given them of God to judge Error and Blaſphemy, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
riſes up that is of a contrary Nature to the pure Light and
peaceable Spirit of Righteouſneſs, which has brought us forth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45229:3"/>
a People to his Praiſe, amongſt whom is the Spirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and a ſound Mind, who have the Mind of Chriſt, and
will not be divided from their Husband, their Maker, nor let
his Judgments depart from his Law that he has placed in their
Hearts, and his Righteouſneſs that he put in his Spirit in
their Inward Parts, which now goeth forth to judge Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and Filthineſs, as well of Spirit as Fleſh, which
makes the filthy Dreamers that deſpiſe Dominion angry, and
cauſes them to vent their Confuſion, Blaſphemy and Darkneſs,
to the manifeſting their own Shame, as <hi>J. B.</hi> has done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Judgment is gone forth againſt him for denying that
Chriſt that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the Judge and Saviour, who
having denyed him in his Workings for our Salvation, we
cannot think it ſtrange to ſee him inveighing againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

them a Name, who, as he ſent his Son into the World, ſo
hath his Son ſent them, and hath ſanctified them through the
Truth, that they may be one as the Father is one, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which the Father gave him he hath given them, though
<hi>J. B.</hi> grudges them it, and that which they have they return

            <p>Thy Judgment is thou ſayeſt and believeſt, <hi>That whatever
is writ to the Churches by Men, Elders, ought to be written by
the Holy Ghoſt, whether it be Exhortation or Counſel, Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
Warning of Evil, &amp;c. in Matters of Conſcience, which
things belong to God.</hi> So then they have Power in the Holy
Ghoſt to admoniſh and warn in things relating to Conſcience
according to thy Judgment; but we may go ſomething further
as well as our Brother <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote to the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Commandment,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>not the Lord but He ſpake,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45229:4"/>
and ſo his Faith and Judgment herein was diverſe from thine,
and ſo is ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Paper to the Churches</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>is not to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe it was writ from a Sight or a Senſe, or Senſible Part,
and not from the Spirit of Revelation.</hi> As if that implyed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
as if the Spirit's Revelation put out Sight and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
and ſo thou wouldſt have Blind Elders and Senſleſs
Miniſters; and is not this from Satan's Transformings in thee?
and has he not led thee here into the Ditch? for did not thoſe
that ſpoke forth the Spirit's Revelations, ſpeak from a Sight
and a Senſe, and from that Part in them that was made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Revelation? and were not the Prophets called <hi>Sears?</hi>
and were they not to declare what they ſaw? and did they not
ſpeak from the ſight they had of the Mind of the Lord? and
were not they ſenſible of what they declared? And did not the
Apoſtle declare what he had ſeen with his Eyes, and his Hands
had handled, and what he had taſted of the Word of Life?
ſo his Senſes were exerciſed therein, and from the Senſe he
wrote; but thou, who haſt loſt thy Senſe and Feeling, cryeſt
out againſt Senſible Miniſters and Elders; and ſo People may
ſee what ſtuff they have, and are like to have from thee, which
is full of Senſleſneſs; and 'tis much if thou canſt put it off
with giving it away; for it is not worth buying.</p>
            <p>So thou run'ſt on in thy ſenſleſs Stuff, and ſayeſt, <hi>The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is the Soul, Heart and Mind of every Viſible Man.</hi> And
whence haſt thou this? who art crying out againſt us for not
holding the Form of Sound Words? haſt not thou preſumed
herein above what is written? where does the Scripture ſay
ſo? or where can it be ſo much as inferred from thence? and
doſt thou think to recover thy ſelf with writing ſuch ſtuff as
this, or hurt us thereby? or will it not make thy Folly more
manifeſt, that it might proceed no further.</p>
            <p>And the following part concerns thy ſelf, whoſe Mind the
Adverſary has ſtoln from the Light, that would have kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
out of the Headineſs and ſpirit of Exaltation, in which
thou ſtandſt feeding upon the Tree of Knowledge, that has

puft thee up, who has made uſe of thy Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ledge to ſerve
<hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Intereſt, who is now become thy Teacher and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Work of Oppoſition againſt the Light, and his
Teachings, Leadings and Formings of his People.</p>
            <p>And thy not owning the Judgment and Superiority of the
Miniſters who ſay, <hi>He that is not juſtified by the Witneſs of
God in Friends, is condemned of it in himſelf,</hi> does not make
it untrue, who contendeſt againſt the Truth and its Miniſters;
for God's Witneſs is one, and its Judgment one, and as his
Name is one ſo is his People (though ſuch as are got into
Hardneſs, above the Fear, would divide them, and make
their Judgment differ) wherefore it will hold true forever,
That ſuch as are unreconciled to the Church, are no Miniſters
to the Church; for God's Church and He are in Unity (which
thou art inſenſible of, being divided from it) and the Church
is in God; ſo <hi>they that are unreconciled to the Church, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled
to God, and ſo can be no Miniſters unto it;</hi> and he
gives his Power to the Church that is in him; and they that
will not hear the Church, let them be as <hi>Publicans,</hi> ſaith Chriſt:
and ſuch unchurch themſelves that receive not the Judgment of
the Church that is in God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth:
and though the Falſe Church may and does bring Snares, yet
will the True Church of God never bring Snares upon her
Members.</p>
            <p>And thy Teſtimony againſt the Practice of <hi>Impoſing Books</hi>
(as thou deemeſt it) favours more of Malice then Truth; for
thou knoweſt, there were none impoſed upon thee, nor any
in the Meeting; and thou haſt dealt Enviouſly and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
in the Relation thereof: and when it was mentioned
at <hi>Sudbury</hi> (where <hi>J. B.</hi> oppoſed it) it was left to Friends
Freedoms, who all beſides him then and there conſented, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Contradiction. But he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as more gratified his
own Enmity, then ſhown his care for the Poor. And ſo <hi>J. B.</hi>
thou haſt loſt the ſenſe of the Light that ſaves, and art got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which deſtroyes, and darkens, and vails, as they that
read thy Book may feel the Darkneſs, it is ſo thick.</p>
            <p>And thy crying up the Light to cry down the Meſſengers and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45229:5"/>
Labourers it has ſent forth, is not from the Light, but from the
Transformings of Satan, who informs againſt its Meſſengers
and Miniſters; for the Light ſaid of ſuch, <hi>You are the Salt of
the Earth,</hi> and that ſalts the Earth; and he calls them, <hi>The
Light of the World,</hi> and has not excluded them from being
<hi>Fellow-Workers together with him,</hi> nor yet aſhamed to call
them <hi>Brethren:</hi> So thou and thy Work are diſcerned, and
there's Thouſands can never forget the Day of their Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who would have even pluckt out their Eyes for them that
were made inſtrumental in the Power and Spirit of the Lord,
to beget them to God, having them in Eſteem for their Works
ſake, accounting them worthy of double Honour (though
thou haſt loſt thy Firſt Love and Senſe of the Heavenly Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that reached through them unto thee) which they can't
forget who have kept their Habitation, but muſt highly eſteem
them by whom they were begotten to the Lord, as Fathers;
and ſuch as have believed through their Word, and abide
therein, can't think ſleightly of their Authority, and that
Power which hath effectually wrought for the breaking all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and Yoaks of Bondage from off their Souls, and
thoſe are found Witneſſes for them, they are no Impoſers of

in the pouring forth his Soul unto Death comes to ſee his Seed,
and ſo thou art a Stranger to the Sufferings of Jeſus, and knows
not the Fellowſhip of them, who never wert baptized into his
Death with him, who art denying the Extent and Effect of
his Sufferings, thou being out of the Senſe and Feeling. And
if that <hi>which God made in Man</hi> be in Bondage and Captivity
(as thou ſayeſt) then muſt he deſcend thither to fetch it out;

him, that he would rather have him under the Power of his

               <hi>And the Devil</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>could never get into Heaven

that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, who was in the Spirit; and ſo thou art not in
the Spirit, but in the Transformation, that hath not ſeen it;
and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Revelation was ſince the Fall, who ſaw it, <hi>Michael</hi>

and ſo thou art ignorant of the Scriptures and the Power of
God, that makes War againſt the Devil and his Angels, who

them who ſit in the Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus, who

            <p>And as to our Teſtimony to that Chriſt that dved without

thou haſt printed it, and our dealings with thee in that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

by that Chriſt that dyed at</hi> Jeruſalem, but agreeing with
them: And thy Subtilty is ſeen, in taking thoſe Expreſſions to
exclude the <hi>Manhood,</hi> in which it is really included, which
ſayes, <hi>By Grace you are ſaved, and therefore not by him that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
though he was full of Grace, and by it taſted Death that
he might reconcile unto God, without which no Salvation:
<hi>And by the Light of the World we are condemned;</hi> as if that was

that I might as well ſay, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head, therefore not the Seed of
God;</hi> and <hi>a Man ſhall be for an Hiding-place, and a Covert
from the Storm, therefore not Chriſt; the Son of Man's Coming
is as the Lightning, therefore not the Spirit; God ſhall judge the
World by the Man Chriſt Jeſus, therefore not by the Light;</hi> this
is contrary to the Senſe of Scripture; for that includes them
in one, and joyns them together whom thou wouldſt part aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
as thou mayeſt read in <hi>John,</hi> when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The
Son of Man muſt be lifted up:</hi> and they asked him, <hi>Who is the
Son of Man?</hi> his Anſwer was, <hi>Yet a little while and the Light
is with you, while you have the Light walk in it:</hi> likewiſe when
the Babe was brought to <hi>Simeon,</hi> he took it in his Arms, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, <hi>Mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation, a Light to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Prophet ſpeaking of him, <hi>And
thou</hi> Bethlem-Ephrata, <hi>who art one of the leaſt amongſt the
Tribes of</hi> Judah, <hi>out of thee ſhall come forth unto me he who ſhall
be Ruler in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whoſe Goings forth are from of old, from
everlaſting:</hi> ſo He that came out of <hi>Bethlem</hi> was he that dyed
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who is the Ruler, that judges and condemns, who
was from Everlaſting; ſo that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> need not periſh that
were in the World before that Body came in it for want of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for his Goings were from of old, from Everlaſting;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45229:7"/>
and God's Anointed is ſpoken of, which is Chriſt (though thou
underſtandeſt it not) before his coming in that Body.</p>
            <p>But thou tellſt us, <hi>Only all the World was freed from their
Offerings for Sin by that One Offering, and that</hi> Only <hi>has an</hi>
Alſo <hi>too, they were</hi> outwardly <hi>reconciled by the Death of his Son.</hi>
And was not he that was the One Offering for Sin, that ended
all other Offerings, the Juſtifier, Condemner and Saviour? why
elſe did he put an End by it to all other Offerings, but becauſe
they were faulty, and had not Efficacy in them to juſtifie &amp; ſave?
and he that reconciles to God by his Death, muſt needs be the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
Juſtifier and Saviour? and there's not another. And then
to thwart thy ſelf thou ſayeſt, <hi>'Twas the Man in the Myſtery
that dyed, that was one with the Myſtery, who was the Chriſt of
God, being one with the Spirit of God;</hi> ſo then according to this,
he that dyed that was one with the Spirit of God, doth both
juſtifie, condemn and ſave. And then in Contradiction again to
the <hi>Man in the Myſtery,</hi> thou ſay'ſt, <hi>'Twas the Woman's Part
that dyed, which was his Soul and Body; for</hi> Eve (thou ſayeſt)
<hi>was in Tranſgreſſion:</hi> And did his Soul and Body ſin, which
thou ſayeſt was the <hi>Woman's Pars, which was in Tranſgreſſion?</hi>
And in pag. 2. thou ſayeſt, <hi>The Woman is the Soul, Mind and
Heart of every Viſible Man and Woman:</hi> and ſo thou makeſt no
Difference between his Soul and Body, and the Soul and Heart
of every Viſible Man and Woman; Oh groſs Darkneſs, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
and Confuſion!</p>
            <p>And our Teſtimony has alwayes had a reverend Eſteem of
that Precious Blood that was ſpilt without the Gates, as being
of great value in the Sight of the Lord, and having a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in it towards the Remiſſion of Sin, to obliege all that are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the End thereof, not to live unto themſelves, but unto
him that dyed for them: And as they are to be blamed that will
not come to the Light, but cry it down, relying upon the Death
and Sufferings without it; ſo art thou, who pretendeſt to cry
up the Light to render the Loving-kindneſs of the Lord invalid,
in ſending his Son to lay down his Life and Precious Blood, and
taſte Death for Mankind; and ſuch as ſpeak from the Light,
which is the Life that was in that bleſſed Body, can never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45229:7"/>
regard, but have an high Eſteem of what he did and ſuffered therein.</p>
            <p>And further, thou ſayeſt, <hi>There is a Soul, or an Inviſible Woman,
which God did make and place in every Viſible Man.</hi> I never read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of an <hi>inviſible Woman</hi> that God did make; no, that's thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and comes from thee, who doſt not write from Sight or Senſe; a
meer Figment of thine own Conceiving, being gone from the true
Senſe and Sight which gives a plain Underſtanding: <hi>And</hi> Eve (thou
ſayeſt) <hi>conceived and brought forth the firſt Inviſible Man, the Son of
Perdition, which brought Death over all;</hi> but thou telleſt us not who
ſhe conceived by, and who brought Death over her, if ſhe brought
Death over all. And in thy other Anſwer, which is much to the
ſame, <hi>'Tis plain in Scripture</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>there's Two Chriſts, Chriſt
and Antichriſt:</hi> And art not thou in the Transformings, that wouldſt
make Antichriſt a Chriſt? and who'le take the Information of this
Informer can we think, but Satan, who would have Antichriſt to be
Chriſt, and lay it upon the Scripture alſo; but the Scriptures ſay,
<hi>There's but One Faith, and One Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and we believe
them, and not thy Writings from Satan's Transformings. And thou
doſt directly oppoſe the Scripture, who ſayſt, <hi>Chriſt came not of
David or Iſrael;</hi> for in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 'tis ſaid, <hi>He did come of the Seed
of</hi> David <hi>according to the Fleſh,</hi> and ſo thy Spirit is ſeen, and the
Oppoſition is diſcerned; and 'tis the leſs for us to be Oppoſed by
thee, who art ſo great an Oppoſer of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Antichriſt</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>ſtrives to bring in his Doctrine, and
would be Head over all thoſe Inviſible Appearances that come from God,
yea, and Viſible Appearances alſo;</hi> which is fulfilled in thee and thy
Brethren, who are judging his Miniſters, and the <hi>Wholſom Order and
Commendable Form in the Church,</hi> to lay them waſte; nay, that ſpirit
hath not left unattempted the Scriptures themſelves, that ſo all Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Foot-ſteps in the Goings forth of the Light being aboliſhed,
and the Motions and Whimſies from Antichriſt's Transformations ſet
up in their place, the True Light and Spirit might thereby be aboliſht
alſo; <hi>and that is the Word of Truth in my Heart to that spirit whoſe
Workings have been to that End.</hi> So thy Work is ſeen, and Judgment
gone forth againſt that ſpirit, which it cannot eſcape: And the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Quarterly-Meeting</hi> is true, and will ſtand over thy Head
forever, except thou Repenteſt: And ſo the Reaſons of thy Diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us are ſome of them anſwered in what has been writ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45229:8"/>
And whereas thou <hi>diſowns that Body or Church, who look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to have Power to judge of Errors, and have not Power to convince
of Error, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that that Power by which the Miniſters
and Elders amongſt us do and have judged Errors, the ſame hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Thouſands of their Errors and falſe Doctrines, and I believe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee alſo in Years paſt, when thou waſt little and tender: There is
a difference between Conſcience truly tender unto God, and that
which is ſeared and hardned through Enmity, which is to be judged
and condemned by the Church, and ſuch as make Strife and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be amarkt by them that keep in the Power. And how canſt
thou deny thy ſelf to be a Member of any Church, but the true, who
haſt declared, <hi>the World to be the Church of God;</hi> and the true can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
admit of thy belief and ſpeaking, who believes and ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

Faith and Belief of the Church that is true, who art againſt Sight and

which cannot comprehend the Light and the things that are therein,

before us, and ſo they may take thee; for thou haſt been a Shame
to us, who haſt manifeſted ſo much Sottiſhneſs and Hypocriſie, a to
be twenty Years and more amongſt us, and be called after our
Name, and yet all this while remain ignorant of our Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
touching Doctrine. And thou art for our marrying with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for thou ſayeſt, <hi>The Lord made all Nations of one Blood;</hi> but
the Nations have poluted themſelves, and are gone from God's
make, and the Lord hath gathered us out from the Nations and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds;
and thou wouldeſt have us mix with them again, and put
that together, which God hath disjoyned, and this is the Informer's
work againſt God, and his Chriſt's work: And when <hi>Naomy</hi>'s Sons
