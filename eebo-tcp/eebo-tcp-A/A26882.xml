            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the Primitive Churches had some Responsal Forms (which our <hi>Psalms</hi> in Meeter, and Tune, do now supply without offence or disorder) and that it is the declining of Zeal, and the badness of men, that is become their disgrace, and not the forms; for the use of men of both extreams (passing by <hi>Cyprians Sursum Corda</hi>) I shall recite an evidence out of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. pag. 652. <hi>When we begin to say—the People answer [with thy Spirit,] shewing that they so spake of old; not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their own Wisdoms, but by the Spirit. But I speak not now of my self: But the Church is now like a Woman, which is fallen from her ancient prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in many places retaineth only the Symbols (or tokens) of that ancient felicity; and sheweth only the Cases (or Boxes) and Cabinets (or Tills) of her Iewels (or Ornaments,) but is deprived of her Riches. The Church is now like such a Woman. And I speak not this only as to (her loss of) gifts; (for if this were all, the matter were the less,) but also as to Life and Virtue.</hi> When in the fourth Century the <hi>old Custom</hi> is thus reported, it must be very ancient: And this sheweth that <hi>Zeal</hi> then caused the peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses; And were they now used by <hi>good men</hi> with the <hi>like holy Zeal,</hi> they would be less scrupled.</p>

            <p>SIR, Your Book called, <hi>A Vindication of Dr.</hi> Owen, I find containeth four distinct Parts or Subjects.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. A Vindication of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> Personal Worth: which you and I agreeing in, I have nothing in that to say against you.</item>
               <item>II. Your Consent to the main of the Cause which I defend, and your dissent from the Persons whose words I Confute: Of this I shall thankfully take notice.</item>
               <item>III. Your blaming of me for my naming the Dr. and for my manner of defence against his Arguments.</item>
               <item>IV. Your dissent from me in certain Doctrinals.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Having dismist the first, as to the second, I thank you,</p>
            <p>1. That you profess your self a <hi>hearty friend to all good men, and to the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I thank you that you say, <hi>p.</hi> 3. [<hi>I do not pretend in what follows to maintain against you that it is unlawful to use a form of Prayer, or comply with an imposed Lyturgy, or under some circumstances to joyn in the use of ours in Worship.] Neither shall I undertake to justify altogether the</hi> 12 <hi>Arguments you have printed</hi> as Dr. <hi>Owens, in order to refuting them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I am pleased that you expound the Doctors words, <hi>p.</hi> 24. as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying only, [<hi>It is not lawful for us to go and joyn in publick Worship by the Common-Prayer,] He doth not say it is not lawful for any: and for ought you know this</hi> [Us] <hi>whom he concerned in it, might be a very few to whom this Manuscript was imparted, and they might be under such circumstances as your own resolutions oft in Print would discharge from that Worship as a duty.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Were I never so well able to prove from this, and the Doctors many printed Writings, that he meant more, I would not now do it. I only here desire the Men and Women that have been with me, and profest that they thought the Doctors 12 Arguments to be unanswerable against
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62878:4"/>
the Lawfulness of joyning in the use of the Lyturgy, to take notice of what his worthy Vindicator saith.</p>
            <p>4. You grant, <hi>p.</hi> 25. that you [<q>Conceive that the Author doth not mean by these words, [<hi>Because that Worship itself—is not lawful] that it is simply unlawful, which must render it so at all times, and to all Persons, under what circumstances soever: But that taken with all its modes, as well as matter, and the manner, severity, and universality of its imposing, it is so: Besides, it is not said that according to the rule of the Gospel it is Unlawful, but [according to the rule of the Gospel it is not lawful,</hi> [which may fairly be construed thus; The rule of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth not authenticate, or warrant it; and I think it ought to be so construed: It being the defect of the rule, not its <hi>Opposition,</hi> which he lays the great stress of his Cause upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Remember Reader, that I was mistaken that thought <hi>not-lawful,</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> had been all one, and that the Doctor said not that the joyning in the Lyturgy as aforesaid, was <hi>unlawful,</hi> but only <hi>not lawful,</hi> not as in <hi>opposition to the rule,</hi> but <hi>without</hi> it, (and so are the 20 circumstances which I named.]</p>
            <p>5. When he saith [<hi>It is not in our power to make use of any part of it as we shall think fit.</hi>] And I maintain that though man hath not put that in our power, God hath put it in our power to joyn in the good part of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Publick Worship, without owning the faults (or else we must joyn with none;) you deny not this, <hi>p.</hi> 27. but say that he meant it of <hi>mans giving</hi> us power (which I never denyed.) But it is God that we serve.</p>
            <p>You say [<q>When men pray, they bid us pray—in extempore prayer, both are required to what is good.</q>] True: And I may joyn with the <hi>good in an extempore prayer,</hi> without owning any evil in it.</p>
            <p>Indeed you say, <hi>p.</hi> 28. [<q>The Mass is not more twisted in all the parts of it by Law, than the Lyturgy, nor left less to our power to pick and choose: If this Union do render the far greater pollutions, the Idolatry, and Heresy of the Mass infectious to the whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, who can prove that the pollutions of other Worship, when we are likewise commanded not to distinguish or divide, doth <hi>not in their kind</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> diffuse the <hi>taint alike.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> God is the Master of his Worship: I do what he bids me, tho man contradict it: If God bid me hear and believe the Scripture, and man say, hear also, and believe the Apocrypha, I will openly profess I obey God, and you, no further than you contradict not God: Rather than not hear the Scripture, I will hear also the Apocrypha, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be Gods Word. But if they bid me also hear the Alcoran, I will withdraw. 2. It is not the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> but the <hi>kind of the thing joyned</hi> that maketh it unlawful: An honest weak man, an Antinomian,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62878:4"/>
an Anabaptist, a Presbyterian, or whoever you dissent from in tolerable cases, may mix his Opinion, and faulty expressions and methods, with his Prayer and Sermon, as intimately as evil is mixt in the Mass, and yet you will not refuse Communion with him: It is lawful to drink beer that hath bad water mixt, rather than none, but not to drink that which hath poyson equally mixt.</p>
            <p>To <hi>p.</hi> 29. I think if a Turk pray against Idolatry, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Prayer is materially good: But as to <hi>Goodness</hi> from a <hi>Holy Principle,</hi> no Hypocrites is good. The insufficiency of my answer you no way mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, till you prove that I must joyn with all that is in publick Worship, or with none.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Pag.</hi> 32. You say [<q>
                  <hi>Doth he say a word</hi> of owning Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and <hi>Worship.</hi>
               </q>] <hi>Ans.</hi> If you or he say nothing against these, we shall leave the Diocesan case to others: But if you be the man that I have lately privately written to, I doubt not but I have proved to you, that Parish Churches that have good Ministers, are true particular Churches, and those Ministers true Pastors, and that any Bishops holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, doth not disprove it.</p>
            <p>7. When you recite my words, describing the Cause I plead, <hi>viz. [I have written over and over, that I persuade no man either to, or from a publick Church, till I know his Circumstances; And that I doubt not but it is one mans duty, and another mans sin.</hi>] You add [<q>I believe dear Sir, that though this concession may displease those who may best bear it, it may recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile you to most of those that are called Dissenters.</q>]</p>
            <p>If so, those Dissenters it seems by you do not much differ from me: But I think ten to one of the people accounted commonly Dissenters through <hi>England,</hi> are of my mind, and are for Parish-Worship rather than either none or worse. But by <hi>Dissenters,</hi> I suppose you mean those of the Doctors mind, or your own: And if so, I thank you for your own Charity and Reconciliation: But if you did not know them better than I, I should doubt that your said Friends are not altogether so recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable.</p>
            <p>Sir, You add, <hi>p.</hi> 39. [<q>And if (as you allow) the practical deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination depends on the circumstances of the Persons, you reduce the Controversy to a far narrower room, than was by most supposed: And every one being best capable of understanding his own circumstances, it will not bear great heat or importunity from another.</q>]</p>
            <p>But whence came those wrong Suppositions of the most? If after 20 years Communion in the Parish Churches, I venture on the Censorious so far as to give my Reasons for my own Practice, and defend those Reasons, and that Practice against contrary Writings, and such wise Men as you are so reconcilable, and see how narrow the Controversy is, whence comes it that most think it to be what it is not, against such fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62878:5"/>
plain expressions? You and I may conjecture at the Cause.</p>
            <p>Your Conclusion is a pious Profession of that Love, and the main Principles of that Concord for which I write.</p>
            <p>10. You wisely leave the Vindication of the Doctors words, when it cometh to the case which I oppose him in: As [<q>That neither God, nor good men will allow of, judging our Profession and Practice by any reserves of our own;</q>] when I have proved that our reserves against owning mixtures of evil, are necessary in all Communion.</p>
            <p>11. You vindicate not his words, that [<q>He that joyns in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Common-Prayer, doth by his Practice make Profession that it is <hi>wholly agreeable to Gods mind and will.</hi> And that to do it with other reserves is Hypocrisy, and worse than the thing itself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>12. You vindicate not his grand Argument [<q>Religious <hi>Worship not Divinely</hi> Instituted and Appointed, is false Worship,</q>] without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any secondary sort of Worship.</p>
            <p>13. You defend not his saying [<q>That there is nothing accidental in the Worship of God: and that every thing that belongs to it is part of it, or of its subsistence.</q>]</p>
            <p>13. You defend not that, [<q>
                  <hi>Because outward Rites and Modes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> Divinely Instituted and determined, do become necessary parts of Divine Worship, therefore such as are Humanly Instituted and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, are thereby made parts of false Worship.</q>] What work would this Argument make? If all outward Modes are false Worship, when determined by Men, if Divine Determination would make them necessary.</p>
            <p>14. You do not vindicate that [<q>All Prayers and Praise in Church-Assemblies, meerly as such, are prohibited by the Lyturgy,</q>] unless you do it by denying Parish-Churches.</p>
            <p>15. You do not defend [<q>That the Lyturgick Worship was in its first Contrivance, and is in its continuance, an Invention, or Engine to defeat, or render useless the promise of Christ to his Church, of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Spirit in all Ages to enable it to the due discharge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all Divine Worship in its Assemblies, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to be complyed with. That the very being and continuance of the Church, without which it is but a dead Machine, lyeth on this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Doth this speak only of the English Lyturgy, which is not 200 years old, think you? When next he tells us, that [<q>
                  <hi>It's the way of Worship by a</hi> prescribed Lyturgy, and that it was insensibly brought in (when in several Ages the Church had lived without it) and that to render the promise of Christ, and the work of the Holy Ghost in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of gifts useless.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62878:5"/>16. You defend not that [<q>Hence followed a total neglect of all the Spirits Gifts in the said Administration—Nor that [This produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all the Enmity—of the said work of the Spirit, which the world is now filled withal—that it ariseth from hence alone. Nor that the Worship Treated about, consists wholly in the Institutions, and on the Authority of Men, and therefore is false Worship—and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Kingly Office of Christ in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor that [<q>It belongs to the faithfulness of Christ to appoint and command all things in the Church that <hi>belong</hi> to the Worship of God—in the Forms and Modes of them—(Doth this speak only of the <hi>English</hi> Lyturgy.)—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor that liberty to use gifts in Prayer and Preaching, is ridiculously pretended, &amp; they are excluded in all the solemn Worship of the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>17. You defend not that [<q>
                  <hi>This Practice</hi> (joyning in the Lyturgy) condemns the suffering Saints of the present Age, renders them false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of God, and the only blameable cause of their own sufferings.</q>] And if all the Nonconformists that 1660. gave their Testimony for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lyturgy, were not Saints, at least they have been Sufferers: And doth not this as much make them false Witnesses? And if both you and we were mistaken, I am confident you will not justify all that we suffer by, and say <hi>we are the only blameable</hi> Cause? As if every such mistake were worthy of all the punishment undergone? Nor will you think that every good Mans Opinion must be justifyed, which he suffereth for, lest he be made the only Cause.</p>
            <p>18. You defend not that [<q>All the Promises, Aids of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with respect to the Prayer of the Church, whether as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, or ability—or the manner—are rejected and excluded by this Form of Worship.]—</q>
            </p>
            <p>19. You defend not, I hope, that <q>your Church Covenant is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve —nothing but what Christ commandeth <hi>in the Worship of God.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>20. Nor that [<q>The Practice inquired into contains a vertual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of our Church State, and of the lawfulness of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and Ordinances therein.</q>] If you do, it is no renunciation of ours.</p>
            <p>I thank you that you defend none of all these. For truly they be not things Indifferent, but if they be not true, they are of confounding, dividing, unpeaceable Consequence.</p>

         <div n="2" type="section">
            <head>SECT. 2.</head>
            <p>III. AS to the third thing, which taketh up most room, <hi>viz.</hi> your blaming me, 1. For using the Doctors name, 2. For the manner of my Confutation, I say distinctly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62878:6"/>1. I confess I think that the name of Christ and Religion, and its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be preferred before all mens: And I had many years ago heard a Conformable Preacher before a very honourable, and learned Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, charge the Nonconformists with holding that [<hi>A thing lawful in itself, in Gods Worship, becometh unlawful, if it be commanded by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. And that Forms and Liturgies were unlawful, because they be not made in Scripture by Christ.</hi>] And I have read too many such Charges: And I always answered that we were slandered.</p>
            <p>2. I quickly heard that the Manuscript was commonly spread, and he that brought it me, said, he believed a thousand were confirmed by it against going to the Parish Churches and Lyturgy.</p>
            <p>3. Several of my Friends and Acquaintance had got it, and told me they thought it unanswerable. And all named the Doctor as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>4. I was suddenly told of a very able Conformist that was going to answer it, and I feared he would lay it on us all.</p>
            <p>5. I made no doubt but Pulpits and Press would loudly say, these are the Nonconformists Principles: and if I denyed it would cite the Doctors Paper and Name.</p>
            <p>6. I knew divers of his Printed Books have the same Opinion of the unlawfulness of Imposed Forms; what now should I say against such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Nonconformists Opinions? Must we all bear the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so many Errours, and be published with Scorn and Contempt to be such, to make us odious to all, rather than one Man should be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
            <p>I purposed at first to conceal his Name, till I saw that all took notice of it, and none denyed it, (and after (I conjecture it is your self) that in the Letter to me affirmed it.) I know that multitudes of Men of Name, Learning, and Power, scorn us as they do the Quakers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them that say [<hi>We make all this noise and Schism as a distinct Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and suffer silencing, and Imprisonment, because we will not Communicate with the Lyturgy which the Martyrs owned:</hi>] I dare not suffer the Innocent to lie under such a slander for one [or many] Mans Name; we gave them our publick Testimony to the contrary, 1660. and 1661. If a few that would not come in then, and be seen among them that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Cause of the old Nonconformists, have now by our distempers got so many of their mind as that we must be) thought intolerably to wrong them, if we (necessarily) give our reasons against them, and shall pass their Excommunicating Sentence against the Cause of the old Non-Conformists, and yours, I cannot be one that shall betray the Truth and Cause of Catholick Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by silence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at such a time, when the Erroneous expect that their Opinion should be so necessary to our Union, that none must contradict it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62878:6"/>Therefore your saying that you have met with none that approveth my writing, if it were for the Cause, as well as my faultiness, will make me see the greater necessity of bearing my Testimony against them; Epidemical diseases most need Physicians, if not to cure the sick, yet to preserve the sound. <hi>Paul</hi> wanted not Love nor Prudence to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he not only reproved his Temporizing Separation to his Face, but left it with his Name on Record to all Generations, when they were both dead. Christ had immediately before abundantly honoured, and praised <hi>Peter,</hi> who yet for his miscarriage speaketh to him, as he did to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. And yet the miscarriage was done in Love to Christ, by a prime and dear Disciple; and his <hi>name</hi> must be thus left under this most sharp reproof, to be read from Age to Age by all. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were choice Disciples, and yet their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and their Uncharitable Zeal for Christ, must be recorded with their Names, as men that desired they knew not what, and knew not what manner of Spirit they were of. We are not so much better than they, as the Passions of some Applauders intimate: Christ will not be more tender of our Names, than of his Cause, and the good of Souls. If <hi>David</hi> will cause Gods Enemies to blaspheme, his sin shall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the sight of the Sun, though the sharpest part of the punishment be pardoned.</p>
            <p>But as for my naming the Dr. and your intimation, that it's long of me that he is named as the Author of those Arguments, I further say, 1. Is not a Man named openly, till his Name be Printed? Was not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted report, (still continued) a publication. Was there no publication of Names till 224 years ago, when Printing was invented? 2. All that I yet desire, is to be able to deny it to be his, that the next Man that hits the Non-Conformists in the Teeth with it, as the Doctors, may but be told it is not his: If you can and will but tell me that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not to be his, that I may have but so much to say, I will thank you, and make it publickly known.</p>
            <p>Either the Cause and Arguments are true, or false: If true, defend them. If false, are they not dangerous in so great a Cause; and at such a time, when they tend to <hi>drive</hi> hundred thousands from all Church Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Communion, and to persuade Men into scandalous suffering for ill doing.</p>
            <p>I think it laudable in you to honour the Doctor, and if you be the Man I conjecture you are, I think it's specially incumbent on you; As to your hints of suspicion of my sense of old differences, if I know my heart, I forgave, and fully put up all Personal Quarrel long ago: But the National Concerns made so deep a wound in my heart, as never will be fully healed in this world: But this leads me to the second part of your reproof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62878:7"/>II. I do but tell you my reasons for naming the Doctor, but I undertake not to justify either that, or the manner of my writing, from mistake, imprudence, or other such faultiness: I suppose you to be a Man whom I take from my heart to be far wiser, and better than my self: And therefore, as I thank you for your gentle, friendly reprehension, so I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that my very esteem and reverence of your judgment maketh me suspect that I have done amiss, when I see it not in the Cause itself: That I could have defended the Cause of Love and Communion against those Arguments, without taking notice of the Author, and without wronging the Non-conformists who will be charged by his name I did, and do wish; but I thought it could not well be done. If in this I mistook, I ask pardon of God and Man; for so I must do for my sins known and unknown.</p>
            <p>And as to the manner of my writing again, I say, I am convinced that all that I do is faulty, and cannot but have some favour of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and imprudence, and forgetfulness, and other faults of the Author. I read over your Animadversions, and, 1. I see at present some words of my own, that I much more blame my self for writing, than you for blaming. 2. What I yet see not to be faulty, your Authority shall make me yet suspect, and further consider. 3. I see very many passages, where I am confident the mistake is yours, sometimes mistaking the matter, and sometime my words. What good will it do the Reader, or <hi>you,</hi> or me, to give the world an account of all these, and to drown the <hi>Cause</hi> in abundance of <hi>self-defending words?</hi> Indeed I have neither <hi>time</hi> nor <hi>mind</hi> to write a Book now for my self-defence. The greatest Affliction I have by this Controversy as Personal, is this diverting of my thoughts so near my last hours from things more agreeable to my Case: And far be it from me to be confident in justifying my (faulty) writings, when I am going to the Judge that will take that for an aggravation of my sin. But I durst never forsake publick Communion, nor my own work, because I cannot have one, and do the other without fault: I am suspicious there may be more faults in me and my writings, than either I discern, or you, or any such have told me of. And if I could prove that your mistakes are the ground of your Accusation, I see by your noting my numbring the mistakes in matter of Fact, in the private Letter to me, how you would take it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, instead of writing for my self, I will give the Reader this concession and advice.</p>
            <p>Readers, I think it is little of thy concern to know whether I be wise or unwise, good or bad, or whether I did well or ill in naming Dr. <hi>O.</hi> or whether the manner of my writing be much, or little to be blamed: On condition you will agree with me in the cause of Love and Concord that I defend, Lonly then intreat you, that what imprudence, unskil fulness, rashness, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62878:7"/>
other faults you find in me or my writings, you will the more carefully your selves avoid them, and do better: And if you judge me to do ill, when I do my duty, and think very hardly of me for being against your way, I unfeignedly forgive you; and if you forgive not me, I can bear that. I was aware that I should be ill spoken of by many whom I love: And I am not Ambitious to be ill spoken of: If Folly make me exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise self-denyal, it is for somewhat that I thought had been better then all the Love and Praises which I deny. I flatter no Party, and I look to gain by none: I have gathered no Church to depend on for kindness, nor is the fear of displeasing them a by as to my judgment. And if it be otherwise with any, I think, were they like to have need of men in this world as short a time as I, they would make as little of mens good or ill thoughts and words as I do, except for the sake of other men.</p>
            <p>Therefore Reader, think of all the rest what you see cause, so you will but agree in the Cause that I am defending: That is,</p>

And Christianity itself being a profession that we obey God before Man. Else Man by commanding us to own some ill word, or circumstance, might drive us from all Christian Communion. If Men should command us in our private Meetings, to do it for an ill end, or an ill Principle (as in Obedience to Usurpers) we must not therefore forbear all private Meetings, nor will our bare meeting signify our Obedience to such Commands. If the Pastor of a single Church (or many Associate) tell the people, your meeting must be to own <hi>e. g.</hi> Anabaptistry, Antinomianism, Presbytery, Erastianism, Separation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this binds them not either to own it, or to withdraw, without some greater reason.

These <hi>must be added</hi> to the universal Duties, so far is such addition from being sin: I have often named many particulars; As the Translation of the Scripture, which to choose: The version of the Psalms in rithme, or metre, the common use of new made Hymns, the dividing the Scripture into Chapter and Verse; the words of Sermons; their method; the particular Text to be chosen; what Chapters to read; at what hour to begin; how long to Preach; in what words to pray, whether the same oft, or changed; whether fore-studied, or not, whether written, or unwritten: whether studied, and written by our selves, or by others; where the place shall be, where the Pulpit, Font, Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall stand; what Ornaments they shall have, Linnen, Silk, silver Vessels or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Whether we be bare-headed, or covered at Prayer, Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall kneel, stand, sit, or be prostrate at Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what distinctive Garments Pastors shall use. By what signs of consent and obligation Men vow, and swear, whether by putting the hand under the Thigh, lifting it up, subscribing, laying it on the Book, kissing the Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Catechisms to use, with many more such. God hath commanded men to choose such things as these by the Rules of <hi>Edification, Love, Peace, Concord, Order, Decency, winning those without,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>

to us at that time and place, when we cannot have better without more hurt than benefit to the publick or our selves. Among many Ministers, weak and strong, all cannot hear the best, nor must renounce the weaker. To live under the countenance of Government under an honest Minister of mean Parts in Peace and Concord, though he use the Lyturgy, is more to the common advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Religion, and to the profit of most particular Souls, than to hear an abler Man, with the distraction of Disturbers, and to be Fined, and lie in Prison on no better a Cause.</item>

                  <hi>XXXVI.</hi> They that constantly refuse Communion in the publick Churches while it is commanded, and while many write to prove it sinful, and many are in Prison, and ruined for refusing it, are justly to be interpreted to hold it to be unlawful, unless they openly profess the contrary, and give some better reason for their forbearance.</item>

                  <hi>XXXVII.</hi> To hold that any Congregations are such, whose Worship is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but such as God forgiveth, and accepteth, but that it is unlawful for us to joyn with them, lest it make us guilty of their sin, this (though it should be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and uncharitable, and sinful) yet is not to Excommunicate that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as no Church, or no Christians. But to say of any Congregation, that they want any thing essential to Christianity, or to make them capable to be loved as Christians, or that their Worship of God is Idolatry, or so bad, as that God accepteth it not, the evil of it being greater than the good, (as poyson in our food) and on this reason to declare that no good Christian should Communicate with them, this is to Excommunicate such Congregation, as far as one Church may Excommunicate another, which is but by such renouncing their Communion.</item>

               <item>
                  <hi>XXXIX.</hi> The use of faulty Lyturgies is no worse than the use of faulty Translations of the Holy Scripture, which yet Christ and his Apostles ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily used, (of which I shall say more anon.)</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>XL.</hi> I have before proved how faulty the Priests Calling was in Christs time, and the Temple and Synagogue Worship, and the Pharisees long Lyturgies, on pretence whereof they devoured Widows Houses, and their corrupt Doctrine; and how great the faults were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Sardis, Laodicea, Thyatira, Pergamos,</hi> and those that <hi>James</hi> wrote to, from which none were commanded to depart: And to Condemn Christ or his Apostles,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62878:10"/>
as favouring, or using sinful Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is worse in Christians than it was in the Pharisees.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These are the Principles, and this is the Cause for which I write: And I cannot defend it without opposing those that openly militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. If the Woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> could have told <hi>David</hi> that any one had held, or hindered her Son from killing his Brother, she would not have called him unpeaceable. It was hard measure that the striving Israelite offered to <hi>Moses,</hi> that said, <hi>Who made thee a Prince, and a Iudge over us? Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Aegyptian?</hi> And all for saying, <hi>Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</hi> If we could as charitably judge of a godly man that differs from us, as of our selves, and most esteemed Partners, how much sin should we avoid?</p>
            <p>But Reader, agree with me in this cause of Christian Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and then think of me and my Writings what thou seest meet. The question is not which of us is the Wisest, or hath done best, but how we should all please the God of Love and Peace, and avoid the Evils which have long threatned us, and which with grief I must say, our mistakes, and miscarriages in Religion have brought upon us, and are like to increase. Many seem like a Ship of Passengers, whose Pilot hath cast them by Errour on the Sands or Rocks; and some that pity them as they are sinking, tell them that their Pilots mistake hath endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered them, and they must take better advice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And instead of accepting help, they revile the helpers as injurious, unpeaceable, dishonourers of their wise and faithful Pilot. And if far worse be not yet at <hi>hand, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace must wonderfully frustrate this prognostick.</hi>

            <p>IV. BUt somewhat, Reverend Sir, you oblige me to say about my supposed Doctrinal Errours, which you have found in my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> (Had I dispraised him as much, you might have found more.)</p>
            <p>I said, that [<hi>I doubt not but his Soul is now with Christ, and though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have no sorrow, it hath great Repentance, and that Dr. O. is now more against the receiving of this mistake than I am, and by defending it, you far more displease him than me.</hi>] Here my supposed Errours are three.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>That I suppose him to know so much in Heaven.</hi> This being but played with as in jeast, I answer the more briefly to it in earnest.</p>
            <p>1. I am not of the Socinians mind, that lay the Soul as <hi>in nuda potentia</hi> to sleep till the Resurrection: Nor do I believe that Souls in Paradise
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62878:11"/>
with Christ, are more ignorant than they were in the Body. 2. And therefore I think the Doctor knoweth what he wrote, and did on Earth, and is not fallen into forgetfulness. 3. And that he knoweth into whose hands he gave those Papers, and what mind the men were of, and how they were received while he lived, if they have been so long extant as you seem to intimate, and that they were justifyed then. 4. And if the Saints shall judge the world, and be like, or equal to the Angels, I do not think that the concerns of this life are any more below their regard, nor more impertinent to them, than to the Angels: Nor that they live as unconcerned Strangers to Earth (when a Sun-beam can reach so far.) The Souls under the Altar, that cryed <hi>how long,</hi> knew that their blood was unrevenged on Earth. 5. Nor do I believe that Christ, with whom they are, and the Angels that here attended them, are so strange to them, as to tell them nothing of the Earth. But lest you feign that I suppose them to have News-books, Gazetts, or Post-letters hence, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advise you that justly extol his Learning, and Wisdom on Earth, not to bring him too low in Heaven, in comparison of us imprisoned Sinners, nor make him an ignoramus: And then we will but agree, that if he know of our faults here, he is against them, but if he think you are all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged since he died, there is mistake in Heaven. It followeth not that Souls in Heaven know <hi>nothing by Angels,</hi> because they know not <hi>all things:</hi> Nor that of themselves they know not what a man here may know by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, that the effects will be like the Cause, and his many Friends that owned his mistake on Earth, will some of them yet own them.</p>
            <p>I can but be sorry (for I am not so presumptuous as to think to change your Judgment) if the contrary supposition be [<hi>your best Weapon] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popish Superstition of praying to Saints:</hi> For all this I will hope that you do not pray to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> for so much as you believe he knoweth, nor yet feign him stark ignorant for fear of praying to him? <hi>Do you think he hath forgotten the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ase of</hi> England? <hi>Or will you pray to him to intercede for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. My second supposed Errour is, that <hi>the Saints in Heaven have any displeasure:</hi> And this is said to be [<hi>a Contradiction to the generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Opinion of all that you have met with.</hi>] I doubt not but your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is large, but I perceive it is not with all sorts of men. I am sorry they should generally deny so great and clear a truth.</p>
            <p>1. Let us examine the Controversy, as of the <hi>Matter,</hi> and 2. As of the <hi>Name [Displeasure.</hi>] 1. <hi>Complacence</hi> is the first act of the will upon Good as Good, before it come to <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Compared Goods,</hi> (which is usually <hi>de Mediis:) Displicence</hi> is its contrary, and its object is <hi>Evil as Evil.</hi> One is called <hi>Volition,</hi> or <hi>Willing,</hi> the other <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi> or <hi>Nilling.</hi> As <hi>Pleasedness,</hi> and <hi>Displeasedness</hi> are in the <hi>Passions,</hi> and signify <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Trouble,</hi> we have nothing here to do with them, (having expresly excluded <hi>sorrow</hi>) but as they are in the <hi>Will.</hi> I thought till
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62878:11"/>
now, that all sober Divines had been agreed (Protestants and Papists) that not only in Saints and Angels, and Christ as Man, but in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (who is most remote from imperfection) there is Complacence, and Displicence, Willing, and Nilling, which though in Creatures that have Accidents, they really differ as Acts, yet in God who is most simple, they are (say the subtiler part of the School Doctors) but the Essence of God by extrinsick denomination from relation of the effects, differenced from the Essence simply considered, and from each other; or as the Scotists <hi>formaliter,</hi> or as the Thomists <hi>ratione ratiocinata;</hi> but none deny these to be in God. I suppose that Volition or <hi>Complacence</hi> you deny not: As to <hi>Displicence</hi> or <hi>Nolition,</hi> answering the Judgments dislike, I prove that it is in Heaven, in God and Creatures.</p>
            <p>2. If the <hi>will of God, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> have any Act about <hi>Evil,</hi> it is <hi>Displicence,: But some</hi> Act about Evil they have, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Major, if they have any Act, it is Displicence, or Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for the will hath no other primary Acts before Election, (even <hi>frui &amp; intendere, presupposing</hi> this <hi>Complacence:</hi>) But God and good Spirits have no <hi>Complacency</hi> in <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> as such: <hi>Ergo</hi> they have a <hi>Displicence: Aut placet aut displicet,</hi> being the first in nature.</p>
            <p>That God or Spirits at least have some Act of will about evil as such, is commonly agreed: Else all the sin and evil in the world would come to pass, without any Act of God, or good Spirits in Heaven about it: Sure they that for Predetermination have written so many Volumes, (and one against me) are not of that mind. They say this is to feign God, and all in Heaven asleep, or having nothing to do with Earth: I have my self proved indeed (with others) that God hath no Volition or Complacency of Evil as such, but a Displicence I have proved.</p>
            <p>2. If God have no Displicence as to sin, then there is no effectual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to it, but all the world would be drowned in wickedness: For the Creature would presently run into evil. But sin is restrained—</p>
            <p>If any in excess of subtilty say, that Nolitions are not in God, but Volitions of the Good, are instead of Nolitions of Evil, this is bold, and at least the language unfit, and reductively these Volitions are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of their Contraries. And however none of this can be feigned of Souls.</p>
            <p>3. If God be not <hi>disp'eased</hi> with sin, then his prohibitions are no signs of his displeasure; any more than his Commands. But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Then his Judgments and Execution in Hell, are no effects of his displeasure.</p>
            <p>5. Then Christ came not to reconcile us to a displeased God, nor is he any more displeased with Persecutors then Saints, nor with Cursing than with Blessing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor with any man for doing it.</p>
            <p>6. If the subtilty which I have taken notice of in my <hi>Catholick Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62878:12"/>
asserting Volitions without <hi>Nolitions</hi> in God, were defensible, it would, as I said, be of no truth as to Creatures; if Souls in Heaven have no displicence against sin, how is their <hi>will</hi> holy in the Image of God, that hateth Iniquity? Devils love sin; Stones, and Brutes neither love, nor hate it. Saints in Heaven hate it, and love it not: meerly <hi>not-loving</hi> it is not their full holiness.</p>
            <p>7. If Saints there are not displeased with sin, how can they glorify Christ for dying for it, or God for punishing it.</p>
            <p>8. Or how can they be everlastingly thankful to Christ for saving them from it.</p>
            <p>9. What a change must they impute to Christ that came so low, and suffered as in a sort forsaken, to destroy the works of the Devil, and now hath not so much as the least displeasedness with sin.</p>
            <p>10. Then Christ and Saints there are no more displeased at Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prophaneness, Murder, Adultery, then at Piety and Love.</p>
            <p>11. Then it no more displeaseth Souls there, that they here sinned, then that they did well: <hi>Pauls</hi> mind is much changed then about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. The best is, though you and yours are offended with me, it is not displeasing to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> if he know it. But if your reason be, because that all displeasedness hath some <hi>suffering</hi> of the mind, or <hi>trouble,</hi> 1. As to my meaning you know I <hi>excluded sorrow.</hi> 2. And it is not true that you suppose. Pure <hi>Displicency</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> in God, and the blessed, hath no trouble: It is <hi>not</hi> exercised in a <hi>body</hi> that hath a Heart, or Head troubled by commotion of the Blood and Spirits, nor yet in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Soul that hath hurting passions. It is the pure perfection of the will; and nothing but its <hi>Aversation</hi> from sin; and contrary to Love: Love and Hatred are names that may well here be used, but <hi>Complacence,</hi> and <hi>Displicence</hi> being the same, sound as less to <hi>signify</hi> Passion. And if there be Passion in Heaven, (which you cannot disprove) it might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminution of felicity.</p>
            <p>II. But I am not hopeless that you will deny none of all this as to the matter, but turn all into a quarrel at <hi>words,</hi> and say that the name of <hi>Displeasure</hi> is not fit for any Act of God or Saints, or Angels in Heaven: If that be the worst (which is bad enough) let us next try that wordy Controversy. I. By Scripture. II. By School Divines. III. By common practical Divines.</p>
            <p>I. Scripture use of words in Sacred Things is our best Dictionary. He that is our great Teacher, knoweth how to speak: If you dislike his words, methinks you should not accuse Men of Errour, and that against the common sense of all that you meet with, for imitating God, and speaking as he doth: And that at the same time when you are defending one that would have no Mode, or Accidentals in Worship used, which God prescribeth not. If by my words I must be Justified, or Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62878:12"/>
I hope God will not condemn me for speaking as he taught me, no more then for doing as he bid me, though all your party should do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I can bear their Condemnation.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew phrase which we translate by <hi>Displeasing</hi> God or Man, is oft [<hi>It was Evil in his Eyes</hi>] which speaketh a positive Act of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding <hi>de malo:</hi> And that there was no answerable Act of the Will, let him say that dare.</p>

            <p>Num. 11. 1. <hi>When the people complained, it displeased the Lord—his anger was kindled</hi>—</p>
            <p>2 Sam. 11. 27. <hi>The thing that</hi> David <hi>had done displeased the Lord,</hi> (Murder, and Adultery.) No, say you, God is not displeased with any sin, there is no displeasure in Heaven.</p>
            <p>1 Chr. 21. <hi>God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>Psal. 60. 1. <hi>O God—thou hast been displeased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isa. 59. 15. <hi>The Lord saw it, and it displeased him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Zech. 1. 2. 15. <hi>The Lord hath been sore displeased, or displeased with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure—I am very sore displeased with the Heathen—I was but a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 6. 1. <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 2. 5. <hi>He shall speak to them in his anger, and vex them in his sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</hi>

            <p>Deut. 9. 19. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, [<hi>I was afraid of the great anger, and hot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure wherewith the Lord was hot against you to destroy you.</hi>] I am sorry that you all differ from <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Expositors suppose that when God is said to have <hi>no pleasure in fools,</hi> or in wickedness, <hi>&amp;c. Eccl.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Ps.</hi> 5. 4. it signifieth <hi>displeasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Scripture ascribeth to God not only <hi>Displeasure,</hi> but <hi>Hatred,</hi> which signifieth the greatest <hi>displeasure,</hi> Deut. 16. 22. Psal. 11. 5. <hi>The wicked, and him that loveth violence, his Soul hateth,</hi> Isa. 1. 14. Mal. 2. 16. Psal. 5. 5. <hi>Thou hatest all the workers of Iniquity,</hi> &amp; 45. 7. <hi>thou hatest wickedness,</hi> Rev. 2. 6. 15. <hi>The Doctrine of the</hi> Nicolaitans—<hi>which I also hate,</hi> Zech. 8. 17. Amos 5. 21 &amp; 6. 8. Jer. 44. 4. <hi>O do not this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing which I hate,</hi> Isa. 61. 8. Prov. 8. 13. &amp; 6. 16. I thought those that overstretch [Esau <hi>have</hi> I hated] would not have denyed all <hi>displeasedness</hi> in God.</p>
            <p>But if I should go further, and cite all the Texts that ascribe even <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> to God, and say <hi>he is angry every day,</hi> &amp;c. and that his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62878:13"/>
wrath shall punish the Wicked, I suppose it would do more to weary the Reader, that knoweth this already, than to convince your Party.</p>
            <p>II. But my 2d Appeal is to the Accurate Scholastick Writers, because I suppose you will say that the Scripture speaketh popularly, &amp; after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men. <hi>Ans.</hi> (Or else it must not speak to Men.) But here I should much more confound most Readers, if I should call them to Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, or Metaphysical Writers; I should cite to them many sheets out of <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Ockam, Durandus, Bonaventure,</hi> and all their followers, who commonly ascribed <hi>Displicency,</hi> as well as <hi>Complacence to God.</hi> If you need Witness in this case, read them, and seek it, and pardon me for not abusing the Reader with such Citations.</p>
            <p>III. The same I say of the consent of Practical Protestant Divines. I do not think the Reader would forgive me, if I should prove that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> and all the Forreign Reformers, and all our Martyrs, and English Divines, Episcopal, Presbyterian, and (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you say against it, to their injury) Independants also ascribe <hi>Displicence</hi> to God: Sure they that translated the Bible did. And surely the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Hildersham, Dod, Greenham, Rogers, Preston, Sibs, Bolton, Whateley, Allen,</hi> and hundreds such, are far from disowning such expressions.</p>
            <p>But methinks I should not need to suppose you to object that it is not God, but Man that you speak of: No, I will not abuse you so much as to suppose that you take man to be more <hi>perfect,</hi> and less <hi>Passive</hi> then God. Indeed <hi>Displicence,</hi> and <hi>Complacence</hi> in God, are Active <hi>ad extra,</hi> and signify but the perfection of his will, and <hi>exeuntèr,</hi> the expressions and effects, and no <hi>Passivity:</hi> But all Creatures are Passive as well as Active, and they are receptive <hi>ab objectis,</hi> both in their <hi>Ideal Conceptions,</hi> and their <hi>Appetites:</hi> And therefore <hi>Displeasure</hi> in a far grosser Passive sense, must be ascribed to the Creature, then to the Creator: and yet without any diminution of felicity.</p>
            <p>And 2. It is certain that Christ himself was <hi>much displeased</hi> with sin on Earth, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14 &amp; 3. 5. And surely he is not any less perfect, nor more reconciled to sin in Heaven. He was <hi>displeased</hi> with it, when he died for it: and is his <hi>will changed</hi> since to favour it? Yea, if you should say that [<hi>sin is nothing, and therefore no object of a Divine Act</hi>] of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, or hatred, but God is said to <hi>will</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> it, only because he doth not <hi>will</hi> or <hi>love</hi> it, but punish it; yet the Church hath long ago Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Monothelites</hi> as Hereticks, and determined that Christ hath <hi>two Wills</hi> and Operations: And therefore as Man, his knowledge and will must have somewhat of Passivity, though not of Pain.</p>
            <p>2. And it's strange that Christ is made our Captain, and manageth a War against Satan in the world, and <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels are engaged in it, and yet have not the least displeasure against Sin and Satan.</p>
            <p>3. And that Christ hath such terrible threatnings against Sin and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62878:13"/>
even <hi>everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels, the Worm that never dieth, and the fire that is not to be quenched, and that he shall come in flaming fire, rendring vengeance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that all they might be damned that obeyed not the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the Wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against all Ungodliness, and Unrighteousness of men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation shall devour the Adversaries, all Kindreds of the Earth shall wail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of him, and he will say, Those mine Enemies that would not I should Reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me: Depart from me all ye that work Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. And yet hath not the least <hi>displeasure</hi> at Sin or Sinners. That most of the World must lye in Hell, and feel no effects of <hi>Christs displeasure,</hi> because he <hi>hath none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Angels and Saints are not perfecter than Christ, but are of his mind, and are displeased with Sin, and Persecutors, and Devils in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Christ.</p>
            <p>The Saints in Heaven have not forgotten their former sins: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them hath some effect: It is not <hi>Pleasedness</hi> with the evil; therefore it is <hi>Displeasedness;</hi> they are not ignorant of all the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Injustice, Violence, Persecution, and Blood-shed on Earth, and all the sufferings of the Just: They love not this with Complacency: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hate it with <hi>Displicence;</hi> or else they are senseless neuters.</p>
            <p>Do the Angels <hi>pour out the Vials,</hi> do the <hi>Souls under the Altar pray for revenge,</hi> are the <hi>Heavens and the holy Apostles and Prophets bid rejoyce over</hi> Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 20. and yet none of them so much as <hi>displeased</hi> at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> sin, or the Churches suffering?</p>
            <p>Sure you do not so far disagree from us in all this, as to deny the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I hope it is but a false Conceit of the unfitness of the word: And if the word [<hi>Displeasure</hi>] do displease you, why would not so accurate a Reprover once tell us what word it is that he would have used instead of it? We that are accused, know that [<hi>Nolition, Displicence, Aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hatred</hi> (or as <hi>Campanella</hi> calls it <hi>Disamor</hi>) are words of the same signification as to the <hi>will,</hi> answering <hi>dislike</hi> in the understanding, (yea, <hi>dislike</hi> oft signifieth both.) If you cannot bear these, sure you are less patient at the words [<hi>Wrath and Anger of God</hi>] &amp;c. what is it that you would have? Even <hi>Nothingness</hi> is an object of Nolition to the blessed; for they are averse to annihilation, so that the quibble that <hi>malum est pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio,</hi> will be here of no use to you; for what is more <hi>displeasing</hi> than <hi>Privation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Brother, I am so far from perceiving any Conviction in your Accusation in this matter, that I must say that you have in this made your self to me what Dr. <hi>O.</hi> did in the case of Concord. You constrain me to bear my publick Testimony against you, when you pretend herein to speak the mind of so great a number of your Acquaintance, when I remember the Sermons that are commonly talkt of, and the Collections
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62878:14"/>
made by the <hi>Friendly Debater,</hi> and many such others, I look to hear e're long from Prefs and Pulpits, [<q>That the Nonconformists teach that no Rebellion, Treason, Perjury, or Wickedness is at all displeasing to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Christ, to Angels, or to any Saint in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though they call Adulterers, Murderers, and such others to Repentance, and Mourning for Sin, and separate from others as too bad for their Communion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at the same time they tell all the wicked, neither God, nor any in Heaven is displeased with them.</q>]</p>
            <p>Fore-seeing this scandal, I humbly address my self to such Accusers with this answer following.</p>
            <p>[Take not verbal differences for real: No doubt but this Persons Errour is meerly verbal: All Mens Studies go not one way: It's like he is not vers'd in Philosophers, and Schoolmens Writings, that use <hi>Displi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> and <hi>Complacence</hi> for meer Nolition and Volition, Hatred, or Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and Love. And though he knew that Scripture, and Christian Writers commonly speak that which he accuseth, he was someway by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed to think that I used the same words in a worse sense than Scripture, and all Writers do (though I excluded sorrow:) And his interesting in his Errour, [<hi>The general received Opinion of all that he hath met with</hi>] doth but signify what sort of Men, and how few he hath met with, or how few Writers on such Subjects he hath read, and remembred, (for doubtless he doth not knowingly abuse them.) And when did all the Protestants, or Nonconformists chuse him to represent them? why is not my word as valid on the contrary, who remember not one Man, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, or Papist, or Heathen that is for the Immortality of the Soul, that is, of the Opinion which he expresseth; except those few that hold that <hi>non datur verè malum,</hi> There is no Evil in the World, but all that we call sin and punishment is good, and miscalled evil by us in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but all willed by God, and those in Heaven? yet even <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and <hi>Peter Sterry</hi> confess a good fort of Evil. And I doubt not but this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is against what he speaketh himself.</p>
            <p>And to stop your Censures, let me ask you, if one mistaker accuse us all, whom we never authorized to represent us, doth this lay so great a blot on us, as an erring Council of Bishops doth on the Clergy, whom they represent: And yet how great a number of Councils have falsly reported the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>I will stop your mouth now but with the last words of <hi>Sulpitius Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> History.

                  </gap> habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur.</hi>] Read the Author, lest you think I made these words for our times. And of their Captain Bishop he saith, [<hi>Certe Ithacium nihil pensi, nihil sancti habuisse definio: Fuit enim audax, loquax, impudens, sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosus, ventri &amp; gulae plurimum impertiens, hic stultitiae eo usque processit, ut omnes etiam sanctos viros quibus aut studium in erat lectionis, aut propositum erat certare jejuniis tanquam Priscilliani socios in crimen arcesseret.</hi>] (And yet saith that the Persecution of the <hi>Priscillianists</hi> did but increase them.) Pardon this digression, by which you may see that if you be not respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for all that Councils, and the Major part of Bishops say or do, much less are we for the verbal Errour of one or a few men, though fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by them on many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby they necessitate these our open dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimings of their words.</p>
            <p>III. My third supposed Errour is much like the former, saying, that [<hi>Though Heaven have no sorrow, it hath great repentance.</hi>] In this [<hi>all Protestants] are</hi> (falsly) said to <hi>be against me.</hi> Here also the Errour is either <hi>Verbal</hi> or <hi>Real.</hi> And, 1. He knows that as to the word all Protestants own the Scripture, which ascribeth <hi>Repenting</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 36. <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 14. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 8, 10. &amp; 26. 3. 13. <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 9, 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 18. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 35. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Am.</hi> 7. 3, 6. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 6. It's true that this is not spoken of God, as if he had any mutability as man hath; But God being infinitely more perfect then man, the phrase is further fetcht, and less proper of God then of man: Therefore it is not the <hi>Name</hi> that he blameth, seeing he owneth the Word of God.</p>
            <p>II. And if it be not the <hi>Name,</hi> but <hi>my sense</hi> of it, do you find where he proveth any wrong sense that I express, or doth he give a better?</p>
            <p>I said in a Book [<hi>There is not such a thing as grief or sorrow known in Heaven.</hi>] The Vindicator citeth this as if it were contrary to, [<hi>There is no sorrow, but displeasure and repentance:</hi>] If he mean not that [<hi>no sorrow,</hi> and <hi>no sorrow</hi>] are Contradictions, he need to have gone no further then the present sentence for it. And if he had proved that [<hi>no sorrow,</hi>] and <hi>Displicence,</hi> or <hi>Repentance</hi> are Contradictions, he would have done that against the Scripture itself, which he intended not, nor can do.</p>
            <p>He hath prevented my labour in transcribing other Authors that use <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> usually for a meer change of the mind, purpose, and practice, without any signification of sorrow, and he appealeth to Scripture use of the words: But is there any thing besides <hi>sorrow,</hi> that by all his words he labours to exclude? And did not I expresly exclude it: And yet is this Reverend man thus puzled at this as a dangerous Doctrine? Doth he attempt in one syllable to blame any thing but the <hi>word?</hi> When I excluded his misliked sense? And he will not deny the ordinary use of the word as without <hi>sorrow?</hi> But let us willingly take the Scripture use:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62878:15"/>
which speaketh of <hi>Repentance</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and on <hi>Earth.</hi> It is not Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on Earth that we have now to treat of: And do you think its a good Argument that there is no Repentance in Heaven without sorrow, because there is none on Earth without it? But even on Earth, <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is either the Act of the <hi>Intellect, and Will,</hi> alone, or an <hi>Act</hi> of these joyned with divers <hi>Passions.</hi> It is sometime so largely taken, that the <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>grief, shame,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and specially <hi>anger</hi> against our selves, are parts of it: But in all common Authors, and ordinary use, and even in Scripture, it is taken for the change of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> the Passions being but effects, or concomitants of it. To <hi>Repent,</hi> in the common and prime sense, is but to <hi>change our Mind and Will, and wish we had not done what we did.</hi> When a thing was well done of us, and yet sped not well, we repent and wish we had not done it for the sake of the event: but we blame not our selves for the Act, nor grieve for that, but for the event. But usually we have cause of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> as well as of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and must joyn them together. But where the Gospel frequently <hi>promiseth Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, pardon, and life together,</hi> and Preacheth both <hi>Repenting</hi> and <hi>Believing</hi> in order to <hi>present joy,</hi> there is little mention of the sorrow in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, save for the murdering of Christ, or some great sin. And Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Repenting are distinguished in Scripture as two things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>I rejoyce, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—For Godly sorrow worketh Repentance to salvation, not to be repented of.</hi>] Is the sense [<hi>Godly sorrow worketh Godly sorrow?</hi>] No, but a change of mind and life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. It is not called [<hi>Repentance for dead works,</hi>] but [<hi>from dead works,</hi>] as speaking the change, rather than the grief.</p>
            <p>Exod. 13. 17. <hi>Lest the people repent when they see war, and they return to</hi> Aegypt: Hence <hi>sear</hi> is the moving Passion, and <hi>Repenting</hi> is <hi>wishing</hi> they had not left <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>returning</hi> is the effect. I am readier to think that sorrow is no part, but an adjunct of Repentance in the strictest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest sense, then that it is no Repentance without sorrow: sure the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying faculties of Man are the <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> and I think the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Acts of Rational true Repentance; are the Acts of the same facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>Sorrow</hi> is but such an adjunct as <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> at our selves are.</p>
            <p>But it is <hi>Repentance in Heaven</hi> that is our subject: And I have cited you Texts enough which speak of <hi>Gods Repenting:</hi> And do you believe that he hath sorrow? You'l say, that's but metaphorically spoken? <hi>Ans.</hi> No more is knowledge, or will, or any such Act that we can speak of God: But if it be not a name unmeet to be spoken of God; are Souls there greater, or happier then he.</p>
            <p>But we find no talk in Scripture of any in Heaven Repenting, save God: No wonder: How little hath God told us of the particular state and action of separated Souls, before the Resurrection; when it pleaseth God so sparingly to mention their present state, (yea, and their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62878:15"/>
in the old Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) shall we feign that he must tell us of all their thoughts?</p>
            <p>But all these Acts of Repentance Souls in Heaven have. 1. They know more of their sins both as to the matter and evil, then ever they did on Earth. 2. They own their Culpability, that is, that they are the Souls that committed these sins, and deserved Death and Hell for them. 3. They know the goodness of all the ways that are contrary to their sin. 4. They love all that good, and hate all their sin more than they did here. 5. They wish they had never committed them. 6. If it were to do again, they would not do it.</p>
            <p>This is proper true Repentance: Either you deny the <hi>Things,</hi> or but the <hi>Name.</hi> If the <hi>Thing,</hi> which of these deny you.</p>
            <p>1. If Saints in Heaven know not sin better then they did here, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is to them as dark as Earth.</p>
            <p>2. If they know not that they themselves were the Subjects, and Actors of these sins, they are ignorant, or erroneous.</p>
            <p>3. If they know not that Gods way is better than sin, they are brutish.</p>
            <p>4. If they love Good, and hate Evil no better then here, then they are no better.</p>
            <p>5. If their will do not wish that they had not done it, then their will is not holy and averse to sin: Either they review it with approbation, (which you believe not) or with dislike, or senselesly with no act of will. If with dislike, and displicence, as before is proved, that hatred, or aversation contains a wish, they had never done it. Else <hi>David, Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> were better Men on Earth then in Heaven: For here they wisht they had not been guilty of Murder, Persecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they wish it not there, their wills are more unholy than here.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you'l say, <hi>It's a vain wish of an impossibility? Ans.</hi> No such matter: I talk not of a <hi>prayer,</hi> or a <hi>desire</hi> that <hi>factum non factum fiat;</hi> but a <hi>Vellem</hi> or <hi>Mallem me non peccasse:</hi> I had rather I had not sinned: And that is not <hi>vain,</hi> which is the <hi>Wills perfection</hi> or Holiness itself.</p>
            <p>6. And that they would not do the like again, I need not prove.</p>
            <p>I were a greater dishonourer of Heavenly felicity, if I denyed any of these, then you feign me to be. I doubt not but those aforesaid that are disposed to obloquy, will take occasion from your words (yea, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists from your entitling all Protestants to it) to say [The Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists (or the Protestants) hold that Murder, Rebellion, Perfecution, and all sin is so small a matter to their Saints in Heaven, that they do not so <hi>much</hi> as Repent of it, or will or wish they had never done it. Therefore they either justify it, or are neuters to it.]</p>
            <p>They say that the Mother of <hi>Lombard, Gratian,</hi> and <hi>Pet. Comestor</hi> being a Whore, said she could not repent of the Fornication that had begot three such Sons: If any say that the Saints in Heaven do not so much as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62878:16"/>
wish, or will that they had not sinned, because Christ is glorifyed by saving them from it, they pervert the Gospel Doctrine of Grace, and would teach the justifyed on Earth to be impenitent.</p>
            <p>But if you return to wordy Quarrels again, and say all these Acts ought not to be called <hi>Repentance,</hi> if they have not sorrow. 1. I durst not so make my self Master of Languages, against the use of all the world. 2. And against the Scripture that speaketh of Gods Repenting. 3. Nor against Etymology. 4. And against the nature of the Case. Men in flesh have sin and danger, and Bodies lyable to sensible commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits, and so to grief. Those in Heaven are not such: They have no cause of grief, and yet have renewed faculties of mind and will, which disgust sin, and hate it, and are turned from it to a contrary love and life. Even here, if a man by his own sin and folly had shut up himself twenty years in a Dungeon, or put out his Eyes, and never seen the light, suppose this man suddenly delivered into the light, and he would not stay to mourn for his former state, but the sudden joy would exclude sorrow: And yet his change would be a true Repentance for what he did.</p>
            <p>But as you have wronged all Protestants by fathering your Errour on them, you have made it my duty to vindicate them with my self.</p>
            <p>But I am grown such a Prodigal of my Reputation with Men of such a judging disposition, that I will cast away a little more of it on your Censure. The Scripture speaketh so much more of our Glory after the Resurrection, then before, and purposely keepeth us so low in our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the particular state of Souls before, and <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you take not for an Heretick) for all his Treatise against <hi>the sleep of Souls,</hi> did think the difference was so great between the state of the separated Souls, and that at the Resurrection, that I must profess my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to be so great, that I am uncertain whether this first state do set all the blessed so high, as that no thought is consistent with it, that hath the least degree of suffering.</p>
            <p>For, 1. I know that all Creatures are Passive. 2. If felicity be imperfect till the Resurrection, it must be privatively, or positively, or both. If privatively, how can I prove that nothing positive may concur, when privation is as bad. 3. I think that Protestants mostly agree, that Christs own Soul, while his Body was in the Grave, was in Paradise, in Joy, and yet in a state that was partly Penal, as it was a separation from the Body by death. And that all Souls in Heaven are happy, and yet in a state partly Penal in Heaven itself, as they are separated from the body, and short of the Resurrection: For not only the minute of dying, but the state of death is Penal, to a Soul that desireth a return to the body: And yet Heaven may be to it unconceivable felicity. I only hence conclude, that we must not take on us to know more than we do of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62878:16"/>
separate Souls, nor to make a measure or manner of blessedness for them of our own heads, nor to apply every Text to them that is spoken of the state after the Resurrection: There is enough besides to feast our joyful hopes.</p>
            <p>IV. Some few other practical Doctrines we differ about, as where <hi>pag.</hi> 30. you say [<q>I doubt not to affirm that doing that which a Law requires, so far as the intention is moved by the Law, is a justifying of it. And sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any Law on the consideration of its Penalties, is so far a justifying its preceptive part, as not so great an evil as the Penal.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I first premise that this is little or nothing to the Cause I pleaded for: For whereas you say [<hi>None that I know of say it is a duty simply, or without any dependence or human Sanction.</hi>] I have largely told you that taking publick <hi>Communion to be but</hi> do facto, <hi>what it is,</hi> and the <hi>Lyturgy as commonly used,</hi> I take it to be a duty to hold such Communion (where no better at least is) though there were no human Sanction, but voluntary Concord; and this by vertue of Gods great Commands of glorifying him with one mind and mouth in Unity, Love, and Peace; not an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table duty, but a duty <hi>rebus sic stantibus.</hi> It is in obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands more than Mens, that I have gone to the Parish Churches; and would have gone as much, if the Law had not commanded it, but only had deprived me of better.</p>
            <p>But as to your <hi>undoubted</hi> affirmation, I am as much past doubt that it is not true as you unlimitedly express it. The <hi>intention may be moved by a Law for the effects. or consequents sake, and not justify the Law,</hi> but only justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the <hi>Act of the Subject:</hi> Yea, it may be moved by the formal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law-giver, exprest by his Law, and yet not justify the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were Taxed with others by <hi>Augustus</hi> Law: They were moved by that Law, and its effects to pay the Tax: And yet justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed not the Law, nor decided the Case, whether it were by Right or Usurpation: All Conquered People by unjust War, may obey a Taxing Law: The <hi>Israelites</hi> might obey the <hi>Philistines,</hi> that forbad them Smiths, and Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They may labour, and Travel, and pay Taxes, moved by unjust Laws, and yet not justify the Law, but only their own Acts. When Christ sent <hi>Peter</hi> to take a Fish with Money in his Mouth, and pay Tribute, the Law moved his intention, because of the offence that would follow the breaking of it: And yet his answer intimateth that he justified not the Law: If he carried his Cross at their Command, that justified not their Command. If he bid us give our Coat to him that sueth us for our Cloak, if the Law be against us, it proveth not he bids us justify the Law. If a Confessor go to Prison, or Banishment, or to the Gallows, or fire without resistance, to do this as moved by the Law, is no justifying of the Law. If the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> should pay each man a yearly Tribute for liberty of Conscience, or the Christians under the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62878:17"/>
Turk pay Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-mony, moved by the Law, this justifieth not the Law. I am persuaded your Church would gladly pay somewhat for liberty of Worship, and yet not justify the Law that required it.</p>
            <p>If the Law required us to meet for Gods Worship at an inconvenient place or time, or to use a version of Psalms in Meeter, or a Translation of Scripture that is not the best, he that useth these in obedience to this (because Concord in these according to Law, is better then a better Version, Translation, Hour, Place, with Discord, and because Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may do more good then better circumstances would without it) yet doth not hereby justify the Law. If the Law bid you appear before Justices or Judges that are bad men, and unjust, you may obey the Law, and not justify it.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, I will not aggravate your Errour by its ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But you and I tell the world, what need all men have of pardon in our mistakes, even when we are most confident.</p>
            <p>2. And as to your second affirmation, it is not true without limitation, [<q>That submitting to a Law, on consideration of the Penalties, is so far a justifying its preceptive part, as not so great an evil as the Penal.</q>]</p>
            <p>This is confused work: The <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceptive part of the Law</hi> is <hi>actus praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,</hi> the Commanders Act; The instances before mentioned tell you that this may be obeyed for the Penalty sake, when yet the evil of the Command, or Law, is sinful, and so worse than the Penalty or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which are not sin: Forgive me for telling you that you should have distinguished the <hi>preceptive part of the Law</hi> from the <hi>matter Commanded</hi> by it, and the <hi>evil of the Law and Law-maker,</hi> from the <hi>evil of the Obeyer;</hi> and then only have concluded that he that obeyeth a Precept only to avoid the Penalty, professeth the Penalty to be worse then his Act of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. But he doth not make it worse then the Law, or the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers sin.</p>
            <p>If a Law did Command me to appear before a Lay-Civilian, who useth the Keys of the Church, and this on pain of Death, or Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I may be moved both by Precept and Penalty to appear, as being better then either refusal, or penalty, and yet not think that the Law or Precept is a less evil in itself, or its ends, to the Law-maker, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? (Whether this thought be right or wrong, is nothing to our question) so if I were by Law commanded to joyn in the Lyturgy, on pain of Death, or Imprisonment, or being deprived of all other Church Worship, I may think this Law worse than my sufferings, and yet think my Obedience to it my Duty.</p>
            <p>Yea, if a Law bid me play with Childrens Bubbles, or any such tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sling, on pain of Death, the Case would be the same.</p>
            <p>And if any should take occasion by your confident judgment to refuse to obey, wherever he may not justify the preceptive part of the Law, the effect would be worse then of my naming Dr. <hi>O.</hi>

            <p>I Told you I have no leisure to write Books for my self now: Thus far I have written for Truth, and Love, and Unity. As to all your Charges against my self, I say again, I will not justify my self: My na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> which is so heinously taken, I have told you the occasion of. To which I truly add, 1. I did it as a distinctive note, that the Readers might know what it was that I answered. 2. And I that use to put my Name to my Writing, never dreamt that it would have been taken any worse to name him, than to confute a Writing that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, uncontrolled supposition bore his Name. Had I thought it would have been taken so ill (while the Super-Conformists bear far more) it's two to one but I had forborn it. And now it's done, I am yet but little wiser, when I think of the publick Cause fore-described, I am ready to think it should weigh down all your contrary reasons: When I feel in my self an inward averseness to strive with any by ungrateful words, and hear from you how ill it's taken, then I dislike it: And my own selfish lothness to be the object of the hard thoughts, and talk of so many of you, is some byass to my judgment. I wholly follow the Rule you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to choose that which doth most good, and least hurt: And truly the reverence of your own, and some others judgment, telling me that it doth more hurt than good, doth turn the Scales, and make me repent that I named the Doctor.</p>
            <p>And I leave your Charges against me to their best advantage, to the Reader, though my inclination is much to open the mistakes.</p>
            <p>I may give a brief touch to your self, for your information, which I expect not should affect the Reader, suppose your Book to lie open before you.</p>

            <p>2. I named not Mr. <hi>Ralphson,</hi> till all said he openly owned his Books in Prison. Had you rather all that Worship God in Parish Churches, were persuaded that it is Idolatry, than Mr. <hi>Ralphson</hi> should be confuted by name?

            <p>2. I offered you to stop it.</p>
            <p>3. Is it disingenuity in me to tell you of twenty untruths in your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letter (and many notorious,) and ingenuity in you to be offended for being told of them, rather than for writing them? This is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the World, that taketh the detecter only for the sinner.</p>

            <p>2. It's strange so knowing a man should think that bad Arguments, with a valued Name, are not dangerous! Yes, even against common sense, as those for Transubstantiation. To confute your self, you add, that [<hi>on all sides peoples Opinions are mostly, and most strongly mastered by affections, and it's beyond all our power to cure the disorder.</hi>] And yet is there no danger from Names?</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. Sir, if telling me of any sin that ensnareth Souls, be using me <hi>more scornfully then the most virulent adversaries,</hi> spare me not, but use me so: wo to me, if Repentance become odious and intolerable.</p>
            <p>But I must stop, lest I cross my purpose of not writing for my self, but you.</p>
            <p>The conclusion of all is, dear Brethren, the longer I study the Gospel, and the longer I live in the world, the more fully I am Convinced that Love is the great work of the Spirit, and the Men that Love most, are the best Men, and those the worst, that have least love: And I would write in golden Letters as my Motto, GOD IS LOVE, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: And if Christians loved no more than others, they would be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they: And that Love desireth union and familiarity; and that censoriousness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and flying from each other, both signify, and breed hatred. Could we but so live as to make all our Enemies believe that we heartily love them, it would conquer their enmity, and tie their Hands, and Tongues, by reconciling their Hearts. I know many at this time, to whom God marvellously performeth that promise, <hi>Blessed are the Meek, for they shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inherit the Earth.</hi> No winds root up the grass, which overthrow the Oaks. <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all the world. These overcame Philosophy, and Empire at first. Power may overcome Bodies, and Argument stop Mens Mouths, and yet more enrage them unto Enmity: But Love Conquereth Hearts: Love the Conformists, if you would do them good, or preserve your self from evil: Not that all men must be loved alike, nor sin loved for the Persons sake; but every one according to the measure of his amiableness. Young Christians are usually like young fruit, harsher, and sourer than the mellow fruits of holy ripeness, and experienced age. Who would think, that did read the Epistles of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom Jesus loved, breathing out <hi>Love, Love, Love,</hi> that this very man had three times offended Christ, by sinning against Love. First, by ambitious desiring to be above his fellows: Secondly, by offering to call for fire from Heaven against the refusers of Christ: Thirdly, by forbidding one to cast out Devils, (and do good) in Christs name, because he followed not with them, (like those that now would have some faulty men forbidden to Preach.) Love groweth as Grace groweth. If my confuting the Principles and Practices that are fitted to destroy Love, by Censures, Contempt, and unjust alienation be interpreted as contrary to Love, let but the Censurers love so much the more, so it be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as such, and not a dividing Party only, and I have my end.</p>

               <hi>SECT. 5.</hi> A Comparison of the use of a faulty Translation of the Scripture, and a faulty Lyturgy.</head>
            <p>IN Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days the Bishops Translation of the Bible, and that called the Old one being faulty, were only in use. King <hi>James</hi> procured a better, but the Lyturgy still retained, the Old one. Suppose a Law were made that only the Old faulty Translation be used; many refuse it, and suffer for it; the Parliament cometh and establisheth the New Translation, and swear all men to promote it as a part of Reformation; we are in possession of it for sixteen years: then a Law is made that all shall go to Prison that use any but the Old; two thousand break this Law, and use the New, and suffer part of the penalty, and shift from the rest as long as they can. At last the State is resolved to suffer them no longer, but, in Prison they shall lie: Hereupon many suffer Imprisonment, many die there. Some few in <hi>London</hi> keep up secret Worship with the New Translation, and others go to the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Old is used. In the Countries there is not past one Minister in twelve or twenty Miles that keeps up a Meeting in the use of the New one. The few that yet do, say, that [<hi>to use the Old one, or joyn with such as do, is Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaking, and false Worship, and unlawful, and a going back from Reformation.</hi>] Some that live in Countries where none in twenty Miles openly use the New one, come to <hi>R. B.</hi> for counsel; he desireth them to bring one of the contrary Judgment, and judge when they hear both: He tells them, that, 1. They should keep up the New Translation as far as they can in Gods Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, while the hurt will not be greater than the benefit. 2. That when they have no Publick Church or Worship to joyn with, but what useth the Old one, they should rather joyn with such than none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As also when they cannot have the New one without more hurt than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. 3. And that while they can have the New one, they should not renounce Communion with the Churches that use the Old one, as separating from it as unlawful, but only disown the <hi>faults</hi> of the Old one, while they disown not the Communion of the Churches in the use of it.</p>
            <p>The other say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 1. That it is a cursed thing to offer God a worse, while we have better. 2. That we are sworn against it. 3. That it is false Worship, and obeying man before God. 4. That we do but keep our possession, which they would put us out of, and it's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from us, and not we from them. 5. That we keep to Gods Word, which is the only Rule. And therefore Communion with the Old Translation is unlawful, and we should rather suffer death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. B.</hi> answereth, I. 1. That it is a cursed thing to give God no Publick Worship, because we cannot have the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Translation, and to live like Atheists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we cannot have what we would. <hi>None<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is worse than the Old. Family VVorship without Church VVorship, is worse than an Old Translation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. And that it is not we that offer God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the worse before the better; it is they that exclude the better, which we protest against, having not our choice.</p>
            <p>II. That he that sware to give over all Church VVorship, unless he have the New Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, swore wickedly li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e an Atheist; and he that swore to communicate with no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church that used the Old Translation, swore wickedly like a Schismatick; and he that swore that Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence should never return him to a necessity of using the Old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> swore blasphemously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he could have governed the World against God.</p>
            <p>III. That all Worship is so far <hi>false</hi> as it is faulty; That to forsake all Publick Worship when we cannot have the better Translation, is to be righteous unrighteously, <hi>over much,</hi> and <hi>too little,</hi> and to disobey both God and man.</p>
            <p>IV. Keep your <hi>Possession</hi> as long as you can without more hurt than good. I am not one that ever strove to take it from you. But do your Brethren in Prison enjoy Publick Worship? You'l
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62878:20"/>
say, they <hi>do better.</hi> It's easier bearing their Imprisonment, Poverty and Death, than your own. But what shall ten parts of the Kingdom do, that must have the Old Translation or none? You'l say, I suppose, <hi>They may give over all Church Worship as impossible, and take up with Family Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But stay, 1. Must you not first prove the <hi>Old</hi> so <hi>bad,</hi> as that <hi>no-Church</hi> Worship is better? Have you proved this? 2. Will not your Reason prove, that we must also separate from <hi>you?</hi> Have not weak Ministers as bad faults as a weak Translation? 3. What's become then of your saying, <hi>We had Possession?</hi> Have they Possession of better that have <hi>none at all?</hi> Or, will you be <hi>without all,</hi> because you had <hi>once Possession</hi> of better? And will it excuse your ungodliness, that you can lay the blame on them that <hi>dipossest</hi> you? Or if they be Schismaticks for so using you, doth it follow that you are none, if you persuade all to separate from all Gods Church Worship rather than joyn where the Old Translation is used.</p>
            <p>V. Gods Word is the <hi>Rule;</hi> but only a <hi>general Rule</hi> for <hi>words,</hi> modes and circumstances. To love God and our Neighbour, and the Unity of the Church, are his greatest Commands. Go learn what these mean: To violate these, and forsake all Church Worship, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the best Translation, is not to keep to <hi>the Rule,</hi> but most grosly to violate it in the greatest Commands against many Scripture Admonitions, which vehemently urge you to Love and Unity.</p>
            <p>But, good friend, if really Christ and Scripture be your Guide, I desire no more; tell me, and lay by partiality; <hi>Did not Christ and his Apostles use both in the Synagogues, Church. Meetings, and Writings a faulty Translation of the Old Testament, and as bad as ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Deny it if you can for shame. Though sometimes they varyed, they mostly used the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which <hi>our faulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Translation of the Old Testament is made, as it differs from the Hebrew. Is this no Consutation of you? Yea, Christ and the Apostles used it the rather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was in <hi>common use.</hi> 2. And are you sure that among so many Greek differing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies as we have of the New Testament, that you use and follow none but the best.</p>
            <p>I would add a similitude, supposing that we had just possession of the Publick <hi>Church-place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This is no better than if you would tell all men, they should die rather than eat Brown Bread, if force take all other from them, because it is unjustly done, and they had possession of better.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Scripture is Gods own Word: A mis-translation maketh that to be his word that is not; which sure is a tenderer matter than in what words we speak our own minds to God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure a depravation of Scripture is more than a Ceremony: Were Lyturgies such an alteration of Gods own words, you would more plausibly accuse them. One that said, God said this or that, which he said not, was worse tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one that spake his own words undecently to God. To say, this is Gods word, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not, is indeed adding to it; but so it is not to speak words as our own. How much the <hi>Septuagint</hi> differs from the Hebrew, how many Verses it leaveth out, how many additions and alterations it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, is commonly known. Christs and the Apostles use of this, was no approbation of its faults, much less their presence in the Synagogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when others read <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets in them. And the <hi>Psalms</hi> in the <hi>Septuagint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Translation were part of their Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. For man to speak faultily is no wonder: It hath a more plausible pretence for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to say that men corrupt the word of God. And yet when it is but such an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Humane Imperfection, it is no just pretence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62878:20"/>But yet a word more; <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Do you think that the Pharisees and Scribes had so much of the gift of Extemporate Prayer, that they could, and did use to make long Prayers, as if it were by the Spirit Extempore? <hi>Say so,</hi> and you will disgrace the Doctors Arguments, that lay so much on this manner of praying. No doubt but it was Forms and Lyturgies that they used; yet when Christ condemneth them for praying in the streets to be seen, and using long prayer for a pretence to devour Widdows houses; <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Did Christ speak one word against them as <hi>Forms or Lyturgies?</hi> Did he want Zeal or Knowledge? <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Had they not been good in themselves, what cloak could they have made for so great evil? <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Did Christ or his Apostles ever forbear the Synagogues for the sake of these long Lyturgies? Come friends, there is no end, nor much hope in disputing against fixed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and wrong confident Conceits, how clear soever the Light be against it. Hold your Judgment, and I shall hold mine, till God irresistibly reconcile us; and if you cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, I can forgive you, but not own the guilt of your mistakes, and the Effects. I have too much already of my own, I had rather you accused me, than Conscience, for wilful contracting any more. The Lord save us from our Enemies, but more especially from our Friends, and all their Temptations, and above all, from our selves.</p>
            <p>It amazeth me to hear wise and godly men say, [<hi>It is Popery that is coming in upon us;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Let us all forsake the Parish-Churches,</hi> Quasi die. The Enemy will take the City within these few years; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Let us all go out of it to day. Like him that killed himself for fear of dying some years hence. Dementation goeth before Perdition. Who knoweth not that the Religion of the Parish-Churches is like to be the National Religion? And shall we persuade Protestants to leave them all? Passion provoked by some mens badness, hath too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Love to Conformists in some mens minds, so that they scruple not too uncharitable opinions and words of them. This is contrary to Christian Love. I doubt not but there are hundreds of godly Conformable Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> On <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1662. Seven thousand or more did Conform, that had been kept in, in the Parliaments time; were all those seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand tolerable the year before, and ungodly the next year? Many Conformists now in <hi>London</hi> were taken for very good men in 1659. At once the other extream, most study to get them out; and shall we also call all men on pain of hazarding their Souls to forsake them? A very great Church-man above 40 years ago was heard say to his Brethren; <hi>The Non-conformable Puritans are Snakes: We have the Law against them, and can tread them down when we will: But it is the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Puritan that is the Devil of</hi> England, <hi>to be cast out:</hi> And shall we second this, and that as in opposition to it? Grace is lost as far as Christian impartial Love is lost. And they that lose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion themselves, which lyeth in Love, are like to be no good Keepers of it in the Church. If a good Man that we value become a danger to the truth, we are angry if his Errour be but contradicted, lest his Name be blemished: But some dare say the Conformists are all false, ready to betray the Church to Papists: who nowdo far more to keep them out then we do. This is against <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17. If there be any such Conformists high or low, I am none of their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; God will find them out, and judge them: But I am confident that it is also Conformists (by the advantage of their Possession) that will do more to stop their desired success, than Nonconformists can do. I am sure Bishop <hi>Iewel, Usher, Morton, Hall, Downame, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. were far from Popery. And what man living hath written stronglier against it, than Dr. <hi>Isaac Barrow,</hi> (against whose Book a Doctor hath newly dasht his Reputation, as a bubble against a Rock: And what the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> and many more have done, is known.</p>

            <p>AS all men ought to have a just regard of their own and their neighbours reputations; so the over-much tenderness of the guilty and the proud, doth make it a matter of much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for an impartial man to know whether, and when he should name, or make known the persons whom he doth oppose or blame: Though the resolution seem easie both to them that have no charity to caution them, and to them that will do no duty, that displeaseth others.</p>

            <p>And the Papists quite out-do us in naming their Opponents, and their Errours, and yet not renouncing Communion with them, but keeping them in the bosom of their Church; as whole loads of Books written by the Schoolmen, and several Sects and Orders against each other shew: And specially the Controversies between the Seculars and Regulars, sharply handled by <hi>Watson.</hi> in his <hi>Quodlibits,</hi> and divers others: And newly <hi>Peter Walsh,</hi> that calls himself <hi>Valesius,</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rjeants,</hi> and his <hi>Blaklows</hi> Controversies tell us more. But none more than the Jesuists and Jansenists: did we differ about half as many and weighty points as are recited in the <hi>Iesuites Morals,</hi> and their Charge against the <hi>Iansenists,</hi> we should scarce think each other fit to be Members of one Communion.</p>
            <p>And naming Opponents is oft necessary to make the Reader know what Books we write against for distinction sake.</p>
            <p>2. And there is yet another great cause of naming faulty men both (otherwise) godly and heretical. The Duty of a Publick or National Repentance oft requireth the mention of publick sins and sinners; (specially if they be our own) God long forbeareth the publick National sins of Ancestors, to see if Posterity, (who are the same <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,</hi> though not the same Persons) will prevent his Judgments by Repentance: In which case they must confess their own, and their Fore Fathers sins. This was the due practice of the Church of Old, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. &amp; 107. and many other shew; and the prayers of <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> and others: they named many, and bewailed more of their National and Fore Fathers sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if they do not, Christ will name them for them, as he did the blood shed from <hi>Abels</hi> till <hi>Zach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rias,</hi> and will revenge all together on the Impenitent Generation <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. It was not to call dead men to Repentance, that all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned faults of good and bad men are recorded in the Scripture: But it is partly for the exercise of National Repentance, and partly for a warning to the living, that good mens names tempt them not to sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea that shaming them is a mercy to us all to this day, is evident, in that where God recordeth any sin, without laying some reproach upon it, Satan maketh a snare of it, to persuade us it is no sin. What abundance have been emboldened to Lie, because the Midwives in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> Lies are recorded without adjoyned reproof. Polygamy is pleaded for as lawful by that reason; and the Jews did so by Divorce; and some by drinking to excess, or overthrow of reason: All of us take it for a duty to bewail the Nations resistance of Reformation, and cruelty to the Martyrs in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, and such like as part of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Humiliation.</p>
            <p>3. When pernicious Deceivers endanger the Church, by their Sophistry and Reputation, especially by publick Writings which survive them. God hath named in Scripture <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Elymas,</hi> and the Party called <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> whom his Soul hated, and largely described many throughout the New Testament, especially Epist. to <hi>Gal. Col.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Iude, Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. And all that were faithful to the true Faith did of old name with detestation the <hi>Ebionites, Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Gnosticks; Valentinians, Basilidians, Manichees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Priscilianists,</hi> and <hi>Arians, Sabellians, Paulinists, &amp;c.</hi> And since the Reformation, the soberest Reformers named with zealous renunciation the names of not only such as <hi>Caesar Vaninus,</hi> and <hi>Pomponatius, Valent. Gentilis, Servetus</hi> (whom they burnt) but also those Captains of Sedition, that were the Heads of dangerous Sects. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Muncers</hi> case they commonly mention with detestation; and <hi>Ionn</hi> of <hi>Leydens,</hi> and the rest at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>II. But there are many things that stand up against this duty, and turn men from it, or make it doubtful in particular Instances.</p>
            <p>1. One is the great abuse of it by the Antients, and the mischiefs done by that abuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for greatest grief to read it, and to feel the fruit of it to this day, which while I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Councils and Church-History, many cannot bear it. The case of the <hi>Easter</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in all the Christian World, even in <hi>Brittain</hi> tells it us: The shameful Catalogue of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>Philastrius,</hi> yea many in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tell it us: So do the Controversies with the <hi>Audians, Novatians, Donatists,</hi> the <hi>Nestorians, Eutychians, Monothelites,</hi> the <hi>tria Capitula</hi> out of <hi>Theodorite, Theodore Mops.</hi> and <hi>Ibas:</hi> the Image Controversies, the <hi>Corrupti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Phantasiasts,</hi> and many more such: And since the heat of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> (such as <hi>Marbachius, Heshasius, Westphalus, Gallus, Ambsdorsius,</hi> and lately <hi>Calovius,</hi> and many still) against the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> The over-violent usage of the Remonstrants in <hi>Holland,</hi> the strife at the City of <hi>Frankford,</hi> between the Conformists, and Nonconformists; the Violences, and Reproaches of Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independants, Erastians, and Anabaptists against each other in <hi>England,</hi> with the evil means, and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and woful effects. The <hi>Scots</hi> Covenants excluding from their publick Union there and here, all the Diocesan Divines and Party, even such as <hi>Usher, Morton, Hall, Davenant,</hi> &amp;c. These great abuses of over-doers, and dividers, make many charitable men think, that it is best to mention no mens faults at all, save u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter Enemies.</p>
            <p>2. And another grand dissuasive, is the certain abuse that bad men will make of it: Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spit-fires do already write books full of palpable Lies against other men (of which I have had a notable part:) And in common speech and reproach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make many that they converse with, believe these lies? And if we call each other to Repentance, or confess our own sin, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Malice will turn it to a common scorn, and say, they are all alike, and worse than they confess.</p>
            <p>3. And another hinderance is, that we think controverted Cases are not matter of Censure: And these are Controversies.</p>
            <p>4. But the greatest impediment of all, is the <hi>Natural selfishness, Pride</hi> and <hi>Impatience that is in all,</hi> so far as they are unmortified, and unhumbled, and <hi>interessing</hi> God and his Truth, and Cause, more deeply than is just, in the interest of our selves, our Parties, and our Opinions.</p>
            <p>To these four Cases I briefly say, 1. The avoiding of the contrary extream, hindered not God and good men from mentioning <hi>Diotrephes, Demas,</hi> the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and all aforesaid.</p>
            <p>2. If we shall omit all duty that men will abuse, we shall do none, or next to none. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is most honourable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except Innocency: And they would reproach men less, if they more confest their sin themselves: And a true Confession is a true description of the Case, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them that make it worse then it is, or lay the fault of the Guilty on the Innocent.</p>
            <p>3. What Heresy or sin almost is not controverted? Satan will make a Controversy of all, if that shall serve: <hi>Arrianism</hi> is a sad instance, and <hi>Socinianism,</hi> which is much worse, and Popery is more disputed for than they all.</p>
            <p>4. God hateth the Proud, and will abase them, and pardoneth none but the Penitent, and he that sinfully saveth his Credit, shall most lose it: Repentance is a great, hard, necessary work, we can easily call other men to repent.</p>
            <p>III. Having told you my judgment, I will as this worthy Brother adviseth, yet further review my own actions.</p>
            <p>I am one of those that have formerly imitated <hi>Austin</hi> in some Confessions, and Retractations; but I cannot make every scornful expectants Opinion my measure, nor retract all that every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream'd Opposer, or Dissenter doth dislike. And I am one that long, and very dearly endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have prevented those <hi>Overturnings,</hi> which I bewail: and at that time I thought them a sin so great, as I will not now describe, and took in the prognostick of their Consequents, in which I have only been thus far mistaken, that Gods wonderful mercy hath hitherto made them much easier then I expected: I mentioned them most openly and plainly then, to convince the Guilty, and save the Tempted; and I have oft since made some mention of them, not to call
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62878:22"/>
the dead to Repentance, but the Societies in their humiliations, and the Nation, and to preserve the living from the guilt of participation, and imitation. But I find that some much mistake me, and think that all the Persons that I have named, I mention as intolerable, or make them worse than they are, and equal the better with the worse, yea, make the Welsh Itinerants worse then ignorant, vicious, meer readers. All this is far from my words and thoughts.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Clement Writer</hi> wrote two Books against the Scripture, the Ministry, and me, I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him modestly in my Book, called, <hi>The unreasonabless of Infidelity:</hi> The Ranters I detested: The Quakers, when they bitterly reviled me, I gave free leave to dispute with me in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as long as they would: The Seekers, that said, Scripture, Church Ministry, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were all lost, till new Miracles restored them, I dealt with peaceably: But I confess I took all these for such as were as unfit for my Communion, as they thought me for theirs, and mischievous to the Souls of Men. But I never thought of as equal with these the Persons that I then wrote against, as <hi>Antinomians,</hi> nor those that I now name on such accounts. I know that the <hi>Libertines</hi> Opinions called <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> by too near consequence subvert the Gospel. But I believe that the good men did not see such Consequences, but believed the fundamentals, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch they so subverted, and erred through ignorance, and unskilfulness, and confusion in managing Disputes, and zeal for Free-Grace, drew them in the dark to injure, and dishonour it: These erroneous Men, for ought I know, might love God through Christ more then I; and if so, they were so much better men then I. <hi>Amesius</hi> saith, that Theology is so connext, that every Errour by consequence overthroweth the foundation: If that be so, who is not guilty of it? I write here against no man as Episcopal, Presbyterian, Independant, Erastian, or Anabaptist; but only against hating one another on such accounts, and doing those things by alienation, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, opposition, or other aversation unnecessarily, which signify detestation, or want of Love, or tend thereto.</p>
            <p>As to the men named by me, take not the knowledge of their Opinions from me, but from their publick Books: Mr. <hi>Erbury, Prince, Lilburn,</hi> and such others have spoken too loud by the Press: I think much better of Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh, W. Sedgwick, Den, Hobson,</hi> &amp;c. and yet better of Mr. <hi>Powell, Cradok, Lloyd,</hi> whom I named, whom you may know in print: [The last, by a Dialogue between <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Lázarus,</hi> about his Soul, and Letters to Mr. <hi>Erbury.</hi>]</p>
            <p>That which I say of such, I fully believe; that is, 1. That the Dr. greatly mistakes in his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as if Lyturgies had been the only cause, or at least greater than they were, of a defective Ministry, when so many of its greatest Adversaries have been so faulty, and defective.</p>
            <p>2. Because those Errours may be dangerous to the hearers, which God forgiveth to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant speaker, I assert, that sound Doctrine read out of Notes or Books, is less hurtful to the Hearers, then dangerous practical Erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r delivered with fluent extemporate fervency, and that when <hi>Calvin, Hildersham,</hi> and such great, and holy men, prayed usually in the Pulpit by a Form, they failed not of the Spirits help, so much as they that extempore pray erroneously. And that Mr. <hi>Phil. Nye</hi> spake not mistakingly, when (to me) he wish't <hi>that the publick Congregations in</hi> Wales <hi>had good Sermon books read to them,</hi> (though men should call them Homelies in contempt; not to put down Preaching, but where it's wanting: And that a very excellent Ministry beyond Sea, use publick Lyturgies, and Pulpit Forms: And excellent Holy Men in <hi>England</hi> long used the English Lyturgy, from whom I never would have separated; even such A. Bishops, and Bishops, as <hi>Granmer, Parker, Grindal, Abbot, U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And I do not believe that the <hi>Westminster</hi> Assembly were all, save eight Ministers, void of the Spirit, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Communion, while they used the Lyturgy: Nor yet that of the 9000 that were in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches in 1659. or 1660. the 7000 that Conformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1662. were suddenly made insufficient, if they were sufficient before, (though I meddle not with the question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And yet against the contrary extream, I say, if many thousands be not in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom Bishops have Excommunicated, and thought intolerable, yea, whom great Councils have called Hereticks, wo to those Bishops that are worse than they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62878:23"/>I conclude with thanks to my Reverend Monitor, and tell him, that I would sain (whose Censure soever I undergo,) avoid both their sin, who undervalue mens Piety for tolerable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp; condemn those that are better than themselves, (&amp; themselves by consequence much more;) and theirs who in honour of good mens names, extenuate their dangerous errours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and practices, and hinder publick Repentance, forgiveness, and deliverance, by hiding, or smoothing over publick sins. But being my self lyable to forgetfulness, when I remember what answer a false Argument calls for, and what notice young people need for their preservation, I am sometime less sensible of the impatience of the partial, and mistaken, and how much harder it is to bear blame, then to deserve it, and how ill the effects of their impatience may be. Therefore while I stand to the Rule that he mentioneth, if I have by ignorance, hast, or any other Cause, done that by naming, or confuting any, which hath truly a greater tendency to do hurt, than to do good, I repent of all that's so said and done, and ask forgiveness of God and Man.</p>
            <p>And if any be unhumbled for the publick sins of the Land, or any Party of their Minds, which have dishonoured God and our Religion, and hardened Adversaries, and brought us all into distress, and threaten yet worse to all the Land, and our Posterity, the Lord humble them before it be too late.</p>
            <p>And if any that are far worse themselves, take advantage from any mens Errours, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, or Confessions, to feed their own, and others malice, to reproach Piety, to oppress; or calumniate the Innocent, and lay the faults of a few that got military advantages, upon them that were furthest from the guilt, yea, on the Nation, and the Protestant Cause, the day is at hand, that God will vindicate the just, and stop the mouths of false Accusers, with as great severity at least, as we can well desire. And delay is no violation of his promise: Though he stay long, he will avenge them speedily, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. And he knoweth that their day is coming: And then we shall say, it was the fittest time.</p>
