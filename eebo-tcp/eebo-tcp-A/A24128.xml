            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HOW agreeable it will be to preſent the World, with theſe ſmall effects of my Leaſure, that is filled with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſoaring Geniouſes,</hi> I know not; but
<pb facs="tcp:51772:3"/>
at leaſt how pardonable it may be, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, when I have told how this little Hiſtory of the Antient Nations of the Chriſtian <hi>Jacobites</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> amongst other looſe Papers, came to my hands in the moſt caſual manner, after it had been aſleep in a Repoſitory altogether unſuſpected of any ſuch thing for almoſt ſixteen years paſt, when more out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity then ought elſe, finding the Name of <hi>Jacobite</hi> upon it, an Appellation we now give to the followers of an unhappy <hi>Prince</hi> fled to the <hi>French King</hi> for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; I look't, and what, I imagine, the rest of the World, may be, was inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know, whether the Sect of the Old and new <hi>Jacobites</hi> reſembled one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much in Principles as they did in Name; to which alſo the Novelty of the
<pb facs="tcp:51772:3"/>
Hiſtory, and the Elegancy of the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> added ſome strength of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having found it ſo handſom, and ſo compendious a Narrative, and ſo many miſtakes rectified by it, which we had imbibed from other Histories, I could not forbear in imitation of the <hi>French,</hi> who, with moſt applauded and indefatigable application, bring all the Learning of the World into their own Country, wiſhing the ſight of it in our own <hi>Engliſh Tongue:</hi> And my Zeal for it extended ſo far, not finding any one had done it, that together with the proſpect of a moſt taking, and acceptable diverſion, it imployed me with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation in the rendring of it into our own Natural Language; which, with what aſſiſtance the difficulty of ſome places made
<pb facs="tcp:51772:4"/>
neceſſary through my unacquaintance with many of their Ceremonies, I accompliſhed in ſome few dayes, and brought to this preſent ſhape, in which you now ſee it; which, allowing for thoſe inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that attend moſt Tranſlations, the Graces, and Idioms in any Language, eſpecially the <hi>Latin</hi> being hardly to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by any other with the ſame agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, I hope to be tolerably perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d; and therefore ſhall not trouble the Reader with tedious Apologies for the defects of what I have permitted to be publiſhed for the better information only of ſuch, who have not ſtudy'd Languages of the preſent ſtate of the Ancienteſt, though unhappy erroneous Church in the whole Eaſt, many things concerning which have been very fabulous and inauthentick; and indeed

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Chriſtian Faith, having been heretofore planted in <hi>Aegypt</hi> about the beginning of the Goſpel, by the Holy Apoſtles; and eſpecially by the Preaching, and good ſucceſs of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> encreaſed abundantly in a little time, according to the moſt fertile nature of that Soil. The Learning of that fruitful Country, having, as it were, prediſpoſed them for thoſe Myſteries, and by fitting their Minds thereto, ſerved as it were, as a handmaid to <hi>Theology.</hi> Here <hi>Amonius, Pantoenus, Clemens, Tatianus, Origen,</hi> and not to name any more, the incomparable <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51772:6"/>
were born: Here was first begun and cultivated the Monkiſh Diſcipline: Here were the ſupputations of time, and the perpetual deſignation of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and from hence propagated by Circular Letters to other Churches. Here, laſtly, in the ſpace of a few Months were deſtroyed One Hundred and Forty Thouſand Men under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> for the Chriſtian Faith, and Seventy Thouſand baniſhed, with Tyrannical Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood, does, and deſervedly, give date to Martyrdom it ſelf; from which dreadful and barbarous deſtruction we count as from an <hi>Aera:</hi> And never any where, certainly, did the Chriſtian Religion extend its roots with more felicity till the Third Age, in which it brought forth <hi>Arius,</hi> and with him a moſt peſtilent brood of Hereſie, which was ſcarce extinguiſhed by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the pious care of the Princes, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops: But immediately after; to wit in the Fourth Age, up ſtarted <hi>Eutaches,</hi> Superiour of a Monaſtery at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and broached new Errors in the Church; who flying, after his condemnation, by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> Council, to <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> unhappily obtained from that pious Biſhop a defence of his Hereſie; by which means, the infection being ſpread through <hi>Aegypt,</hi> it there received name and increaſe from one <hi>Jacobus Syrus Baradienſes,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed yet more and more in the next Age, <hi>viz.</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the Little, and <hi>Zeno, Iſauricus</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> his Succeſſors, until it was reduced under <hi>Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi> who fortifying the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> with the ſecular arm gave the name of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,</hi> or in other terms <hi>King followers,</hi> to the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians; <hi>Melchi</hi> in their Language ſignifying
<pb facs="tcp:51772:6"/>
               <hi>King.</hi> Now at that fatal period when the Diſſenters were too ſeverely uſed, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> were too immoderate in their puniſhments of them, the <hi>Saracens</hi> made an irruption into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the diſtreſſed <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who by their daily ill uſage had been too much exaſperated, and were more evilly and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forced into Arms for the common ſafety; and add to this, had as much cauſe of fear of their fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as of the blaſphemous enemies of that ſacred name, they fled to <hi>Mahomet</hi> for ſuccour, upon which the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour is reported to have ſaid; Do good to the <hi>Cophts</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for they are related to you both by Blood and Marriage; and he that does hurt to a <hi>Copht,</hi> does hurt to me: And I wiſh to God our not long ſince immoderate uſage of our fellow Chriſtians, though Diſſenters in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> even in this Age, had not produced as dreadful an effect, by driving the miſerable into nefarious Camps.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Aegyptian Cophti,</hi> eaſily ſubmitting themſelves to the Mahometan Yoke, being mildly uſed, ſound a much more gentle Slavery, than the other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whence even to this day they far ſurpaſs them in number; and <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Vytenbogaen, Anno 1613.</hi> aſſures us they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the <hi>Greeks</hi> in number ten times; adding this half Verſe or Hemiſtic out of <hi>Homer:</hi>

inward delight of travellers in fiction, that inſtead of preſenting us with the true Hiſtories of things, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before us in their proper colours, they treat us only with a banquet of hear-ſayes and impoſſibilities; and for ſuch who vary from us in Opinion, we do nothing, for the moſt part, but load them, with the moſt odious calumnies and criminations: So that <hi>Joſephus Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernus</hi> a man born in <hi>Cairo,</hi> and of unexceptionable truth and integrity, and a ſufficient witneſs of things done in his own Country, having compiled a ſhort Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of the Manners and Cuſtoms of his Compatriots, we thought it not improper to preſent it to the Publick; eſpecially ſince it would take up but little time and coſt, in either Printing or Peruſing.</p>

in <hi>Europe, Chriſtiani per Cingulum,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians of the Girdle.</hi> As to the Origine of their Name, the aforeſaid Doctors think they took it either from their ancient Fatriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for they are Subjects of that See, or from ſome other Saint; namely, <hi>Jacobus Syrus Baradienſis:</hi> but this does not ſeem certain, for in the Catalogue of their Patriarchs, as it is in their Sacrifice of <hi>Maſs,</hi> there is no mention made of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; therefore the moſt probable Opinion is this, that they are deſcended of the ancient Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> often called <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Holy Writ, as afterwards, when we come to treat of their other Name of <hi>Cophtes</hi> ſhall be ſeen; and indeed, was not this a great Truth, a multitude of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which are now living in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and not <hi>Jacobites.</hi> But becauſe the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which are known throughout the reſt of the World, have gotten to themſelves this Name of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they are willing to differ from them by this firſt Name <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi> and not <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> altho' they agree together in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: add to this, that they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and not <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and do this to diſtinguiſh themſelves from other Nations, which are living with them in the ſame Countries. They have therefore no other Author to whom they owe the Name of Jacobites but the before-cited Patriarch; and this alſo I can my ſelf affirm, that in their Exhortations as well publick as private, I have heard them called <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the Flock of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>ENough ſeems to have been already ſaid of the Name and Origine of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> now we are to ſpeak of their Government in Matters Spiritual; but before I commence, you muſt know, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do not in all places enjoy the ſame liberty, for thoſe that are free from the Injury and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> enjoy a more ample liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in governing the Church, and ſuch as do the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> as many Hiſtorigraphers relate; but thoſe that dwell in <hi>Aegypt, Lybia, Nubia, Thebais,</hi> &amp;c. and are compell'd to bear the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to obey the Commands of a barbarous Emperour, are not truly ſo free. But now how they are govern'd in Spiritual Matters, we ſhall ſee in few words.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Jacobites</hi> the higheſt Dignity is that of their Patriarch, as they call him, and he takes his Power from the Vice Roy or <hi>Bacha,</hi> who Commands in <hi>Aegypt</hi> in place of the Emperour; his Office is to exerciſe his Power on the Chriſtians in Spiritual Things. For Example, if any <hi>Jacobite,</hi> having forſaken his Religion, does embrace that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51772:9"/>
                  <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Armenians,</hi> then he may, and even ought, to call him to an account: but if he be turned <hi>Mahometan,</hi> then he cannot; for they are Maſters, and it is not lawful for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to contend with thoſe, whom they ſerve; but if he lives in thoſe Countries, which are not ſubject to the <hi>Turk,</hi> as in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> he may call him, and require a reaſon why he did forſake his Religion; nay, indeed, pronounce an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema againſt him; but this is rarely done in theſe times, the Patriarch fearing leaſt he that is ſo uſed, ſhould turn <hi>Mahometan,</hi> amongſt whom there is no Salvation, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> not caring to be ſaved by, or in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this only Power he now poſſeſſes, for he is not ſecure as to the things belonging unto the Church, ſuch as Tythes, Firſt-fruits, Marriage-fees, or Alms which are given by Chriſtians at or near their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, or thoſe things uſed to be given by ſuch as receive the Sacraments of Ordination and Confirmation, &amp;c. for concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, he can move no Controverſie with the Subject.

Of the Election of the Patriarch, Archbiſhops, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WHen the Patriarch, who held the Keys in Spiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is dead and buried, the Canons of the Church do publickly exhort every one to pray to God, that he would pleaſe to aſſiſt each one with his Holy Spirit, that a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Church may be choſen, which may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Divine Majeſty, and to Men, and preſently Convoke by their Letters, the Arch Biſhops, and Biſhops, who, as ſoon as they are come together into the Cathedral Church, chooſe one of the ancienteſt Monks of the Hermites, who ſeems to be a truly Penitent, and to have ſtrictly exercis'd Faſting and Continency, and all other Vertues belonging to the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fleſh. But when any one is choſen, they do not declare who it is; for as ſoon as any of them knows he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that Dignity, he flies, and does not willingly accept, but they take and lead him by force into the Town, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him with many ſupplications that he would vouchſafe to be Paſtor of their Church, ſince he was choſen by the Arch Biſhops, and Biſhops, conducted by the Holy Ghoſt: He oppoſes with many Words and Tears, profeſſing himſelf inſufficient for ſo great a Charge, but at laſt overcome, as it were, by their importunity, he accepteth. Then he is brought to the <hi>Bacha,</hi> or Vice-Roy for that time in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by whom he is conſtituted Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and from whom he receives a Grant of his firſt Petition; which is, That he may Govern the Church, according to the Inſtitutions of their Anceſtors. And ſo much for the Election of the Patriarch; let us now ſpeak of the Biſhops</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51772:10"/>
They are choſen almoſt in the ſame way as the Patriarchs; for they are taken by force, and conducted to the Patriarch, who admoniſhes them not to wave any longer ſo ſacred a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to ſubmit themſelves to it, remembring that they are both Elected and Called by the Holy Ghoſt, who can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der facile to them what they think hard and difficult; to whom, as ſoon as conſenting to take on them the Office, is given either by the Patriarch, or the <hi>Bacha,</hi> after the ſame manner, a <hi>Faculty,</hi> that it may not be lawful for any Perſon under their Charge to diſobey, or contend in any thing.</p>
               <p>As to the Election of the Arch-Biſhop, the Patriarch toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Canons aſſemble in the Church, and having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him, he receives Authentick Letters from the Patriarch and Vice-Roy, or <hi>Bacha,</hi> and ſuch a Power as is uſually given to an Arch-Biſhop, and ſo after his Conſecration is ſent into the Province, which is allotted him. The ſame way are choſen Prebendaries, Prieſts, and Superiours of Convents. who all refuſe at the firſt, but at laſt overcome, as it were by entreaty, do accept. Of which number none receive this Authority from the <hi>Turk,</hi> nor his Confirmation, but <hi>Abbots</hi> and Priors of Convents, the others requiring not ſuch a one, becauſe under, either the Patriarch, or ſome Biſhop.</p>

               <p>SInce it is not a daily, but a rare thing to Conſecrate a Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>triarch, we will in few words give ſome account of that Ceremony. The Election of the Patriarch being made, as we ſaid before, in the Cathedral Church, and Notice being given to all People of the certain Day of his Conſecration, all the Citizens and Inhabitants of <hi>Memphis,</hi> and many Strangers come flocking into the Church, where the Conſecration is to be ſolemniz'd, and not only many Chriſtians, but many of the principal <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometan</hi>'s flock thither, for as this Ceremony is ſeldom to be ſeen, ſo when it is, they husband the opportunity. This then is the Order of Conſecration.</p>
               <p>At Midnight after Maſs is begun, and the Introit is over, one of the Seven Biſhops who begun it, leaves all the reſt, and goes into the Sanctuary. The Second goes on with the reſt of the Maſs: to the Second the Third ſuceeds, who alſo takes his turn as to the Celebration: the Fourth to the Third; and ſo to the Seventh, who after he has ſung the Preface, gives over the reſt of the Maſs, and goes with the other into the Sanctuary, as we ſhall ſee in the next Chapter, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with ſeven ſteps, and in which is in the middle an Altar where the Maſs is celebrated, upon which ſteps ſtand the ſeven Biſhops, upon every ſtep one, upright in his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Habit and Mitre at which time, the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, and other Miniſters of the Sanctuary there aſſiſting, having on a Linnen Surplice, and a Girdle, of which we ſpoke in the third Chapter, and a woollen <hi>Ephod</hi> on their Heads, call the Patriarch, and when he is come to the firſt Biſhop who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51772:11"/>
ſtands upon the firſt ſtep, he reads to him a certain Period of the Pontifical-Book, placed near his Head, and encouraging him to hope, that God will endue him with his Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may Govern his Church, after which, he breathes in his mouth, ſaying, Receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> which done, he takes the Mitre from his Head, and the ſame does the ſecond, third, and fourth Biſhop, and ſo to the ſeventh, on the ſeventh and laſt ſtep; and when he is come to the ſeventh ſtep, ſeven Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Cathedral bring to him the Pontifical Habit, each tendring him that part of the Garment which he is to put on, the firſt a ſort of Linnen which he wears about his Shoulders; the ſecond the Surplice; the third the Girdle, &amp;c. adding ſome ſpecial words appointed to each part of the Garment, when he is cloathed he ſits upon the higheſt ſtep, and all the Biſhops taking from him the Mitre, he puts another upon his Head, all the Biſhops and Canons in the interim kiſſing his Hands, and promiſing him Obedience. Which done, the Patriarch deſcends from the ſteps, and begins to celebrate Maſs, and adminiſter the Sacrament of the Euchariſt to the Biſhops, Canons, Arch-Deacons, Deacons, &amp;c. who are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Sanctuary. Hitherto of the Conſecration of the Patriarch, as to the Arch-Biſhop's there is nothing peculiar but what is deſcribed in the Pontifical Book, and is performed by the Patriarch alone, celebrating the Maſs together with all the other Miniſters, who aſſiſt him; then all the Biſhops, or three of them kneeling, kiſs the Hand of the Arch-Biſhop, who is ſet in a Chair on the Left-hand of the Patriarch; and this is done before the Conſecration of the Sacrifice of the Maſs. The ſame manner is obſerved in Conſecrating a Biſhop, for he is conſecrated by the Patriarch, and nothing more is done to him, but what belongs to the Arch-Biſhop, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch breathing upon him, and ſaying, receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

On the Sabbath, or Preparation before the Lord's Day, or Eve of any Saint, they come all together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, whither Men or Women, with naked Feet, and ſuch as are able, bring with them a Mantle, or Covering, with which they invellope themſelves, when they come to ſleep that Night in the Church, whoſe Floor for this purpoſe is covered with Matts or Carpets, according to the Dignity of the place; and when the Evening-prayers are ended, all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Clerks or Laymen, ſing together in the Choire, the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Pſalms belonging to the Evening-Service; which fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they go all into ſeveral places to ſleep, only the place, where the Women are, is ſhut up, that Men be not amongſt them. But thoſe that are near the Temple, ſleep in their Houſes, who being call'd by a Clerk, an hour or two before day, come and joyn with the reſt who ſlept that Night in the Church, and having girded themſelves, go with the Prieſts and other Miniſters into the Choire, where they begin Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, or Morning-prayers, after which they ſing the Hymns, and Canonical Hours, as they call them, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt, third, and ninth Hours, which Hours Morning and Evening contain

forty eight pſalms to be repeated by turns; the Prieſt and the chiefeſt of the people ſinging every one a pſalm in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, beſides the Leſſons and Goſpels which are firſt reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Coptic, and then in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> that all may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; the prayers are only read in the Coptic. Which done, the Prieſt, with the Deacon and Sub-Deacon, and Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, who ſerve always at Maſs, begins it, and when they are all bowed down to the ground, recites the Introit, before the Door of the Sanctuary, in the Coptic Language, which performed, he enters into the Sanctuary with the Miniſters, having all Cenſors in their hands, and goes three times about the Altar and bleſſes it, then comes the Clerk to the Door of the Sanctuary with the Hoſt, Wine, and Water, all which the Deacon receives in the Sanctuary with great modeſty, and lays them before the Prieſt, who puts them all in order to be conſecrated. Then he begins ſome Oraiſons and Hymns, and the people ſing with him, and if there be any Story of a Saint belonging to the day, the Prieſt reads it in the Coptic Tongue; which done, the Sub-Deacon begins the firſt Epiſtle, taken out of the Old Teſtament, alſo in the Coptic Language; then another, <hi>viz.</hi> Sub-Deacon reads two Epiſtles in <hi>Arabick,</hi> one taken out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other a general one; and after he has recited ſome few Hymns and Oraiſons, he reads the Goſpel appointed for the day. Then the Prieſt ſolemnly begins the <hi>Preface</hi> in the <hi>Coptic,</hi> and is fol'owed by the Choire that ſings the reſt, and the Litany, which the Prieſt alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats in the Sanctuary with a clear and audible Voice in the ſame Tongue, and when the Preface is ended, then he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Bread and Wine, the people attending to him with great Devotion, which done, the Prieſt takes firſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the Deacon, Sub-Deacon, and the other Miniſters; and if there be any of the people preſent, the Prieſt gives them of the ſame Hoſt, and the Deacon in a Spoon of Silver or Gold gives them of the Blood.

But before the diſtribution, the Prieſt hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cup, and the Deacon having the Hoſt upon a plate, they go out of the Sanctuary face to face, that is mutually

They uſe, for inſtance, a woollen Cloak on their Heads, which they not only wear which ſerve in the Church, but thoſe alſo who will enter into it, otherwiſe they muſt not enter. They wear alſo a long Linnen Garment reaching to the ground, and ſet with Jewels, in mode of a Croſs, at their backs and breaſts, and in their neithermoſt and loweſt parts, and in the flaps or ſleeves, near the Arms and Hands; but if the Church be poor, then they uſe Silk inſtead of Jewels; and when they have got on this Garment, they gird themſelves with a Girdle, of which we have ſo often ſpoken, and the Prieſt only carries the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in his Left hand, for the other Miniſters, <hi>videlicet,</hi> Deacon, or Sub-deacon, or any of the inferiour Orders cannot do it; and this is their conſtant uſe.

Of BAPTISM.</head>
               <p>WE have ſaid in the Chapter of the Form of the Temple, that there was a place deſigned for a Font of Baptiſm, wherein is a Receptacle, which in time of Baptiſm they fill with Water, and that being done, the Prieſt having firſt put on his ſacred Veſtments, comes together with all the other Miniſters to the Font, ſinging various Orations and Hymns firſt begun by the Prieſt in the Coptic Tongue, then follow the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpets,</hi> as we ſaid before in the Celebration of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> Which ended, the Prieſt begins to ſing the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and to repeat almoſt all the Orations and Prayers uſed at the Communion-Table; then he conſecrates the Water, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing therewith a little hallowed Oyl and Salt. Then the <hi>Pater Luſtricus,</hi> or perſon reſponſible for the Child, brings the Infant, which is to be Forty days old, neither is it lawful for any perſon, no not for the Mother or Midwife to enter the Church, unleſs neceſſity compels; and firſt a great many Lamps and Candles being light up, the Prieſt asketh this perſon ſtanding before the Font, whether he will have this Child waſhed with the holy Water of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> who ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſeut, he repeateth the <hi>Exorciſm,</hi> and many other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, according to the Cuſtom of many Nations, and taking the Infant into his hands, putteth him three times into the Water, adding theſe words uſed by all Chriſtians in this Sacrament: <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And taking a linnen Cloth, wipeth the Child, and confirmeth him with Holy Oyl, and anointeth therewith all his Joynts. After which the Prieſt dreſſeth and bindeth him with the Girdle before mentioned, and he cannot be by any one unty'd, unleſs by a Prieſt after the third day.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51772:15"/>
And then he again pulleth of the Infant's Cloaths, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with fair Water in an Earthen Veſſel, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards flings into a River, or ſome other place, where it may paſs away. But the Water of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is convey'd through ſome hole into a ſubterraneous place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſolemnly celebrated twice in the Year, firſt on the Sunday of the <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and then on the Sunday of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> when as we have ſaid, it is adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>But as we remarked in the firſt Chapter, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is diligently obſerved and that on the eighth day after the Birth, and this not only in the principal Cities where there is a great concourſe of people, but alſo in Villages, and in the Country, with the greateſt rigour.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> as we have obſerved, do very ſeldom uſe this Sacrament; a little oftner the <hi>Laics,</hi> and then it is ſeverely and rigidly exerciſed.

The penance which the Confeſſors are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to enjoyn their penitents is ſometimes ſo heavy, and for ſo long a ſpace, that it often exceeds ſix Months, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Year, during which time they are not admitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And this for the moſt part is the nature of their penance; two or three times a week they abſtain from Victuals, living upon Bread and Water, and bow every Night to the Ground fifty, or a hundred times, kiſſing it towards the <hi>East.</hi> They think there is but one ſort of ſin, and not different <hi>Species</hi> of them, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe to ſay.</p>

And after the Laics have performed the penance, that their Confeſſors have enjoyned them, they come weeping and bare-headed with great devotion to the Door of the Sanctuary: There they ſtand, and holding ſome Linnen in their hands, the Prieſt gives them a bit of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and the Deacon preſents them with ſome Wine from the <hi>Cup,</hi> in a Gold or Silver Spoon. Likewiſe, if any ſmall Children are to be waſhed with the ſacred Water of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> which Ceremony is alſo to be done at other times, beſides thoſe before-mentioned, they are brought by the <hi>Pater Luſtricus,</hi> or by ſuch like perſon, to the door of the Sanctuary; then the Prieſt puts a ſmall piece of the <hi>Host</hi> into the Child's mouth, and having dipped his finger in the <hi>Cup,</hi> rubbeth therewith the Childs mouth.

               <p>MEntion was made of this Sacrament, when we treated of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> where we ſaid, excepting that of the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> there is no reſpect had to Age in conferring of any <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> all other, the greater as well as the leſs being conferred without taking the Age of any one into conſideration. And this is the way of adminiſtring this Sacrament. If any Child is to be made a Deacon, who by reaſon of his yet-tender Age cannot perform the Duties of his <hi>Order,</hi> then one of his near Relations, either Father or Mother promiſes to obſerve them for him, till he grows of Age to keep them himſelf; and theſe are the Rules of the Order: To faſt twice, <hi>videlicet,</hi> every <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,</hi>

But none performs the Divine Office until he has attained to Prieſt s <hi>Orders,</hi> which he takes at the Age of five and twenty, and then he is obliged to obſerve the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Rules. But he that is received into Orders, be they greater or leſs, firſt giveth his Name to the Biſhop's Secretary, and a ſingle piece of Money to the Patriarch, of about Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Engliſh, and then at the time of Conſecration the Biſhop ſtanding before the Door of the Sanctuary cutteth off his Hair, then putting his Hand upon his Head, bleſſeth him in form of a Croſs, and therewith congratulateth him on his admittance into the number of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks:</hi> this being done, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Sanctuary, and ſits upon his Pontifical Chair, and the Miniſters, or thoſe that aſſiſt at the Ceremony, having on a long Surplice and a Girdle, bring him a Girdle: then the Biſhop confers upon him the other <hi>Orders</hi> as far as the <hi>Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> and uſes thoſe Ceremonies which are uſed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> If you enquire of me concerning the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the manner is different as to them, for they are elected when they are abſent, and are taken in the Church againſt their wills in time of <hi>Orders,</hi> and after ſeveral words and ſupplications, as if they were overcome by them, they are forced to conſent; after which being cloathed with the Sacerdotal Ornaments, they are conducted to the Biſhop into the Sanctuary, and there by him ordained as has been ſhewed, and is the Cuſtom amongſt other Nations.

               <p>THeir <hi>Marriages,</hi> as we have ſaid in the Chapter of the Sacraments, are celebrated with great ſolemnity and magnificence; and this is the manner of them in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> The Bridegroom, and Bride, firſt ask leave of the Turkiſh Judge, for thoſe that are under the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Dominion, cannot take a Wife, except they firſt have obtained permiſſion of the <hi>Grand Seignour</hi>'s <hi>Lieutenant:</hi> This leave being granted, they go both into the Cathedral Houſe, where they give their Names to be enrolled, and having paid a certain Sum of Money to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, he appoints them the day when they are to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At the Day appointed they come into the Church, and having lighted up ſeveral Lamps and Candles in the ſecond and third <hi>artition,</hi> where the Women uſe to be, they begin to ſing in the firſt many Hymns and Prayers in the honour of the Bridegroom, and give him ſeveral private Exhortations; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they conduct him into the third partition, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him there to ſet with his Spouſe, then they ſing ſome Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Goſpel belonging to <hi>Matrimony;</hi> and if the Bridegroom be a Deacon, he ſings himſelf the Goſpel laid on the Pulpit in the ſecond partition, and firſt in the Coptic Tongue, and then in the Arabic. Theſe Leſſons are taken out of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and out of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Goſpel out of St. <hi>John,</hi> concerning the Marriage in <hi>Galelea.</hi> Which done, they lead the Bridegroom ſolemnly through the Church, with many Lamps and Candles, and ſinging many Hymns and Pſalms, But if the Bridegroom be rich, they make ſeveral Fire-works, wait upon him ſinging and playing on divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick, and ſpend ſo much ſometimes in theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51772:18"/>
things, as amounteth to more than 3000 Crowns, Engliſh. As for the <hi>Dowry,</hi> which they call the Bond of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> the Husband is obliged to give his Wife, according to the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Canons, five and twenty Crowns, <hi>French</hi> Money; but ſeveral of the Nobility obſerve not theſe Canons, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a diſhonour to give ſo little, do often beſtow, ſome One, ſome Five hundred, and ſome a thouſand Crowns. The Spouſe gives nothing to her Husband, but has Cloaths, Ornaments, and ſometimes a Houſe. When this Ceremony is ended, they are both magnificently conducted into their Houſe, where they live in ſplendour many days, and take their pleaſure; but the ſecond Night after the Marriage, the Husband according to the Cuſtom, goes into a ſecret room, and the next day ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning, ought to ſhew them that are preſent the Sign of Virginity; that is, <hi>Sanguinem illum qui effluxit ex per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſractâ pelliculâ illâ:</hi> called by all Phyſitians, the <hi>Sign of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,</hi> or <hi>Hymen;</hi> which effluction uſes to appear on the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; and if it does not, the Spouſe ſuffers in her Reputation, and if the Husband pleaſes to uſe his Right, he may ſend her again to her Parents, who ſhall be bound to pay all the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he has been at.</p>

They eat only of Bread and Pulſes, and Herbs, which they are not to ſeaſon with Oyl, and of theſe but once a day, and that is in the Evening. The ſecond <hi>time</hi> of faſting is the <hi>Advent,</hi> from the fifteenth day in <hi>November,</hi> till the Feaſt of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> which happens the twenty fifth of <hi>December:</hi> And then they forbear Fleſh and Milk, but may eat of Fiſh lawfully. The third is celebrated in honour of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and begins the twenty fourth day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and ends the twenty-fifth day of <hi>August,</hi> which is <hi>Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption-day.</hi> Their fourth and laſt Faſt is in honour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and begins the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> and ends on their day, <hi>viz.</hi> the twenty ninth of <hi>June.</hi> But as to the time or duration of this Faſt, it is not certain, for it is according to the courſe of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> At this time as well as at the <hi>Advent</hi> they eat Fiſh, but in time of <hi>Lent,</hi> or when they faſt in honour of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin,</hi> they do not.</p>

Of their Holy Pilgrimages.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Jacobites</hi> are uſed to go on Pilgrimage upon a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious account: for to ſay in a word, there are many places in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the Bodies of Saints, and Images of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> are kept, which they believe to perform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary Miracles. But about the middle of <hi>Lent</hi> for the moſt part, they are wonted to travel to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and becauſe the Road is infeſted with Thieves and <hi>Arabs,</hi> they uſe all to gather together in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whether <hi>Jacobites, Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Europeans,</hi> Merchants or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, Pilgrims, &amp;c. and there joyn in one Body, or <hi>Caravan,</hi> as they call it, and the number of the Pilgrims is ſo great that it ſometimes exceeds ſixty thouſand Men. And after in this manner they are aſſembled together, they aſcend their Camels and begin their Journey, and in twelve or fifteen days ſpace reach the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But before they arrive there they are to enter into the City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and then <hi>Catea</hi> and <hi>Ravilay,</hi> in which three mentioned places they are to pay a Toll or Cuſtom to the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſuch as are Subjects, eight <hi>French</hi> Crowns, the reſt double, to wit, ſixteen: Again, when they are come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> four Crowns are to be given by the Subject, eight by the reſt, and they live in a ſort of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity together, as long as they ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where all the Holy Week they viſit the Holy places. But on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day they aſſemble all together in the Church of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher and hear Maſs, which all the Biſhops that are preſent, celebrate in ſo many ſeveral Chappels. In the Chappel of the Sepulcher only the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> if he be preſent, otherwiſe his Vicar, with ſome of the <hi>Abyſſine</hi> Churches, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom, they ſay, a Light ſhineth out of the Sepulcher. But
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51772:21"/>
the <hi>Turks,</hi> that are Keepers, extinguiſh all the Lamps and Candles ſet up that day in the Church, which are again lighted by the Divine Light ſpringing out of the Sepulcher. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſteem this to be a fiction; and in truth it is ſo: it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and many teſtifie, that this might anciently have been, when thoſe that profeſſed the Chriſtian Religion were very rare, but now the Faith being diſplayed through the whole World, we have no need of any ſuch Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that the <hi>Turks</hi> may have a good eſteem of the Chriſtian Religion, they are wont to deceive the credulous minds of the ſimple with ſuch Arts, as may bring no damage to the Chriſtian Faith, feigning the Lamps to have been kindled by a light ſhining out of the Sepulcher, when indeed they have a Lamp ſuſpended out of the Sepulcher, with which the Prieſt lighteth up again all the reſt that were extinguiſhed. And this is done by the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> or the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> becauſe they alone, as we ſaid before, celebrate <hi>Maſs</hi> in the Chappel of the Sepulcher. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Europeans</hi> believe this, but to impoſe upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in this matter is a thing impoſſible</p>
               <p>The firſt day of <hi>Eaſter</hi> being paſt, they viſit the Holy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the River <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and the reſt of the Holy Places of the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which they do throughout the whole Week of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and after this, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one returneth into his own Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But there are alſo ſome peculiar places in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to which they go upon a Religious ſcore, as firſt to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>'s Temple to which they are accuſtomed to go, thinking on the eighth day of <hi>September,</hi> which is her Birth-day, the Bleſſed Virgin, together with ſome particular Saints, appear in a phantaſtick manner in the Circuit of the Sanctuary; which many flock together to ſee, Many other places likewiſe they have dedicated to Saints, as to St <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and others; and becauſe they are famed for many Miracles, out of devotion they repair thither in a great number; they take Beaſts with them, which they offer up as a Sacrifice in honour to the Saint, and when they have boyled them, eat of them in the Temple.</p>

Of their Food, and Cuſtom in Eating.</head>
               <p>WHen they are call d upon through exceſſive heat in their languiſhing ſtomachs, and the thirſty Spirits in their Liver, to drink, they repair and refreſh their too much exhauſted Bodies by the vertue of cold Meats or Drinks, or a ſuffection of frigid Aliments, with which the County much abounds. And altho' almoſt every day, ſix Oxen, and twelve thouſand Sheep are ſlain, yet they had rather, for the moſt part, feed on Milk, Herbs, and other things, but on <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> they eat only Fiſh: And this is their manner in Eating.</p>
               <p>Their knees being buckled under them, they ſit upon the ground about a Table which is ſpread before them, and if an Eccleſiaſtick be preſent, taking Bread and breaking it into pieces with his hands, for it is unlawful among us to uſe a Knife; after he has given Thanks he diſtributes to every one, which being done, they prepare themſelves to eat.</p>
