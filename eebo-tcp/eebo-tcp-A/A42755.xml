         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Parliament by an Ordinance of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. 1642. enabled <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> to receive Money, Plate,
Horſe, and Armes upon the Propoſitions, for which the Publique Faith was to be engaged.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Gill</hi> upon that Ordinance lent <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax 60. li.</hi> upon the Publique Faith, aud raiſed a Troop of
Horſe compleatly armed with Swords, Piſtolls, Back, Breaſt, and Pot, wherein he disburſed 600. li. a great part of
which Monies he borrowed upon Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Gill</hi> ſerved under the command of the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> as Captain, and Major of Horſe, untill his Arrears amounted unto
1657. li. 16.s. 3.d.</p>
            <p>The Parliament by Ordinance of the 22 <hi>May,</hi> 1647. provides for the payment of one third of the Arreares of the Northerne
Officers, to be accepted by them for the whole in full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Gill</hi> one of thoſe Officers, his Accompts being audited, and ſo ſtated, that the 600. li. advanced by him in Horſe and Arms
upon the Publique Faith, was accompted amongſt his Arrears, was then in a ſtraight, conceiving that the Parliament intended not
to give one third in full for his Money lent, yet being in neceſſity for monies by reaſon of his loſſes in ſerving the Parliament, was
willing to accept of one third in full for his Arrears, and to receive one third of his 600. li. lent, but not for ſatisfaction; therefore
upon the 27 of <hi>May,</hi> before he took an Aſſignement for any money, five dayes after the ſaid Ordinance paſſed, he petitioned the
Committee of the Northern Aſſociation, ſhewing that he could not accept of one third for the whole of his 600. li. lent, and that
the Ordinance mentioned only Arrears, and deſired that his Caſe, with his loſſes and ſufferings, might be repreſented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Committee ordered, That his Petition ſhould be reported to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thereupon Col. <hi>Gill</hi> received his Petition and Accompts from the Clerke of the Committee (as appeares by a Note of the
Clerks hand) and put them into the hands of Mr. <hi>Bryan Stapleton</hi> to report to the Parliament, as he hath already teſtified. After two
years expectation of reparations for his loſſes and ſufferings, and the 400. li. the remaining two thirds of his 600. li. lent money, the
Act of Parliament paſſed for doubling upon Deans and Chapters Lands, and Col. <hi>Gill</hi> was adviſed, and did beleeve, that without
offence he might double the money that he had lent upon the Publique Faith, and he did double the 400. li. (the two remaining
thirds of the 600. li. lent in Horſes and Armes) which with the Intereſt allowed, amounted to 600. li.</p>
            <p>NOw if any conceives that Col. <hi>Gill</hi> hath gained by the Common-wealths Service in receiving one third of his Arreares, and
Troop, and doubling two thirds of his 600 li. lent in Horſes and Armes with Intereſt, hee humbly offers the aboveſaid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
That by his receiving one third of his Arreares and Troop, (whereof he loſt 387 li.) by the Parliaments transferring the
ſame from the Exciſe to Deans and Chapters Lands, and by his doubling the two thirds of his Troop, and Intereſt for the ſame, he
never yet received in money his 660 li. lent upon the Publique Faith.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Gill</hi> humbly craves your favour to conſider, That he hath been a conſtant ſufferer for the Parliament from the beginning
of the War to this day, and hath upon his credit advanced great ſums of Money for their Service, and loſt his Eſtate and Calling
which was, and would have been of great advantage to him, and he deſires that he may not be ruined in his attendance upon
your Honours, he having waited near nine Moneths after a heavy ſentence given againſt him, and nothing can more certainly ruin
him and his Family then a further long attendance, under the ſentence given againſt him; He beſeeches you therefore that the
report of his Caſe now reſting in the hands of Col. <hi>Downes</hi> may be ſpeedily heard, and he humbly hopes he may yet be thought ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of doing further ſervice for the Common wealth.</p>
