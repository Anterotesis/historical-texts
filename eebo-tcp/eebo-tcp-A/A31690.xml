            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE CHARACTER OF A
GOOD MAN, NEITHER WHIG nor TORY.</p>
            <p>HE is one whoſe Name is <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>; his Surname is <hi>Catholick,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from Sects and Separatiſts.</p>
            <p>One who is neither Atheiſtically profane, nor Enthuſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Superſtitious, but ſeriouſly Religious according to the Canon of Scripture, and ſoberly conformable according to the Laws of the Land; <hi>giving to</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Ceſar<hi>'s, and to God the things that are God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One that thinks it highly reaſonable to prefer the Wiſdom of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in appointing the External Modes and Circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, before the Dictates of a private Judgment; and therefore will not diſturb the Peace of the Church, in contending paſſionately for or againſt little things.</p>
            <p>One that believes the Doctrine of the Communion of Saints, to be Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and therefore thinks it his Duty ſometimes to maintain a Chriſtian cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and a Religious Communion with ſober, wiſe, and good Men; who hold the Foundations, tho they differ about the Pinacles of the Temple.</p>
            <p>One who is a Chriſtian of a Primitive Temper, doth not ſet Boundaries to Religion, and circumſcribe it to Time and Place, as if it had taken Sanctuary only in Holy Ground; but looks upon External Reverence, and Internal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as the beſt Ingredients of Divine Worſhip, whether it be performed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or on the Mountains of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One whoſe Faith is agreeable unto the Doctrine of the Holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and his Life conformable unto the Example of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes promotes Peace and Purity, and wiſheth that the Terms of Chriſtian Communion were ſo comprehenſive, that all the World might with one Mouth glorify the Eternal God.</p>
            <p>He is a Man of a ſober Piety, and well temper'd Zeal; doth not baptize his Religion with the Name of a Sect, nor eſpouſe the Quarrel of a Party, nor is he guilty of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Vanity, in crying up a <hi>Paul,</hi> an <hi>Apollos,</hi> or a <hi>Cephas:</hi> but looks upon it as the great deſign of Chriſtianity to make Men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98614:2"/>
good; and where it hath not this Effect, it matters not what Church Men are of, becauſe a bad Man can be ſaved in none.</p>
            <p>He is one that lives a <hi>Godly, Righteous and Sober Life,</hi> as if the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had a relation to the Creed; doth not put off his Religion with his Sun-Day-Sute, and make it the Buſineſs only of Canonical Hours, adjourning his Piety, until the Bells excite him to a new fit of Devotion.</p>
            <p>One who by an univerſal Converſe endeavours to enlarge the Territories of his Reaſon, and to knock off the Shackles of Ignorance and Prejudice, contracted by Education and private Examples: <hi>proving all things, he holds faſt only that which is good.</hi> And rejects all Phanatick Principles and Practices, whether they come from <hi>Rome, Munſter,</hi> or any other Quarter.</p>
            <p>One who keeps his Conſcience tender, yet not ſo raw as to kick at every thing, which a miſinformed Underſtanding may ſuſpect to be unlawful: If he be guilty of Exceſs in any thing, it is in his Charity towards thoſe who differ from him in their Apprehenſions about Sacred things. Knowing it to be a moſt unlikely way, by beating out Men's Brains to inform their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>He is one that is Chearful without Levity, Sober without Formality, Prudent without Stratagem, Religious without Affectation; can be Sociable without Drinking, Angry without Swearing, and Zealous without Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>One in whom Nature and Grace, Piety and Prudence, are excellently poized; and it may be a Queſtion, whether his Wiſdom or his Goodneſs be moſt eminent; becauſe both are cover'd with a Vail of Humility.</p>
            <p>He can walk in the Furnace of an afflicted Church, without ſmelling of Papal Superſtitions, or being ſinged with <hi>Babel</hi>-Confuſions, neither bowing down to the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> or worſhipping the Calves of <hi>Bethel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is one that hath no by-Ways, from the Royal Road of Loyalty, Reaſon and Conſcience; but keeps ſtreight forward, treads firmly, being ſecure of the Ground he goes on, and is neither aſhamed, nor afraid of his own Actions: So that he can bid defiance to Danger, bear up his Head againſt a Volly of unjuſt Slanders, and ſmile upon a Crowd of villainous Perjuries, being compaſſed with a Brazen Wall of Innocence, and having within his Breſt a thouſand Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>He is one that can expreſs his Loyalty better than by Debauchery, and had rather invoke the Majeſty of Heaven, with a Book in his Hand, than a Brimmer; trembles to hear Men pray for their own Damnation, fearing leſt their Prayers ſhould be anſwered.</p>
            <p>In a Word, He is one that mends the Times more by his good Example, than by his Cenſures. Knows that the beſt Men are the beſt Subjects; and when ill Men by ſecret Conſpiracies, ſcandalous Immoralities, and venemous Pamphlets, are plotting the ruine of the Kingdom; The Language of his Heart and Tongue is, <hi>God save the King.</hi>
