         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Againſt His Preſent Majeſty JAMES the Second, at the King's-Bench-Barr
at Weſtminſter, On <date>Saturday May the 30th. 1685.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THis day being the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1685. The Villanies, Impoſtures and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
of <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> alias <hi>Willoughby,</hi> one of the Evangeliſts of the
late pretended Popiſh Plot, (<hi>one, Second to none except</hi> Oates, <hi>in the moſt flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rogueries</hi>) were brought to light by unqueſtionable Evidences; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are as follow.</p>
            <p>About Eight of the Clock in the Forenoon, my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Jefferies</hi> with two
more of his Brethren being on the Bench, the <hi>Jury</hi> was called, being all perſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Eſtates and Quality, againſt whom <hi>Dangerfield</hi> brought no exceptions, and ſo
it was quickly Impannelled: Then the Indictment was read, the Sum of which was that
he had given into the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> a moſt Dangerous, Seditious and Falſe Accuſation
againſt his Royal Highneſs <hi>James D. of York,</hi> (now our preſent King) and uſed all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to bring hatred and contempt upon him, and ſet him and his Brother at variance
by falſly Swearing that our preſent King gave him Twenty Guineys to Kill his Dear Brother
of Bleſſed Memory, and that he the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was Hyred by ſeveral perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to ſtifle the then Rampant <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and to throw it upon the <hi>Presbiterians;</hi> the Falſity
of all which, was proved by undeniable Evidence. The Indictment was in few words open'd
by Mr. <hi>Phips,</hi> and then Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> began to mannage the Evidence for the King.
Firſt, Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi> and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> proved that, that Information was <hi>Dangerfields,</hi> and
that he was the Author of the forementioned <hi>Libellious Narrative:</hi> After this was proved,
they began to make direct Proofs. Firſt, was called the Earl of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> who gave a large
and pertinent Evidence; the ſubſtance of which was, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was recommended
to him as a perſon that could diſcover great matters, concerning the diſaffected diſloyal
Party of <hi>England,</hi> commonly called <hi>Presbiterians;</hi> after he not then knowing his Roguery,
he was introduced by him to his Royal Highneſs, pretending to make a full diſcovery of a
horrid Plot againſt the Government, and particularly his Royal Highneſs, then pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great poverty, and that he had pawned his Cloaths for the ſervice of the Government,
the DUKE out of Charity gave him ſome Ten Pounds (which after the Rogue ſaid was
for killing the KING) and afterwards he got Audience of the K<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>NG, and told the
KING the ſame Flam and got ſome Forty Pounds, but the KING would not hear him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
alone by the DUKE's advice, leaſt he might prove a Rogue, as it after appeared he
was ſo, that he never had Audience of the KING or DUKE alone, as was proved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb facs="tcp:101942:2"/>
Witneſſes. My Lord <hi>Peterborrough</hi> ſaid that after he had come to Court twice or
thrice he began to ſmell a Rat; he likewiſe Swore in the preſence of the Great God, that
whereas <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had charged him with contriving a Book that contained the ſubſtance
of the after pretended <hi>Sham Meal-Tub Plot,</hi> that all was falſe.</p>
            <p>The next Evidence for the KING was Coll. <hi>Halſal,</hi> who backed my Lord <hi>Peterbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi>
Evidence by ſeveral Circumſtances, and told the Court how that being asked by
the KING his Opinion of <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> he replyed, <hi>That he looked up on him to be a Pick-pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Rogue;</hi> and that he looked upon all that he Swore to be Roguery, becauſe he could not
produce the Commiſſion he pretended he ſhould have had from Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Evidence for the KING was Mr. <hi>Cellier;</hi> who gave Evidence that one time
<hi>Dangerfield</hi> came to his houſe Curſing and Swearing, and ſaid that in Caſe he was not
better furniſhed with Money, he would tack about and go from the Evidence he had given
againſt the diſaffected Party and become an Evidence for them, ſaying, <hi>He was ſure they
would furniſh him with Money enough,</hi> and endeavour to prefer him, and procure him a
Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Then my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> atteſted that ſhe never heard of <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> till he had Accuſed
her before the Council, and whereas he had formerly ſwore that he had ſeveral Papers
from her, all was Falſe, and that he was not able to produce one.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Powis</hi> atteſted that he never ſaw <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſo as to know him from another
man, and that all was Falſe that he had ſpoke of Treaſon concerning his Lordſhip, and
that he never came to him with any ſuch Treaſonable Meſſage as he pretended; much
what the ſame Evidence was given by one Sr.—<hi>Harvey</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Hill:</hi> After this
the Kings Council to ſhew how great a Rogue he was, and how little credit he deſerv'd,
produced in Court ſeveral Records of former Convictions in ſeveral Courts in <hi>England:</hi>
Firſt a Record was produced, for breaking a Houſe here in or about <hi>Lond<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and that he
was found Guilty of the Fellony, but not of the Burglary: Then another Record was
produced for his breaking a Houſe in <hi>Eſſex:</hi> Then three or four Convictions for putting
off Falſe Guineys, for which he had ſeveral times ſtood in the Pillory at <hi>New Sarum</hi> in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Evidence for the King had done, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> began to make his Defence,
which was juſt ſuch another Cant, as his Brother <hi>Oates</hi> made in his Tryal, <hi>viz.</hi> That
their Evidence was the Prop of the Proteſtant Religion (which made great laughter in
the Court) that the King was Judge and Plaintiff, and began to make Saucy
reflections upon ſeveral honeſt men, but was ſharply reproved by my Lord Chief Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice
and kept within his bounds, which was obſerved to put him a little out of his <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
Rethorick, which was nothing but ſome flouriſhes upon general matters of the late
deceaſed Popiſh Plot; then he was deſired to make a particular defence, and he called
ſeveral Witneſſes which all concluded with ſomething againſt himſelf, as the <hi>Salamanca</hi>
Doctor's did.</p>
            <p>Firſt, One Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> the Clerk of <hi>Newgate</hi> being asked by <hi>Dangerfield</hi> what Evidence he
could give, replyed, <hi>He never ſaw</hi> him, <hi>and Mrs.</hi> Cellier <hi>together,</hi> as <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſaid more
<hi>That he believed him to be a Rogue, for he had been three times in their Cuſtody in Newgate.</hi>
Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> atteſted the ſame, and that he knew nothing of an intreague betwixt Mrs.
<hi>Cellier</hi> and <hi>Dangerfield.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> ſaid he remembered little, for he had been
ſince ſtruck with a <hi>Palſie.</hi> Sir <hi>John Nicols</hi> was called but a peared not; then <hi>Dangerfield</hi>
called <hi>Thomas Williams, William Scarlet,</hi> and <hi>Henry Sherbourn,</hi> but none of them appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then one Mr. <hi>Blaſdel</hi> an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> but he proved him to be a great Rogue; then he
called one <hi>William Tilbury,</hi> but he knew nothing of the Matter, only that he Lodged
ſometimes at his Houſe, and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> pretended Acquaintance with my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s
Family, then were called ſeveral more but did not appear. Mr. <hi>Chiffinch</hi> atteſted the
ſame that my Lord <hi>Peterborrough</hi> and Coll. <hi>Hallſal,</hi> and nothing to the Priſoners ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
Laſt of all, was called one Mr. <hi>Stretch</hi> by <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> who inſtead of doing him
ſervice, proved that while he ſaid Mr. <hi>Stretch</hi> was ſearching Coll. <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, that
<hi>Dangerfield</hi> pinned the Seditious Paper upon the Wall. The Priſoner having made what
pitiful defence he could, which as you have heard was nothing to the purpoſe, but to
prove himſelf the greater Rogue.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice moſt Elegantly and Succinctly Sumed up the Evidence, telling
the Jury what a Monſter of Wickedneſs the Priſoner was, and how the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was concerned. and in ſeeing ſuch profligated Rogues brought to Condign Puniſhment
and how that the Evidence was beyond all exceptions; ſo that without going from the
Bar the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment: Here's an end of the Evidence of the
once admired <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> who was abetted by the <hi>Whiggs</hi> to endeavour to Tarniſh the
Luſtre of the Glory of the beſt and greateſt of Princes.</p>
