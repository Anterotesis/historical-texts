         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

diſcovered in all ages, ſetting
notable brands of his diſpleaſure on
the ringleaders, and impudent chieftains

hath ſuffered ſo to be ſwollen with
pride, that the earth hath not been able
to bear their burden: Others he hath
ſo flatted by detecting that brazen face,
that to cover its effrontery had the
veyl of virgin verity, <hi>Jacobs voice but

            <p>Secondly, The elder Church Chriſtian
was expreſs about a Miniſtry and the
right qualification of Miniſters, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the holy Inſtitution of our Lord
Jeſus, the great Head, Doctor and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of his Church, who left her not
as common, in which every Chriſtian
(as to the publick uſe of gifts) had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
right, but ſeparated ſome to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct,
to exerciſe power of the Keys,
to continue ſucceſſion, and to miniſter
the holy things of the Goſpel, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of an infallible promiſe of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
with them to the end of the
world. This ſeparation has been for
many hundred yeers declared by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of hands, which the Church
calls Ordination, and has Apoſtolique
practice to warrant it. In <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6.
<hi>Stephen</hi> is mentioned to be a man full
of <hi>faith and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet did
he not execute any Miniſterial Office
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119900:21"/>
(upon account of his gracious qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations)
till <hi>he was preſented to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
they had prayed for him, and laid
their hands on him;</hi> a Scripture well to
be weighed by men of contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
eſpecially ſince backed by the
general practice of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
For if the Churches fidelity in
this Goſpel Tradition and Univerſally
received Ordinance ſhould be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
the Canon of holy Writ, and
all the Doctrines and Practiſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
will become litigious, ſince the
<hi>Church as the pillar and ground of truth,</hi>
is the deliverer and declarer of them.
And we are not to doubt,<note place="margin">Iraen ad Victor. <gap reason="foreign">

hath rightly guided the Catholique

men, of all times and Churches, how

it, and accordingly declared themſelves,
and nothing hath ever been found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, worthy the ſway of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
in contradiction to ſo Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
an acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>And truly I much wonder any ſhould
be of contrary judgement, who ought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119900:22"/>
to know the validity of Antiquities,
conſent echoing to Scripture; were
Scripture ſilent, had the practice of
Antiquity no footing therein, I ſhould

that is moſt againſt it. For that of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<hi>Calvin</hi> is moſt true,<note place="margin">Reſponſ. ad ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipellem.</note> 
               <hi>Si in ſola

the Judge,</hi> then <hi>prodigious hereſies which

precept or preſident to its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
then is the Church to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſuch her warrantable cuſtoms and
obſervations.</p>
            <p>In the 28 Chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Matthew,</hi>
our Lord Jeſus is mentioned to have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended;
in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſe</hi> the Eleven
are ſaid to go away into <hi>Galilee</hi> unto a

them, there he appears to them in a
glorious condition, which cauſed them
to worſhip him as <hi>Emanuel;</hi> God,
Man, Mediator. In the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſe</hi> our

this Chriſt is not mentioned ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119900:22"/>
to tranſfer power Miniſterial to
his Apoſtles; he aſſerts his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
before he gives them theirs;
that done, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all

that other paſſage, <hi>As my Father hath

That tranſferrency of power Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
from God the Father to God the
Son, and from God the Son to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and to their Succeſſors in the
Miniſtry, who in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phraſe
are the Hereditary Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Haereditarii Christi diſcipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I do not affirm, there is an equality
of ſpiritual power in Miniſters now to
that in the Apoſtles, no more then in
the Apoſtles to that in Chriſt, all Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
are not of a capacity; if <hi>the Spirit
were on him without meaſure,</hi> and upon

               <hi>God gave him
a Name above all names both in heaven
and earth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtles, and no
creature muſt contend with its maker.
But this I dare affirm, That the power
Spiritual and Miniſterial which the A-Apoſtles
expreſſed by impoſition of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119900:23"/>
hands, and ſince in conformity to them,
and upon the ſame ground they do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on, who are lawfully called to the
Miniſtry in the Church Chriſtian, is as
truly ſpiritual power in them, as in
their Head from whom they received
it; and that the Church has now as
clear a Charter for her Orders, as the
Apoſtles had for their Apoſtleſhips,
the great D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of us Gentiles is my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,

&amp;c. Prophets and Teachers, that
is, Miniſters as well as Apoſtles; both
fixed by Chriſt as neceſſary to carry on
his ſpiritual building the Church; Both
miniſtring Spirits for the good of the
Elect, both his good Angels, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
from all quarters his choſen ones,
both uſefull, one to lay the foundation,
and the other to perfect the Structure.</p>
            <p>I write not this to ingage my ſelf in
controverſies, I ſhall ever indeavour
to decline them, as well knowing they
account nothing to Church peace, or
Religions purity; but this I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that my judgement is flatly againſt
entrenchment upon Church Offices;
let Chriſtians imploy their Gifts ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119900:23"/>
and inſtruct themſelves and their
Families thorowly, and they will finde
enough of that task. If our Lord had
laid the right of teaching in mens rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſes,
or their talkative abilities, he
would have appeared to thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people, whom he in the courſe
of his life and Miniſtry taught, fed, and
cured of infirmities, and from whom
he had approbation to do and ſpeak, as
never man did or ſpake; it's probable
he might have found as nimble orators,
as pregnant gifted men in prayers, as
great meaſure of ſelf-denial in ſome of
the people, as was in <hi>Peter, James, John,</hi>
or the reſt of the Apoſtles: But he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to the Eleven met according to
his appointment, and them he culls out
of the maſs of the multitude to be the

as <hi>ver. 19. Go ye therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye,</hi> an

large Dioceſſes; Eleven to preach the

perſonal but Doctrinal Viſits, not to
their lives, but to the perpetuity of
their ſucceſſion, <hi>Miniſterial</hi> not <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique,</hi>
for can we think thoſe few
could peragrate the Univerſe, into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of which there was then no
means of convoy or tranſport? or that
the hour-glaſs of their lives did not
ſpeed too faſt, for them to ſow the ſeeds
of grace in, to ſo many ſeveral and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
people, and Nations? or can
the Apoſtles in any ſenſe natural be
ſaid to continue to the end of the
world, till when Chriſt promiſes to be
with them? I tro no: moſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
died within the firſt Century;
If Chriſts promiſe was to continue
them ſo long as he continued concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with them, then muſt they not
have ſeen death till the end of the
world, for ſo long he ſaith he will be
with them. And if they died ſo ſoon
after, and the world has yet laſted
above 1500 yeers, and how long fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may laſt, God onely knows:
the promiſe muſt be underſtood to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119900:24"/>
orderly ſucceſſion of the Miniſtry in
all the ages of the Church, who are to
carry on the Apoſtles Office of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and exerciſing Diſcipline in it, to
the end of the world. And this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
underſtood and followed in
their practice, for though <hi>Judas</hi> fell
from his Apoſtleſhip, yet the Eleven by
prayer and calling on God, were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſpecially to compleat their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
by the admiſſion of <hi>Matthias, Act.</hi>
1. 15. remembring that Chriſt Jeſus had
a work to carry on in the world, which
required the full help he had in his life
time aſſigned to it; and though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
admitted none into the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their order, but upon ſpecial

            <p>The conſideration of this, made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
anciently very modeſt to offer

the Fathers and Biſhops very preciſe
and ſcrupulous in admitting any unto

reputed, and had great knowledge both
in Humane and Divine Learning. Saint
<hi>Jerome</hi> plainly tells us,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>Orator.</hi> Romanum.</note> that in his time
the Church was ſo well ſerved, that it

I will not deny, but that great parts are
often hinderances to the work of grace
in the ſoul, men will not come off to
Chriſt without great ado who are
wedged to the wiſedom of this world,
which contradicts the wiſedom of God
in the fooliſhneſs of preaching; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>to preach

to acquaint the ſoul with what is Gods
command and mans duty, by prayers to

               <note place="margin">Lib de rationa ver Theologiae</note> This,

who would have been leſſe ſtrict to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, had ye not ſharpened the
Inſtruments of their diſpatch; And
therefore I beſeech you hear my moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to you ſeconded by two men of
your own Coat, every way without
exception, the firſt my right worthy
and meriting Friend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>I deſire both my ſelf
and others of my minde and profeſſion
may by an ingenious acknowledgement
of our failings be fitted for God and
mans abſolution; both in preſent and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages, that it may not be ſaid that
the Miniſters of</hi> England <hi>erred greatly
and were puniſhed ſharply, yet knew
not how to repent humbly and truly,
every one palliating their own errors and
transferring the blame and guilt upon
others, when themſelves were in ſome
things more blameable then any men;
and merited in their own cenſures, to be
esteemed the chief of ſinners.</hi> Thus he.
The other to the ſame tune, is Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baxter,</hi>

of you ſo led the way to ſeecet and open
vilifying, deriding, contemning and
aſperſing your brethren, that you, even
you have been the means of raiſing thoſe
calumnies you cannot allay? Have you
not had yet time and means enough to
obſerve, how God hath been offended
with your unpeaceable proceedings, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>For my part</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>I daily look death in the face, and live
in a conſtant expectation of my change,
and therefore have the better aſſurance
of being faithfull to my conſcience; and I
muſt needs profeſs, that when I look back
upon my life, I have more comfort in the
leaſt means that ever I uſed for the
Churches peace, then in all my moſt
zealous contentious engagements.</hi> Thus
he. And what can be more fully writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to their honours, and the ſhame of
thoſe whoſe high ſtomacks incubate
their confeſſions? But I know the
wiſe in heart will conſider this, and for
the reſt, I pity, not reproach them;
<hi>Zacheus</hi> is as well to be imitated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:119900:43"/>
Thus much of the head of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though I conceive it neceſſary
to add ſomewhat concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
ſuch I mean as are decent, and
not ſupernumerary; I know this is a
<hi>noli me tangere,,</hi> and perhaps may be
born out of time; But yet ſince my
aime is to pleaſe no party by a baſe
paraſitiſm, nor to provoke any by a
ſarcaſtique freedom; I think fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
(with all humility and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
my thoughts about Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which I look upon as fleſh and
skin to the ſoulary part of Religion,
as mounds and fences, to the granaries
of ſound doctrine; I know as life, ſo
Religion may be preſerved by plain
clothes, and fewer rites, as well as by
richer and more numerous; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I offer my conceptions not as a
peremptory dictator, but as a petitory
Monitor; I confeſſe the primitive
times had little of Ceremonies, They
were in Perſecution, and the Chriſtians
in them under reſtraints, not owned
by Magiſtrates, nor in any polity for
a great while, <hi>Aliud fuit tunc tempus

of the Chriſtian Church grew
better, and Emperours and great men
ſhewed themſelves propitious to her,
then prudence dictated ſomewhat
more luſtrous and ſuitable to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous

which ought not to be conſidered leſs

things of variety and virtuous delight,

So ſay I in the caſe of Ceremonies, ſo
far as they relate to the uſefull Order
and Ornament of the Church, they
are not only not to be contemned,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119900:44"/>
but honoured and kept; And theſe
that are hotly violent againſt them
<hi>quâ</hi> ſuch, had beſt conſider, that there
may be uſe of them to do the drudgery
of worſhip, and to ſtave off pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe,
and when they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
but as Cryars of Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
are, to minde men of their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to what is ſacred, and to learn
them to be bare and ſubmiſſe to their
betters, there is no ill conſtruction can
be reaſonably made of them.</p>
            <p>I know they have and ever will be
(while men are ignorant, ambitious,
and worldly) ſubject to be abuſed,
partly by the ignorance of ſuperſtitious
people, and partly by over activity of
men of note in the Church, who of
good purpoſe introduced them, as did
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> Church-Muſick into the
Church at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cent. 5. c. 6. p 361.</note> to prevent
the <hi>Arians</hi> withdrawing of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
to their Church or Oratories in
which they had ſuch Muſick: I know
(I ſay) that by this and other means
the number of Ceremonies grew ſo
great, that the Church was not able
to abide them, That S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and
many others greatly inveighed againſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119900:45"/>
them, and wiſhed correction of them.
And therefore as all things of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and order, conſtituted by man,
may (upon juſt cauſe) be ordered and
altered, as to prudence ſhall ſeem moſt
meet, Provided it be done in lawfull
manner, and by perſons lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereto; ſo endeavoured many in
the Church, to put a ſtop to this evil,
and to offer a remedy thereto.</p>
            <p>But alas! It was a diſeaſe paſt cure,

highly deſerve of the Church of God;
theſe cannot but grieve to ſee, when

yea they muſt needs lament, to ſee
that the fire of deſtruction, rather then
that of purifying, hath paſſed upon their
brethren of the Clergy, many of which
were holy and good men though of
different judgments. My prayer to
God is, that our Governours may
conſider the great ſcandall that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is under, while by our Indignities
to the Clergy, that are not all of the
current opinion, we not only turn a

<hi>Campion</hi> into a Prophecy; but
alſo help to fulfill it (<hi>Nihil putidius

and our garments of beauty

when our variances fill us fuller
of animoſity then holy zeal, which
bright Sun is ſeldom in the ſouls firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contemporary with the Moon of
ſenſual paſſion: I wiſh that ſome would
give way, and others not take the way
of their brethren, but all endeavour to
excell one another in humility. In
moderateneſs: no mans humour is
valuable with Church peace: they who
will carry all with high hand, and not
bear with their fellow Chriſtians in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
things, ſhould conſider the demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Lord Chriſt; <hi>Ille ſervare

though blurred by ſinne, yet never ſo
to be eraſed, but that it had power of

            </p>
            <p>What this radical Law was, and

above me to determine: But this is
plain, that <hi>from the right uſe of this
Law there is enough to make us know
God, our ſelves, and our Neighbour, and
to abhor injury to any of them.</hi> 'Tis true,
God explained this Law by ſuperadded
Laws which he gave his people the
Jews, and according to the equity of
which we Chriſtians proceed, but he
never ſuperſeded or nulled that Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law; But rather ſtrengthens it by
theſe latter. Though the faireſt draught
of this Law was that on the heart of
<hi>Adam,</hi> yet the remains of that divine
Art is admirable in the heart of every
man, who <hi>from that is taught to love and
fear God as the moſt excellent good, and
to do every thing as in his ſight, yea, not
to do wickedneſſe becauſe of the divine
adverſation to it.</hi> There are amongſt
the Learned thoſe that ſpecifie the
heads of this Law written in the heart;
Our late deceaſed <hi>Selden</hi> out of the
Rabbins reduces them to ſix heads,<note place="margin">Cap. 2. de Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driis Judaeorum.</note> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,

            <p>I purpoſe not to ſay any thing of
this further then to ſhew the neceſſity
of Laws to keep Nature in awe, and
the great uſe of them; For what Saint

had no Rulers and Magiſtrates, men
would have lives leſſe calm then wilde
beaſts do, and would not only ſnarl at
but wholly devour one another.</hi> As God
commended the uſe of Laws by his firſt
compiling of them, ſo hath he principled
man with diſpoſitions deſirous of and
conformable to Laws; No Family, no
combination, no number of men but
have their Laws, Cuſtomes, and uſages
according to which in matters of all
natures they proceed; If there be any
<hi>Caſus omiſſi,</hi> they conſult about them,
and make prudent proviſions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>The Law of nature is the generall
Law of mankinde; A Law immutable
hath been and ever will be what it was
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119900:112"/>
till it ceaſe by diſſolution; What was
to <hi>Adam</hi> a ſin by the light of Nature,
is no leſſe a ſinne to us by light of the
ſame nature: <hi>To diſobey our Creator,
To forget reverence to our own ſelves, To
do injury to thoſe that live with us; Theſe
and ſundry ſuch things are abuſions to
nature, and againſt the law of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Text of Nature, Men in
all ages have largely commented, and
the ſeverall Laws of Nations are as ſo
many Pandects and multiform Caſes
upon the Inſtitutions of God in nature,
God hath given man underſtanding to
proportion Government to the beſt
advantage of civil ſociety; The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to rule is Gods, the frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
mens; They at firſt order it
as ſeems beſt to the advantage of them
and their people. In all Governments
there hath been great care to compile
Laws with advice, and to execute them
anſwerably; Therefore the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
times and people reſigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and theirs to the pleaſure and
conduct of their Religious and holy
men, or to ſuch martiall ſpirits as yet
were guided by them, and wholly reſted
on their ſagacity for conduct: It was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119900:112"/>
no vulgar policy to poſſeſſe people that
Law-makers had colloquy with the
gods in the contexture of their Laws,
the nature of man by a voluntary and
yet in a ſort awed propenſion, believing
beſt of that which came from the divine
ſuperviſing: And indeed there were no
Laws ever made or continued good, but
ſuch as have their patern from that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
and equity which is in the divine
Law, whether in pure Nature or in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
writ; For while Law-makers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with themſelves and endeavoured
to enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ize their powers, and entail to
their Families the glory of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
they were apt to embaſe Laws
by mixtures of injury, which lacquied
to their Uſurpations; And while they
had rewards and honours to beſtow,
wanted not Parafites to excite them
thereto, and Orators to defend them,
with pretended Reaſon for ſo doing;
But when they conſulted with Right,
Equity and Juſtice, and conſidered that
to oppreſs others to right ones ſelf was
injury, and a plauſible ground of the
oppreſſeds conſpiracy againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors,
and that they ought not to do
as they would not be done by, then they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119900:113"/>
betook themſelves to equaller diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions,

            </p>
            <p>Of all the Law-givers that I reade of
none more abſolute then <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet
none more ingenious, the nobility of
his minde and the tenderneſſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
would not permit him to fix rule
upon his Family, he left the diſpoſe of
it to God whoſe it was. There is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
much to be admired, It was <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cithus</hi>
Servant to <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> Tyrant of

               <note place="margin">Steph. <hi>in verbo.</hi> Macrob. <hi>Satur.</hi> l. 1. c. 11.</note> who had by his dying Maſter
commended to him the Government
of his Kingdom and Children; But he
carried himſelf ſo gently and juſtly all
the time of his Viceroyſhip, That the
people thought themſelves governed by

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119900:113"/>
great reſpect and ſerenity; A great
temptation to be other then he was, but
a greater vertue to be as he was. Theſe
two (I ſay) denied themſelves much, and
were excellent Rulers, but for the moſt
part Law-givers have done otherwiſe,

more precious then perſwaſion or

how he that never did any warlike thing,

him, ſhould do and ſettle as he did,

chief heads of the goodneſſe of ancient
Laws and Canons.</p>
            <p>1. They eſtabliſhed Propriety, and
declared the rule of Juſtice, not only
between man and man, Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,
but alſo between Subject and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119900:115"/>
yea, in a ſort betwixt God and
Man.</p>
            <p>By Laws Canonique and Civil were
Religious men and Religious things
ſet apart continued and preſerved to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
uſes. Had it not been for good
Magiſtrates ſuch as <hi>Conſtantine, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
and later as worthy; <hi>There had
been a ſeiſure of all the Houſes of God
in the world to the uſe of Prophaneſſe,
Prieſts might have wandred in Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
Sabbaths have given way to Wakes,
Sermons to Interludes, Sacraments to Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalian
Feaſts.</hi> Had it not been for
Laws the ſtrongeſt had been the beſt,
and the wickedeſt the wiſeſt man, for
ſuch ſometimes thrive moſt: The beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
would have praied no dole at the
rich mans gate, Nor the rich man have
had out of which to beſtow an alms, nor
yet to relieve himſelf: Had it not been
for Laws vices would have been vertues
and vertues have heard the reproach of
puſillanimity. Were not Laws, <hi>ſmall
offences would be beneath and great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
puniſhment;</hi> Nay, what could be
an offence when there was no rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which it was an offence? It were
well for <hi>Nero</hi> and his Sect of monſters
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119900:115"/>
if there were neither Clerk to recor
nor Law to bound their follies: But it
is to the good of humane ſociety, that
there is this reſtraint upon exorbitancy,
and this encouragement to good and
order.</p>
            <p>The Ancients were very zealouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted

more out of ſuperſtition then policy, they
knew that <hi>uno dato abſurdo, mille ſequun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>

of thoſe that furthered this have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to God and men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

(I truſt I may ſay) they kept the unity

ſo Princes of honour will not
break the confederacies they make upon

is built upon their fidelity. The

Loyalty to our Princes for the moſt

We have recognized their Crowns,
ſupported their eſtate, obeyed their

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119900:134"/>

that they might deſervingly be called
Patrons of generall peace, and ſuch as
by the change they brought, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

But when with <hi>Baſſiaenus</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Princes of fury and extraordinary
frailty,<note place="margin">Eraſm in praef. ad Script. Rom.</note> then even then we honoured
them as Gods Vicegerents, and were
ſo far from derogating from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
that we paid indiſputable and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
obedience to them; The daily prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

pray that all men in power may ever
rule juſtly, and men under power obey
readily; For jealouſies in States do
but provoke Governours to get and
preſerve high power, and nouriſh
thoughts in Subjects how to diſſipate

            <p>Nor have we deceived the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

for although the vanity of ſome is ſo

yet the ſober Engliſhman hath a

and if we view the great Families

many of them will be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

though I know many would tugg much

A juſt weight and ballance
gives adverſaries leaſt advantage. Some
