            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is no small admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in lyke manner, to such who profess the Trueth, in the Reformed Churches of EUROPE, that these of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> having both the Old and New Testament in their hands, and reading the doctrine contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein: Especially in that Epistle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of old, by the Apostle to the Romanes. But that they may, in lyke manner, clearly see how grosly in every poynt of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between them and vs, they haue swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that Ancient Trueth delyvered therein, to the <hi>Noveltie</hi> of latter sprung vp <hi>Errour</hi> quyte controdictor thereto: (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh, <hi>[Chap. 1. verss 21.] the faythfull Citie, is become an Harlot.)</hi> Were not, in lyke manner, that there is a vaile over their hearts; and (as is fore prophesied of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47325:3"/>
such;) That their <hi>Errour</hi> is not only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavableness of vnrighteousness in them that perish: but such a strong delusion, [2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.] that they are inebriated, or made drunk therewith: And so the delusion being strong, is not easily overcome, nor can they be made sinsible thereof; so long as their drunkenness is vpon them, more nor <hi>Naball</hi> could be of his trespass agaynst <hi>David,</hi> (as wyse <hi>Abigail</hi> well knew,) til his wyne was gone from him. [1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.] The same being also a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Iniquitie;</hi> and mysteries not beeing known, (as <hi>David</hi> telleth vs,) till the eyes be opened: <hi>[Psal.</hi> 119. 18.] Even so, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that this mysterie bee not seen by delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded soulls; altho (as at <hi>Sauls</hi> conversion) the light shyne as bright about them, as at noon day: <hi>[Act.</hi> 9.] till lykewyse the LORD open their eyes, and make the scales of their former ignorance and errour, in mercy, to fall off. And, as in curing of <hi>Sauls</hi> blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it pleased the LORD to vse the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of a Disciple <hi>Ananias,</hi> rather than a great Apostle: Even so, it hath pleased the LORD, sometymes, for curing the blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

of poore seduced soulls, by <hi>Poperie,</hi> to vse the Ministrie of some who are but weak instruments: That so the greater glory may be his own, amongst whom as one, (as it hath pleased GOD before now to haue blessed my weak endevours for that end:) So I haue taken the ensuing paynes, to see as yet if by HIS BLESSING, I may reclayme but one poore soull, to come out of <hi>Babell,</hi> and gayn it to CHRIST; wherein if the success bee according to my hearty and charitable desyre, I shall bless the LORD, whose only work is the bringing back of the strayed sheep, and conversion of a simple soull. But, if it be otherwyse, and that the wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant &amp; seduced, say as their predecessours did when the LORD, by His Prophet, <hi>[Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> 6. 20.] did exhort them, to stand in the wayes, and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk therein; and they should fynd rest to their soulls: But they sayd, we will not walk therein; then it shall bee sufficient to mee, that my work is with my GOD; altho with <hi>Ieremie [chap.</hi> 6. 29.] I may say, that the bellowes are burnt,

That is, ask and try what was the doctrin which was taught from the beginning by PAUL to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; and to the Church of CHRIST there in His tyme, and the tymes of her next primitiue and succeeding Pastours in these poynts controverted, now-a-dayes: and accordingly adhere thereto, disclayming all contrary, if they would be accounted true <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> that is, the Professours of that Apostolicall Trueth &amp; Religion, which was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally then taught to the whole Church of CHRIST in generall, and to the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANES at that tyme in particular.</p>
            <p>For which end, I haue set down in this short Treatise, the summe of that doctrine collected only out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of PAUL TO THE ROMANES: as also out of the writs of one for all of their ancient Bishops, beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison

of greatest account amongst them, <hi>Pope Gregory the first,</hi> for his Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Learning, surnamed by them <hi>The Great;</hi> who lived in the six hundreth year of CHRIST.

let them think it strange or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, (let bee impossible,) that the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who pleadeth such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, should make <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and fall from the trueth, (as Ierusalem farre more priviledged and renowned than shee, of a faythful citie became a harlot:) elss, what needed the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. to set before her eyes the example of the cutting off, of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> who were the natural branches for their <hi>Apostasie:</hi> and therefore, to exhort her who yet stood by fayth, not to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynded, but fear. Which exhortation had bene altogether vnnecessary, if by her priviledge of infallibility, (which is greatest high-myndedness,) she had no cause to fear.</p>

And, therefore, for any <hi>Apostasie</hi> could never be cut off, neither should he haue spoken conditionallie, or doubtinglie, after this manner, (if thou continue,)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47325:8"/>
but particularlie excepted her as one, that could not but continue in the fayth, and not erre therefra.</p>
            <p>Next, if without contradiction it bee evident that both in head and members, shee hath erred <hi>de facto,</hi> and fallen from the fayth, by the witnessing of <hi>Romanists</hi> themselues.

Agayn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom. 8. 15. For yee haue not receaved the spirit of bondage, agayn to fear,</hi> (sayeth the Apostle;) <hi>but yee haue receaved the spirit of adoption, whereby wee cry, Abba, Father.</hi>

Where we see, That being GODS adopted children, wee are exhorted not to fear, (as if wee were going only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a king, or judge;) but to go to Him as a loving Father, with confidence to be heard, (as our Saviour showeth vs;) and that His Spirit in our hearts, teacheth vs to cry, or incall vpon Him, as a Father, and vpon none other.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom. 8. 27. He that searcheth the heart, knoweth the mynd of the spirit,</hi> (sayeth the Apostle.)</p>
                  <p>Whence it followeth; That He must be the searcher of the heart, and know the sinceritie of Prayer; on whom wee must incall: seeing oftentymes neither are our distresses visible, nor our prayers vocall. But so it is, That to search the heart, is GODS only prerogatiue, as we haue it, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 30. Therefore, it followeth, That GOD only is to bee incalled vpon; and neither Saynct nor Angell.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore, wryting to <hi>Eulogius, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Alexandria,</hi> hee concludeth thus;

                  <p>In lyke manner; For the Title, <hi>of head of the Church,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, thus sayeth <hi>Gregorie,</hi> speaking of the fore-named <hi>Patriarch of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople; Ex ea quam pretendebat humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, jactantiam sumpsit, ita vt vniversa sibi tentet ascribere, &amp; omnia quae soli vnicapiti cohaerent; videlicet, CHRISTO, perela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem pompatici sermonis, ejusdem CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STI sibi studeat membra subjugare, Lib.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">Greg. l. 4.

                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 36. That is; Out of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded humilitie, hee assumeth that pryde of speach: That hee would ascrybe all to himselff.

                  <p>Moreover; Whereas <hi>Bellarmine, (lib. 2. de Pontifice, cap.</hi> 31. and 27. §. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondeo,)</hi> maketh this to bee another Style of the <hi>Popes;</hi> that hee is called <hi>Generalis Pater:</hi> And maketh this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereon; That all are therefore, his sonnes: And consequenlie, hee not subject to any; but all subject to him.
