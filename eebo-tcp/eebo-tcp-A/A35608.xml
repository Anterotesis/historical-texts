            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Authors</hi> which were before ſold for <hi>Fifty</hi> or <hi>ſixty pounds</hi> ſeverally, being ſo collected and printed <hi>verbatim,</hi> the Price was reduc'd to <hi>Thirteen pounds ten ſhillings.</hi> The <hi>Charges</hi> of which ſaid <hi>Work</hi> in Nine Volumes, by <hi>buying</hi> ſeveral <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> and <hi>preparing</hi> and <hi>methodizing the Copy</hi> fit for the Preſs, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to about a <hi>Thouſand pounds,</hi> beſides <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Printing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Conſideration whereof the KING's <hi>Majeſty,</hi> upon the <hi>Petition</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee,</hi> was graciouſly pleaſed to grant to him and to his Aſſigns his <hi>Royal Privilege</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. for the ſpace of <hi>Fourteen years</hi> from thence next enſuing; thereby prohibiting all and every perſon and perſons to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print</hi> the ſaid <hi>Work,</hi> or any <hi>part</hi> or <hi>parcell</hi> thereof, within His MAJESTIE's Dominions, during the ſaid Term, without the Leave and Conſent of the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee:</hi> As by the ſaid <hi>Privilege</hi> (printed in the Firſt Volume of the ſaid Nine) it doth more fully and at large appear.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which ſaid <hi>Privilege,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> which prohibit the reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Books, either in part or whole, without the Conſent of him who makes a due Entry of the ſame in the <hi>Regiſter-Book</hi> of the Company of Stationers at their Hall, which the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> had done accordingly at the Coſt of about <hi>Seven pounds;</hi> one Mr. <hi>Matthew Pool</hi> hath (in the ſaid <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Bee</hi>'s Abſence in <hi>Holland,</hi> without his Leave and Conſent) undertaken a <hi>Work</hi> which he calls <hi>A Synopſis of the Critical and other Commentators upon the Bible:</hi> in purſuance of which Deſign he hath nominated ſeveral Voluminous <hi>Commentators,</hi> and amongſt them the ſaid <hi>CRITICKS,</hi> of which eſpecially he intends to make an <hi>Epitome</hi> with the reſt. The dealing with which Voluminous <hi>Authors</hi> the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> and his <hi>Partners</hi> ſhall not at all look upon themſelves as concerned in, provided he forbear the Injuſtice of taking any thing out of the ſaid <hi>CRITICI SACRI</hi> in Nine Volumes, which they have printed at ſo <hi>vaſt a Charge.</hi> Which nevertheleſs if he ſhall purſue to doe, (beſides the infringing the Right that the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> hath in them by his MAJESTIE's ſaid <hi>Privilege</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi>) he will hazard the making the ſaid <hi>Books</hi> unſailable, and, ſo much as in him lies, contribute to the Ruine of him the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> and his <hi>Partners:</hi> too many men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what they ſhall <hi>ſave</hi> by the <hi>ſmallneſs of the Price,</hi> rather then what they ſhall <hi>gain</hi> by the <hi>Goodneſs of the Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe Conſiderations the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> and his <hi>Partners</hi> are forced to joyn this neceſſary Addition, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the late ſad and diſmal <hi>Fire</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1666. it pleaſed God that there were burnt and conſumed above <hi>Thirteen hundred</hi> of the ſaid <hi>CRITICI SACRI,</hi> which, if reckoned but <hi>barely</hi> as they <hi>coſt,</hi> amount to <hi>Twelve</hi> or <hi>thirteen Thouſand pounds;</hi> of which Loſs the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> ſuſtains the one half, and his ſaid <hi>Partners</hi> the other half. (Beſides divers other Books belonging to the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> that were alſo then burnt and conſumed, to the value of <hi>Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds,</hi> all which lay at his <hi>Warehouſe</hi> in <hi>Sion College</hi> near <hi>Cripplegate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> (by this ſad Accident being fruſtrated of his hopes and expectations of reaping the Benefit and Advantage of his great Care, Coſt and pains) doth intend and hath deſigned to <hi>re-print</hi> the ſaid <hi>CRITICKS</hi> in far better <hi>Method</hi> then this already done, and hopes and is verily perſuaded that no perſon whatſoever, that's ſwayed either by Reaſon, Conſcience or Juſtice, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to abridge him of or obſtruct him in that lawful and laudable way of Advantage, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered ſo extreamly in an <hi>

            </p>
            <p>And although the ſaid Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> to ſtrengthen himſelf in this his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking,</hi> hath gain'd the <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> of divers <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned Perſons,</hi> to teſtifie the <hi>

            <p>So that the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi> and his <hi>Partners</hi> do in reaſon and common Juſtice expect that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſhould deſiſt from that part of his <hi>Deſign</hi> wherein the aforeſaid <hi>Nine Volumes</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and likewiſe leave the <hi>Epitomizing</hi> or <hi>other digeſting</hi> of the ſaid <hi>CRITICI SACRI</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi>'s own diſcretion and diſpoſal, ſeeing it evidently appears that they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely his own proper <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Proprietie.</hi>
