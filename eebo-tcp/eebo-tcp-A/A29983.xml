            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Poetical Reflections
ON A LATE
POEM
ENTITULED,
<hi>Absalom and Achitophel.</hi> By a Person of Honour.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IF ever any thing, call'd a <hi>Poem,</hi> deserv'd a severe
Reflection, that of <hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> may
justly contract it. For tho' Lines can never be
purg'd from the dross and filth they would throw on
others (there being no retraction that can expiate the
conveying of persons to an unjust and publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach);
yet the cleansing of their fames from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
pollution, may well become a more ingenious
Pen than the Author of these few reflections will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to challenge.</p>
            <p>To epitomize which scandalous Phamphlet (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the denomination of <hi>Poesy)</hi> no eye can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it without a prodigious amazement; the abuses
being so gross and deliberate, that it seems rather a
Capital or National Libel, than personal exposures,
in order to an infamous detraction. For how does
he character the King, but as a broad figure of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
inclinations, or contriv'd unto such irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as renders him rather the property of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
and Vice, than suitable to the accomplishment
of so excellent a Prince? Nay, he forces on King
<hi>David</hi> such a Royal resemblance, that he darkens
<pb facs="tcp:101176:3"/>
his sanctity in spite of illuminations from Holy
Writ.</p>
            <p>Next (to take as near our King as he could) he
calumniates the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with that height
of impudence, that his Sense is far blacker than his
Ink, exposing him to all the censures that a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
a Traytor, or what a Subject of most ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
evil can possibly comprehend: and it is some
wonder, that his Lines also had not hang'd him on a
Tree, to make the intended <hi>Ahsalom</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p>As to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> (in his collusive <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel),</hi>
what does he other than exceed Malice it
self? or that the more prudent deserts of that Peer
were to be so impeach'd before-hand by his impious
Poem, as that he might be granted more emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condign of the Hangman's Ax; And which his
Muse does in effect take upon her to hasten.</p>
            <p>And if the season be well observ'd, when this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate
Poem was spread, it will be found purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divulg'd near the time when this Lord, with his
other Noble Partner, were to be brought to their
Tryals. And I suppose this Poet thought himself
enough assur'd of their condemnation; at least, that
his <hi>Genius</hi> had not otherwise ventur'd to have tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
on persons of such eminent Abilities, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the Nation. A consideration, I confess, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
my Pen (its preceding respect being paid to the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth)</hi> to vindicate their Reputations
where I thought it due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101176:3"/>
And some are not a little mistaken in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of persons, if any Kingdom has at this time
Two men of their Dignity, of more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Understandings: Which may (if well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd)
be some inducement to their future preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and esteem. As I have endeavour'd chiefly to
clear their abuse, so I have pass'd divers considerable
persons, under as malign inclinations of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's;
conceiving, that what I have said for the
Principals, may remove such smaller prejudices as
are on the value of others on the same concern.</p>
            <p>His most select and pecuniary Favourites, I have
but barely touch'd, in respect his praise includes a
concomitant reprehension, if well apprehended.
Besides, I was unwilling to discourage any, that for
the future may desire to be admir'd by him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their liberality. A method, that perhaps may
in time set up some Merchants of <hi>Pernassus,</hi> where
the <hi>Indies</hi> of Fame seem lately discover'd, and may
be purchas'd <hi>per Centum,</hi> according to modern exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>As to the Charactet of <hi>Amiel,</hi> I confess my Lines
are something pointed, the one reason being, that it
alludes much to a manner of expression of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's,
as may be seen by the marginal Notes; and a
second will be soon allowed. The figure of <hi>Amiel</hi>
has been so squeez'd into Paint, that his soul is seen
in spite of the Varnish.</p>
            <p>And none will deny, but it is as easie to send Truth
backward, as it is to spur Falsities egregiously for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and might have caus'd any Asse, as knowing
as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s, to have rebuk'd such a Poet as will needs
<pb facs="tcp:101176:4"/>
prophecy against the sense of Heaven and Men. But
I have enough of this <hi>Amiell,</hi> as well as of his Muse,
unless that by his means it occasions a further account.
And for what is mine here, It will at worst contract
censure, in respect it is a brief reflection on a very
large Libel. And tho' I believe it did not cost (tho'
that be not offer'd for an excuse) the tenth part of
the time of the other. As to my Preface, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that he should find, that this smaller work has
some Nose.—Tho' I am no more bound to have my
Face known by it, than he is willing to obscure his by
a Nameless Preamble.</p>

            </l>
            <l>For 'tis not harder much, if we tax Nature,</l>
            <l>That Lines should give a Poet such a Feature;</l>
            <l>Than that his Verse a <hi>Hero</hi> should us show,<note place="margin">

When he within the Royal Palace dwell'd,</l>
            <l>And saw 'twas of import if Lines could bring</l>

            <l>And tho no Wit can Royal Blood infuse,</l>
            <l>No more than melt a Mother to a Muse:</l>
            <l>Yet much a certain Poet undertook,</l>
            <l>That Men and Manners deals in without-Book.</l>
            <l>And might not more to Gospel-Truth belong,</l>
            <l>Than he (if Christened) does by name of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This Poet, who that time much squanderd thought,</l>
            <l>Of which some might bring Coyn, whilst some none brought,</l>

            <l>An Emblem in these days of much import,</l>
            <l>When Crop-ear'd Wits had such a Modish Court.</l>
            <l>Tho some from after-deeds much fear the Fate,</l>
            <l>That such a Muse may for its Lugs create.</l>
