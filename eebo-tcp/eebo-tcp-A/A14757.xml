            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gods wrath and displeasure. <hi>To whom is strife.</hi> You talke of good fellowship &amp; friendship, but wine is a rager and tumultuous make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and serts you a quarrelling, &amp; medling.

            <p>All Interpretors agree, that hee meanes some most virulent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, whose poyson is present and deadly. All the Woes hee hath mentioned before, were but as the sting of some Emmet, Waspe or Nettle, in comparison of this Cockatrice, which is euen vnto death; death speedy, death paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and wofull death, and that as naturally and ineuitably, as <hi>Opium</hi> procureth sleepe, as <hi>Ellebore</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, or any Poyson killeth.</p>

All sin is the poyson wherewithall the old Serpent and Red Dragon enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms the soule of man, but no sin (except it bee that which is vnto death) so mortall as this, which though not euer vnpardonably, yet for the most part is also irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerably, and ineuitably vnto death. Seest thou one bitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with any other Snake, there is hope &amp; help. As the Father said of his son, when he had information of his gaming, of his prodigalitie, yea, of his whoring: but when hee heard that hee was poysoned with drunkennesse, hee gaue him for dead, his case for des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and forlorne.

this encrcaseth with yeares, and parteth not till death.

There his eyes behold the strange woman, his heart speaketh peruerse things, becomming heartles as one (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) in the heart of the

Oh that God would be pleased to open the eyes of some drunkard, to see what a dunghill and carrion his soule becoms, &amp; how loathsom effects follow vpon this spirituall death and sting of this Cockatrise which is the fountaine of the other two following, temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death?</p>
            <p>And well may it bee that some such as are altogether fearelesse and carelesse of the former death will yet tremble and bee moued with that which I shall in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place tell them. Among all other sinnes that are, none brings forth bodily death so frequently as this, none so ordinarily slaies in the Act of sinne as this. And what can bee more horrible then to dye in the acte of a sinne without the acte of repentance? I pronounce no definitiue sentence of damnation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11903:10"/>
vpon any particular so dying; but what dore of hope or comfort is left to their friends behind of their saluation? The whoremaster hee hopes to haue a space and time to repent in age, though sometimes it pleaseth God that death strikes <hi>Cosby</hi> and <hi>Zimry</hi> napping, as the deuill is sayd to slay one of the Popes in the instant of his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and carry him quicke to hell. The swearer and blasphemer hath commonly space, though seldome grace, to repent and amend: and some rare examples stories afford, of some taken with oathes and blasphemies in their mouthes. The theefe and oppressor may liue and repent and make restriction as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>: though I haue seene one slayne right out with the timber he stole halfe an houre before; and heard of one that hauing stolne a sheepe and laying it downe vpon a

But this sinne of Drunkennesse is so odious to him, that he makes it selfe, Iustice, Iudge and Executioner, slaying the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly with misfortune, bringing them to vntimely shamefull ends in bruitish and bestiall manner of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their own vomit and ordure; sending them sottish, sleeping, and senselesse to hell, not leauing them either time, or reason, or grace to repent, and crie so much as <hi>Lord haue mercy on vs.</hi> Were there (as

            <p>In Barnewel neere to Cambridge one at the Signe of the Plough, a lusty young man, with two of his Neighbours, and one Woman in their company, agreed to drinke a barrell of strong Beare; they drunk vp the vessell, three of them dyed within 24 houres, the fourth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly escaped after great sicknes.

Yet is there a salue for this sore, there came one from heauen that trode, the Winepresse of his Fathers fiercenesse, drunke of a cup tempered with all the bitternesse of Gods wrath and the diuels malice, that hee might heale euen such as haue drunke deepest of the sweete cup of sinne. And let all such know, that in all the former discouerie of this poyson, I haue onely aimed to cause them feele their sting, and that they might with earnest eyes behold the Brasen Serpent, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously repaire to him for mercie and grace, who is perfectly able to eiect euen this kind, which so rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hardly is thrown out where once he gets possession.

mercy, as the thirstie land hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raine, a longing appetite after the water that comes out of the Rocke, after the bloud that was shed for thee; then let him that is a thirst come, let him drinke of the water of life without any money; of which if thou hast tooke but one true and thorow draught, thou wilt neuer long after thy old puddle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of sinne any more.

Parents, if you loue either soule or body, thrift or pietie, looke to keep them from this infection.

If any of them bee bitten of this Cockatrice, sleepe not, rest not, till you haue cured them of it, if you loue their health, husbandry, grace, their present or future liues.

I speake not to such Starres as this Dragon hath swept downe from heauen with it tayle: for of such the Prophets, the Fathers of the Primitiue, yea, all ages complaine of.
