            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſgraces of his Life. And therefore it would be but a vain Attempt ſor any perſon of ordinary prudence and common reaſon to endeavour ſuch a thing. But when a man has done an Act applauded by the approbation of many ſober perſons, and ſuffers only the Reproaches of a few, and moſt of thoſe his Enemies, it is but the dictate of ſelf-preſervation to remove the weight that oppreſſeth him. I have made my ſelf the publick Diſcourſe, and in ſome meaſure the publick expectation both of Town and Country, and began to do thoſe things for which His Majeſty was moſt graciouſly pleaſed to deem me worthy his (never-to-be-forgotten) Favour; for this reaſon I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think my ſelf ſafe from the ill opinion even of the beſt of my Friends, ſhould I by a neglectful and careleſs ſilence, ſubmit my ſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by thoſe Violences and Diſgraces that have been put upon me in the purſuit of my gratitude for the greateſt obligation that could be received from a moſt benign and Royal Bounty. Therefore for the ſatisfaction of the World, and to vindicate my ſelf, without any thoughts of prejudice or revenge, I hold it but an Act of common Juſtice to my Friends and my ſelf, to make a faithful, and render a true Account, of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages in Fact, that concerned the Tryal of Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom I thought I was to have been a Witneſs, and had refreſhed and recollected my thoughts to that purpoſe. In the next place I ſhall add ſome few Obſervations upon the Objections made againſt me and my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and then leave it to all unbiaſſed perſons to judge of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both Loyalty and Integrity therein.</p>
            <p>The Charge itſelf I brought againſt Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was of a high nature, and form'd into an Indictment from the Relation which follows, given in by my ſelf, that had been the Chief Actor in the whole concern by her means.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1678. Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> came to me then a Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> (that being the firſt time I ever ſaw her) from which place in about a Months time ſhe obtained my diſcharge. I was no ſooner out from thence, but I was Arreſted and carried to the <hi>Counter,</hi> whither Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> ſent her ſervant, who told me, that if I could forthwith obtain my Liberty, her Miſtreſs would purchaſe it at any rate, for that there was buſineſs ordered me to undertake the Tueſday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and if I could not get out before that day, ſhe could not tell if ever I ſhould be freed by her or not.</p>
            <p>Thereupon I removed my ſelf to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> by Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, who after I had been there about two days came to me, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me ſome Money for the preſent, told me, I ſhould have a weekly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for my immediate Expences, but that I ſhould not long continue
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58068:3"/>
there. At the ſame time ſhe added further, that I might do as much ſervice there, as if I were forth, by obſerving one <hi>Stroud</hi> a Priſoner there, who, as ſhe ſaid, knew much of the Life and Converſation of Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> and withal, commended me to the Advice of two Prieſts, then Priſoners alſo there, which I was to take for the more ſecure management of that buſineſs. At the ſame time likewiſe Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> ordered me to write to one <hi>Blazedale</hi> an Apothecary, for ſuch Ingredients as I ſhould have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for to lay the ſaid <hi>Stroud</hi> in a Trance, whereby I might the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the Defign, which was, of getting ſome Papers in his Cuſtody, which were reported to concern Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> in his Evidence. Some time after, as well by order from Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> as others, I was directed to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and diſcharge my Debts; in purſuance whereof I was furniſhed with Money, which not being ſufficient to procure my Liberty, I prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a Waiter to go with me to Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe, and by her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions left at home, I went from thence to <hi>Powis</hi> Houſe, where I found her, and where I received as much more as quite Diſcharged me; ſo that in four hours after ſhe brought me into the preſence of the Lady <hi>Powis;</hi> who together with her ſelf, returned me thanks for my diligence in that buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Stroud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was alſo preſent when the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſent me to <hi>Peterly</hi> with a Pacquet, and was the perſon the Lady intruſted to make up the Pacquet. Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was alſo preſent when I returned from <hi>Peterly,</hi> and delivered the Pacquet which I brougbt from thence to the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> &amp; ſhe was likewiſe by, when the Lady read a Letter openly to this effect, (which I brought from the Prieſt Mr. <hi>Jeane</hi> in the above-mentioned Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.)</p>

The next day Mrs <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> was ſent for to the <hi>Tower,</hi> who upon her return, told me, I muſt ſpeedily procure ſome perſons that were well habited, to go to the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſes and Clubs to learn how things ſtood. Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was alſo preſent, when the Lady <hi>P.</hi> told me, that I muſt ſtick hard againſt the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> D. of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and others; all which was to be done, when I went the firſt time to give His Majeſty an Account of the new SHAM-PLOT, at which time I was to inform His Majeſty, that if he had dyed at <hi>Windſor,</hi> they had poſted about the Town and Suburbs a conſiderable Army, with which they intended to have taken poſſeſſion, and did deſign to bring the ſame to a Common-wealth, and ſet up the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as Head of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: That the L. <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> and others were granting out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to that purpoſe, and that I my ſelf had a promiſe of one from a great <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> all which and more I told His Majeſty by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, juſt before his going to <hi>Newmarket;</hi> whereupon His Majeſty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me Money, of which I ſent an Account by Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> who at her return, adviſed me to beware of one Colonel <hi>Halſel,</hi> for that the Lords fear'd he would diſcover me. Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> carried word from me to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Manſel</hi> Lodged, and upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn told me, the Lady <hi>P.</hi> would meet me in the afternoon at her Houſe, as ſhe did, and Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was preſent when her Ladiſhip bid me go again to Father <hi>Sharp</hi> to Confeſſion, and receive the Sacrament, for that I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58068:4"/>
was to go in a ſhort time after to the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury.</hi> Soon after Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> received a Letter, that that very night I muſt go to the ſaid Earl with this formal Complement.</p>

                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>My Lord, I am a ſtranger to your Lordſhip, neither introduced nor ſent by any perſon; but I deſire to know, if it be in my power to ſerve you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may have your Lordſhips favour.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Then did Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> deliver into my hand a ſhort Dagger, of which ſort and faſhion three or four had been brought to her, about three days before, by a <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant, I being preſent at the ſame time when they were delivered to her. After I had been with the Earl, upon my return home, I told Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> I could not do my buſineſs, (which was indeed to ſtab his Lordſhip) but would take ſome other opportunity. Of all which Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> ſent an Account to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and as ſhe told me, her ſelf received for anſwer, That I ſhould go forthwith to the King, and inform His Majeſty that I had been with the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who had promiſed me a Military Imployment. Then by direction I went a ſecond time to the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury;</hi> Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> furniſhed me then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with a Dagger. But returning again without any <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, I received new Orders to go to the King, and acquaint His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty how I had been a ſecond time with the E. of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and of a great quantity of Papers that concerned the New PLOT, that were in Colonel <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, for the ſearch whereof my farther buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to pray a Warrant; which would not be granted, becauſe I could not make ſuch Affidavit as was requiſite. For which I was well ſcool'd, both by the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> and Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> who after they had told me ſeveral ways how I might have ſaved my Oath, added withal, That I was obliged by my Religion to part with my Life for the good of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Some ſmall time after, the Lady <hi>P.</hi> came to Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe, where being all three together, the Lady endeavoured to perſwade me to go a third time to the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> which I refuſed to do; whereupon the Lady ſtriking me gently on the hand with her Fan, called me <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted fellow,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>ſhe would go herſelf;</hi> Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> made anſwer, No, Madam, that ſhall not be, for I will ſignifie to the world the bravery of our Sex above the Mens, and go my ſelf and do the work. Whereupon ſhe went out of the room for a while, leaving the Lady and my ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to diſcourſe the method of putting the Papers into Colonel <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> Room; which Papers when I had made them up, I ſhewed them to Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> who incouraged me to proceed, ſaying, ſhe would warrant I ſhould be well rewarded for my pains, and wiſh'd me good ſucceſs. When I had convey'd the Papers into Colonel <hi>Manſels</hi> Room, Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> came to me from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and told me, I muſt go to the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and pretend to give intelligence of certain Prohibited Goods which were lodged in the Colonels Chamber, to the end the Officers upon ſearch might find the Papers.</p>
            <p>Soon after being to attend the King and Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> about the Papers, and wanting ſome Inſtructions, I went home to adviſe with Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> at what time I was taken by Colonel <hi>Warcup,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and ingaged by Bail to attend the King and Councel the next day at Three of the clock.</p>
            <p>Upon my being brought to a Hearing, I was Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> whither Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> ſent her Maid to me, and ſomething to my ſupport, adviſing me to ſtand faſt, promiſing I ſhould want for nothing, and ſhould
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58068:4"/>
be removed to the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> After which, the Maid came a ſecond time that day with a Note, which ran thus.</p>
            <q>I am in Cuſtody, and if examined how I came to know you, will declare, I imployed you to get in deſperate Debts; it cannot worſt you.</q>
            <p>To colour which pretence, the Maid alſo brought me two Books of Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Huſbands concerns, and added further, that her Miſtreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to ſtand faſt, <hi>For her Life was in my hands.</hi> To this Intrigue theſe Particulars may be added.</p>
            <p>That I having told Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> how I had been with the King alone at Mr <hi>Chiffins</hi> Lodgings: Oh, ſaid ſhe, <hi>what an opportunity have you loſt!</hi> Soon after the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> coming in, Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> told her the ſtory; at which the Lady turning ſhort about, with her face towards Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> ſaid theſe very words, <hi>How bravely might he have killed the King, had he been provided!</hi> That Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> ordered me in our publick diſcourſe to call the King Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Duke Lady <hi>Ann.</hi> That Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was one of thoſe that ordered me to Treat with Mr. <hi>Boyce,</hi> to try if I could corrupt him to be an Evidence againſt <hi>Prance</hi> (a Witneſs for the King.) And that ſhe was one of thoſe that ordered me to go and Treat with <hi>Nicholas Stubbs,</hi> in reference to recanting the Charge he had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gifford</hi> the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>This is the ſum of the Charge, without any flouriſhing or refining, all matter of Fact, which I intended to have made good againſt Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> in reference to His Majeſties moſt gracious confidence which he had put in my future reality. A Charge not only in my belief, but in the more venerable and ſound opinion of thoſe that had the Conduct of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and management of the Evidence, well guarded and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſufficient ſtrength of Corroborating Teſtimonies. But leſt I may ſeem to abound too much in my own ſence, here they are all in their order. Let the world view them, and then give an equal Sentence.</p>

                           <p>I will tell your Lordſhip what I do know, if theſe Gentlemen will not be too nimble for me, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Kings Councel.)

                           <p>Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was not Committed upon my accuſation, therefore I hoped ſhe might have been Tryed without my Teſtimony. But when I was in danger of my Life, when I lay in the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi>

was reported to be a third Witneſs againſt me, I raked up every trifle. But if I had thought it Treaſon, I would have diſcovered it before. And as to that particular buſineſs concerning Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> a School-maſter, that <hi>Smith</hi> ſometime ſince did come to me, being my old acquaintance, to ask my advice in it, which was to go to the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> I asked him what to do? ſaith he, I can ſay enough againſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to ſerve them and take off his Evidence; and asked me if he ſhould do it.

Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> afterwards told me, this <hi>Smith</hi> and one <hi>Phillips</hi> were willing to tell ſome ſtories or other of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and I told her this very ſtory; ſaith ſhe, you being acquainted with him, it is poſſible you may do ſome good upon him; and ſaith ſhe, I had as lieve as Ten Guineys that you would do it: ſhe ſaid ſhe did not care if ſhe had been at the charge of Ten Guineys, if he would be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and diſcover the truth.</p>

               <p>It is a ſad thing, that people of a vitious profligate Life, both hefore they come to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and all along in their life-time, ſhould be ſuffered as Witneſſes to take away the Life of a Worm.

               <p>He made me believe as though he would fly. I believe he is: we will not hood wink our ſelves againſt ſuch a fellow as this, that is guilty of ſuch notorious Crimes; a Man of Modeſty, after he hath been in the Pillory, would not look a man in the face. It appears, that after he was burnt in the Hand, he hath been Outlawed for Felony, and ſo it doth appear by the Record.</p>
               <p>After I had been abſent about half an hour, I returned with my Pardon, which being read, inſtead of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tlagaria qualiacunque pro Feloniis quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque,</hi> the ſence was more contractively expreſſed by the words, <hi>Omnia Maleſicia &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tlagaria qualiacunque;</hi> which omiſſion ſeemed to render the Pardon defective; it being his Lordſhips opinion, that the word <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagaria</hi> did onely extend to Outlawries between party and party, ſo that my Evidence was wholly laid aſide.</p>

               <p>Such Fellows as you are, Sirrah, ſhall know we are not afraid of you. He produceth us here a Pardon by the Name of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and ſaies his Father and Kinſman are both of that Name and Place. Will you have him Sworn whether his <hi>Father</hi> or Cozen <hi>Thomas</hi> was ever Convict of Felony? It is notorious enough, what a Fellow this is; he was in <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Goale.

               <p>While his Lordſhip was giving his directions to the Jury, I was going away, as not thinking there was any more occaſion for my ſtay, or that his Lordſhip had any farther buſineſs with me. Preſently I heard a voice,</p>

               <p>Then let him be Committed.</p>
               <p>Immediately I was taken into Cuſtody, and carried away to the <hi>Kings-Bench-Priſon,</hi> where I remained from Friday the day after the Tryal, till the Wedneſday-morning following; at what time I was by a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> of my own procuring, brought to the Bar, in order to my giving Bail. But altogether unknown to me, there was a Copy of a Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which I had pleaded at the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> for the remitting a Fine upon me, wherein I was Pardoned for Felonies, Robberies, and all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which raiſed another Argument.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Where was this Pardon allowed? and for what? was it allowed for Felony, as well as the Fine, or for the Fine onely?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Dolbin.</speaker>
               <p>I allowed the Pardon, and as I remember, 'twas onely for the Fine. The Clerk of the Crown remembers perhaps.</p>

               <speaker>M. Tanner.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think it was for the Fine only; but the Felony is included, and therefore Pardoned I ſuppoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, I ſuppoſe not: for if it were not allowed for the Felony, as well as for the Fine, I do not know but that the Indictment ought to be removed, and the Pardon allowed next <hi>Eſſex-Aſſizes.</hi> However, upon his Lordſhips farther conſideration, I was diſcharged.</p>

Being now come to what more particularly concerns my ſelf, I ſhall endeavour to keep within the bounds of reſpect and Reverence to the Office and Dignity of the perſon to whom I am conſtrained to offer theſe Reflections, out of a deep ſence of an Injured Proſelyte to Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as may render me ſuch in the eſteem of the world. And that my Defence may rather appear to be a forced Complaint, than a Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Expoſtulation with a Superiour in ſo high a degree, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon that ſuffered under his Severity. Not forgetting to render my moſt humble thanks to ſome of thoſe Honourable Judges his Brethren, whoſe mildneſs was a Lenitive that very much aſſwaged the rigorous entertainment of my Loyal attendance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take the words in the ſame order as they were ſpoken.</p>
            <q>Dangerfield, <hi>was you ever Indicted for Burglary?</hi>
            </q>
            <p>What the world may think of the Queſtion, I cannot tell, but to my apprehenſion it ſeemed very odd that ſuch a perſon ſhould put himſelf to the trouble of demanding a Queſtion, to which he could not chooſe but well know, or rather was very certain, that the Party Interrogated was no way bound to return an Anſwer. If then the Anſwer were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Verge of Conſtraint, conſequently it was Impertinent; and if ſo, obnoxious: for conſidering the Circumſtances under which the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was well known to have lain, and how eaſily ſuch petty obſtacles might have been prevented, by the uſual fore-ſight of thoſe that fail not to inſpect the Converſation of the moſt material Witneſſes in Tryals of ſuch concernment; It was very ſtrange, that a perſon ſummoned after ſo long deliberation, as a Witneſs for the King, and ready to deliver his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, for no leſs than High-Treaſon, ſhould have his Mouth ſtopt with a Queſtion, which the Priſoner her ſelf had not power to ask, but onely to prove the matter of fact. Had his Lordſhip demanded of Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> whether ſhe had ever been Indicted before of High-Treaſon, he would have looked upon it as a great piece of Deſpair or Impudence, had ſhe anſwered, Yes, my Lord, I have. Yet he that would have ſmiled at ſelf-accuſation in a Priſoner, could think it reaſon to ſift the Kings Evidence to his own ruine. And I muſt Arraign my ſelf for I know not what Burglary, to gratifie his Lordſhip, and the Priſoner, at the ſame time Arraigned by the Court for High Treaſon.</p>
            <q>Let every Man have his right, in God's Name.</q>
            <p>With Submiſſion, I am apt to believe, that here was either a miſtake of the <hi>Sex,</hi> or elſe a ſuppoſition at the delivery of the words, that <hi>Man</hi> in Engliſh, like <hi>Homo</hi> in Latine, is of the Epicene Gender. Elſe I cannot conceive what coherence there could be, between this diſtributive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and my Anſwer to his Lordſhips Queſtion, <hi>I will take it at their proof,</hi> unleſs he thought I deſerved to be Hanged for my obedience to the Kings Writ, to which I was (as I thought) amply enabled by his moſt Gratious Favour. No Impartial man could think I came there to do Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> wrong, or that ſuch a thing was in my power; for his Lordſhip could not but know, ſhe had acknowledged <hi>her Life was in my hands.</hi> So that all the wrong ſhe could expect from me, was to be falſe to the King and Kingdom; and all the right I could have done her, was either to have devoted my ſelf for her dear ſake, with an obſtinate ſilence to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58068:12"/>
Halter, or to have ſtifled my Evidence with ſome generous piece of ſelf Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide.</p>
            <p>Upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Suſan Edwards,</hi> his Lordſhip was pleaſed to ſpring this Queſtion to the Maid.</p>
            <q>What did you ſay to <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> when he ſaid he muſt turn Rogue, and diſcover all their <hi>PLOTS?</hi>
            </q>
            <p>I am unwilling to let fly the leaſt extravagant thought. But certainly it was a particular way of Proceeding, to give the Kings Evidence an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to abuſe and render the Kings Teſtimony ridiculous, and by a queſtion ſo remote and forraign, that at firſt it onely created a wonder why it ſhould be asked; to make one of the beſt Collateral Witneſſes the King had, the ſport of his own Court; and all this (for the wonder ſoon ceaſed) to entertain the Auditory with a Sarcaſme of a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid:</p>
            <q>I ſaid he would be no greater Rogue than he was before.</q>
            <p>How ſtrong this ſmelt of premeditation, I leave to the world to judge. For his Lordſhip could not chooſe but know what the Anſwer would be, who had the Queſtion ſo ready, when there was not the leaſt cauſe or neceſſity for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For <hi>Suſan Edwards</hi> was ſummoned to prove the bringing the Twenty ſhillings in Silver, and the Guiney to me from Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> at <hi>Newgate,</hi> (upon my firſt apprehenſion) with Inſtructions what to ſay, ſhould I be asked about the occaſion of our Correſpondence. She was to have proved the Meſſage that ſhe brought from Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> to me ſoon after,</p>
            <q>That her Life was in my hands, and that if I did not ſtand faſt, ſhe was an undone Woman.</q>
            <p>Which had it been fully Sworn, I queſtion whether Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> though I had been what they would have made me, muſt not have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Jury, and reſerved to a farther diſcovery. But to all this his Lordſhip had not one Interrogatory to purpoſe, onely amuſeth the unwary Damſel, (who if ſhe paſs henceforward for a Wit about the Town, owes her advantage ſolely to his Lordſhip) and leads her into a Queſtion to deſtroy what he ought to have ſupported. As if the Maid had been ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned thither not to give her Evidence, but onely to ſhew her Parts. Which when his Lordſhip had done, he could not forbear to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Maids Wit with a Sardonick ſmile, give her the great applauſe, <hi>You were pretty nimble with him.</hi> Whence I may with <hi>Seneca</hi> preſume to obſerve, that there is a difference between Paſſion and Sedateneſs; and that apparent Heats and Tranſportments, are not always the ornament of a <hi>Tribunal. Quid ergo? non iraſcor Latroni? non iraſcor Venefico? Non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sed procedam in Tribunal non infeſtus ſed vultu Legis; nec quicquam magnum eſt, niſi quod ſimul &amp; placidum,</hi> l. 1. de Ira, c. 26.</p>
            <p>But now directing his Speech to Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> with a more friendly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he enquires of her,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have you any Record to ſhew that</hi> Dangerfield <hi>was put in the Pillory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if it had been the work of that Morning to Arraign Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> for Treaſon, and try me by her Evidence. You may be ſure Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was loath to come to the Teſt; and I think his Lordſhip was as unwilling ſhe ſhould: what Records ſhe had, he had allowed her fairly enough before
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58068:13"/>
to produce, without the help of ſuch incouraging Queſtions. Though the Court be of Councel for the Priſoner, there was no ſuch need of prompting a Woman, whoſe readineſs in ſuch affairs, had been ſo well experienced in the ſame place. However, it being now impoſſible for her to deny a favour ſo earneſtly demanded, ſhe produced a Brace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; the one was a Copy of an Outlawrie for Felony, upon which his Lordſhip called to the Kings Councel,</p>
            <q>Come Gentlemen, what ſay you to this Outlawry for Felony?</q>
            <p>Here his Lordſhip ſeemed to Careſs the advantage he had over me; he calls to the Kings Councel, as one that ſaw he had put them to a puzzle, and conſequently certain of the Victory. I would not willingly incur the diſpleaſure of any man, eſpecially of his Lordſhip; but my Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation urges me to ſay this, that though there are many Reaſons why a Man may ask a preparatory Queſtion, which he is able to reſolve at the ſame inſtant; yet here it carried the reſemblance onely of a preparatory Formality, which the ſubſequent proceedings required. The knowledge of my Offences, were the Motives that induced Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> to aſſociate me with her ſelf, in the deep Contrivances of ſo wicked a Conſpiracy. His Majeſty himſelf, who never gave me thoſe Reproaches under the foul guilt of Treaſon, as his Lordſhip did when Pardoned by his Soveraign, well knew my Crimes; but beholding my penitence, gave a forfeited Life to him, who had been the bane of a Conſpiracy againſt his Sacred perſon. Elſe Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> had hard meaſure to be ſo long detained upon the acccuſations of one who walked about the Town with a defective Pardon. And it may be looked upon as a Recompence for her Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that ſhe was ſo eaſily delivered. Otherwiſe, it was a ſevere Caſe, that Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> laden with ſo many Crimes, fouler than all mine put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, unleſs what ſhe her ſelf had involved me in, ſhould be brought to the Bar to encounter me her grand Aſſociate, her Confederate, her Intimate in the conduct of all her myſterions Treacheries, with an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Outlawry, (I ſpeak comparatively) and all for want of a <hi>Quibuſcunque,</hi> and this too in order to her Acquittal.</p>
            <q>We ought to be very careful in theſe Concerns.</q>
            <p>I dare not preſume to inſtruct his Lordſhip, nor do I; nor do thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more queſtion, but that his Lordſhip exactly underſtands how far his care ought to extend. But whether needleſs and overweening nicety be care, I leave the Caſuiſts to diſpute. Care may be hurtful, where there is more care taken of the greater Criminal, than of the leſs. Care may be too injurious, if I may not ſay preſumptive, when it over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſcans and deſcants upon a thing of ſo ſolemn a nature, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of a Soveraign Prince, whoſe onely <hi>Let him be Pardoned,</hi> is like the command of <hi>Let there be day.</hi> And I dare be bold to ſay, That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty never intended I ſhould ſuffer that prejudice and diſgrace by his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as his Lordſhip hath put me to.</p>
            <q>Elſe we may do a work this day, may make the Kingdom rue it.</q>
            <p>I ſee his Lordſhip continueth his care; but there are many that fear, his care was too neglectful, to let ſo great a Criminal as Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> was,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58068:13"/>
(for while I have breath I muſt ſtill maintain it) break all the Fences of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the meer defect of Clerkſhip. And many good people there are, whoſe Prayers, Hopes, and Wiſhes, are all to the ſame effect; That the Kingdom may not rue the Cavils of that Morning, under the pretence of care and tenderneſs of Conſcience. And the Queſtion may be fairly put, whether the great Arch-Angel of the Three Kingdoms, and the Tutelar Angels of the Nation, his choſen Aſſiſtants, ſhewed more care in committing ſo great an Offendor as Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> and ſupporting my Information; or his Lordſhip, in vilifying both my Teſtimony and Perſon to ſet her free. The World muſt needs believe that his Lordſhip had a very high opinion of his Prudence and Juſtice, to advance them above the Wiſdom and Equitable deliberation both of the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. But he had Condemned ſeveral (at what time there was no diſputing about Pardons, though far more furiouſly Attacked) and therefore as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſt be ſaved, or elſe <hi>Aſtraea</hi>'s Ballance would fall from the <hi>Zodiack.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>It is a ſad thing that people of a vitious profligate Life, both before they come to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and all along in their Life-time, ſhould be ſuffered as a Witneſs to take away the Life of a Worm.</q>
            <p>His Lordſhip next will deny the King his Prerogative; for that very perſon whom the King had ſet right in Court, he calls one of a vitious and profligate Life; ſo far his Lordſhip differs from the ſence of the Bleſſed: Heaven rejoyceth at the Converſion of a ſinner, his Lordſhip ſtorms at mine. And becauſe I had deſervedly ſuffered before in bad Cauſes, he was reſolved to be even with me, and make me ſuffer for once undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly in a good one. I ſubmit to his Lordſhip, that it would be an hard caſe for ſuch perſons as he mentions, to take away the Life of a Worm. But his Lordſhip miſtakes Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Character, for ſhe was no <hi>Worm,</hi> unleſs he means ſuch a <hi>Worm,</hi> as would have Corroded and Cankered the very Root of the Nations happineſs. And then it was a <hi>ſad thing,</hi> that a perſon of a <hi>profligate</hi> Life <hi>Pardoned,</hi> ſhould not be admitted to give his Teſtimony againſt a Woman of a profligate Life unpardoned. Here was onely the difference in the Proverb; the Worm was trod on, and his Lordſhip turned again.</p>
            <p>Might I be ſo bold, I would ask his Lordſhip, who diſcovered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Cataline,</hi> but <hi>Curius? Flagitiis atque facinoribus Coopertus &amp; Fulvia?</hi> Saluſt.</p>
            <p>Who revealed the Treaſons of <hi>Marſhal Biron,</hi> but his Confident <hi>Laf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin? Accablé de Crimes &amp; de mauvaiſes affaires?</hi> Mezeray.</p>
            <p>For if a Man be not of the Cabinet-Councel of the wicked, he ſhall never be able to know their Intrigues; and if he know them not, far leſs able to diſcover them. Mrs <hi>Cellier</hi> acknowledged, that had I not been brisk, I had never been fit for their turn. He that is not through-paced in bad principles, is not to be truſted in the Murther of a Prince; Men of Vertue certainly were not to be invited to the attempts. But people of vitious Principles, ſtick as cloſe to them, as honeſt and good men to the Precepts of Vertue, which creates the difference and ſafety between communicating a piece of villany to a Miſcreant, and an honeſt man. From whence I collect, That no Man can be a good Witneſs in Miſchief againſt his Confederates, unleſs he be involved in the ſame Crime. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reaſon is plain to all Men, why ſome are Pardoned for Burglary, ſome for Robbing on the High-way; to the end they be good Witneſſes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58068:14"/>
to diſcover the miſ-deeds of their Accomplices. For to uſe his own words at the Lord <hi>Caſtlemains</hi> Tryal: <hi>A Man once Pardoned, is reſtored to his former Credit; and ſo the King intends by all his Pardons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if that be true, (as I would take all advantages to ſubſcribe to his Lordſhips opinion) certainly his Lordſhip was under a miſtake, ſo needleſly to quarrel with His Majeſties Broad-Seal, or at leaſt, to make ſo ſlight of his intentions. Doubtleſs it was an high reflection upon the Kings Honour, to repeat and raiſe from the Tomb of ſilence, to the ruine of a Pardoned Subject, the Ghoſts of buried Crimes. And yet ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had affronted His Majeſties moſt gracious Act and Deed, to declare that the very intentions of the King are valid in his Pardons. But the grandeur of the antient Oracles conſiſted in their Ambiguity.</p>
            <q>I queſtion whether he will come again or no, he has been gone a great while.</q>
            <p>His Lordſhip purſues his Text very ſmartly, and in another Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he would have looked upon it as a kind of <hi>Malitia praecogitata,</hi> to proſecute a perſon, that to his knowledge never did his Lordſhip wrong, with ſo much vehemency; for my part, my little reaſon tells me, that though it be the duty of far my Betters, to reverence and to be careful of giving Offence to a Perſonage ſo highly entruſted as his Lordſhip, yet that it is beneath the Majeſty of Magiſtrates ſo eminently exalted, to trample upon the meaneſt of their inferiours. Neither do I think, with all Submiſſion be it ſpoken, that his Lordſhip kept within the bounds of true <hi>Decorum,</hi> to ſit in that place prepoſſeſſing the People with an ill opinion of the Kings Evidence. I am ſorry I diſobliged his Lordſhips patience; yet I dare be bold to ſay, (though it be no eaſie task to hurry through the ſtreets of <hi>London)</hi> that I did not exceed the time allowed me of half an hour, to go from the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> beyond the Royal <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi> However, at length I did return, as far as I can gueſs, contrary to his Lordſhips both expectation and deſire, by that expreſſion which follows, when he ſaid,</p>
            <q>I queſtion whether he will come or not.</q>
            <p>A ſurmiſe, of which I cannot fathom the reaſon, for I neither had the leaſt apprehenſion of the danger concealed, or fear of my diſability to make good my Charge, in regard his Lordſhip had not revealed his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intentions to me. Had his Lordſhip had any ſuſpition of me, it may be wondred he did not ſend his Tipſtaff along with me then, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he did, and which he might as juſtly have done. But here <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> in one of his Dialogues, lends me his aſſiſtance, where he ſays: <q>That he who inveighs againſt the abſent, doth but claim the attention of the Auditory to himſelf, by prepoſſeſſing their ears, and ſtopping them up after he hath filled them full of the worſt he hath to ſay, by which he renders them impenetrable to any defence againſt the ill Character he hath given.</q> Which he calls a very great injury, not onely in his own, but in the judgment of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Draco,</hi> two wiſe and famous Legiſlators.</p>
            <q>Such are fit to be employed to find out, but hard to be believed when they have found out.</q>
            <p>This is a <hi>Laconiſm</hi> wherein his Lordſhip had undertaken much in few
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58068:14"/>
words, and therefore the harder to be interpreted. But I humbly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his meaning to be this; That they who are and have been the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers of the PLOT, and fit to be believed, ſo far as to ſay there was a PLOT, are not when they Swear in the Proſecution of their Diſcovery, in regard that ſuch a Proſecution is the act of men of <hi>Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Lives.</hi> If this be the meaning of this pithy Sentence, as I believe <hi>Salmatius</hi> himſelf could find no other, his Lordſhip hath laid a fair Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the Subverting, Overturning, and invalidating all that hath been ſaid or acted by all the Teſtimonies and Evidence for His Majeſty, in all the ſeveral late Tryals, wherein his Lordſhip himſelf preſided: which if it ſhould come to paſs, I leave it, with ſubmiſſion to his Lordſhip, to conſider the fatality o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Conſequences. My Lord, it can be no good Logick to grant the Papiſts ſuch a Concluſion; they are nimble enough to lay hold upon the ſayings of great and Learned Men, eſpecially when uttered as Apothegms; and they needed no ſuch encouragement to prove their Arguments. But Heaven avert, that either your Lordſhip, or any ſuch Stars of the firſt Magnitude in the Sphere of Loyalty, ſhould ever live to ſee ſuch a mutation of Affairs!</p>
            <q>Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> is this the Man that broke <hi>Chelmsford</hi>Goale?</q>
            <p>Lord! What a ſtrange Queſtion was this, for all Men that own Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to ſhake their heads at? Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> muſt be favoured by the Name of Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi> muſt be tempted to anſwer for the Keeper of <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Goale. As much as to ſay, Is there no Man here that can help a man out to vilifie this Rogue? But it ſeems Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> could neither anſwer his Lordſhips Queſtion, nor his expectations. But to ſhew how ready I am to obey his Lordſhips Commands, I will freely give his Lordſhip to underſtand, that I never did break the Goale of <hi>Chelmsford;</hi> though if I had, I know not what kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it would have done his Lordſhip, but onely to render me more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Auditory.</p>
            <q>Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> was he Burnt in the Hand for Felony?</q>
            <p>Here was another ſtrange Riddle propoſed, but not ſo difficult to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold as that of <hi>Sphynx;</hi> for wherefore ſhould that Queſtion be asked, when there was a true Copy of a Record produced for it? but this was ſtill to improve the ill-will and bad opinion of the People againſt me. My Lord could never have been the Conquering Champion, had he not firſt made me the monſtrous Dragon. But I owed that reſpect to his Lordſhip, that had he put that Queſtion to my ſelf, I would have owned it. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am apt to believe, that as the Caſe then ſtood with me, any other perſon, though the beſt Gentlemans Son in the Country, might have been lyable to the ſame ſcandal, or rather diſgrace; for then I was but a young ſtripling, under the Tuition of my Father, and no way privy to the Fact laid in the Indictment, till it was actually committed by another perſon; who being, as I was under my Father, Clerk to another Atturney, came to me one Evening with a Cabinet, which, as he ſaid, he had taken from his Mother, who was a Woman very rigid, and careleſs of his Maintenance: withal he told me, I ſhould have a part, if I would conceal his Crime, and help him off with the Goods, which the ignorance of my youth was by ſuch a dazling proſpect eaſily tempted to undertake, as I did; and for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58068:15"/>
which the other Boy gave me as many of the things, as he ſaid amounted to one third part more. Now to ſhew what a cunning gameſter I was at this ſport, I was no ſooner poſſeſſed of my gay Toyes, but I openly wore the Rings which came to my ſhare, and ſhewed my Silver Medals to the Countrey-people, diſplaying my Prizes with all the folly and pride ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable of an unexperienced Boy, and one that underſtood nothing of his danger. At length, the deſcription of all the things being publiſhed in the Gazet, the people of the Town well knowing I had ſhewed them ſeveral of the Goods mentioned in the Advertiſement, carried me before a Juſtice of the Peace, to whom, upon my Examination, I owned where I had them, and how I came by them; thereupon the Juſtice Committed me, and being brought to Tryal, I was Convicted for Confederacy. Which is the whole and plain truth of the ſtory, of which his Lordſhip would have made ſuch an advantage againſt me</p>
            <q>He made me believe he would flie; I believe he is: we will not hood-wink our ſelves againſt ſuch a fellow as this, that is guilty of ſuch notorious Crimes. A Man of Modeſty would not look a man in the face, after he hath been in the Pillory.</q>
            <p>I do find now, that his Lordſhip is coming to his application; but if the Spirit of Wiſdom be mild and ſoft, as the Sacred Oracle of Scripture affirms it to be, I cannot imagine why his Lordſhip ſhould fall into ſuch Raptures and Rhapſodies upon bare ſurmiſes. It's believed I was <hi>fled,</hi> and and therefore <hi>we will not hood-wink our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Here his Lordſhips ſuppoſition was without ground, becauſe I did return again. Neither do I remember, that I told his Lordſhip I would <hi>flie,</hi> becauſe it was a thing I never pretended to. Now the Logick of Reaſon informs me, that where the ſuppoſition vaniſheth, the inferences can never be true. But grant I had been Pillored, moſt certainly the Pardon reached that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and tho it was thought to be defective in reference to the Outlawry. I humbly conceive it was not ſo fair for his Lordſhip at that time to tax me for want of Modeſty. I have been informed, that one of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Predeceſſours was once a Robber upon the High-way, but having obtained his Pardon fell to his Studies, roſe by the Law that he had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten broken, and became a great and famous Judge. So that Reformation ought to be encouraged, not upbraided. For my part, though neceſſity prompted me to ſo many vile miſ-deeds, yet within my ſelf at the ſame time I abhorred the Fact I was committing; and therefore I humbly beg his Lordſhips Pardon, for differing from his Lordſhips Judgment of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. For he that hath once obtained the Pardon of a Prince, ought to be ſo far from ſecluding himſelf from the Converſe of Mankind, or daring to look people in the face, that he would wrong the high favour done him, ſhould he not make it his buſineſs to ſhew himſelf the publick object of Royal Mercy, and defie all thoſe that tax him with his forgiven Crimes. But theſe Taunts and Reproaches, (though ten thouſand times more frequently thrown in my diſh) ſhall never make me decline the juſt cauſe I am ingaged in, for the Service of my King and Country. In order whereunto, though I were the Man that yeſterday durſt do an ill act, I am not to day afraid, after a full repentance of my Crime, <hi>to look him in the face,</hi> who ſhall be ſo unkind as to tax me with immodeſty for ſo doing. If his Lordſhip knew of the defect in my Pardon before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he might have diſpatched his buſineſs ſooner, and not have put
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58068:15"/>
himſelf in ſuch a heat for his attendance upon me: if not, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was unſeaſonable to be ſo violent before the Pardon came, and the defect were proved.</p>
            <p>Here the Pardon was ſcan'd, and adjudged defective as to the Outlawry.</p>
            <q>Such Fellows as you are, Sirrah ſhall know we are not afraid of you.</q>
            <p>I do not know that ever at any time I called his Lordſhips Courage in queſtion; and I appeal to all that were preſent in Court, whether I failed in any point of reſpect and reverence to the Dignity of the perſons there ſitting; ſo that I cannot apprehend the reaſon why his Lordſhip ſhould believe that I thought my ſelf ſuch a Terrour to him. However, his Lordſhip hath owned himſelf under the Notion of thoſe that may have reaſon to <hi>fear ſuch Fellows</hi> as I am, though for the preſent he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the contrary. <hi>Such Fellows,</hi> is a comprehenſive expreſſion; but I hope there are no more <hi>ſuch Fellows</hi> as his Lordſhip endeavours to make me, in the diſcovery of the PLOT; if there are, his Lordſhip hath not thought it convenient as yet to tell them his mind. But now I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I was no ſuch fellow once; I was allowed as a good Witneſs at the Tryal of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> and at the Tryal of <hi>Munſon</hi> the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So change the times, and we are changed in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we ſee his Lordſhip is not afraid of me; who they are he doth fear, that's onely for time to diſcover.</p>
            <q>He produces here a Pardon by the Name of <hi>Thomas </hi> of <hi>Waltham,</hi> and ſays, his Father and Kinſman were both of that Name and Place; will you have him Sworn, whether his Father and Kinſman were ever Convicted of Felony?</q>
            <p>Here is a Propoſal made to the Kings Councel, the ſtrangeſt that could be imagined; his Lordſhip could not but well know who was the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Waltham</hi> concerned in the Pardon, and the chief occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was granted; which was, to make me a Legal and Warrantable Teſtimony agaiſt a foul Traitreſs, that had Conſpired the Death of His moſt Sacred Majeſty: and yet for that very reaſon he rejected the Kings favour, to render it ineffectual both to His Majeſties expectation and my advantage. However, at the ſame time he could have been content, that the perſon whom he had reſuſed for a Teſtimony in the Kings behalf, as one that had been Pillored, Burnt in the Hand, and Outlawed for Felony, and unpardoned, as he concluded, for the laſt, ſhould be allowed to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach his Father, his Kinſman, and himſelf, upon his own Oath; Nay, had I but ſaid it, I queſtion it not but it would have been enough. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if it were onely put by way of <hi>Irony</hi> to the Councel, it onely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make an inſignificant noiſe among the ignorant, and I fear me comes within the Verge of a Baffle upon Royal proſecution. I do confeſs, that in all my obſervations of the late Proceedings, I never ſaw the Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo well Hectored before.</p>
            <q>He has been in <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Goale; I will ſhake all ſuch Fellows before I have done with them.</q>
            <p>Here's a ſhow of Words and Threats as great as Hail ſtones; let all Men take an extraordinary care how they get into <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Goale. <hi>He has</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58068:16"/>
               <hi>been in</hi> Chelmsford <hi>Goale, and therefore I will ſhake all ſuch Fellows.</hi> Here's a new moſt horrid and monſtrous Crime, never heard of before, <hi>to have been in</hi> Chelmsford <hi>Goale;</hi> 'tis no matter for what he was in <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Goale. But I have already given the world an account, how I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that diſmal and execrable place, and for what, and ſhall therefore ſay no more of it.</p>
            <p>But to this terrible buſineſs of <hi>ſhaking;</hi> I hope 'tis eaſie to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that I ſtand upon a ſounder bottom than to be ſo eaſily ſhaken. With ſubmiſſion, I believe it to be the ſame bottom on which the Intereſt and Safety of my moſt Gratious Soveraign and Countrey, the Proteſtant Religion, and National Government at preſent ſtand; and then let his Lordſhip endeavour to ſhake all together if he can, I am certain to be ſhaken in good company. Truly I cannot chooſe but check my thoughts for thinking what throwes his Lordſhip endured to deliver a Midwife.</p>
            <q>Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> have you any more to ſay? Are there any more <hi>Waltham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> here?</q>
            <p>To which I anſwered and told his Lordſhip, that there was enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, to diſcourage a man from ever entertaining an honeſt Principle.</p>
            <p>To which his Lordſhip,</p>
            <q>What do you think with all the Miſchiefs Hell has in you, to brave it in a Court of Juſtice?</q>
            <p>Thus was my mouth quite ſtopped, there was no ſpeaking after this. However, I will leave this to all the world, whether the modeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which I made of the uſage I had received for coming to do His Majeſty Service, were a braving of the Court or no.</p>
            <q>Have you any Friends will be bound with you a in good Sum of Money?</q>
            <p>I was in good hopes his Lordſhips haſt had been over, and that he had been now going about to turn a kind Banker, believing I might want Money in the place whither he was ſending me. For conſidering the ſafety wherein I thought my ſelf, by Vertue of my Pardon; and not believing his Lordſhip would have made ſuch publick Reflections on the Kings Grace and Favour therefore granted, to juſtifie me againſt all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that would be made againſt me by the Kings Priſoners: I could not imagine any other reaſon why his Lordſhip ſhould examine me for Security; but it ſeems it was to another end: for not having any Subſidie-Friends in Court, he gave the word of Command,</p>
            <q>Then let him be Committed.</q>
            <p>And ſo I was Committed <hi>to all intents and purpoſes;</hi> for immediately I was taken into Cuſtody, &amp; hurried away to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Priſon, where being looked upon by thoſe inferiour <hi>Beaſts</hi> of Men, as one that lay under <hi>thoſe</hi> ſevere aggravations, of which the ſcorn and contempt of <hi>Superiour Command had ſo tempeſtuouſly thrown upon me,</hi> and I was preſently lockt up with <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> and ſeveral others whom they had aſſimulated to themſelves in Lawleſs conditions; who maliciouſly remembring that I had been a Witneſs againſt them at their Tryals, upon which they lay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58068:16"/>
their Conviction, not onely rudely aſſaulted, but farther menaced me with nothing leſs than Murder. So that finding my ſelf an unequal Match, either for Power or Number, I acquainted the door-keeper with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and told him withal, that it was his Maſters buſineſs as much to ſecure my Life as my Perſon, and therefore deſired to be removed to ſome place of more ſecurity; which ſoon after was done by one <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> an Officer belonging to that place. Who after he had demanded and received from me ſeveral Fees, which, as I was afterwards aſſured, were as unjuſtly extorted, as by me readily paid, according to the uſual cuſtom of thoſe Purſe-Leeches, put me into a kind of Dungeon on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſide, where I continued from Friday till Munday night, after a ſort of hard uſage; <hi>which I am apt to believe,</hi> I ſhould not <hi>have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to have undergone, had there not been a private and particular Order for it from ſome higher Authority than the Marſhal, as he himſelf told me afterwards.</hi> However, upon Wedneſday morning after, I was brought by an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> of my own procuring to the Bar, in order to my intention of giving in Bail. But it ſeems, altogether unknown to me, there was a Copy of a Pardon which I had pleaded formerly at the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> for the remitting a Fine impoſed upon me, wherein I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Pardoned for Felonies, Robberies, and all other Miſdemeanours. By which Pardon, being general, it appeared that I was alſo Pardoned for the very Crime <hi>for which his Lordſhip had Committed me to the</hi> Kings-Bench; <hi>ſo unexpected a check did my good fortune put upon heat and temerity.</hi> I confeſs it was my happineſs, that I did not call to mind that Pardon at Mrs <hi>Celliers</hi> Tryal, <hi>(if I may not rather call it mine own)</hi> for then I preſume I might have prevented my falling under (that Misfortune I had) <hi>the hands of a tranſported ſeverity.</hi> But I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge the reaſons why I did not, and why indeed it was almoſt impoſſible I ſhould; for firſt, my Mind and Thoughts were wholly charged with the weight of the Teſtimony which I thought I had been to give in againſt the Priſoner. In the next place, I could not imagine, ſince the King had been pleaſed to give me a ſpecial Pardon, that I could have had any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a general one, which I then did not know included more than my Fine. And then it was one of the greateſt ſurprizes in the world to me, <hi>and to find his Lordſhip ſo imbittered againſt me;</hi> a thing which I ſo little expected, being no way conſcious to my ſelf that I had ever acted <hi>againſt his Lordſhip</hi> any thing that might occaſion ſo much <hi>fury, unleſs it were that I once endeavoured to have Mrs</hi> Cellier <hi>examined before the Lords of the Councel, to give an accompt of what ſhe had once informed me in the time of our intimacy, touching a Treaty between his Lordſhip and the Lady</hi> Powis, <hi>in favour of Sir</hi> George Wakeman. <hi>This I am apt to think, went a great way, and was the main inducement to render my Teſtimony contemptible and Invalid; and that which produced ſo many Cautions to the Juries how they gave credit to my Oaths. And all men know, that ſelf-intereſt is that which may expoſe the moſt Sage oft-times to acts of unwarineſs, in publick Caſes of great Weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Where was this Pardon allowed, and for what? was it allowed for Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or the Fine onely?</q>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not here undertake to be my own Interpreter, but leave it to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial to cenſure the continuation of his Lordſhips Nicety and Curioſity.</hi> For he would infer, <hi>That if it were allowed for the Fine onely, it was ſtill</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58068:17"/>
               <hi>to be allowed for the Felony; though Mr.</hi> Tanner <hi>the</hi> Deputy Town-Clerk <hi>of</hi> London <hi>had delivered his opinion in anſwer to his Lordſhips queſtion, That he thought all was Pardoned that was expreſſed in the Pardon. His Lordſhip ſuppoſed it was not, and therefore declared, that if the Pardon were not allowed for the Felony, as well as the Fine, he did not know but that the Indictment ought to be removed, and the Pardon allowed next Eſſex-Aſſizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with all ſubmiſſion to his Lordſhip, I ſhall humbly crave leave to ask this Queſtion; What may be thought to be the intentions of a Prince when he Pardons a Man? doth he intend to Pardon the one half, and leave him to anſwer the Law for the other; or is it intended in ample manner? more eſpecially, when it was ſufficiently known the Pardon it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not ſatisfie the end for which the Pardon was granted, without it were abſolutely full for all Crimes paſt. The firſt is to make a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is Pardoned, when he is not; and the Prince himſelf looſeth as well the aim as the intention of his Mercy and Compaſſion: if the latter, then it is as fully to reſtore him to his former Reputation, to avoid his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Impeached for any paſt Crimes, and to encourage him to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the future. Yet all this being granted, his Lordſhip will have the Pardon however to be allowed in the Country where the Crime was acted; as if the King intended by every Pardon he is pleaſed to grant, that the Parties concerned ſhall be forced to go into the ſeveral Counties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have offended, and perhaps into all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> to have their Pardon allowed; but in regard that upon his Lordſhips bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration I was diſcharged, I will ſubmit to his Lordſhips condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention: adding this to my former experiences, that ſometimes there may be a reaſon for great Men to adviſe, as well as others.</p>
            <p>And thus I have expoſed, with all ſubmiſſion and caution poſſible, thoſe Conceptions which the Impreſſions of my ſevere and unequal uſage brought to the aſſiſtance of my moſt ſerious thoughts.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now produce the Arguments maintained by the Kings Learned-Councel at the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> upon the ſame Subject in point of Law, of which the ſubſequent Relation gives a true account.</p>
            <p>The Wedneſday ſevennight after, the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> coming to his Tryal, I was Subpoena'd on His Majeſties behalf, by the Advice of His Learned Councel, to be a Witneſs againſt him; and the matter of Fact having reference to the ſame thing, I think fit to give an accompt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

                           <p>But, my Lord, how do you prove he was Burnt in the Hand? for that will be the greateſt Exception. If a Man for Felony come to be Burnt in the Hand, whether that be ſuch a ſtigmatizing as will render him uncapable of giving Evidence.</p>

                           <p>As for the Outlawry it is Pardoned, and by that he is reſtored to be a Witneſs again; but of my Lords deſire to have Councel aſſigned him to ſpeak to this point, whether a man branded and Burnt in the Hand for Felony, be after to be received as a Witneſs, I ſee no reaſon but he ſhould have it.</p>

                           <p>I do for my own part. Firſt, in this matter I am clear, if a Man were Convicted of Perjury, no Pardon after will make him a Witneſs, for that were to do the Subject wrong. The Pardon doth not make a Man an honeſt Man, but takes off thoſe Reproaches that lay upon him; for the Law is ſo wiſe, it will not ſuffer needleſs Contumelies to be heaped upon him, as to be called <hi>Perjured Raskal</hi> and the like, which is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent abuſive Language, that tends to the breach of the Peace. But a Man once Convicted for Perjury in a Court of Record, no Pardon ought, or ever might ſet him up again. But indeed, that is not our Caſe; we are upon this ſingle point, Whether a Man Burnt in the Hand, to whom after a Pardon is granted, may be a Witneſs? Though perhaps it is not ſo ſtrong in this Caſe, as it is in the other of Perjury. For a man it may be would not wilfully forſwear himſelf, that hath Committed a Robbery. But I think it reaſonable, and there is no reaſon to deny it, that my Lord ſhould be allowed Councel to ſpeak to the ſingle point as the Caſe is here. Who would you have aſſigned you my, Lord?</p>

                           <p>My Lord, I do humbly conceive the Pillory is another Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Burning in the Hand will render him incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Witneſs.</p>

                           <p>But ſee, my Lord, whether this be ſo neceſſary for your defence, as to protract this Cauſe for the Argument. Your Councel not being ready, the Jury muſt be Adjourned, and the Tryal put off. I ſay this to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think it is the duty of my place to diſcharge my Conſcience, both for the King and the Priſoner. But admitting that the Law ſhould ſo fall out, to be as is inſiſted upon, that he is uncapable of being a Witneſs, yet I will ſay this to you, you may give in Evidence the Records of theſe Convictions of whatever ſort, and they ſhall be read. It was ſaid the laſt day, there was Sixteen; if there were Six hundred, they ſhould be all read, and they will go all to invalidate his Credit, and ought to have that influence upon all the Juries that ſuch perſons come before.</p>

                           <p>And the reaſon my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> gives, is this, he ſaith, That notwithſtanding the Pardon, he is not <hi>Probus &amp; legalis Homo.</hi> And 12 <hi>Jac.</hi> in <hi>Brownlowes</hi> Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 47. the King Pardoned a Man Attainted of giving a falſe Verdict; and 'tis adjudged there he ſhall not be a Witneſs; for the puniſhment was Pardoned, yet the Court ſaid the Guilt remained.</p>

                           <p>I wrote it out of the Book word for word as I repeat it. The King may Pardon Simonie, but he cannot enable the Simoniſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and ſo is <hi>Crooke,</hi> 686, <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Shelbournes</hi> Caſe.</p>

                           <p>I think the King might ſure have diſpenſed with that inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but the Pardon could not take away the Guilt.</p>

                           <p>He can diſpenſe with the puniſhment; and thoſe other Books are clear in it, That after the Pardon the Guilt remains: and for theſe Reaſons and Authorities I do conceive he cannot be a Witneſs.</p>

                           <p>I take it, it is clearly contrary to the conſtant general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the conſtant practice of the Law. For when a Man is Pardoned, I take it you may not ſay he is Perjured, nor he is a Felon; and he cannot be reputed ſo to any intent or purpoſe whatſoever.</p>

                           <p>I ſhewed you the practice of Law in that Caſe was conſonant to Reaſon, for it was to prevent railing Language, which tended to the breach of the Peace; but it is another thing for him to be repelled and hindred from being a Witneſs.</p>

                           <p>My Lord, it was for Robbery on the High-way: if it were in a Caſe between Party and Party, except there had been Record of it made out in proof, it had been no objection to his Teſtimony. But in the Caſe of Felony, where the Life of the party is concerned, the Law ſaith, the Court are of Councel for the Priſoner; and if the Court doth know in fact, (as this was notoriouſly known) that the Witneſſes are Convicted of Felony, and in Law that a Pardon will not make them Witneſſes, they are obliged to urge it and make it known; therefore their practice, and their not taking notice, ſeems an Authority, that they ought to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Witneſſes, though it is true, their Credit is left to the Jury.</p>

                           <p>That is my Lord <hi>Hobarts</hi> opinion; and it is true, the very <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is taken away, ſo as never to be remembred again in order to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but doth it ſet a man right as to Reputation, as if he had never offended? it cannot be ſo in reaſon, if twenty men come and tell me ſo.</p>

                           <p>Certainly he is guilty ſtill in ſtrictneſs of Conception, but the Law ſaith, he is not guilty, and the Law will admit ſuch a Man to be a Witneſs; but ſtill ſuch an one will be a bad one in our thoughts, for all the Pardon.</p>

                           <p>Brother, I agree with you in that; and if I were in my Lord <hi>Caſtlemains</hi> caſe, I would admit him, and not labour farther to diſpute the Law; but when he has given his Teſtimony, he ſhall have all theſe Records proved againſt him to invalidate what they can.</p>

                           <p>And the Caſe that Mr. Atturney puts of waging Battle, is as plain a Caſe as can be, for none can wage Battle, but he that is <hi>Liber &amp; legalis homo:</hi> for it might have been objected you broke Priſon, therefore you are not <hi>Liber, &amp;c.</hi> and cannot wage Battle; but if it were anſwered the King has Pardoned it, he would be reſtored to be <hi>Liber, &amp;c.</hi> which is the ſame Caſe in reaſon with this.</p>

                           <p>None but what are to corroborate his Teſtimony. But in the common Caſe of an Approver, he confeſſeth his own guilt, and yet is a good Witneſs againſt the Approver.</p>

                           <p>Yes, his own Confeſſion.</p>

                           <p>But how far is he a Witneſs?</p>

                           <speaker>Mr. Att. G.</speaker>
                           <p>His Confeſſion ſhall be Recorded, and if he doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict thoſe he approves, he ſhall die; and ſo he Swears to ſave himſelf, yet a good Witneſs.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                           <p>The Law thought it convenient to diſcover Felonies, and ſuch great Offences; which were hard to be done, but by ſome that were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Offence, and ſo would incourage them that would diſcover to Convict the reſt; but here comes a perſon that is Convicted, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by another Crime, and would by his Evidence take away the Life of another not accuſed for that Crime for which he was Pardoned, but another. And that word <hi>reatus</hi> in my Lord <hi>Hobard</hi> is capable of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation another way; and a Man may have his guilt taken away as to ſome purpoſes, but not to other.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. Att. G.</speaker>
                           <p>But the Book ſaith, it takes away all diſabilities too.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                           <p>I think there is a difference between a Pardon before Conviction and after.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. Soll. G.</speaker>
                           <p>But in Mr. Atturneys firſt Caſe, even before Conviction, there was a legal diſability upon his breaking of Priſon, by reaſon of which, he could not wage Battle till Pardoned.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                           <p>It is a diſability upon a Preſumption, not upon Conviction: for the Law preſumes a man that is innocent will abide his Tryal; but if he break Priſon and fly from Juſtice, it argues guilt; but in a man that is Convicted, the guilt is plain.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. Soll. G.</speaker>
                           <p>But, my Lord, the preſumption runs as high to the diſability in the one caſe, as the Conviction in the other; if then the Pardon can take away one diſability <hi>e pari,</hi> it may the other alſo.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. Att. G.</speaker>
                           <p>Nay, if you pleaſe to look into my Lord <hi>Hobard,</hi> you will find he ſaith, that the very acceptance of a Pardon implies a guilt.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                           <p>No, pray Mr. Atturney, I do not agree in that, I would not have it concluded, that every great Man in <hi>England</hi> that hath a Pardon, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Offences thereby pardoned.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Mr. J. Jones.</speaker>
                           <p>My Lord, I take it there is a difference between a ſpecial
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58068:20"/>
Pardon and a general Pardon: for by taking a particular ſpecial Pardon, there cannot but be intended a conſciouſneſs of guilt; but if a perſon be included in a general Pardon, there is no conſideration of any particular Offence, and the laying hold of that, implies not a guilt, for all have it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoſe particularly excepted, and we cannot ſuppoſe every one guilty.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                           <p>Truly I think the acceptance of a ſpecial Pardon doth not at all in itſelf, without Confeſſion or Conviction, imply a Man to be guilty of the Crime pardoned. For you know my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſays, No wiſe Man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Gods pardon and the King<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> at any time, though we are conſcious of no actual Crime to need it. And beſides, in theſe times, when no Man knows when he is ſafe from the Perjuries that do ſo much abound, it may be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without a confeſſion or implicitation of guilt, to get a Pardon, which we need not, but only as a ſhelter againſt a falſe accuſation.</p>
                           <p>Then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Raymund</hi> went down to the Common-pleas.</p>

                           <p>If it hath reſtored him to his Credit, I hope they ſhall not blemiſh him ſo much, as to make the Jury not believe him.</p>

                           <p>Ay, but I aſſure you it ſhall have its due weight according to the Crimes charged upon him; all the Records ſhall be read, and all that can be obſerved from them ſhall.</p>

                           <p>Do you think we ſit here to have Men loaden with all the guilt of moſt infamous villanies in the world come here, by their Evidence take away Mens Lives, and their qualifications not obſerved?</p>
                        </sp>

                           <p>My Brother will come up preſently, and we ſhall hear what they ſay to it.</p>

                           <p>We have men grown ſo inſolent now adayes, that upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or what ſort of confidence to term it I know not, run all whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Men, and perſons of all Qualities, as if there were any thing in their confidence that could render them better, than their own villanous Actions proclaim them to be. Humility becomes Penitents, and no wicked impudent man can be thought to repent; but theſe Mens Behaviours hath nothing of an appearance of Repentance, but with ſaucineſs think to make all fly before them, and that their boldneſs in accuſing, ſhall without more ado juſtifie the truth of their Accuſation: but God knows, they diſcover what they are by their inſolent carriage.</p>
                           <p>Then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Raymund</hi> returned and delivered the Opinions of the other Judges to my Lord and the other two Judges privately.</p>

                           <p>Look you, I will tell you what my Brother reports their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Common-pleas to be: He ſays, he put the Queſtion to them in both caſes, That he is Outlawed for Felony and pardoned, and Burnt in the Hand for Felony and pardoned. They ſay they are of Opinion, That the general Pardon would not reſtore him to be a Witneſs, even as to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry of Felony, becauſe of the Intereſt the Kings Subjects have in him, and his Teſtimony could not be received upon the general Pardon. But they ſay this further, That where a Man comes to be burnt in the Hand for a Felony, they look upon that as a kind of a more general diſcharge than the Pardon alone would amount to, if he had not been Burnt in the Hand: If he had been Convicted and not Burnt, a general Pardon would not have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58068:21"/>
made him a good Witneſs; but by that and the Pardon, they think he is made a Legal Witneſs.</p>

                           <p>But I conceive by their Opinions in the <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> that they think a Pardon after Conviction of Perjury would not reſtore him to be a Witneſs, becauſe of the intereſt the Subject hath in his Teſtimony.</p>

            <p>Then I proceeded to deliver my Evidence, which was to this Effect.</p>
            <p>That about the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1679, the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſent me with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> that being the firſt time I had ever been to wait on his Lordſhip; to which Letter I received another in Anſwer, and delivered it to the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> who read it to me as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This perſon I like well, and though he be no Scholar, yet he may ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Youths as he ſhall be directed, by which I ſhall be eaſed of much trouble and ſuſpition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By thoſe Youths was meant the <hi>St. Omers</hi> Witneſſes, for his Lordſhip was their Tutor.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip was one of thoſe that imployed me to fetch <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> out of Priſon.</p>
            <p>Some time after that, I went to wait on his Lordſhip with ſome Letters and Liſts of Names, that came from <hi>Nevel,</hi> and upon the peruſal thereof, his Lordſhip ordered me to imploy divers perſons to write Copies from them; ſaying, it was a buſineſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and muſt not be delayed. Then I informed him, that perſons were at that very time, a writing at <hi>Powis-houſe;</hi> then his Lordſhip replyed, let them go on and be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and I will pay my part, which his Lordſhip did; for ſome time after, I ſent <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Woodman,</hi> then Servant to Mrs <hi>Cellier,</hi> with a Letter to his Lordſhip, who in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereto ſent Forty ſhillings for his part of the Writing.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe Letters, and thoſe which I put into Colonel <hi>Manſels</hi> Chamber, were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable in matter of fact, and tended onely in concurrency to the <hi>Sham-Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Lordſhip wrote the <hi>Compendium,</hi> and I read one part of it as it lay before him at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip peruſed the Papers of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> who intended to accuſe Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> with <hi>Sodomy;</hi> and his Lordſhip was alſo privy, and gave conſent to the drawing up, and Swearing to the falſe Affidavits which <hi>Lane</hi> made before Sir <hi>James Butler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day after I had been Treated with by the Lords in the <hi>Tower to kill the King,</hi> I went to wait on the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> who having ſent his Servant out of the Room, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me, why I was ſo unwilling to do that, for which I was taken out of Priſon. I deſired to know what that was? Why, ſays his Lordſhip, were you not yeſterday at the <hi>Tower?</hi> I anſwered, yes, I was; and then ſaid, would your Lordſhip have me <hi>kill the King,</hi> for that's it you mean, I ſuppoſe? Then his Lordſhip ſaid, that was the buſineſs he meant; and then he ſtorm'd, and was ſo furious, that I cared not to ſtay any longer.</p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip was privy to my part of the <hi>Sham-Plot,</hi> and uſed in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to call the King Tyrant.</p>
            <p>This was the true Subſtance of my Evidence, which being backt with <hi>William Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s, the Court proceeded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
