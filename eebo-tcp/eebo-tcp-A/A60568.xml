            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I remember that when our Tutour had read over a book writ by D <hi>H.</hi> he said, That <hi>if he had been to write a tract on that subject, he would have said the same things with that authour.</hi> And therefore I here make bold to send you

            <p>BE pleased to suffer <hi>me</hi> (who never yet commended <hi>any</hi> man out of the pulpit) to say a little of this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Moor,</hi> newly interred here <note n="*" place="margin">Not in <hi>Caius</hi> Colledge, as he desired, because <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dell</hi> would not suffer him to be buried by the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which was his <hi>last</hi> request.</note> 
               <hi>before</hi> us, under that very <hi>stone</hi> whereon he was wont to kneel down in prayers to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>He was a person, who had that of <hi>Solomon</hi> continually before his eyes, Eccles. 9. 10. <hi>What ever good thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wisdome in the grave, whither thou goest:</hi> or rather, he had the life of the Blessed Jesus in his daily meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practise. You can scarce name
<pb facs="tcp:51300:4"/>
the <hi>good</hi> or piece of <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> wherein he was not eminent: one of the ablest that ever I met with, not onely in the knotty pieces of Divinity, <hi>Cases of conscience,</hi> and <hi>Chronologie,</hi> and all ingenuous sciences, especially <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and all kinde of <hi>Antiquity</hi> (which, if any thing, must bring the men of this age to their wits again, when all is done) but also in <hi>Anatomy, Physick, Mathematicks,</hi> and the like. Those who are the most eminent for all these now in <hi>England</hi> being of his education.</p>
            <p>But above all I must admire his piety to God, signified in every particular that I could observe. And I think I had more the happiness of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (and so greater opportunities to note his behaviour) of late years, then any here present, except his own family, having been with him almost every day for these seven years last past. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (in his second book of <hi>Dying well,</hi> and eighth chapter) is so ingenuous as to blame those Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, who begin with their Sacraments
<pb facs="tcp:51300:4"/>
when they have done with their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; and saith, <hi>Sacramentum conferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur aegrotis quando periculosè aegrotare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiunt;</hi> that 'tis a very dangerous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome (though it is seldome otherwise) that men send not for the <hi>Priest</hi> till the <hi>Physician</hi> hath given them over. This our friend (quite contrary to them, and such as <hi>Asa)</hi> sought to the LORD <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> to the Physician. To the LORD, and that (after a strict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his soul) in those two main parts of divine worship, <hi>Prayer</hi> and the Holy <hi>Eucharist.</hi> No sooner had the disease seized upon him in an extraordinary manner, but straight he spoke of the sixth chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, and those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>mysteria,</hi> and told me and divers others, that he was of his good friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Herbert Thorndikes</hi> minde concerning that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>viz.</hi> That it must needs be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Holy Eucharist: which the <hi>first Nicene Council</hi> thought the <hi>most necessary</hi> viaticum; and after them the whole Christian world (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb facs="tcp:51300:5"/>
               <hi>Calvin, Zanchy,</hi> and others of the Reformed) till some late novelists arose: who would perswade us that Christ had <hi>no</hi> true Church upon earth before these times. And he received the body and bloud of our Saviour with expressions of as much outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as ever I beheld, (which several here present can witness) and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his external deportment was but a necessary consequence of his <hi>inward devotion.</hi> Which also appeared by his zeal and frequency in <hi>prayer</hi> to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: not omitting to humble himself in a decent <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> dedicate to that purpose (as you know the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians did) through every day of his life, even when he was not able to go, but crept and was led to it: not omitting the very last day of his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, when he could not without help move his foot over the threshold.</p>
            <p>As he testified his reverence to God in <hi>doing,</hi> so in <hi>suffering.</hi> Though his sickness was very painfull (caused by an ulcer in his bladder) yet who ever
<pb facs="tcp:51300:5"/>
heard him complain in that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble? All that I heard of it from his mouth, was this; When one told him that he could not but be in great pain; he answered, <hi>My Saviour was in far greater pain for me.</hi> In his sickness he spent the most of his time in reading and meditating on the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, desiring to throw aside other learning, and to know nothing else but Jesus Christ and him crucified: and <hi>this</hi> knowledge was his ballast kept him steady and couragious; for he never abhorred any thing more than the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of this age, <hi>simulation</hi> and <hi>dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation;</hi> so that if ever any man had a window into his heart, that all the world might know his most secret thoughts, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Moor</hi> had. In these changing times wherein men pride themselves <hi>in menstrua fide &amp; anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks) in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that alters as oft as the <hi>moon,</hi> or take up with the <hi>year</hi> at most (and then persecute their neighbours for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as very <hi>Protei</hi> as themselves) who

dare whisper that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

He would oft say, <q>That if men would generally take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and shew themselves bare-faced (without mask or vizard) and profess what they do indeed beleeve; it were the onely way to secure themselves and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and make those few that be facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bent unable to hurt them; but that foolish fear hath always betrayed, and brought evil upon men, from the time of the Gnosticks till now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>vertue</hi> he added <hi>patience,</hi> an admirable submission to all manner of Superiours, though perverse; a most meek and quiet spirit under what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours (Ecclesiastical or Civil) soever. Which I note the rather, because I see some men write large <hi>books,</hi> and many
<pb facs="tcp:51300:7"/>
               <hi>disputations,</hi> to prove that the members of the old English Church are not to be suffered in any civil society: which books and disputations are (in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) far better confuted by such lives as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Moors,</hi> then by volumes.</p>
            <p>And to patience how did he add <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindness!</hi> A true Samaritan. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man was his neighbour; loving to <hi>all,</hi> I cannot say to his <hi>enemies,</hi> because I never heard he had any, for he walkt so far from offence toward God and man, that he attracted the love or <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> rather, even of the froward. And though in these unhappy times diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>religion</hi> (as 'tis the nature of it) hath caused a vast difference in most mens <hi>affections,</hi> yet I cannot hear of any one man that spoke one single word against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Moor;</hi> nor do I remember that I have heard him speak ill of any one man or woman; but I have heard him in general blame the men of this age for pulling down—and looking into other mens faults more then their own. He would say, that he had oft
<pb facs="tcp:51300:7"/>
heard an apt proverb, <hi>After a good din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, let us sit down and BACK-BITE our neighbours:</hi> the discourse of most men now adays being nothing else. And I confess I have seen him very oft (both in sickness and health) upon the mention of <hi>schism, heresie,</hi> or <hi>sacriledge,</hi> shake his head, and profess that he would not have had the least finger in the ruin of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a million.</p>
            <p>But let us go to the <hi>Colledge.</hi> Ask those who were his contemporaries in Gonvile and Caius concerning him, and you shall hear them (beside all this) wonder at his contentedness, his joy in the most private condition (the most mean and toylsome employment) from first to last. Though he had as many fair opportunities for preferment offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as any man, yet he slighted them all, trampling this world under his feet: saying, that since he was but a <hi>passenger</hi> here, it was a folly not to behave himself as a traveller in an inn; a madness to set his minde on such things as there is <hi>no use</hi> of at his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
<pb facs="tcp:51300:8"/>
end; adding, that <hi>God sent no man hither to get money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His contemporaries will tell you, how far he was from disturbing the peace of the Society wherein he lived, from beginning or fomenting any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or sedition in the House. That he never <hi>asked</hi> any Fellow for his <hi>vote,</hi> nor politickly (as the custome is) enquired before hand what other men would do in any election, nor spoke one word for any pupil of his <hi>own</hi> either to get a scholarship or fellowship (and yet even lately he had five or six <hi>senior</hi> fellows at once in <hi>Caius</hi> Colledge his own pupils) but he went on his own road, chose that man whom he in his soul thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for the place, fall how it would; &amp; so his vote oft stood alone, doing no man any good. And though some laughed at his <hi>singularity,</hi> he had his reward <hi>within</hi> and <hi>above,</hi> which told him that a time would come ere long, when it would be declared by strange effects, that wealth was never the greatest happiness, nor worldly policy
<pb facs="tcp:51300:8"/>
the best counsellour, that to lie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear for a good cause was no piety, and to do wickedness for the glory of God was ill worshipping him. In a word, that there would come (as sure as that God is true) a day of <hi>visitation;</hi> when we shall all be judged not by the flexible rules of our factions or interests <hi>(non est judicium Dei sicut hominum)</hi> but by the straight regularities of the Word of God, by the rules of S. Paul, and justice and charity, by the laws of the nation and our local statutes.</p>
            <p>And thus he brought up his pupils, not choosing the <hi>richest</hi> (such as be ordinarily the <hi>tulips</hi> of the University, stay a while, onely to show themselves &amp; see fashions) but such as were of the choicest parts though never so <hi>poor,</hi> and such as he thought he was likely to do <hi>most good</hi> upon: with whom he took more pains usually in one day then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do in a moneth, knowing that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to them he did good not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to single persons, but sometimes to whole families, whole parishes, whole Counties; &amp; he made it his business to
<pb facs="tcp:51300:9"/>
principle them in true <hi>Religion</hi> as well as learning. And now here be pleased to behold and admire the strange bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God upon his precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; though I know many scores of his pupils (some in this and some in other nations) yet I never knew any who continued not firm to those good principles which his Tutour <hi>Moor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled into him <hi>(quo semel est imbuta recens-)</hi> notwithstanding all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>schisme</hi> and <hi>heresie,</hi> on the right and on the left, both from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>

            <p>I should transgress the bounds (though not of your patience, yet I am sure) of the time, if I should tell you now of his <hi>almes,</hi> which are almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. Where is the poor man from whom he turned his face? or where the <hi>poor pupil</hi> that ever he turned from the Colledge for lack of money? and yet what almes he gave was in the most <hi>private</hi> manner he could devise. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. how communicative was he? how ready to lend any thing he had, even
<pb facs="tcp:51300:9"/>
the choicest of his books or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, to any man in Town or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that would make good use of them.</p>
            <p>I must not stand to tell you what pains he took to collect our <hi>University Statutes</hi> (now scattered in many scarce legible Manuscripts) into one body, how he was chearfull without lightness, grave and serious without distrust, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for nothing but sin, delighting in nothing but doing good. And by that ye may trace his footsteps where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went: 'Tis well known that he was through his whole life a diligent collectour &amp; transcriber of the choicest Manuscripts which he could possibly purchase by love or money; All these he gave to Caius Colledge. While he was in the University library, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent he was for the publick good from first to last, what incredible pains he took there for you, and for how trifling a recompense ye all sufficiently know. And when the sharpness of his disease would not suffer him to frequent that
<pb facs="tcp:51300:10"/>
place, he delivered to me <hi>a catalogue</hi> of all the Manuscripts in that library (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Oriental) writ every word with his own hand; which I am to deliver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publick library, as soon as it is open again.</p>
            <p>But my strength faileth, and will not suffer me to tell you half the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things I have heard from him, seen by him: his modesty <hi>(he could scarce moderate an Act without blushing, even when his almond tree did flourish)</hi> his temperance and sobriety in diet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, abating all superfluities, and even robbing himself to bestow upon the poor (remembring the causal particle <hi>for:</hi> Matt. 25. 35. <hi>For</hi> I was hungred and ye gave me meat, <hi>for</hi> I was naked and ye clothed me) his retiredness, his contentedness, his humility—you see I can but name them; nor shall I need when they are known to most of you as well as to my self: especially to that <hi>numerous</hi> company of his pupils who had the happiness of the Queen of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba to be perpetually at the elbow of our Solomon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51300:10"/>
Ye who lamented him to his grave; give me leave to speak to every one of you (dear friends) particularly (as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I heard him on his death-bed) in the words of the dying Romane. <hi>Non est amici defunctum vano ejulatu deflere, sed quae voluerit meminisse, quae manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit exequi, 'Tis not the part of a friend to bewail a dead friend with vain lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to remember what he advised and to perform what he commanded.</hi> There is not <hi>one</hi> of you who had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him that were in the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with most other Gentlemen whose follies are termed wisdome, who are applauded when they talk vainly, and are let alone when they do shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things: No, every mothers childe of you was as sure to meet with his <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of sage and sober <hi>counsel</hi> as of his <hi>diet.</hi> And (in your hearing) he oft la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the misery of our English Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who are commonly brought up to nothing but <hi>hawks</hi> and <hi>hounds,</hi> and know not how to bestow their time in a <hi>rainy</hi> day, and in the midst of all their

               <p>O Blessed Lord, who in thine infinite mercy didst vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to plant a glorious Church among us, and now in thy just judgement hast permitted our sins and follies to root it up; be pleased at last to resume thoughts of <hi>peace</hi> towards us, that we may do the like to one another. Lord, look down
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51300:12"/>
from heaven, the habitation of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and behold the ruines of a deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Church, and compassionate to see her in the dust. Behold her, O Lord, not onely broken, but crumbled, divided into so many sects and fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that she no longer represents the Ark of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> (where the Covenant and the Manna were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) but the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> filled with all various sorts of unclean beasts: and to complete our misery and guilt, the spirit of division hath insinuated it self as well into our <hi>affections</hi> as our <hi>judgments;</hi> that badge of Discipleship which thou recommendedst to us, is cast off, and all the contrary wrath and bitterness, anger and clamor, called in to maintain and widen our brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. O Lord, how long shall we thus violate and defame that Gospel of peace that we profess? how long shall we thus madly defeat our selves, lose that Christianity which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to strive for? O thou which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest men to be of one mind in an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51300:12"/>
house, be pleased so to unite us, that we may be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</p>
               <p>And now that in civil affairs there seems some aptness to a composure, O let not our Spiritual differences be more unreconcilable. Lord, let not the roughest winds blow out of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; let not those which should be thy Embassadors for peace still sound a Trumpet for war: but do thou reveal thy self to all our <hi>Eliah's</hi> in that still small voice, which may teach them to eccho thee in the like meek treating with others. Lord, let no unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable stiffness of those that are in the <hi>right,</hi> no perverse obstinacy of those that are in the <hi>wrong,</hi> hinder the clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our wounds; but let the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in meekness, and be thou pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the other repentance to the acknowledgment of the Truth.</p>
               <p>To this end do thou, O Lord, mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie all exasperated minds (take off all animosities and prejudices, contempt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51300:13"/>
and heart-burnings) and by uniting their hearts prepare for the reconciling their opinions. And that nothing may intercept the clear sight of thy truth, Lord, let all private and secular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs be totally deposited, that gain may no longer be the measure of our Godliness, but that the one great and common concernment of truth and peace may be unanimously and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pursued.</p>
               <p>Lord, the hearts of all men are in thy hands, O be thou pleased to let thy Spirit of peace overshadow the minds of all contending parties; and, if it be thy will, restore this Church to her pristine state, renew her days as of old, let her escape out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be so entire, that not an hoof may be left behinde: But if thy wisdome see it not yet a season for so full a deliverance, Lord, defer not (we beseech thee) such a degree of it, as may at least secure her a being. If she cannot recover her <hi>beauty,</hi> yet O Lord grant her <hi>health,</hi> such a soundness of constitution as may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51300:13"/>
preserve her from dissolution. Let thy providence find out some good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans to cure her present wounds. And to whomsoever thou shalt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that important work, Lord, give them skilful hands and compassionate hearts; direct them to such applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may most speedily, and yet most soundly, heal the hurt of the daughter of <hi>Sion;</hi> and make them so advert to the interests both of truth and peace, that no lawfull condescension may be omitted, nor any unlawfull made: And do thou, who art both the wonderful Counsellor and Prince of peace, so guide and prosper all pacifick endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, that all our distractions may be composed, and our <hi>Jerusalem</hi> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain become a City at unity in it self; that those happy primitive days may at length revert, wherein <hi>Vice</hi> was the onely <hi>heresie;</hi> that all our intestine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions may be converted into a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opposition of our common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, our unbrotherly <hi>feuds</hi> into a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>zeal</hi> against all that exalts it self

               <p>Evening.</p>
               <p>O Most gracious Lord, who doest not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men, who smitest not till the importunitie of our sins enforce thee, and then correctest in measure, we thy unworthy creatures humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we have abundantly tasted of this patience and lenity of thine. To what an enormous height were our sins arrived ere thou beganst to visit them! and when thou couldst no longer forbear, yet mastering thy power, thou hast not proportioned thy vengeance to our crimes, but to thy own gracious design of reducing and reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. Lord, had the first stroke of thy hand been exterminating, our guilts had justified the method; but thou hast
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51300:14"/>
proceeded by such easy and gentle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as witness how much thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst to be interrupted; and shew us, that all that sad weight we have long groaned under, hath been accumulated onely by our own incorrigibleness. 'Tis now, O Lord, these many years that this Nation hath been in the furnace, and yet our dross wasts not but increases; &amp; it is owing onely to thy unspeakable mercy, that we (who would not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified) are not consumed; that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Nation, who cease not to be a most sinfull and provoking Nation. O Lord, let not this long-suffering of thine serve onely to upbraid our obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and enhanse our guilt; but let it at last have the proper effect on us, melt our hearts, and lead us to repentance.</p>
               <p>And oh, that this may be the day for us thus to discern the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our peace! that all who are (yea, and all who are not) cast down this day in an external humiliation, may by the operation of thy mighty Spirit have their souls laid prostrate before thee in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51300:15"/>
a sincere contrition! O thou who canst out of the very stones raise up children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> work our stony flinty hearts into such a temper as may be malleable to the impressions of thy grace, that all the sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> may tremble; that we may not by a perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring obstinacy seal to our selves both temporal and eternal ruine, but instead of our mutinous complaining at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of our sins, search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. O be thou pleased to grant us this one grand fundamental mercy, that we who so impatiently thirst after a change with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, may render that possible and safe by this better &amp; more necessary change within us; that our sins may not, as they have so often done, interpose and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse that light which now begins to break out upon us.</p>
               <p>Lord, thy dove seems to approach us with an olive-branch in her mouth, oh let not our filth &amp; noisomness chase her away; but grant us that true <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> which may atone thee, and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51300:15"/>
Christian <hi>charity</hi> which may reconcile us with one another. Lord, let not our breach either with <hi>thee</hi> or among our <hi>selves</hi> be <hi>incurable,</hi> but by making up the first prepare us for the healing of the latter. And because, O Lord, the way to make us one fold is to have one shepheard, be pleas'd to put us all under the conduct of Him to whom that charge belongs; bow the hearts of this people as of one man, that the onely contention may be who shall be most forward in bringing back our <hi>David.</hi> O let none reflect on their past guilts as an argument to persevere, but to repent; and to make their return so sincere as may qualify them not onely for <hi>his</hi> but <hi>thy</hi> Mercy.</p>
               <p>And, Lord, be pleased so to guide the hearts of all who shall be intrusted with that great concernment of setling this nation, that they may weigh all their deliberations in the ballance of the Sanctuary; that conscience, not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, may be the ruling principle; and that they may render to Caesar the things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51300:16"/>
that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods; that they may become healers of our breaches, and happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers of the sad ruines both in Church and in State. Grant, O Lord, that as those sins which made them are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come National, so the repentance may be National also; and that evidenc'd by the proper fruits of it, by zeal of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rights both of thee and thine Anointed. And do thou, O Lord, so dispose all hearts, and remove all obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that none may have the will, much less the power, to hinder his peaceable restitution. And, Lord, let him bring with him an heart so intirely devoted to thee, that he may wish his own honour onely as a means to advance thine. O let the precepts and examples of his Blessed Father never depart from his mind; and as thou wert pleas'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the one by <hi>suffering,</hi> so perfect the other by <hi>acting</hi> thy will; that He may be a blessed instrument of replanting the <hi>power</hi> instead of the <hi>form</hi> of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among us, of restoring Christian
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51300:16"/>
vertue in a prophane and almost <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Nation. And if any wish him for any distant ends (if any desire his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as a shelter for their <hi>riots</hi> and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness) O let him come a great but happy defeat to all such, not bring few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el but cure to their inordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; and by his example as a Christian, and his Authority as a King, so invite to good, and restrain from evil, that he may not onely release our temporal, but our spiritual bondage, suppress those foul and scandalous vices which have so long captivated us, and by securing our inward, provide for the perpetuating our outward peace. Lord, establish thou his throne in righteousness, make him a signall instrument of thy glory and our happiness, and let him reap the fruits of it in comfort here, and in bliss hereafter; that so his earthly crown may serve to enhanse and enrich his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Grant this, O King of Kings, for the sake and intercession of our Blessed Mediator, Jesus Christ.</p>
