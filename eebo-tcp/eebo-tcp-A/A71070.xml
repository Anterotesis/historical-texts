         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
General Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not for any pleasure I
take in Controversie, nor
out of a Resolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what I have once writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that I expose my self
again to the Censures of Some, and the
Rage of others, in Defence of our Church
against the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But out of a
just sense of the Weight and goodness of the
Cause I have undertaken; which (if my
affection to it hath not strangely blinded my
judgement) doth highly concern us as Men,
as English Men, and as Christians. For
it is the Cause of Sense and Reason, against
<pb facs="tcp:50175:3"/>
the absurd Doctrines they impose on both;
it is the Cause of our Nation against the
Usurpation and Tyranny of a Forrain
Power; it is the Cause of the true Faith and
Christianity, against the Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Roman Church. To aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
such a Cause as this, were to betray
the things which ought to be most dear to
us: for we cannot be reconciled to that
Church on any easier terms, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
our Sense and Reason, ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Country, and hazarding our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>And what can they give us
in exchange for these?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the last of those three Heads,
which gave occasion to the late so much
railed at, and so little confuted Book: which
no sooner appeared, but as if some dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Monster had risen out of the earth, some
crossed themselves and kept as far out of
the sight of it, as they could; others made
hideous out-crys and grievous complaints;
and the more fearful sort were forbidden
either looking on it, or entertaining any
<pb facs="tcp:50175:3"/>
discourse about it. Upon which I pleased
my self that I had not added another Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Book; for if that number had
agreed with the ten particulars, it had passed
among them <hi>for the Beast with seven
Heads and ten Horns;</hi> and they would
have been glad their <hi>City upon seven
Hills</hi> could have been so excused. But
this unusual noise and clamour awakened
the curiosity of many who love to see
strange sights; and that which otherwise
might have been wholly neglected as a
Book, was enquired after and looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
being represented as a Monster.</p>
            <p>But when they found that this evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(as they accounted it) which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had raised, was not to be laid again
by hard words and ill language; they
began to consider what other course was to
be taken to suppress it. And forthwith
there starts up a Young Sophister among
them, and bids them be of good heart;
for by letting flie at him some Squibs
and Crackers he did not question, but he
<pb facs="tcp:50175:4"/>
should put this Monster into such a Rage,
as to make him fall upon himself; which
design being highly approved; in a short
time came forth that dapper piece, called
Doct. <hi>Stillingfleet against</hi> Doct. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet.</hi>
It was a notable plot, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
managed, as the Reader may see
by the following Answer to it. After
him a Graver Person undertakes the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;<note place="margin">Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>mull. hist Iesuit. ordin. c. 8.</note>
but as <hi>Hasenmullerus</hi> tells us,
when <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> sent one of his
Brethren at <hi>Rome</hi> to dispossess a Person,
he gave him this instruction, that <hi>he
should be sure to come behind the
Devil, if he would drive him out;</hi>
accordingly this <hi>N. O.</hi> steals quite behind
my Book, and began to confute it at the
wrong end, hoping by that means to drive
out the evil Spirit which he supposed to
lodge in the Body of it. Which he hath
performed with great dexterity and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
as the Reader may be fully satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Reply here following. These
two I undertook, before any other appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:50175:4"/>
and intended to have published these
two Answers by themselves; but finding
others that had written against me on the
same argument I was willing to bring as
much as I could together to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
or repetition. All which relating to
the Principles of Faith, and the Rosolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Rule of it, I made account to
have dispatched at once; but finding the
Book begin to swell into too great a bulk,
I have respited some parts of it to another
opportunity.</p>
            <p>When those two men had done their
Feats, an ancient and experienced Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cist;
(and yet for all that no Conjurer)
saw plainly this Spirit must be conjured
down; and thefore knowing the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of Charms, he gives his Book the
Title of <hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Stillingflee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
Which words put me almost in as
great a fright as the <hi>Holy Chair</hi> would
have done; I began to consider, whether
<hi>Mengus</hi> or any other of their skilful men
had ever used those Emphatical words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb facs="tcp:50175:5"/>
but I am willing to believe it was
the sole invention of <hi>J. V. C.</hi> And I
doubt not but they will do well hereafter in
<hi>Exorcisms,</hi> especially after the <hi>holy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when the person to be dispossessed is
made sufficiently sick with Rue and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-oyl
and other excellent Physick for
Devils. I find by some of their Authors,
it is a great matter to get the right name
of the Spirit; this <hi>J. V. C.</hi> hath hit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily,
in calling this Monster <hi>the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan
sporting in the waters,</hi> since
they have thrown out so many empty ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
for him to play with. And his three
books of Charms, have been no unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
entertainment; But he is gone; and
I love not to tread hard on the graves
of my enemies. What there appears ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
in him (if anything do so) I shall
consider it in its proper place; chiefly
for the sake of my Iudicious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Dr. <hi>T. G.</hi> who was the first and I
think the only person that hath discovered
his Book to be a <hi>Learned Treatise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:5"/>
But my generous Adversaries, finding
so little success in single attempts, they
next fall upon me with Chain-shot; viz.
<hi>A Collection of several Treatises
against Doct. Stillingfleet.</hi> To make
up the number, they bring in one before
published, to try an experiment what force
that can have in conjunction which had none
of it self.</p>
            <p>The first undertaker therein, is, the
very calm and (according to his new
Christian Name) <hi>Serene</hi> Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi>
the man that hath learnt to mortifie passions
by Mystical Divinity; but is so far from
being sublimed and rectified, by that
Chymical way of devotion, that he seems
yet to remain in the very dregs of them:
the man, that hath so accustomed him-self
to Legends, that he cannot write
against an Adversary, without making
one of him. And although there be many
very pleasant ones in his Church-Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet I hardly think there are many
more wonderful, than (if his insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:50175:6"/>
had any colour of truth in them) the
first part of my life had been. For by
making me so active in those times,
when I was uncapable of understanding
what they were, he seems to represent
me as one that had so passionate a zeal for
Presbytery in my cradle, that I would
suck of none but a Scottish Nurse;
that the first word I pronounced was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
that I would go to School to none
but Lay-Elders; and was cursing <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz</hi>
before the Parliament at eight years
old. Is not this a hopeful beginning for
a good Legend?<note place="margin">S. C. p. 79.</note> 
               <hi>Will</hi> he, saith he, <hi>or
they damn the execrable Covenant?</hi>
as though, I had ever any thing to do
with it but when I renounced it! If I
should tell him, that as great a Friend
as he takes me to have been to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and the late times, even then I was
entred into Episcopal Orders by a most
worthy and learned Prelate of our Church;
that, I never subscribed any Address to
the Usurpers, as some in the World have
<pb facs="tcp:50175:6"/>
done, and those who would now be thought
the Kings most loyal Subjects; that I
never drew off any one person from
their Allegiance to the King to submit to
to the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> (let those who did
it clear themselves) even such an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
would give too much countenance to so
pitiful a Calumniator. I thank him that he
hath not charged me with laying the first
platform of Presbytery at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or
having a hand in the first and second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
and I might as will charge him with the
Gunpowder Treason, as he doth me with
any thing about the Covenant. By this we
may guess what Ecclesiastical History we
are to expect from him, who writes so at
random about the matters of our own times.
But the man is to be pitied; he was under
one of Mother <hi>Juliana's</hi> fits, he writ
with a good mind, but he knew not what.
Some vent must be given to a violent
fermentation, else the vessel might burst
asunder; and I hope the good man is
<pb facs="tcp:50175:7"/>
somewhat more at ease, since he purged
away so much Choler. <hi>I</hi> assure him I
can with pleasure read what he wrote with
rage; and laugh at the violence of such
passions, which like a Gun ill charged
may give fire and make a great noise,
but doth the greatest mischief to him that
holds it. If <hi>I</hi> would pursue him through
all his heats, <hi>I</hi> must undergo the <hi>Ordeal-tryal,</hi>
touch firebrands without hurting
my self: which although <hi>I</hi> might do, yet
<hi>I</hi> know my Adversaries are so implacable,
that even that would not convince them of
my innocence. <hi>I</hi> leave him therefore to
grow cooler and wiser; but <hi>I</hi> beseech him
for his own sake, that he would attempt no
more the justifying <hi>the union of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. C. p. 46.</note> and for the sake
of Religion, that he would not call <hi>God</hi>
any more <hi>an incomprehensible No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
a Description fit only for the
Atheists Catechism. If there were any
thing in his railing Book which looked like
reason or argument <hi>I</hi> might perhaps at my
<pb facs="tcp:50175:7"/>
leisure be perswaded to answer it; though <hi>I</hi>
do not love to have to do with mad men, no
not in their lucid intervals.</p>
            <p>The next that follows is one that goes
about to vindicate the <hi>Roman Churches
devotions and Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Indulgencies,</hi> he is a meer
pattern of meekness, compared with
<hi>S. C.,</hi> he writes pertinently and without
the others bitterness and passion. His
great endeavour is to clear the honour of his
Church, from the absurd Doctrines and
practices charged upon it. And the force
of all,<note place="margin">Roman Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c. vindicated <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note> he saith lies in this, <hi>that where
the Church hath defined nothing in
her Councils, it is to no purpose to
object that such Doctrines are
taught by some in it; for those who
defend their separation from the
Communion of a Church by reason
of its erroneous or corrupt Doctrines
must make it appear that those are
taught by it, and the belief of them
also exacted from its subjects.</hi> To
<pb facs="tcp:50175:8"/>
this purpose <hi>S. C.</hi> likewise speaks (in
some of his lucid intervalls) and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this is become a common Topick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, to take off the <hi>odium</hi> of such
opinions and practices as they are willing
enough, but ashamed to defend, which
<hi>I</hi> shall in this place briefly remove. The
thing <hi>I</hi> was to prove was, that persons in
the Communion of the Roman Church do
run great hazard of their Salvation: for
which <hi>I</hi> instanced particularly in several
opinions and practices which are very apt
to hinder a good life which is necessary
to Salvation. Now a twofold Question
here arises. 1. Whether the Church may
justly be charged with those Doctrines
and practices? 2. Whether, although
the Church may not directly be charged to
have decreed them in her Councils, yet
so much countenance and encouragement
be not commonly given to them in that
Church, that particular persons do run
great hazard of their salvation by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of them? For which we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb facs="tcp:50175:8"/>
that it hath been the method of the
Roman Church to allow many more things
in common belief and practice than it hath
dared for very shame to decree in Councils,
especially when such things have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by her enemies. In this case it hath
been thought the most prudent course for
the Councils to speak deceitfully and in
general terms, so as to give as little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as may be to their enemies, and
yet to retain ground enough to uphold their
former opinions and practices: Which still
continuing in Vogue and reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so much the more dangerous to mens
Souls, because their Councils having had
opportunity to have declared effectually
against them were so far from it, that
by their doubtful expressions they have left
ground enough for the continuance of
them. Now from hence the Directors of
Conscience among them frame their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and the people think it their duty
blindly to follow them; and supposing
any one among them should scruple any
<pb facs="tcp:50175:9"/>
such Doctrine or practice, to whom must
he resort but to his Confessors, and will
any such dare to condemn what is generally
received although not decreed by Councils?
or if he should, dare any person rely on
his private judgement when it is contrary
to the most received Doctrine or practice?
Besides, the promises of Infallibility are
supposed by them to be primarily made to
the Church, and only by way of representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Council; and therefore Doctrines
or practices generally received and allowed
by the Teachers of the Church and the
Guides of conscience, must be received by
them as true and good; for otherwise those
promises would fail to the Church in its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive
capacity, and consequently, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
no General Council, it were possible
for the most erroneous and pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and practices to prevail in the Church,
which must utterly overthrow all pretence
to Infallibility. But in our present case
we need not run so far, for I shall here
prove that in the most material points in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb facs="tcp:50175:9"/>
on by <hi>N. O.</hi> viz. <hi>the Doctrine
of the efficacy of the Sacraments</hi> ex
opere Operato, <hi>and of Indulgences,</hi>
we do justly charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
even in the decrees of her Councils with
laying such a foundation, as doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the necessity of a good life. The
way he takes to vindicate those points
from this consequence is this, That the
<hi>Sacramenta mortuorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> viz. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
and Penance which confer justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

rightly disposed;</hi> And the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
vivorum,</hi> viz. <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Eucharist and Extreme
unction, do require the receiver
to be actually in a State of Grace;</hi>
the same,<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> he saith of <hi>Indulgences,
that the benefit of them doth
suppose a man put into a State
of Grace by the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9.</note>
so that the whole matter is put
upon this issue, whether their Doctrine
concerning the conditions by which a man
<pb facs="tcp:50175:10"/>
may be put into a State of Grace, be not
such as doth overthrow the necessity of a
good life? And it being acknowledged that
the Sacrament of Penance doth confer the
Grace of justification on all persons rightly
disposed for it, our only business is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what necessary conditions their Church
requires in order to it. For which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal

one to judge, whether from hence it doth
not necessarily follow, that all those that
have but imperfect contrition, or bare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
for their sins, are by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Penance put into a State of
Grace, according to the Doctrine of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> And how far this
overthrows the necessity of a good life,
will appear from the explication of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi>
and <hi>attrition</hi> given by the same
Council.<note place="margin">Sess. 14. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Contrition</hi> is defined, to be,
<hi>a grief of mind and detestation of
sin committed, with a purpose of
sinning no more;</hi> therefore <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contrition</hi> or <hi>attrition</hi> must be
such a grief and detestation of sin past,
as implies but an imperfect purpose of
sinning no more. From which it evidently
follows, that by the Doctrine of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
a man may be put into a State of
Grace without so much as a firm or perfect
purpose of sinning no more. And can
<pb facs="tcp:50175:11"/>
there be a Doctrine invented by men that
doth more effectually destroy the necessity
of a good life than this doth? For the
State of Grace puts a man actually into
the favour of God; and supposing him to
fall into mortal sin afterwards, all he
needs to do, is only to repeat the same kind
of attrition and receive the Sacrament of
Penance and he is perfectly sound again
and recovers the Favour of God. I know
the Council there saith, That <hi>this attrition
must exclude voluntatem peccandi,</hi>
as <hi>O. N.</hi> observes; but that implies no
more than a mans not having at that time
a purpose to sin again; and the Council
distinguishes it from the <hi>propositum
non peccandi de caetero,</hi> or the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not to sin again, which the Council
applies to <hi>contrition</hi> as the other to <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And <hi>Cajetan</hi> himself quoted by
<hi>O. N.</hi> calls it <hi>an imperfect purpose
of not sinning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> So that after all the
evasions which have been yet, or can be
produced, the Roman Churches Doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:50175:11"/>
of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi> doth
most dangerously obstruct devotion and a
good life. I desire therefore <hi>O. N.</hi> and
his Brethren to be a little more sparing in
their censures of us as unfaithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Doctrine of their Church,
for we understand it much better, and
represent it more truly, than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
            <p>But supposing the words of the Council
were ambiguous in this matter, what
better help can we have to understand it,
than the sense of their most eminent and
learned Instructours of Conscience? and
those not of the single Order of <hi>Jesuits,</hi>
as some would have it believed, but of all
sorts among them.<note place="margin">Melch. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Relect. de Poenit. part. 6. p. 932.</note> 
               <hi>Melchior Canus</hi>
who was far enough from being a Friend
of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> saith expresly, <hi>although
a man knows he hath not contrition
but bare attrition, he may come
to the Sacrament and receive grace
by it;</hi> for which he gives this reason,
<hi>because Baptism and Penance, are</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:12"/>
Sacramenta mortuorum; <hi>and therefore
those who are under mortal sin if
they have attrition whereby the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
is removed may not only
come to them, but go away with
the Grace conferred, because the
Sacraments always conferr Grace,
where the impediment is removed.

Layman</hi> with expressions of esteem,<note place="margin">Layman. Theol. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. l. 5. tract. 6. c. 2. sect. 2.</note>
and he determins that <hi>true contrition is
not necessary to the Sacrament of
Penance after the commission of
<pb facs="tcp:50175:12"/>
mortal sin, but attrition is sufficient
although a man know it to be only
attrition.</hi> If they had made attrition
only necessary to the Sacrament of Baptism,
they might have pleaded, that they had not
destroyed the necessity of a good life after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to preserve the Grace conveyed in
Baptism; but we see in the case of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

is necessary but a new Act of <hi>Attrition,</hi>
and that not only when a man mistakes it
to be <hi>contrition;</hi> but though a man

<hi>Cardinal Tolet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tolet. Summ Cas. l. 3. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> although he asserts the

               <hi>Cardinal Lugo</hi> not only
contends for the Doctrine, but asserts it
to be the Doctrine of the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Trent,</hi> viz. <hi>that attrition with the
Sacrament of Penance is sufficient
for the Grace of Justification;</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:50175:13"/>
quotes <hi>Suarez, Vasquez</hi> and <hi>Maera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
as sufficiently proving from the
words of the <hi>Council, that attrition
is the next disposition to the Grace
of justification conveyed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi>
and this <hi>attrition</hi> he there
shews against <hi>Sylvius,</hi> doth not imply
<hi>an imperfect love of God above all;</hi>
which is directly contrary to <hi>O. N.</hi> And
in another place he proves,<note place="margin">O. N. p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>that a man
is not bound always to contrition
for his sins although they be mortal;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lugo disp. 7. sect. 11. n. 201.</note> for saith he, <hi>if he were, then a

but only by invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
from a new mortal sin in
coming to the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
without contrition, because
some time is commonly supposed
to intervene between a mans attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and his justification by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
in which time he would
sin mortally by omitting contrition,
if he were obliged to it; but this,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:13"/>
saith he, <hi>is against the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Divines, that a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
any new guilt by omitting
contrition.</hi> Nay he afterwards deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,<note place="margin">Sect. 13. n. 263.</note>
               <hi>that a man that hath received
the Sacrament of Penance with bare
attrition is not bound, under the
guilt of mortal sin, for omitting it,
to an act of contrition at the point
of death; which is,</hi> he saith, <hi>the
commonly received opinion among
them, and he quotes Diana, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninch,
Becanus, Layman, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundez,
Faber, Turrianus, Salas</hi>
and others for it. The great argument
he brings, is, <hi>because Confessors do
not think themselves obliged to put
men in mind of an act of contrition
at that time as necessary, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience shews.</hi> And are not
such Confessors excellent Guides to Heaven
the mean while? If they be, they have
found out a much broader way and wider
gate than ever Christ intended. What not
<pb facs="tcp:50175:14"/>
one single act of contrition necessary! No,
not at the point of death! What pity it
is for sinners, you have not the keeping
of Heaven-gates? How do they want the
Sacrament of Penance in Hell, for no

as scandalous and pernicious to the
Souls of men, but not one of them relates
to this Doctrine of <hi>repentance,</hi> although
the <hi>Jansenists</hi> in <hi>France</hi> had complained
of it. Whence could this arise but from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it as the Doctrine of their Church?
Indeed I find that on <hi>May</hi> 5. 1667. The
<hi>Pope</hi> caused a <hi>Decree</hi> to be published
<hi>straitly forbidding all persons in
their debates about Attrition, to
condemn each other;</hi> but it is worth
our while to understand, what this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
was, viz. <hi>Whether bare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
doth require an act of the love
of God;</hi> and <hi>although the Negative</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:16"/>
be there said to be <hi>the more common
opinion, yet the Pope would not
have the others that affirmed it to
be censured.</hi> But not the least word
against the sufficiency of bare <hi>attrition.</hi>
Are any of the Books censured which
assert this Doctrine? Nay, they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with great approbations. Are any
of the Defenders of it discountenanced?
Nay, they are Persons in the highest
esteem, dignity, and Authority among
them. Are any cautions given to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
to beware of these Doctrines? Nay,
these very Books are purposely written and
approved for their instruction and use. And
if their Church be innocent after all this,
so was the Iewish Church in our Saviours
time; for the corruptions that were then
among them had no decree of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi>
that I find, for them; it was
only their <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> which introduced
them. And yet our Saviour thought mens
Souls in danger, when he bid them <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:16"/>
               <hi>of the leaven of the Pharisees.</hi>
I confess when we debate the causes of
Separation from their Communion, we
think it then reasonable to alledge no more,
than what they impose on all to believe and
practice (and we have enough of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in that kind without going farther)
but when we represent the hazard of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to particular persons, we may then
justly charge them with the pernicious
Doctrines and practices which are received
and allowed among them, although not
decreed by the Church in Councils. For
otherwise it would be just, as if one should
say to a man, that asked him, whether
he might safely travel through such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
<hi>yes, without doubt you may,
for although there be abundance
of Thieves and High-waymen,
yet the Prince or the State never
approved them, or gave them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to rob Travellers.</hi> Do you
think any man would venture his person
or his purse, on no better security? Yet
<pb facs="tcp:50175:17"/>
such security as this, if it were true is all that
such moderate men as <hi>O. N.</hi> or his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
can give as to the Roman Church;
for they dare not deny the bad consequence
of the Doctrines and practices charged upon
them, but only say, <hi>the Church hath
not decreed them.</hi> So much I thought
necessary to say to this newest and most
plausible pretence, which is made use of by
the best Advocates for the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>And now farewel to Moderation; for
the two next which appeared on the Stage
against me, were two <hi>Jesuits;</hi> the one
sent over a Book, which if we look only
at the bulk and thickness was a very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
one, called by an odd <hi>Antiphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
Reason and Religion:</hi> I have
endeavoured to draw off all the <hi>Spirit</hi> I
could find in it, in the following discourses,
but I am forced to leave a vast quantity of
Phlegm and <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> behind. I
shall say no more of him here, having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak so much of him in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
about the Principles of faith, which
<pb facs="tcp:50175:17"/>
will in a little time be ready to appear.</p>
            <p>The other is the stout Defender of <hi>lg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius
Loyola</hi> and the whole <hi>Order</hi> of
<hi>Jesuits;</hi> What, one man undertake to
defend the <hi>Jesuits</hi> as to their <hi>Principles</hi>
and <hi>Practices!</hi> and that in this Age, which
so well understands their Maxims and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct!
and in <hi>England</hi> too, where those
of other <hi>Orders</hi> and the <hi>Secular Priests</hi>
love them so dearly! But nothing is too
brave or difficult, for a <hi>Jesuit</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
however he comes off in it. As
to <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> I will come to
terms with him; if what he confesses as
to his ignorant zeal, pious simplicity,
frequent visions and extasies, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
preaching, unmannerly contempt of
Superiours do not prove him a <hi>Fanatick,</hi>
I am content to let him go. But what if
<hi>Ignatius</hi> himself being grown old, did
suspect such frequent extasies and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for illusions? I desire him to look
<hi>Ribadineira,</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:50175:18"/>
must be referred to another place. I shall
now only give a tast of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way of defending the principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to Government which I charged his
<hi>Order</hi> with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first was,</hi> that Government
was so originally in the People, that
they by their Representatives may
call their Soveraign to an account
and alter the form of Government.
<hi>Now mark this Answer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(whatsoever truth it may have
in speculation) is by no means to
be preached to the People, who
are apt enough of themselves to
stretch cases and pick quarrels with
their best Governours, yet was it
taught many Ages before the Jesuits
were so much as thought of. <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
the man for his plain-dealing; the
Doctrine it seems is</hi> true <hi>enough, but
the people are not fit to be trusted with the
management of it, no,</hi> not in their
places and callings; <hi>no, no, let the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:18"/>
Jesuits <hi>alone with these things, they
know just the very nick of time, when to
be Iudges and Executioners too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next principle is, <hi>the Popes
power of deposing Princes,</hi> to which
he again answers roundly.<note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>You are then
to know, Sir, that the Doctrine was
long ago taught by almost all
Orders and Professions, Seculars,
Regulars, Divines, Lawyers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jesuits were in Being.</hi> A
very Catholick Doctrine it seems it is!
What a stirr do other people make with
mincing this matter, I know not how;
give me a man that speaks out, and lets
Princes understand what their general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is in this matter, lest they may
possibly be deceived, as though it were
only the bold assertion of some few Persons
among them. <hi>What wonder then</hi> saith
he, <hi>if</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and 3. or 4. more
Jesuits were carried away with such
a Torrent of Doctors who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them?</hi> Nay, in my opinion the
<pb facs="tcp:50175:19"/>
only wonder is, how any Persons among
them dare think otherwise, this Doctrin
having as he tells us, so Catholick a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               <hi>the Jesuits have

Yes, but have a care how far you believe
him: we poor simple Islanders might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by this, that they had declared
it to be false and pernicious. There is
no such matter I will assure you, but
upon the stirrs in <hi>France</hi> they renounced
the publishing it, they renounced it as
they were in <hi>France,</hi> but thought it
good Doctrine at <hi>Rome:</hi> they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to treat any more of it, because of
the odiousness of it to Princes, and that is
all the <hi>renouncing</hi> they ever meant.</p>
            <p>The third Principle is, <hi>the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

<hi>did protest against these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
as void, null, unjust, and
agreed upon by persons that had no
power, and that they were to be so

not think this sufficient,</hi> but declares
<hi>all those Articles that related to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Religion, Church-lands, or
any Ecclesiastical Rights, or brought
any the least prejudice to them or
might be thought or pretended so
to do, to be null, void, invalid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,

that they shall remain so for ever;
and that no person, though never so

shall be bound by such oath;

of the Plenitude of Apostolical

reprobate, null and cassate all those
articles and protests before God of
the nullity of them; and restores
all persons and places to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

them,</hi> with very much more to the same

Call you this, Sir, the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
them! Is it credible that he who
in the beginning of his Answer had charged
the late Protestant Books, (which he most
ingeniously calls <hi>Libels)</hi> to be <hi>cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with nothing else but what
we know to be false,</hi> should within a
few Pages have the confidence to affirm
in the face of the world so notorious an
untruth? But I leave this ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
to be Chastised for this and other his
extravagancies, by his worthy Adversary,
and return to my own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:22"/>
After all these unsuccessful attempts
at last the <hi>Knight</hi> himself resolves to
encounter the <hi>Dragon;</hi> and accordingly
he buckles on his armour, mounts his stead,
and, according to all ancient and modern Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of the combat, directs his lance into
the very mouth of it; wisely considering,
if the head were mortally wounded, the
whole Body would fall to the ground. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him at a convenient distance follows
his Squire <hi>I. S.</hi> who had a particular
spight at the <hi>Dragons Tayl,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear or wit falls unmercifully upon it,
and in his own opinion, hath chopt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a thousand pieces. But such mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
creatures whose strength lies scattered
in all their parts, do often rise up when
they are triumphed over as dead, and give
their most deadly wounds, when they are
thought to lye gasping for breath.</p>
            <p>It happened that when <hi>T. G's.</hi> Answer
to the first part of my Book came out, I
was before engaged in the Defence of the
Protestant principles of faith against the
<pb facs="tcp:50175:22"/>
Guide in Controversies and <hi>E. W.</hi> (the
Author of <hi>those two learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises</hi>
as <hi>T. G.</hi> calls them,<note place="margin">P. 312.</note> 
               <hi>Protestancy
without Principles, and Religion and
Reason)</hi> part of which being then in the
Press, I was forced to go through with
that, before I could take his Book into
consideration. And thereupon I resolved to
dispatch all those which relate to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Faith together; and then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Principles of Worship in
answer to him, which (God willing) I
intend as soon as the former part is finished.</p>
            <p>All that I shall take notice of him here,
is to represent the ingenuity of his dealing
with me in his Preface, wherein he
charges me <hi>with dissenting from the
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England
<hi>in accusing the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>of
Idolatry.</hi> And by this one Instance I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Reader to judge what Candour and
sincerity he is to expect in his Book.</p>
            <p>For the sense of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
I appealed to the <hi>Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:</hi>

teach them. The design of that last part
is thus set down.<note place="margin">Book of Hom. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tome. p. 46.</note> 1. <hi>That Popish
Images and the Idols of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils
are all one concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
2. That they have been and
be worshipped in our time in like
form and manner as were the Idols
of the Gentils. And for that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
standeth chiefly in the mind, it
shall in this part first be proved that
our Image-maintainers, have had
and have the same opinions and
judgement of Saints whose Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they have made and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
as the Gentils Idolaters
had of their Gods; and afterwards
shall be declared that our Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintainers
<pb facs="tcp:50175:23"/>
and worshippers have
used and use the same outward
rites, and manner of honouring,
and worshipping their Images, as
the Gentils did use before their
Idols, and that therefore they
commit Idolatry, as well inwardly
as outwardly, as did the wicked
Gentils Idolaters;</hi> and this that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
is intended for the proof of:
which it doth very fully. But, saith
<hi>T. G., why did I not appeal for the
sense of our Church to the 39. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles?</hi>
As though the approbation of <hi>the
Book of Homilies</hi> were not one of them,
viz the 35. <hi>The second Book of
Homilies the several Titles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have joyned under this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
(among which Titles the second is this
of the Peril of Idolatry) <hi>doth contain a
godly and wholesome Doctrine and
necessary for these times.</hi> Which
Articles were not only allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Queen, but confirmed by the
<pb facs="tcp:50175:24"/>
subscription of the hand of the Arch-bishop
and Bishops of the upper House, and by
the subscription of the whole Clergy in the
nether House of Convocation <hi>A. D.</hi> 1571.
Now I desire <hi>T. G.</hi> to resolve me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men of any common understanding
would have subscribed to this <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Homilies</hi> in this manner, if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the main Doctrine and design of one
of them had been false and pernicious?
as they must have done if they had thought
the practice of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to
be free from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> I will put th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
case that any of the Bishops then had
thought the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> had been
unjust, and that it had subverted the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Ecclesiastical Authority, that
there could have been no Church, or right
ordination if the <hi>Roman Church</hi> had been
guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> would they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
this into the Articles, when it was
in their power to have left it out? and
that <hi>the Homilies contained a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and Godly Doctrine,</hi> which in
<pb facs="tcp:50175:24"/>
their consciences they believed to be false
and pernicious? I might as well think that
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> would have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> as containing a
<hi>wholesome and Godly Doctrine;</hi> as
that men so perswaded would have allowed
it the <hi>Homily against the Peril of
Idolatry.</hi> And how is it possible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the sense of our Church better,
than by such publick and authentick acts
of it, which all Persons who are in any
place of trust in the Church must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>clare their approbation of
them? This <hi>Homily</hi> hath still continued
the same, the Article the very same, and
if so they must acknowledge this hath
been, and is to this day the sense of our
Church. But saith <hi>T. C. the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the Book of Homilies, as
containing a godly and wholesome
Doctrine, doth not evince that every
particular Doctrine contained in it
is such.</hi> Be it so: but I hope it doth
evince that the Subscribers did not think
<pb facs="tcp:50175:25"/>
the main Doctrine of any one <hi>Homily</hi> to
be false? Surely there is a great deal of
difference between some particular passages
and expressions in these <hi>Homilies,</hi> and
that which is the main design and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any one of them. But in this case
we are to observe, that they who deny the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
do not only look on the Charge as
false, but as of dangerous Consequence;
and therefore although men may subscribe
to a <hi>Book</hi> in general as containing whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and godly Doctrine, though they be
not so certain of the Truth of every passage
in it, yet they can never do it with a good
conscience if they believe any great and
considerable part of the Doctrine therein
contained to be false and dangerous. Such
a subscription would be as apparently shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and dishonest as is the evasion of
this Testimony which <hi>T. G.</hi> makes use of
for want of a better.</p>

Doctrine of the Church ever since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

22. (viz. not barely worshipping but
<hi>adoration of images)</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry</hi>
and plainly repugnant to Scripture. Were
the composers of our Articles so sensless as
not to think Idolatry repugnant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
or not to think adoration of images
to be Idolatry; or not to think the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of it, when the Article
saith <hi>The Romish Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
worshipping and adoration
as well of Images as of Reliques,</hi> &amp;c?
It is not meerly the practice used in the
<pb facs="tcp:50175:27"/>
               <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> but their very <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
concerning <hi>adoration of images</hi>
which is here charged; and can any
Church teach adoration of images and not
be guilty of Idolatry? And for his Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
about being <hi>rather repugnant,</hi>
it had been utterly lost if he had looked into
the Latin Articles where the words are,
<hi>immo verbo Dei contradicit;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appears that <hi>rather</hi> is not used as a
term of diminution, but of a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
affirmation.</p>
            <p>I now come to the exceptions he takes to the
particular Testimonies I produced of the most
eminent Bishops and Divines of our Church,
ever since the Reformation, who have all
concurred in this charge of Idolatry. Two
parts in three he excepts against as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
witnesses in the case: how few of the
Iury would any Malefactor allow if such
frivolous exceptions might serve his turn?</p>
            <p>The two first he excepts against are the
two <hi>Arch-Bishops Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
as Puritanically inclined.</hi> But
<pb facs="tcp:50175:27"/>
as it unhappily falls out, one of them was
never mentioned by me, and the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
till now suspected for a <hi>Puritan.</hi>
The <hi>Abbot</hi> I mentioned was not <hi>George
Abbot Arch-Bishop of Canterbury,</hi>
but <hi>Robert Abbot</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and it is the first time we ever
heard that <hi>a Bishop of Salisbury was
suspended from his Metropolitical
jurisdiction.</hi> But they of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> have a faculty of doing greater
wonders with five words, than Changing
a Bishop into an Arch-Bishop. I hope he
understands the Church he is of, better
than that he hath left, or else we are like
to have a sad account of History from him.
But why I beseech you, after all his zeal
and indefatigable pains for the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> must <hi>Arch-Bishop Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi>
be thrown away to the <hi>Puritans?</hi> If
he had proved <hi>T. C.</hi> at the same time
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there
might have been some reason to suspect

they forbid them the reading
of the Scriptures. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and drawn from Christ to
the Pope; from his merits to the

his bloody sacrifice, whereby on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the spiritual food of his Body and

Transubstantiation; from the
calling upon his name to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints: and from their

to a vain imagination of the vertue
of their Masses, Pilgrimages, Pardons,

Superstition and Idolatry. <hi>I hope</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:50175:31"/>
Canon <hi>they have these words.</hi> And
albeit at the time or Reforming this
Church from that gross Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Popery, it was carefully
provided that all means should be
used to root out of the minds of the
people, both the inclination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and memory thereof; especially
of the Idolatry committed in the
Mass, for which cause all Popish
Altars were demolished, <hi>&amp;c. What
can more express the sense of our Church,
than the concurrent opinion of</hi> Arch-Bishops,
Bishops <hi>and</hi> Clergy <hi>of
both</hi> Provinces <hi>met in</hi> Convocation?
<hi>When we see they so lately, charged the</hi>
Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>with</hi> Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider what exceptions he
takes against the other witnesses produced
by me. <hi>Jewel, Bilson, Davenant,</hi>
all eminent Bishops of our Church and of
great learning, are cast away at once,
as incompetent Persons. But why so?
Why, saith <hi>T. G. they were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb facs="tcp:50175:32"/>
against by our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
K.</hi> Charcles I. <hi>in his third paper
to</hi> Henderson. That is a shrewd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
indeed to their Authority to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by a Prince of so excellent a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and so Cordial a friend to the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England.</hi> But it is good to be sure
whether it be so or no. All that he saith
of <hi>Bishop</hi> Iewel <hi>is this, and though
I much reverence Bishop</hi> Iewel'<hi>s
memory, I never thought him infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi>
So then, he must he <hi>Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
inclined;</hi> but whence does that
follow? not surely <hi>from the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing
his memory,</hi> for that were
to reflect upon the King himself; not
<hi>from his not thinking him Infallible.</hi>
For I dare say, the King never thought
the <hi>Pope infallible;</hi> must be needs
therefore think him a <hi>Puritan?</hi> Surely
never man was such a Friend to the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
as this <hi>T. G.</hi> who without any
ground gives them away some of the
greatest honours of our Church, and (if the
<pb facs="tcp:50175:32"/>
Testimony last cited be of any force to
prove one a <hi>Puritan,)</hi> all mankind,
and himself too: for I plainly perceive
by this Preface that he is not infallible.
Yet for all this we will not let go <hi>Jewel,</hi>
no nor <hi>Bilson, Davenant, White,
Usher, Downam,</hi> what ever <hi>T. G.</hi>
saith against them. Indeed K. <hi>Charles</hi>
excepts against <hi>Bilson</hi> for his Principles
of civil Government, but not a word of his
disaffection to the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
For <hi>Bishop Davenant,</hi> the King saith
<hi>he is none of those to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
or would submit unto,</hi> and
with very good reason, for the King had
appealed to <hi>the practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, and the Universal
consent of Fathers;</hi> therefore Bishop
<hi>Davenant</hi> was a <hi>Puritan.</hi> It seems
they have been all <hi>Puritans</hi> since <hi>the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times;</hi> and I hope the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> then hath good store of them,
for that is far enough from <hi>the Fathers</hi>
or the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> But how
<pb facs="tcp:50175:33"/>
comes <hi>Bishop White</hi> in for a <hi>Puritan,</hi>
being so great a Friend of <hi>Arch-Bishop
Laud;</hi> why, forsooth, <hi>Heylin reports that
for licensing Bishop</hi> Mountagu's Appello
Caesarem, <hi>it was said, that White was
turned Black.</hi> And canst thou for thy
heart, good Reader, expect a more pregnant
proof? It was a notable saying, and it is
great pity, the Historian did not preserve the
memory of the Author of it; but by whom
was it said? that must be supposed by the
<hi>Puritans;</hi> and could none but they be the
Authors of so witty a saying? But suppose
they were the <hi>Puritans</hi> that said it? it is
plain then, they thought him no sound <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi>
for they hold no falling from Grace.
All then that can be inferred from this witty
saying is, that <hi>White</hi> sunk in his esteem
among them by this Act. And is it not
possible for them to have an esteem for those
who are not of their own Party? Concerning
<hi>Arch-Bishop Usher,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was
known to be too much his enemy, to be allowed
to give a Character of him: and his name will
<pb facs="tcp:50175:33"/>
not want a due veneration as long as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and piety have any esteem among us.</p>
            <p>But he is most troubled what to do
with six that remain, <hi>viz. King James,
Bishop Andrews, Arch-Bishop
Laud, Isaac Casaubon, Doct. Field,</hi>
and <hi>Doct. Jackson;</hi> these he could not
for shame fasten the name of <hi>Puritans</hi>
upon (as he doth with scorn on <hi>Bishop
Downam, Reynolds, Whitaker,</hi> and
<hi>Fulk;</hi> whose testimonies I said to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
cavils, I need not to produce although
they are all capable of sufficient vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
For <hi>King James,</hi> he saith, <hi>that
in the place cited by me he saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that what he condemns is
adoring of Images, praying to
them, and imagining a kind of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
in them, all which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by Catholicks.</hi> Was ever man
put to such miserable shifts? Are not
these <hi>King James</hi> his words. <hi>But for
worshipping either them, (Reliques)
or Images, I must account it dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:34"/>
               <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And doth not <hi>King
James</hi> a little after take off their distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and evasions in these words, <hi>and
they worship (forsooth) the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of things in Being, and the
Image of the true God. But Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
forbiddeth to worship the
Image of any thing that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Yea the Image of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is not only expresly forbidden
to be worshipped but even to be
made. Let them therefore that
maintain this doctrine, answer it
to Christ at the latter day, when
he shall accuse them of Idolatry;
And then I doubt if he will be paid
with such nice Sophistical distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Is all this nothing but to charge
them with such practices which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test?
Doth he not mention <hi>their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and <hi>their distinctions?</hi> Did
not <hi>King James</hi> understand what he
said, and what they did? It is plain he
charges them with Idolatry in what they
<pb facs="tcp:50175:34"/>
did, which was that I brought his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for. The like answer he gives to
the rest of them, <hi>viz. that they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, with what they thought
they did, but the Papists deny that
they do any such thing: i. e.</hi> in plain
Terms, they charge them with <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
but the <hi>Papists</hi> deny they commit it. And
so they do when I charge them with it;
so that <hi>T. G.</hi> by the very same reason
might have acquitted me from charging
them with it, and have spared his Book.
Is not this now an Admirable way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that they do not charge them with
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> because the <hi>Papists</hi> deny they
commit it? Who meddles with what they
profess they do, or do not? I was to shew
what these Persons charged them with.
And do any of these excuse them by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any doctrine of theirs was contrary to
these particulars? do they not expresly set
themselves to disprove their distinctions
upon which their doctrine is founded? and
shew the vanity of them because their
<pb facs="tcp:50175:35"/>
open and allowed practices do plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them; and shew that they do give
divine honour to Images however in words
they deny it. But this way of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them is, as if those whom St. <hi>Paul</hi>
charges that <hi>they professed that they
knew God but in works they deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him,</hi> should reply to him, how can we
deny him in our Works, since we profess
him in our Words? Iust so saith <hi>T. G.</hi>
how can they be charged with Idolatry,
since they profess to do no such thing? A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
such persons, as those I mentioned,
did not understand both what the Papists
said for themselves and what they
did notwithstanding. And now I joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with <hi>T. G. in desiring the Reader
may be judge between us, whether
I have betrayed my trust in preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to defend the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
<hi>and whether in charging the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with Idolatry I have
contradicted the sense of it?</hi> since I
have made it appear that <hi>her most true</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:35"/>
               <hi>and Genuin sons,</hi> the most remote from
all suspicion of disaffection to her, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to <hi>Puritanism,</hi> have concurred in
the same charge which I undertook to make
good.</p>
            <p>But there is one blow yet remaining in
his Preface, which I must endeavour to
ward off, otherwise it will be a terrible one to
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>by this
charge of Idolatry, he makes me
to subvert the very foundation of
Ecclesiastical Authority in it.</hi> This it
is to charge home. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>it
being a received Maxime and not
being denyable by any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense, that no man can give
to another that which he hath not
himself, it lies open to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of every man, that if the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be guilty of Heresie,
much more if guilty of Idolatry,
it falls under the Apostles excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi>
(Gal. 1. 8.) <hi>and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
deprived of the Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb facs="tcp:50175:36"/>
to use and exercise the power
of Orders; and consequently the
Authority of Governing, preaching
and Administring the Sacraments,
which those of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England
<hi>challenge to themselves, as deriv'd
from the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>can be
no true and lawful Jurisdiction,
but usurped and Anti-Christian.</hi>
And so farewel to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were not
more kind in this case than <hi>T. G.</hi> is. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have seen his skill in the affairs
of our Church, and now we shall see just
as much in the Doctrine of his own. For
doth not the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> make
<hi>Orders a Sacrament?</hi> and one of those
which doth imprint <hi>an indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. sess. 7. can. 9. sess. 23. can. 4.</note>

from his own Church, that denies
the validity of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi>

               </gap>pend
on the worth or quality of the Ministers of
it but upon the essentials and the institution
of Christ, how can the fault of the persons
hinder the conveyance of that Authority,
which they are only the bare instruments to
convey? Doth <hi>T. G.</hi> think so in all other
Sacraments? as in case of Baptism; that
supposing the Ministers of it have been guilty
of <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the Sacrament
loses its effect? Well fare then the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
whose opinion this was, and in whom
it hath been condemned by the Church. If it
be not so in other <hi>Sacraments</hi> how comes
it to be thus in <hi>Orders?</hi> which he must
acknowledge, to be as much a <hi>Sacrament</hi>
as <hi>Baptism;</hi> or else he must renounce the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> And it is observable,
that the very argument used by the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
and others, was the same which <hi>T. G.</hi>
here produces, <hi>viz. his common maxim
<pb facs="tcp:50175:37"/>
of Reason, and not denyable by
any man of common sense that
no man can give to another, that
which he hath not himself;</hi> to which
this answer was given, that the <hi>Instrument</hi>
was not the <hi>giver,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But, methinks, if</hi> T. G. <hi>had forgotten
the Doctrine of the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Trent, <hi>he
might have looked into some one or other of

his own Church? for</hi> Vasquez <hi>saith</hi> this
is determined as a matter of faith
among them, that the validity of a
Sacrament doth not depend on the
probity or faith of the Minister. And
he denies it to be in the power of the
Church to hinder the effect of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in an excommunicated Bishop,
because it cannot blot out his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,

<hi>the reason he gives is,</hi> that
a power in Consecration is given to
a Bishop, which can never be taken
from him, <hi>although he will not allow
it to be called a</hi> Character. <hi>For several,
<pb facs="tcp:50175:39"/>
especially of the ancient</hi> Schoolmen <hi>would
not have consecration to imprint a</hi> new
Character; <hi>but they were never able to
give an intelligible account of what they
meant by the</hi> Character <hi>as distinct from
that Sacramental power which was conveyed
by</hi> consecration <hi>and they granted to</hi> be
indelible <hi>as the other was, some making it
an</hi> extension <hi>of the</hi> Character <hi>of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
others a bare</hi> extrinsecal denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<hi>added to it; but however they held
it such as could no more be taken away than
the</hi> Character of Priesthood.<note place="margin">

            <p>But if he would not look into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversal
Writers of their Church, yet if he
had but searched into the practice of the
<hi>Church</hi> either in ancient or modern times
he would have been ashamed to have made
use of such an Argument to overthrow all
Ecclesiastical Authority among us. I grant
that in some tumultuous Ages of the Church,
Ordinations have been adjudged null through
the defaults of the Persons, but then it
was meerly for breaking the <hi>Canons</hi> of the
Church; so it was in the case of <hi>Formosus,</hi>
for breaking the <hi>Canons</hi> against the
<hi>Translations of Bishops;</hi> in the case of
<hi>Ebbo Arch-Bishop of Rhemes, whose
ordinations were nulled by</hi> Hincma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
<hi>and the Council of</hi> Soissons, <hi>for not</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:40"/>
being <hi>Canonically</hi> restored after deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but upon appeal to the <hi>Pope</hi> they were
pronounced valid: in the Case of <hi>Pope
Constantine</hi> for precepitating <hi>Orders</hi> to
secure the Popedom; in the famous case
of <hi>Photius,</hi> whose ordination was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Null by the opposite faction on the
same grounds; but all these things were
done in troublesome times, when one party
sought a pretence against the other. But
if we regard the more general practice of
the Church, we shall find when far greater
objections than these were made, yet Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
have been allowed; although made
by <hi>Hereticks.</hi> I shall offer him the fairest
terms he can desire, and for the practice of
the <hi>Church</hi> referr him to his own dear
second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi>
practice of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
The Question of the validity of Ordination
by <hi>Hereticks</hi> was at large debated in the
first action of the second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi>
upon the submission of <hi>Basilius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
and <hi>Theodosius, Hypatius</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:50175:41"/>
others who had been Bishops of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
party, which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Vicar</hi> of the
<hi>Orient</hi> there declared <hi>to be worse than
any former heresie:</hi> upon which the
Question was proposed, whether upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
their heresie they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as Bishops, and the orders be allowed
of those who were ordained by them during
their Heresie? <hi>Hypatius</hi> appealed <hi>to
the custom of the Church;</hi> then the
Canons of Councils and writings of the
Fathers were brought into Council: <hi>Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
produced the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi>
of <hi>Nice,</hi> allowing the <hi>Ordinations</hi> of
the <hi>Cathari,</hi> and <hi>the imposition of
hands</hi> there mentioned he understands only
for <hi>benediction,</hi> and not for <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
making no distinction between those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by <hi>Nestorians</hi> and others; (for
therein the force of that third <hi>Canon</hi>
must lye which <hi>Tarasius</hi> thought so plain)
from St. <hi>Basil,</hi> allowing those Bishops
which communicated with <hi>Isoes</hi> or <hi>Zoius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50175:41"/>
and <hi>Saturninus;</hi> from the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Ephesus</hi> allowing the <hi>Orders</hi> of the
<hi>Messaliani</hi> or <hi>Euchitae;</hi> from the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> allowing the
<hi>Bishops</hi> upon their repentance, which had
joyned with <hi>Dioscorus:</hi> and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
for those <hi>which had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by Heretical Bishops,</hi> it was
there shewed, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the fourth <hi>Council</hi> was ordained
by <hi>Dioscorus</hi> in the presence of <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi>
that <hi>John Bishop</hi> of <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
after he had renounced the <hi>Acepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
by whom he was ordained, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and submitted to as <hi>Bishop</hi> by the
<hi>Orthodox;</hi> that many of those who sat
in the sixth <hi>Council</hi> were ordained by
<hi>Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Petrus,</hi>
who were in that Council declared to be
<hi>Hereticks;</hi> and <hi>for 50. years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tarasius</hi> saith, <hi>they had no other
ordinations:</hi> upon these evidences of
the practice of the Church, this <hi>Council</hi>
of <hi>Nice</hi> declared likewise, that <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

            <p>For the modern practice of the <hi>Church</hi>

given to the <hi>Ordinations</hi> of the <hi>Greek
Church,</hi> although the <hi>Greek Church</hi>
be charged with Heresie; and that ever
since the notorious <hi>Schism</hi> in the time of
<hi>Michael Cerularius</hi> A. D. 1053. In
the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third some
<hi>Greek Clergy-men</hi> living in the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses</hi>
of <hi>Latin Bishops,</hi> yet received
ordination from <hi>Greek Bishops,</hi> which
made the <hi>Latin Bishops</hi> suspend them
from the execution of their Office, the
Pope, hearing of it, sends to his Legat,
wherein he consents to the suspension in case
it were done without leave from the <hi>Latin

which hath so much enraged
those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
against me,<note place="margin">Of the Nature of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</note> I thought I had
reason to expect that a just
Answer should be made to it; but they have
taken an effectual course to undeceive me; for
by this <hi>new way</hi> I perceive, their utmost
ambition is to have something abroad
which among themselves may pass for an
<hi>Answer.</hi> Which put me in mind of what
I have heard a great Person said, when he
had undertaken to manage an ill cause before
a publick Audience, and one of his Friends
asked him what he meant by it, <hi>trouble not
your self,</hi> said he, <hi>our own side will be sure to
believe me.</hi> It was surely some such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
as this, which made the learned
Authors of these two elaborate <hi>Pamphlets</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50175:45"/>
to appear in such a manner in Print, as if it were
no great matter what they said, so their people
might have this to say, and (if they can)
believe it too, <hi>that my book is answered.</hi> If
this be all their cause will afford, it deserves
rather to be pittied than confuted; if it will
bear more, they are as bad managers of it
as their enemies could wish. For however I
was threatned before hand that such answers
were coming abroad, <hi>every line of which
would fetch blood;</hi> yet, as cruel as they are
when we are under their lash, I found that
which they designed for my punishment to
give me no small pleasure: and I never had
so good an opinion of the mercifulness of
their Church as when I saw with what feeble
hands they chastised me. I had heard so much
of their rage, that I expected their greatest
strength would be employ'd upon me; and I
could not tell what <hi>Zamzummims</hi> they might
hitherto keep in the dark, whose arms were not
to be made use of, but upon some special
occasion when an Adversary was to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
all at once and so perfectly subdued as
never to appear more. While I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
my self for this kind of Martyrdome,
out come these mighty men of valour, who
have beaten nothing that I know of, but the
air and themselves; for they have neither
<hi>tyed my tongue,</hi> nor <hi>broke my heart,</hi> nor <hi>fetched
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50175:45"/>
one drop of blood</hi> that I can yet find; all which
were things I was told would be done, when
these answers came abroad; which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
made so loud a noise, that I heard the
report of them not only nearer home, but from
very distant persons and places.</p>
            <p>But lest I should be thought only to despise
my Adversaries (which I confess they have
given me no small occasion to do) I shall
bestow a particular examination upon what
they have offered by way of Answer to my
Book.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Only I think it reasonable in the first
place to take notice of their present way and
method of Answering,<note place="margin">Of their common way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering our Books.</note> wherein they make
use of as many artifices, as they do in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proselytes. When we set our selves to
Answer their Books, we endeavour to state
the Controversie plainly, to examine their
proofs, to apply distinct Answers to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
fairly represented in their own
words, and to render the whole Discourse as
clear and perspicuous as may be, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may be capable of judging on which side
the greatest strength and evidence lyes.
This is the mighty advantage which a good
cause gives us; we make use of no tricks to
deceive men, nor Sophistical cavils to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and perplex things; we dare appeal
to the judgement of any impartial person,
who will take the pains to examin the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50175:46"/>
in difference between us. But in their
late dealings with us, they seek to avoid the
main things in dispute, and abhor any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
proceeding; one man picks out a
sentence here and there to answer, another a
page or two together, a third leaps from
one thing to another, as if resolv'd to pass by
the greatest difficulties; but he is a man of
courage indeed, that dares fall upon the reer,
and begin to confute a Book at the end of it,
so that if he lives long enough, and get heart,
he may in time come to the beginning: And
if we observe them all, they look for nothing
so much as some cleanly way of escape, and
if they can but raise such a dust as to fly
away without being openly discerned to do
so, this they hope those of their own side
will be so kind and partial as to call a Victory.
These are no general accusations, but such
as are easie to observe in their dealings with
me as to my former Book, and that lately
published. But to judicious men, all these
little arts and shifts are either plain acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
of a baffled Cause, or an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a weak and unskilful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If the Book it self be a little too trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
to be medled with,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> it is best to fall
upon the Author,<note place="margin">Of their Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mnies against me.</note> and it is a hard case if by
false and ridiculous stories, or open calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50175:46"/>
or at least base and ugly insinuations,
they cannot diminish his reputation; and
then they hope the Book will sink with its
Author. But <hi>we are not Ignorant</hi> whose
cause is wont to be managed by such <hi>devices</hi>
as these are, and from whom they have learnt
this method of confuting Adversaries. As
for all their <hi>railing accusations</hi> against me;
I shall not so much as desire God <hi>to rebuke
them,</hi> but only pray that he would pardon
them; and if I must thank them for any
thing, it is for giving me the occasion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
so great a charity. I have learnt of
him <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not
again,</hi> not only to forbear reproaching them in
the same manner, but to return them <hi>good for
evil,</hi> and to pray for them while they calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
me. I have so much the less reason to
wonder that my Book should be charged by
them with no less than <hi>Blasphemy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 65.</note> since the
Author of our Religion himself was so, and
suffered under that accusation. But wherein
I pray doth this <hi>blasphemy</hi> lye? have I uttered
any thing that tends to the reproach of <hi>God</hi>
or true <hi>Religion?</hi> have I the least word which
malice it self can stretch to the dishonour of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> or the
<hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> written by divine Inspiration?
no; I challenge the boldest of them, and most
malicious, to produce any thing I ever said
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50175:47"/>
or writ that doth but seem to look that way.
Have I made the practice of true devotion ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
and the real expressions of piety the
subject of scorn and derision? No, so far
from it, that it was only a just zeal for the
Honour and practise of true Religion made
me willing to lay open the ridiculous <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms</hi>
of some pretended <hi>Saints</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church. And must they be allowed to
charge <hi>Fanaticism</hi> on us, and think it far
from <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to represent the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi>
Follies of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> among us; and when
they are guilty of the very same, or greater,
may not we shew their unjustice and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
without being accused of <hi>Blasphemy?
But some of these are Canonized Saints, as</hi>
S. <hi>Brigitt,</hi> S. <hi>Catharine,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and
S. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> which is so far from making
the Cause of their Church better, that
to my understanding it makes it much
worse. For although <hi>Fanaticism</hi> be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned</hi>
by our <hi>Church,</hi> it seems it is not barely
countenanced and allowed in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Canonized</hi> and <hi>adored.</hi> That
which I insist upon, is this; either we have
no <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> or theirs are so; for by the
very same rule that ours are so, theirs must
be too; for our <hi>Fanaticks</hi> do pretend as high
to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>divine Revelation</hi> as any of
theirs; only there is this remarkable difference
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50175:47"/>
between their <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and ours, that ours
are <hi>among us</hi> but not <hi>of us,</hi> but theirs are
both. Now if any one who pretends to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration</hi>
and <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> cannot be charged
with <hi>Fanaticism</hi> without <hi>blasphemy,</hi> we must
be exposed to all follies and contradictions
imaginable; and to what purpose are we bid
to <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of God or
no,</hi>

they are in many things as different from each

folly, and true piety from gross Superstition. If
he had called me an <hi>Atheist</hi> in plain terms, the
grossness of the calumny might have abated
the force of it; but there is no such way to
do a man mischief, as by fly insinuations and
shrewd suggestions introduced with <hi>I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
and expressed with some gravity and
zeal. But you who are so good at resolving
faith, what is this <hi>verily believe</hi> of yours
founded upon? Have you the authority of your

<hi>verily believe it,</hi> as you <hi>verily believe</hi> many
other things, for no reason in the world? If I
should tell you I have made it my business to

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50175:48"/>
for my innocency, and publish a confession of
my faith, with protestations that no <hi>interest</hi>
in the world could remove me from it; you
might tell me, where there is no guilt what
need so much ado? In plain terms, I know
but one way to satisfie such as you are, but
I will keep from it as long as I can, and
that is to go to <hi>Rome</hi> and be burnt for my
faith; for that is the kindness there shewed
to those who contend for the purity of the

they are not fit to be passed by, so are they
too gross to need any further answer. I
shall however declare my mind freely to you;
if I had no other notion of the Christian
doctrine, than what I have from the Doctrines
of your Church as contrary to ours; no other
measures of <hi>Christian</hi> piety than from your
mystical <hi>Theology;</hi> no better way to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

no greater certainty of <hi>Inspiration</hi> from

But the mischief of it is, these <hi>Romantick

               <hi>that I would treat these
matters seriously, and lay aside drollery.</hi> To
be then as grave as he can desire, there are
these two things which I design to prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>

               </gap>n
it, that were no sufficient answer to my Book.
2. That I am far enough from contradicting
my self in any one of the things which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
insists upon.</p>
            <p>1. Supposing what he contends for were
true, yet my Book remains unanswered; the
design of which was to shew that no man can
joyn in the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
without great hazard of his salvation. If I
had any where said the contrary, this indeed
would have made it evident that I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
my self. But what then? doth the
force of all the arguments used by me in this
last Discourse fall to the ground, because I
was formerly of another opinion? Let me
ask these revolters from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
one question; whether they do not now
more plainly contradict themselves as to their
former opinions, than they can pretend that I
have ever done? I desire to know, whether
this makes all their present arguments for
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> of no force? If they think
their present reasons ought to be answered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50175:51"/>
whatever contrary opinion they had before;
why, on supposition I had contradicted in a
a former Book what I say in this, must this
render all that I have said, or can hereafter
say in this matter, invalid? Doth the strength
of all lye upon my bare affirming or denying?
was it ever <hi>true</hi> because I said it? if not, how
comes it to be <hi>untrue</hi> now, because I deny it?
I do not remember I was ever so vain, to make
use of my own authority to prove a thing to be
true, because I believed it; and if I had, the
world is not so vain to believe a man one jot the
sooner for it. If my authority in saying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
be of no importance to the truth of the
thing, then he may prove that I contradict my
self, and yet all the arguments of my Book be
as strong as ever. I do not desire any one to
follow my opinion because it is mine, but I
offer reason and authority for the proof of what
I say; if those be good in themselves, they do
not therefore cease to be so, because they are, or
seem to he inconsistent with what I have said
elsewhere. So that self-contradiction being
proved, overthrows not the reason of the thing,
but the authority of the person; and where
things depend meerly upon authority, it is a
good argument, and no where else. If a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in a <hi>Court</hi> contradicts himself, his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
signifies nothing; because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but his authority that makes his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50175:52"/>
testimony valid; but if a <hi>Lawyer</hi> at the <hi>Bar</hi>
chance to speak inconsistently, if afterwards he
speaks plain and evident reason, does that take
off the force of it, because he said something
before which contradicted that plain reason?
If the <hi>Pope,</hi> or those who pretend to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
contradict themselves, that sufficiently
overthrows their pretence of infallibility; for
he that changeth his mind, must be deceived
once; but for us fallible mortals, if we once
hit upon reason and truth, and manage the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it clearly, that reason doth not lose its
former evidence, because the same persons may
afterwards oppose it. Suppose I should be able to
prove that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his <hi>Recognitions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
what he had said in his former Books;
doth this presently make all his arguments
useless, and him uncapable of ever appearing
in controversie more? Doth this make all his
authorities false and his reasons unconcluding?
doth it hence follow that he spake no where
consistently, because once or twice, or perhaps
as often as his neighbours, he contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
But my grave <hi>Adversary, I. W.</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
that we Writers of Controversies are
like <hi>Witnesses</hi> in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and are bound to
make <hi>Affidavits</hi> before the <hi>Masters</hi> of this
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Controversie;</hi> and that whatever we
say is to be taken as upon our oath; this indeed
would be an excellent way of bringing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50175:52"/>
to an issue, if we were to be sworn
whether such a thing as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
were true or false; and I cannot tell whether
this, or laying wagers, or the <hi>Popes</hi> infallibility
be the best way to end such Controversies; for
any one of them would do it, if people could
but agree about it. But now my <hi>Adversary</hi>
says, that if a man once contradict himself he is
to be looked on as <hi>a perjured person,</hi> and
whatever he saith, his word is not to be taken.
This he not only begins with, but very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly

I see now what it is they would be at, no less
than perpetual silence and being set in the
<hi>Pillory</hi> with that <hi>Pamphlet</hi> on my forehead
<hi>Dr. Still. against Dr. Still.</hi> for being guilty
of contradicting my self, would satisfie <hi>I. W.</hi>
and his Friends; This I suppose was the
meaning of <hi>stopping my mouth for ever,</hi> when
this Answer was to come out. But now I
perceive it is so dangerous a thing, I had best
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50175:53"/>
stand upon my defence, and utterly deny that I
have contradicted my self in any thing, in
which <hi>I. W.</hi> hath charged me.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> To make it then out that this is a
groundless charge, I must go through the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
particulars insisted on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is in the <hi>charge of Idolatry;</hi>
               <note place="margin">No contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction about the charge of Idolatry.</note> but
how do I contradict my self about this? had
I vindicated the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Idolatry</hi>
in my <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Arch-bishop Laud,</hi> this had
been indeed to contradict my self: but this is
not so much as pretended; and if it were, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more easily confuted; for in
that very Book, as it falls out very happily,
there is a discourse to the same purpose,
proving the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rational Account. p. 596, 606.</note> in <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> and <hi>the
worship of Images,</hi> and that the <hi>Heathen,</hi> in
the worship of inferiour <hi>Deities</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi>
might be excused on the same grounds that
those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Here is then no appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in terms; and it is only pretended
to be by consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> from yielding <hi>that
the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>and we do not differ in
Fundamental points, and that the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>is therefore a true Church; from whence
he inferrs, that it cannot be guilty of Idolatry:
because to teach that, would be a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
errour, and inconsistent with the Being of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50175:53"/>
a true Church: and therefore to charge the
Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with Idolatry, and to allow
it to be a true Church is a contradiction.</hi>
This is the substance of what he saith upon
this head: to which I shall answer by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1. That this way of answering is very
disingenuous. 2. That it is Sophistical, and
proves not the thing which he intends.</p>
            <p>1. That it is a disingenuous way; because
he barely opposes a <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>charity</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their <hi>Church,</hi> to a <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
concerning the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>actions,</hi> without
at all examining the force of those reasons
which are produced in the <hi>Book</hi> he pretends
to answer. Can <hi>I. W.</hi> imagine, that any one
who enquires into the safest way for his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hears the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> charged
with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in her worship, by arguments
drawn from the plain <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense of mankind, the repugnancy of
their way of worship to the conceptions we
ought to have of the divine nature, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the ancient Christian Church, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the case in many respects with the
Heathen Idolaters, should presently conclude,
that all these arguments are of no force, meerly
because the person who made use of them, had
upon another occasion judged so <hi>charitably</hi> of
that <hi>Church,</hi> as to suppose it still to retain the
<hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>true Church?</hi> I will put a case
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50175:54"/>
paralled to this; suppose one of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Iudah</hi> should have call'd the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in
the time of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> a <hi>true Church,</hi> because they
acknowledged the true <hi>God,</hi> and did believe an
agreement in that common acknowledgement
to be sufficient to preserve the <hi>essentials</hi> of a
<hi>Church</hi> among them; and afterwards the
same person should go about to convince the
<hi>ten Tribes</hi> of their <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worshipping <hi>God,</hi>
by the <hi>Calves of Dan and Bethel:</hi> would this
be thought a sufficient way of answering him,
to say, that <hi>he contradicted himself, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them a true Church and yet charging them
with Idolatry?</hi> whereas the only true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
would be, that he thought some
kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> consistent with the Being of
a <hi>Church.</hi> Might not such a person justly
say, that they made a very ill use of his
<hi>charity,</hi> when he supposed only that kind of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> which implyes more Gods than one,
to <hi>unchurch</hi> a people; but however, those
persons were more concerned to vindicate
themselves from <hi>Idolatry</hi> of any kind, than he
was to defend his charitable opinion of them;
and if they could prove to him, that this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sort of Idolatry does <hi>unchurch</hi> them as
well as the grosser, the consequence of it
would be that his <hi>charity</hi> must be so much the
less, but their danger would be the same.
This is just our case with the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50175:54"/>
               <hi>Rome;</hi> we acknowledge that they still retain
the Fundamental articles of the <hi>Christian</hi> faith,
that there is no dispute between them and us
about the true <hi>God</hi> and his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
as to his death, resurrection, glory, and being
the proper object of divine worship; we
yield that they have true <hi>Baptism</hi> among them,
in the name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy
Ghost;</hi> and we looking upon these as the
<hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>true Church,</hi> do upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
own that Church to be so: but then
we charge the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with gross cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
that Worship which is proper to the
divine nature, by her <hi>worship of Images, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Host,</hi> and <hi>Invocation of Saints;</hi>
which being done, not in express terms against
the worship of the true God, but by consequence,
we do not think this doth destroy the <hi>Being</hi>
of a <hi>Church</hi> among them; although it makes
the salvation of persons in her communion
extreamly hazardous: and after we have gone
about to prove this by many and weighty
arguments, is it reasonable for any one to tell
us that we contradict our selves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our arguments do signifie nothing? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in truth, here is no appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to that which is our own sense in
this matter. For what shadow of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is it, to say, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is
a <hi>true Church,</hi> and yet is guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:50175:55"/>
supposing that we believe some sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi>
which is very sinful, not to be yet of so high
a nature as to <hi>unchurch</hi> those who practise it;
And we choose the Instance of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi>
for the ground of this charity. If they can
prove that all sorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> do necessarily
destroy the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is, we must have less charity for them,
than we had before; And such a concession
from us doth not shew their guilt to be less, but
only our charity to be greater. Suppose a man
should exceed in his charity towards a person
guilty of some grievous faults, and say, he
believes he may be a pious man for all this;
but withall severely reproves him for his faults,
and tells him the danger he continually runs
by such actions; would it be fair for such a
man to answer him, that his reproofs were not
to be regarded, because he contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for he told him he believed him to be a
pious man, and yet upbraided him with those
faults which were inconsistent with piety?
what would the consequence of this be to the
thing it self? would this make those faults
ever the less, because he judged so charitably
of the person notwithstanding his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them? But when we allow the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>a true Church,</hi> we are far from
understanding by that a <hi>sound</hi> or a <hi>good</hi>
Church free from corruptions, which would be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50175:55"/>
the most proper sense to found a contradiction
upon, in this matter of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but we
mean no more by it, than as a man is a <hi>true
man</hi> though he hath the <hi>plague</hi> upon him;
those which we account the <hi>essentials</hi> of a
<hi>Church</hi> we deny not to it, but withall, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it is over-run with such corruptions
in worship, as do mightily endanger the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those who live in the communion of it.</p>
            <p>2. Having thus discovered the <hi>disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi>
of making so bad a use of our <hi>charity</hi>
against us, I now come to shew how <hi>Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
this way of answering is,<note place="margin">§. 2. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical cavils in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> by a closer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The starting of a new objection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
no argument, and all that this amounts
to is only raising a new difficulty; whereas he
ought in the first place to have answered all
the arguments I had brought to prove them
guilty of Idolatry; and when he had done
this fairly and plainly (which for some good
reasons he had no mind to do) he might then
have insisted on the inconsistency of it with
principles owned by me; but to do this without
giving an answer, so much as to any one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a clear evidence of a sophistical and
cavilling humour, rather than of any intention
to satisfie an inquisitive mind.</p>
            <p>2. The force of this objection lyes in the
different sense and meaning of several expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50175:56"/>
made use of by him, which being explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the objection will signifie nothing. For if
we rightly understand the notion of Idolatry,
the manner of teaching it, the sense of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
errours and a true Church, as it is
owned by me, the very appearance of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
vanisheth.</p>
            <p>I agree in the general, that <hi>the true notion
of Idolatry is, giving the honour due only
to God to a meer creature;</hi> and I desire no
greater advantage against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
than from such a concession; but then we are
to understand, that this may be done several
ways. 1. When the worship proper to the
<hi>true God</hi> is given to a <hi>false</hi> God. 2. When
the true <hi>God</hi> is acknowledged and worshipped,
but the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>God-head</hi> is denyed, and
many <hi>false Gods</hi> are joyned with him in the
same worship. In these two sorts of <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
I acknowledge that the <hi>true God</hi> is rejected,
either wholly in the first way, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the second. But withall I say, that
the giving the Worship to a creature which is
due only to <hi>God</hi> may be consistent with the
acknowledgement of one <hi>Supream God,</hi> and
that these ways. 1. When one <hi>Supream God</hi>
is acknowledged, but no difference is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the external Worship of him and
creatures. This was the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the
wiser <hi>Heathen,</hi> who did in their consciences
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50175:56"/>
acknowledge that there was but one true and
supream <hi>God,</hi> but yet gave the same worship
to inferiour <hi>Deities,</hi> that they did to him.
These men might have pleaded for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for all that I know, as much to
their advantage, as those of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> do against me. 2. When the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
proper to the true God is given to an
Image: or the supposing of <hi>God</hi> to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured by us, by prostrating our selves
before any corporeal representation of him.
This likewise the Heathen were guilty of.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath long since told us of some,
<hi>who profess that they know God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>but in works
they deny him;</hi> so there may be some who may
profess a worship <hi>due only to God,</hi> but in
their actions may contradict it. As suppose a
company of rebellious men, should declare
over and over that they acknowledge but <hi>one
Soveraign Power</hi> of this Nation, invested in
the person of the <hi>King;</hi> but yet, should take
upon themselves to raise forces, to appoint
great Officers of State, and require that the
very same outward reverence and honour be
given to them, which is given to the <hi>King</hi>
himself; would any man in his sense say, that
because these men still declared the supream
Authority to be in the King, that there was no
<hi>Treason</hi> in such actions? or that those persons
contradicted themselves, who allowed that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50175:57"/>
their profession was such as became good
subjects, but their actions made them guilty
of <hi>Treason.</hi> The same we say of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome;</hi> we confess they own the supream
Power of the world to be in one <hi>true God,</hi>
and we have no controversie with them about
the essential Doctrines of Religion (which is,
that we mean by their being <hi>a true Church)</hi>
but withal we say, they overthrow what
they say in their own practice, they rob <hi>God</hi>
of the honour due only to him, by giving it
to <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> and other
creatures. And what contradiction now is
there in all this, and a <hi>Church</hi> agreeing
with us in the object of worship in general,
should act contrary to its own profession, by
requiring those things to be done, which
take away from <hi>God</hi> that honour which is
due only to him, and giving it to creatures?
And this, if I understand it, is all that this
first contradiction in the charge of Idolatry
doth amount to.</p>
            <p>To appply this now to his own <hi>propositions,</hi>
for the greater clearness and satisfaction of all
indifferent persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">§. 3. A distinct answer to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>His first Proposition I agree to, viz. <hi>That
'tis an article of faith, and a Fundamental
point of Religion, that the honour which is
due only to God is not to be given to a meer
creature.</hi> But I desire it may be taken notice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50175:57"/>
of, that this <hi>proposition</hi> is <hi>Sophistically</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
for although it be no dispute between
us, whether that <hi>honour which is due only to
God, may be given to a creature,</hi> yet it is a
very great one, and the foundation of the
charge of Idolatry, <hi>what that honour is which
is due only to God:</hi> and in case we can prove
that they do give to meer Creatures any part
of that <hi>honour</hi> which is <hi>due to God,</hi> it cannot
at all excuse them to say, <hi>that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it to be Idolatry to give that honour,
which they suppose to be due only to God, to a
meer creature.</hi> This <hi>proposition</hi> therefore,
though in it self true, is captiously set down,
and with an intention only to deceive unwary
readers, as will appear by the next proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To teach Idolatry is to err against the
formentioned article of faith and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
point of Religion;</hi> i. e. <hi>to teach Idolatry,
is to teach that the honour which is due
only to God is to be given to a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
That this is to teach <hi>Idolatry,</hi> no one
questions; but our question is, Whether they
who do not teach this <hi>Proposition,</hi> may not
teach men to do those things, whereby the
worship due only to <hi>God</hi> will be given to a
meer creature? If he can prove, that they
who do not in terms declare that they do not
dishonour <hi>God</hi> cannot dishonour him; if he can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50175:58"/>
demonstrate, that those who do not teach <hi>that
the honour which is due only to God is
to be given to a creature,</hi> cannot possibly by
any actions of theirs rob him of that honour
which is due to him: this will be much more
to his purpose than any thing he hath yet
said. And this <hi>proposition,</hi> if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
as he ought to have done, should not
have been a particular <hi>affirmative</hi> but an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<hi>Negative;</hi> For it is not enough to say,
that <hi>to teach Idolatry is to teach that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which is due only to God is to be given
to a creature,</hi> but that <hi>No Church which doth
not teach this can be guilty of Idolatry;</hi> for
his design being to clear the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
his <hi>Proposition</hi> ought to be so framed that all
particulars may be comprehended under it.
But because he may say, <hi>his immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was, not to clear their Church from
Idolatry, but to accuse me of a contradiction,</hi>
I proceed to the next Proposition.</p>
            <p>3. A Church that does not err against any
article of faith, nor against any Fundamental
point of Religion, does not teach Idolatry. <hi>This
proposition is likewise very</hi> Sophistical <hi>and</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
<hi>for by</hi> article of faith and fundamental
point of Religion <hi>is either understood,</hi> the main
fundamental points of doctrine contained in the
Apostles Creed, <hi>and then I affirm, that a</hi> Church
<hi>which doth own all the Fundamentals of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50175:58"/>
may be guilty of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>and teach
those things, wherein it lyes; but if by</hi> not
erring against any article of faith, <hi>be meant,</hi>
that a Church which doth not err at all in
matters of Religion <hi>cannot teach</hi> Idolatry, <hi>the
Proposition is</hi> true, <hi>but</hi> impertinent.</p>
            <p>4. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach
Veneration of Images, adoration of the Host, and
Invocation of Saints, <hi>is agreed on both sides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>That the Roman Church does not err
against any article of faith or Fundamental
point of Religion;</hi> This being that concession
of ours, from whence all the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is taken, must be explained according
to our own sense of it, and not according to
that which he puts upon it; which that it may
be better understood, I shall both shew in what
sense this concession is made by us, as to the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and of what force it is in
this present debate.</p>
            <p>For the clearer understanding in what sense
it is made by us, we are to consider the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the Controversie about <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
between us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 4. In what sense the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is owned by us as a true Church.</note>
which ought to be taken from that <hi>Book</hi> to
which he referrs. There we find the occasion
of it to be, the <hi>Romanists</hi> contending that all
points defined by the <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Fundamental,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rational Account. <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note>
or <hi>necessary to salvation,</hi> on the account of
such a <hi>Definition;</hi> upon this the controversie
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50175:59"/>
about <hi>Fundamentals</hi> was managed against
them, with a design to prove that all things
defined by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are not <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi>
or <hi>necessary to be believed</hi> by all
persons in order to their salvation, because
they were so defined. To this purpose I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
1. What the grounds are, on which
any thing doth become necessary to salvation?
2. Whether any thing whose matter is not
necessary, and is not required by an absolute
command in <hi>Scripture,</hi> can by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
afterwards become necessary? 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Church</hi> hath power, by any proposition
or definition, to make anything become necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to salvation, and to be believed as such, which
was not so before? For the <hi>first,</hi> I proposed
two things. 1. What things are necessary to
the salvation of men as such, or considered in
their single or private capacities? 2. What
things are necessary to be owned in order to
salvation by <hi>Christian Societies,</hi> or as the
bonds and conditions of <hi>Ecclesiastical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?</hi>
For the resolving of this I laid
down these three Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. That the very being of a <hi>Church,</hi> doth
suppose the necessity of what is required to be
believed in order to salvation.</p>
            <p>2. Whatever <hi>Church</hi> owns those things,
which are antecedently necessary to the <hi>Being</hi>
of a <hi>Church,</hi> cannot so long cease to be a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50175:59"/>
true <hi>Church.</hi> And here I expresly distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> and
those things which were required to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi>
or soundness of it, among which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I reckoned the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the way
prescribed by him.</p>
            <p>3. That the Union of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
depended upon the agreement of it in things
antecedently necessary to its being. From
hence I proceeded to shew, that nothing ought
to be owned as necessary to Salvation by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Societies, but such things which by all
those Societies are acknowledged antecedently
necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
And here I distinguished between <hi>necessary
articles of faith,</hi> and <hi>particular agreements
for the Churches peace.</hi> I did not therefore
deny, but that it was in the power of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches, to require a <hi>Subscription</hi> to <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion,</hi> opposite to the errours and
abuses which they reformed; but I denyed it
to be in the power of any <hi>Church</hi> to make
those things necessary articles of faith, which
were not so before. And here it was I
shewed the moderation of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> above that of <hi>Rome;</hi> in that our
<hi>Church</hi> makes <hi>no articles of faith,</hi> but such
as have the testimony and approbation of the
whole Christian world of all Ages, and are
acknowledged to be such by <hi>Rome</hi> it self:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50175:60"/>
but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> imposeth <hi>new
articles of faith,</hi> to be believed as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation; as appears by the <hi>Bull</hi>
of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. This is my plain meaning,
which half-witted men have stretched and
abused to several ill purposes: but not to
wander from my present subject, what is it
that <hi>I. W.</hi> can hence infer to his purpose?
<hi>viz.</hi> that from hence it follows that the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> does not erre <hi>against any article of
faith, or any point necessary to salvation;</hi>
which if it be only meant of those <hi>essential
points of faith,</hi> which I suppose antecedently
necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> I deny it
not, but do not see of what use this concession
can be to them in the present debate: since in
the following Discourse I made the <hi>ancient
Creeds of the Catholick Church</hi> the best mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of those things, which were believed to
be necessary to salvation: so that the force of
the argument comes to this, whatsoever <hi>Church</hi>
does embrace the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> cannot be
guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth embrace all the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> by my
own concession, therefore it is a contradiction
for me to grant that they hold the <hi>ancient
Creeds,</hi> and yet to charge them with <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
And these matters being thus made plain,
there is no great difficulty to answer, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the <hi>major Proposition,</hi> and asserting that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50175:60"/>
a <hi>Church</hi> which does own all the articles of
faith which are contained in them, may yet
teach and practise those things, which take
away from that worship which is proper only
to God, and give it to meer creatures; as I have
proved the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth in <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images, adoration of the Host,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints.</hi> But to make this yet
more plain, there are two things we consider
in a <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>essence,</hi> and the <hi>soundness</hi> of
it; as in a man, we consider his <hi>being</hi> a man
and his <hi>health:</hi> when we discourse of his
meer Being, we enquire into no more than
those things which make him a man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be sound or not: so in a <hi>Church,</hi>
when we enquire into the <hi>essentials</hi> of it, we
think it not necessary to go any farther than
the doctrinal points of faith; the reason is,
because <hi>Baptism</hi> admits men into the <hi>Church</hi>
upon the profession of the true <hi>faith</hi> in the
<hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and whatever
is sufficient to make a member of the <hi>Church,</hi>
that is in it self sufficient, being embraced, to
make a <hi>Church;</hi> but when we enquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the <hi>moral integrity,</hi> or <hi>soundness</hi> of
a <hi>Church,</hi> then we think our selves bound,
not barely to know what is acknowledged
and received, but how far it is so; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>Church</hi> which owns the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Christian faith, doth not by gross
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50175:61"/>
and damnable errours corrupt the Worship
of God, and debauch those very Principles
which they profess to own. And in this
respect none of us ever said, <hi>That the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>did not err;</hi> nay we do say and
have manifestly proved, that she hath erred
against the Christian faith, by introducing
palpable errours in doctrine, and manifold Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions
and Idolatries in practice. From
hence it plainly appears, that the concession
<hi>I. W.</hi> urges me with of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
being <hi>a true Church</hi> signifies nothing, in the
sense by me intended, which contradicts the
charge of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> unless they can prove
that none who own the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> or
their <hi>Baptism,</hi> can so long as they so do, teach
Idolatry, or be guilty of giving the honour due
only to God to meer creatures. These things
being thus explained, I hope the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of
this way of arguing is made so evident, that
no man of understanding, that resolves not
before hand what to believe, is capable of
being deceived by it.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the next contradiction
charged upon me,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> I shall for the diversion of
the Reader,<note place="margin">His <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> and the suitableness of the matter,
take notice of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> wherein <hi>I. W.</hi>
goes about so pleasantly to prove me an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by a notable trick, which it seems came
into his head a little too late, after he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50175:61"/>
this worthy Treatise. I should have
suspected it had been intended only for a
piece of <hi>Drollery,</hi> but that the man so severely
rebukes me for it, and withall talks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than <hi>demonstration</hi> in the case.
What? (thought I) is it come to this at last?
and am I become an Idolater too, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
apt to think my self enclined so much as to
superstition? but what can not the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Wit of man do, upon second and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thoughts? All the comfort I found left
was towards the conclusion, wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
<hi>that the same argument proves the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St.</hi> against Dr. <hi>St. p.</hi> 21.</note>
               <hi>Evangelists and Holy Ghost himself to
be Idolaters;</hi> Nay then, I hoped there was no
great harm to be feared in so good company;
and by that consideration armed my self
against this terrible assault. But at last as he
made nearer approaches to me, I found no
mischief was like to come, but what I brought
upon my self; for he charged me with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but my own Artillery, and the train that
was laid to blow me up was fetched from my
own stores; only he had disposed it in a way
fittest for this deep design. But the best of
it was, his plot went no farther than <hi>my</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and both lay only in <hi>Imagination.</hi> For
there he makes the seat of my <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which
he demonstratively proves must be so by my
own argument. I shall therefore conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what that was, and with what great art he
imploys it against me. Among other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to shew that the prohibition of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<hi>Images</hi> was not peculiar to the <hi>Iews,</hi>
but of an unalterable nature, I insisted upon
<hi>Gods</hi> declaring the unsuitableness of it to his

               <hi>To whom will ye liken God?

from hence I shewed, that the wisest Nations
and Persons among the Heathen looked on
the Worship of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Images,</hi> as unsuitable
to a Divine and Infinite Being, and that the
<hi>Gospel</hi> still more discovered <hi>Gods</hi> Spiritual

briefly summed up by himself thus: <hi>Whoever
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50175:62"/>
Worships God represented in a way far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to his greatness is an Idolater; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Worships God represented to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Beatifical vision, either by words or
by imaginations as well as Images, he Worships
God in a way far inferiour to his greatness;</hi>
ergo, <hi>whoever worships God represented unto
him without the Beatifical vision is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but Dr.</hi> St. <hi>Worships God without the
Beatifical vision</hi> (no doubt of it) ergo, <hi>Dr.</hi> St.
<hi>is an Idolater:</hi> there is no help for it. Nay,
from hence he proves, <hi>that I cannot so much
as think of God without Idolatry my self,
nor Preach of him without provoking others
to it.</hi> O the insuperable force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the dint of demonstration! but the
mischief is, all this subtilty is used against the
<hi>Law-maker</hi> and not against me. Did I not
cite the words of <hi>God</hi> himself, who therefore
did forbid the making any likeness of him,
because nothing could be like him? Is there
no difference between having <hi>imperfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> in our minds, and making
<hi>unworthy representations</hi> of him to our senses,
with a design to worship them? Why did
not <hi>God</hi> as well forbid the one as he did
the other? Were the <hi>Israelites</hi> then <hi>in the
Beatifical vision?</hi> were their conceptions of
<hi>God</hi> suitable to his incomprehensible nature?
if not, why were they not forbidden as well
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50175:63"/>
to think of <hi>God</hi> as to make any <hi>Images</hi> of
him? Is <hi>God</hi> as much disparaged by the
necessary weakness of our understandings, as
by voluntarily false and corporeal <hi>Images</hi> of
him? Nay doth not <hi>God</hi> design to prevent
the errour of our <hi>Imaginations</hi> by such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
as those are? and thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to think worthily of him, and when
we pray to him, to consider him only as an
Infinite Being in his Nature and Attributes?
I do not know what <hi>Imaginations</hi> others have
of <hi>God;</hi> it may be those in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> measure all by themselves, and <hi>God</hi> by
their <hi>Images</hi> of him, and thence conclude, that
no men can think of <hi>God,</hi> but as they picture
him, like an <hi>Old man sitting in Heaven;</hi> but
I assure them, I never had such an <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of him, and if I had, should think it
very unworthy of him. I know no other
conception of <hi>God,</hi> but of a Being infinitely
perfect; and this is rather an intellectual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
than a material imagination of
him. I am assured that he is, by mighty
and convincing arguments, but to bring him
down to my <hi>Imagination,</hi> is to contradict the
evidence that I have of his <hi>Being;</hi> for the
same reasons which convince me that he is,
do likewise convince me that he is infinite
in power, and wisdom, and goodness. If I
thought otherwise of him, I should know no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50175:63"/>
reason to give him the Worship of my mind
and soul. Although my conceptions cannot
reach his greatness, yet they do not confine
it, nor willfully debase it; they do not bring
him down to the meanness of a Corporeal
Image. But because we cannot think highly
enough of <hi>God,</hi> must we therefore devise ways
to expose him to contempt and scorn? And
we cannot but despise a <hi>Deity</hi> to whom any
Image can be like. But such absurd and silly
arguments deserve no farther confutation.
<hi>They</hi> indeed may take more liberty, who write
to those who are bound not to judge of what
is writ, but only to cry it up. As for us, who
think it not fit to have our People in such
slavery, we dare not venture such idle stuff
among them.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to the second contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he charges me with,<note place="margin">§ 6.</note> which is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the danger of salvation which they
are lyable to who communicate with the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The second contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> when yet I acknowledge <hi>that

be a true way to salvation:</hi> and withall
<hi>Arch B.</hi> Laud, <hi>whom I defend, doth grant a
possibility of salvation to those in the Church
of</hi> Rome. The force of this contradiction
depending on these concessions, I shall,
1. Shew in what sense they are granted by
us. 2. Examin the strength of the <hi>propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50175:64"/>
he draws from hence, towards the making
this a contradiction.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning <hi>the Roman Church being a
true Church:</hi> The <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> Adversary
having falsely charged him with granting the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church to be <hi>a right Church,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of his injustice in it;<note place="margin">

                  </gap> p. 293.</note> and saith, <hi>that it
is a Church and a true Church he granted,
but not a right Church; for Truth only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the Being; right, perfection in conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
thus a Thief is a true man, though not
an upright man. So a corrupt Church may
be true, as a Church is a company of men
which profess the faith of Christ, and are
baptized into his name; but it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a right Church either in Doctrine or
Manners;</hi> and again saith, <hi>It is true in that
sense, as</hi> ens <hi>and</hi> verum, <hi>being and true, are
convertible one with another; and every
thing that hath a Being is truly that Being
which it is in truth of subtance.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer
to him,<note place="margin">P. 295.</note> saith, <hi>that the notion of a
Church implyes Integrity and Perfection of
conditions;</hi> upon which I gave him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That he did herein betray his weak or
willful mistakes of a Church <hi>morally</hi> for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysically
true.</hi> If he could prove it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for a <hi>Church</hi> to retain its <hi>Being</hi> that
hath any errours in doctrine, or corruptions
in practice, he would therein do something to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50175:64"/>
the purpose; but when he had done it, all
that he would get by it was, that then we
should not so much as acknowledge the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> to be <hi>Metaphysically</hi> a <hi>true
Church;</hi> and therefore the Reader is left to
judge, whether his Lordships Charity for, or his
Testimony against their Church was built
upon better grounds. By this it is evident in
what sense it was granted, that the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> was a <hi>true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Concerning possibility of salvation in
that Church; <hi>To the question that was asked
my</hi> Lord <hi>of</hi> Canterbury, whether a person
might be saved in the Roman faith?<note place="margin">Arch B. La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. p. 280.</note> 
               <hi>he gives
this Answer,</hi> that the Ignorant that could not
discern the errours of that Church, so they
held the Foundation and conformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a Religious life might be saved:<note place="margin">P. 282.</note> 
               <hi>and
after explains himself more fully,</hi> that <hi>might
be saved</hi> grants but a possibility, no sure or
safe way of salvation; the possibility, I think,
<hi>saith he,</hi> cannot be denyed to the Ignorants,
especially because they hold the Foundation and
cannot survey the building. And the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
can deceive no man that rests upon
it: But a secure way they cannot go, that hold
with such corruptions when they know them.<note place="margin">P. 285.</note>
               <hi>And again,</hi> Many Protestants indeed confess,
there is salvation possible to be attained in
the Roman Church; but yet they say withall,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50175:65"/>
that the errours of that Church are so many,
(and some so great, as weaken the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that it is very hard to go that way to
Heaven, especially to them that have had the
truth manifested.<note place="margin">P. 299.</note> 
               <hi>And in another place,</hi> I do
indeed for my part (leaving other men free
to their own judgement) acknowledge a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of salvation in the Roman Church:
but so as that which I grant to Romanists,
is not as they are Romanists, but as they are
Christians, that is, as they believe the Creed,
and hold the Foundation Christ himself, not
as they associate themselves wittingly and
knowingly to the gross Superstitions of the
Roman Church. And I am willing to hope
there are many among them, which keep
within that Church, and yet wish the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
abolished which they know, and which
pray to God to forgive their errours in what
they know not, and which hold the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
firm and live accordingly, and would
have all things amended that are amiss, were
it in their power. And to such I dare not
deny a possibility of salvation, for that which
is Christs in them, though they hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
extreamly, by keeping so close to that
which is Superstition, and in the case of Images
comes too near Idolatry.<note place="margin">Rational Account. p. 622.</note> 
               <hi>These are my</hi>
Lord of Canterburies <hi>own words, and laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in my</hi> Defence <hi>of him, which</hi> I. W.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50175:65"/>
               <hi>ought to have represented, if he had designed
any thing but <hi>Sophistry</hi> and trifling. But his
game had been then quite spoiled; the fine
sport of making contradictions had been
lost, and his cross purposes had come to
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to see what <hi>contradictions</hi> he
wire-draws from hence by the help of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whoever is in a condition, wherein he
is certainly saved, is in no danger or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of being damned.</hi> If by <hi>he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
saved,</hi> he speaks of the <hi>event,</hi> then
he were a hard hearted man that would not
grant, that he that is actually saved <hi>is in no
danger or probability of being damned;</hi> if
he means it <hi>of a certain way to salvation,</hi> then
it is yet capable of several meanings. For <hi>to
be in a certain way</hi> may imply one of these
three things. 1. That the way it self is so
plain that a man cannot miss of it. 2. Or
that the way is in it self certain, but there are
so many by-paths and turnings lying hard by
it, that it is a very hard matter for any man
to keep in it. 3. <hi>To be in a certain way,</hi> is,
when not only the way it self is certain, but a
man keeps constantly in that way. According to
these several senses this Proposition may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
if by it be meant. 1. <hi>He that is in a
certain way to salvation, is in no danger or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50175:66"/>
probability of being damned, i. e.</hi> he that
keeps constantly in that way which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
lead him to Heaven, the Proposition is
true, but impertinent; but if by it be meant
no more but this, <hi>that he is in a way which in
it self leads to Heaven, but there are so many
cross and by-paths near it, that though it be
possible for him to hit it, yet it is extreamly
hazardous,</hi> no one can imagine that such a
one is in no probability of miscarrying, for we
say he is in very great danger of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the tendency of the way it self.</p>
            <p>2. Prop. <hi>Whoever lives and dyes in a true
way to salvation, having conformed to its
directions, or whoever has done all that was
necessary to attain unto salvation is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
wherein he is certainly saved.</hi> The
<hi>Sophistry</hi> of this is so palpable, that the
weakest eye may discern it; for it supposes
that <hi>true way</hi> to salvation wherein he lives to
be a <hi>very safe</hi> and <hi>secure way, i. e.</hi> that it be
not only true in it self, but free from such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and corruptions which may endanger
salvation; and in that sense it is <hi>true,</hi> but very
far from the purpose. For none of us did
ever yield that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is a <hi>safe way</hi>
to salvation; nay it is expresly denyed by
my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as well as by me.
But here lyes still another piece of <hi>Sophistry</hi>
to be taken notice of, <hi>whoever hath done all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50175:66"/>
that was necessary to attain salvation, is in
a condition wherein he is certainly saved;</hi>
no doubt of it; but the doing all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation is not bare believing the
necessary articles of faith, contained in the
Creed, but obeying the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which
cannot be done by those who wilfully adhere
to gross and open violations of it; as I have
charged the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to do, in her so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
acts of Worship. Their cause certainly
is at a very low ebb when such pittiful <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,</hi>
must pass for reasoning and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among them. Never men had more need
of a <hi>self-evidencing cause,</hi> as well as <hi>propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
than they; so little help do they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it by their Writings.</p>
            <p>3 Prop. <hi>The Roman Church is a true way to
salvation, and teaches all that is necessary to
attain unto it. This is granted,</hi> he saith, <hi>by
me and other Protestants, when we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Roman Church to be a true Church;</hi>
but in what sense, I have already explained,
so far as to leave no colour of arguing from
hence to any contradiction in me. For this
<hi>true way to salvation</hi> in our sense is no more,
but that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
so much of Christian faith, as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to save men, on condition they live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and do not by gross corruptions in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or practice render that faith ineffectual
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50175:67"/>
to them: but withall we assert and maintain,
that to these necessary articles of Christian
faith, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath added such
errours and corruptions, as make the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any person extreamly hazardous, who
lives in the communion of it. And let them
have all the comfort from hence which they
can, I am sure they have not this, that they
have brought me to contradict my self by such
concessions as these.</p>
            <p>By this, his last Proposition comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<hi>whoever lives and dyes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Roman Church, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to her doctrine, lives and dyes in a
true way to salvation having conformed to
its directions, and has done all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to attain to it.</hi> Which evidently
supposes that we yield that the doctrine of the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> is <hi>a safe way</hi> to salvation,
which we utterly deny; all that we assert is,
that so much of the common Principles of
Christianity, as is retained in the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> is sufficient for the salvation of those,
who do not wilfully corrupt them by bad opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and practices, or if they have, do repent
sincerely. But for those who conform themselvs
to the doctrine and directions of the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> as such, we are far from ever saying that
<hi>such live and dye in a true way to salvation;</hi>
for this were to make those doctrines and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50175:67"/>
directions to be as holy and innocent as we
believe them to be false and pernicious. See
now what a contradiction here is; for me to
assert the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>a true Church,</hi>
because it retains the Fundamentals of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
and yet to make the condition of those
who live in it so hazardous in point of salvation,
by reason of the gross errours, which men are
bound to believe as necessary points of faith;
and horrible Superstitions which they must
conform to, if they follow her directions.
Surely he could not but know this to be our
meaning, and consequently to have no shadow
of contradiction in it, no more than is in this
plain <hi>Proposition, That a possible way to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may yet be very dangerous.</hi> But though
<hi>Iugglers</hi> know their own cheats, they would
lose their trade if they made them known to
the people. Something must be said to amuse
<hi>them,</hi> and this seemed the prettiest way, to
confound them, by dazeling their eyes with such
appearances of contradictions: and thereby
to perswade their own party, that they need
not fear the the attaque of such an enemy
who falls foul upon himself. But it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the mist he casts before their eyes, can
make any have such an imagination; it is but
making things clear, and then nothing but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and agreement appears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50175:68"/>
But yet he quarrels with me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> against <hi>St.</hi> p. 7.</note> for <hi>making
the case of living in willful sin and in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Roman Church parallel with
each other; 1. because I will not grant that
a willful sin, such as adultery, to be a true way
to Heaven;</hi> and doth he think that I ever
imagined <hi>Idolatry</hi> and gross superstition to be
so; If I grant that in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
they have a <hi>true way to Heaven,</hi> it is as
other debauched Christians have, who own
faith enough to save them, but their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes from not living agreeably to it.
2. <hi>Because I grant more to them than to Iews
or Pagans, yet they may be saved if they do
repent.</hi> True, but they are not in so great
likelyhood of <hi>repenting,</hi> as those who own the
Fundamental articles of the Christian faith,
and have a sincere desire in general to serve
God according to his will; the Grace of God
being more plentiful, where the Christian
faith is owned, than where it is rejected; upon
which account <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> are in more
danger of not repenting, and consequently of
salvation than those that live in the <hi>Roman
Church. 3. Because I grant a greater ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of salvation to Roman Catholicks than
they do to Protestants; but they do not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and a vertuous sincere mind, which desires to
know &amp; do the will of God may be sufficient, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a particular repentance of all known
miscarriages; but they say such a repentacne
is necessary for us, as does imply a disowning
our <hi>Church,</hi> as such wherein no salvation is to
be had, and a joyning with the Communion of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore the question
about their charity and ours, is about the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of the salvation of persons living and
dying in the <hi>communion</hi> of either <hi>Church;</hi>
We say on the conditions before mentioned,
men may be saved, though they do not in terms
renounce their communion, but they say that
none who do not return to their communion
can be saved; and in this we justly charge
them with horrible uncharitableness, when
many of their Writers allow a greater possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of salvation to meer Heathens. 4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Arch-bishop</hi> Laud <hi>grants a greater capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of salvation than other Protestants;</hi> but
in what sense I have already shewed. 5. <hi>That
this is in effect to say, that it is a true way
to Heaven if they go out of it.</hi> Not if they
go out of it so far as it is true, but so far only
as it is false and dangerous. If a man were
going the right way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> as
far as <hi>Stamford,</hi> and there went quite out of
his way into the <hi>Fens,</hi> here his life is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
if I should tell this man that the way
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50175:69"/>
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York</hi> was <hi>a certain way,</hi> that
the way he went in as far as <hi>Stamford</hi> was
a <hi>true way,</hi> and if he had kept in it, would
have brought him to <hi>York,</hi> but the <hi>way</hi> he is
now in is very <hi>dangerous,</hi> and if he does not
return, his life is in perpetual hazard; is this
all one as if I should tell him, <hi>while you were
in the true way, you must go out of it?</hi> No
such sense can be put upon such words, by any
man that hath sense; and for others, we give
them leave to cry <hi>nonsense</hi> and <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All his other petty objections run upon the
same palpable mistake,<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> and it would be but
repeating the same thing to answer the other
remaining cavils upon this Argument.</p>

What? they; the sober, the judicious, the
wise people of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> turned
<hi>Fanaticks!</hi> it's false, it's impossible; nay, it
is absolutely and utterly impossible to be true;
and none but <hi>Atheists</hi> can charge them with
it. This hath been their common way of
answering to this new charge; but not one
wise word hath been said in a just Vindication
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50175:69"/>
of themselves, by giving answer to those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
plain, and undenyable Instances I have
produced. I wished for no other tryal than
to be bound to bring forth their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and to make good the Authorities I had
cited, and my fidelity therein; but they have
fairly declined this way of tryal. But how
then can they free themselves from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation?
we have men of art to deal with,
and it is some pleasure to observe the skill
they use in warding off a blow they did not
look for. But if they have nothing more to
say then <hi>I. W.</hi> can help them to, the charge
will stick the faster, for his attempt to clear
them of it.</p>
            <p>He begins with a description of <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 8.</note>
               <hi>which,</hi> he saith, <hi>doth necessarily contain
a resistance of authority;</hi> and for this, very
unhappily quotes my own words. <hi>By Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism
we understand either an Enthusiastick
way af Religion, or resisting authority under
pretence of Religion;</hi> just as if one should say
the true notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> implyes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the true God, and to prove it should
quote words of mine to this purpose, That
Idolatry is either renouncing the true God,
or worshipping the true God by an Image:
for as in that case, it is evident, I make two
sorts of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> so it is as plain in this, that
I make two branches of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> whereof
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50175:70"/>
the one is, <hi>an Enthusiastick way of Religion,</hi> the
other <hi>resistance of authority under the pretence
of Religion.</hi> But if this be the true notion of
<hi>Fanaticism,</hi> why doth he not speak one word
in vindication of them, from that very kind
of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which I had charged them to
be so deeply guilty of? Had I not proved
by plain testimonies, that the most <hi>Fanatick</hi>
principles of Rebellion were owned by the
Jesuitical party among them?<note place="margin">Fanaticism of Rom. Church. s. 16. p. 299. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

only so but to take away his life too?</hi> Had I
not proved by clear and late Instances, that
the party which owns these principles is
to this day the most countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
at <hi>Rome?</hi> and any honest men
among them, as to these principles, are on that
account hated and persecuted, as <hi>P. W.</hi> and
his <hi>Brethren.</hi> But why no answer to this
charge? These are things they cannot deny,
and yet dare not confess them to be true. If
<hi>I. W.</hi> answer again, let him speak out like
a man, and either confess and detest these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or we shall charge them farther with
this worst and most dangerous sort of <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.</hi>
My duty and just zeal for his <hi>Majesties</hi>
interest and security, will not suffer me to let
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50175:70"/>
go this part of the charge against them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they would fain have it passed over in
silence, as though never a word had been said
concerning it. This is one of the best arts I have
met with in this Pamphlet; for unwary Readers
will not remember the charge, when they find
no answer: but if <hi>I. W.</hi> had attempted to
answer it, his shuffling and tricks might have
made the deeper impression in the Readers
minds. Remember then this charge stands
good against them, without so much as their
pretending to answer it.</p>
            <p>To come now to the other part of <hi>Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,</hi>
viz. <hi>an Enthusiastick way of Religion:</hi> and
here to proceed clearly, I shall lay down the
method of his <hi>Defence,</hi> and then examine it.
The strength of his <hi>Defence</hi> lyes in these
<hi>Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That Fanaticism does necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a resistance against authority.</p>
            <p>2. No particular ways of Religion, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by a competent authority, are Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.</p>
            <p>3. Those things which concern religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Method of Devotion, which I charge
them with, are countenanced by a competent
authority, <hi>viz.</hi> The Authority of that Church.</p>
            <p>4. That Church cannot countenance Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
which obligeth all persons to submit to her
judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50175:71"/>
So that here are two Principles by which
<hi>I. W.</hi> thinks to vindicate their <hi>Church</hi> from
<hi>Fanaticism;</hi> viz. <hi>competent authority,</hi> and
<hi>submission of judgement to the Church.</hi> To
shew the invalidity of this answer, I shall do
these things.</p>
            <p>1. Shew the insufficiency of it.</p>
            <p>2. The monstrous absurdities consequent
upon it.</p>
            <p>1. If this answer were <hi>sufficient,</hi> he must
make it appear, that there have been none
charged by me as <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in their <hi>Church,</hi>
but such as have submitted themselves and
their judgement to the authority of their
<hi>Church.</hi> For let us consider the occasion of
this charge, and we shall presently discern the
insufficiency of this way of answering it. The
occasion was, that my Adversary made all the
<hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Fanaticisms</hi> among us to be the
effect of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> what answer
could be more proper in this case, than to shew,
that there were as wild and extravagant <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticisms</hi>
before, as have been since? which is
a plain evidence <hi>that</hi> cannot be the cause of
them, to which they imputed them. To
make this out, I searched into the several sorts
of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> and gave instances very clear
of as great <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in the times before the
reformation, as have been since: from the
many pretenders to immediate Revelations
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50175:71"/>
among them, who were persons allowed and
approved by their Church, and some of them
<hi>Canonized</hi> for <hi>Saints;</hi> but besides these, I
gave such other Instances of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> among
the <hi>Friers,</hi> and others of their <hi>Church,</hi> as were
never heard of in the world before; as the
broachers and maintainers of the <hi>Friers Gospel,</hi>
which was to put out of doors the <hi>Gospel</hi> of
<hi>Christ;</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Brethren</hi> of the order of
S. <hi>Francis</hi> called by several names, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that of <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> who continued long,
spread far, and more distrubed the <hi>Church</hi>
than any since have done, the <hi>Dulcinistae</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Alumbrado's</hi> in <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> What
doth he now say concerning all these? were
these countenanced by a <hi>competent authority</hi>
among them? <hi>did they submit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Church?</hi> if neither of these be
pretended in reference to them, then this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
must be very insufficient, because it doth
not reach to the matter in charge.</p>
            <p>2. For those who were as he saith, <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by authority, and did submit themselves
to the Church,</hi> yet this doth not clear them
from <hi>Fanaticism;</hi> but draws after it these
monstrous absurdities.</p>
            <p>1. That prevailing <hi>Fanaticism</hi> ceases to
be <hi>Fanaticism;</hi> like Treason, which when it
prospers none dare call it Treason; an excellent
way, this, to vindicate the <hi>Fanaticism</hi> of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50175:72"/>
               <hi>late times,</hi> which because <hi>countenanced</hi> by an
<hi>authority,</hi> supposed <hi>competent</hi> enough by some
who then writ of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi>
it ceased to be <hi>Fanaticism;</hi> and all the wild
and extravagant heats of mens brains, their
<hi>Enthusiasms</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> were Regular and
orderly things, because <hi>countenanced</hi> by such
<hi>Authority</hi> as was then over them.</p>
            <p>2. By this rule the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi>
nay our <hi>Lord</hi> himself, were unavoidably <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
for what <hi>competent authority</hi> had they
to countenance them? The <hi>Iewish Church</hi>
was not yet cast off while our <hi>Saviour</hi> lived,
but utterly opposed his doctrine and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as coming from a private Spirit of his
own; according therefore to these excellent
Principles, <hi>our B. Saviour</hi> is made a meer <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick,</hi>
because he wanted a <hi>competent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the <hi>present Church</hi> to <hi>countenance</hi>
him; the same was generally the case of the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and of all the <hi>Apostles.</hi> But what
rocks and Precipices will a bad cause drive
men upon? If that which makes <hi>Fanaticism</hi>
or not <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> be the being <hi>countenanced</hi>
or <hi>not countenanced</hi> by this <hi>competent Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
these horrible absurdities are unavoidable;
and all Religion must be resolved into the will
and pleasure of this <hi>competent Authority.</hi> But
I need not take such pains to prove this, for my
brave Answerer <hi>I. W.</hi> sets it down in his own
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50175:72"/>
words.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> against <hi>St.</hi> p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Moreover, otherwise all the particular
manners of Preaching or Praying practised by
the Prophets, and all their extraordinary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and revelations would be flat Fanaticism;
but because they were countenanced by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
authority, they could not deserve that
character.</hi> Excellent doctrine for a <hi>Popish
Leviathan!</hi> are you in earnest sir? do you
think the <hi>Prophets</hi> had been <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> in case
of no <hi>competent authority</hi> to <hi>countenance</hi>
them? What <hi>competent authority</hi> had the
<hi>Prophet Elijah</hi> to <hi>countenance</hi> him,<note place="margin">1 King 19. 18.</note> when all
the <hi>Authority</hi> that then was,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 3.</note> not only opposed
him but sought his life? What <hi>competent
Authority</hi> had any of the <hi>Prophets</hi> who were
sent to the ten Tribes? what had <hi>Ieremiah,
Ezekiel,</hi> and the rest of them? It seems then,
all these excellent and inspired persons are cast
into the common herd of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> for want
of this <hi>competent Authority</hi> to <hi>countenance</hi>
them. And yet this is the Man (meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I lay open the <hi>Fanaticism</hi> of some their
pretended <hi>Saints,</hi> such as <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> and
S. <hi>Francis)</hi> who ranks me with <hi>Lucian</hi> and
<hi>Porphyrie:</hi> hath he not himself a great zeal for
<hi>Religion</hi> the mean while, resolving all revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into his <hi>competent authority?</hi> and not
only so, but paralleling <hi>the expressions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of S.</hi> Brigitt, <hi>and Mother</hi> Juliana,
(than which scarce any thing was ever Printed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50175:73"/>
more ridiculous in the way of <hi>Revelations)
with those of the holy Prophets and Apostles?</hi>
If a man designed to speak mischievously
against the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
he could not do it more to purpose than <hi>I. W.</hi>
hath done in these words? when he compares
things whose folly is so manifest at the first
view, with that divine Wisdom, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
those holy persons, whom <hi>God</hi> sent upon
particular messages to his people, and gave so
great assurance that he sent them; and who
delivered matters of great weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not such tittle tattle as those two
Womens Books are fraught withall. But if
this be the way they have to vindicate them
from being <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> it is absolutely the
worst that could be thought of; for it cannot
discover so high an opinion of them, as it doth
a very mean one of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
and the <hi>Divine Revelations</hi> therein contained.
I could here earnestly intreat the wiser men of
that <hi>Church,</hi> for the honour of <hi>God,</hi> and the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> not to suffer such inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
persons to vindicate their cause, who
to defend the extravagant infirmities of some
<hi>Enthusiastical</hi> women among them, are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to cast dirt and reproach upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Religion, and those Revelations from
whence we derive it. But I forbear; only it is
a shrewd sign, if this way be allowed, of a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50175:73"/>
wretched cause, that cannot be maintained
without plunging those, who rely upon their
word, into the depths of <hi>Atheism.</hi> But these
are not things to be so slightly passed over,
they deserve a fuller and severer chastisement.
For the present, this is enough to shew, what
monstrous absurdities this way of vindicating
their <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Fanaticism</hi> hath brought
<hi>I. W.</hi> to. Yet in one respect he deserves some
pardon, for they are wont to write their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
upon the common Themes out of some
staunch Authors, who considered a little better
what they writ; But this was a new charge,
and neither <hi>Bellarmin, Becanus,</hi> nor any of
their old beaten souldiers, could give them any
assistance; they found not the Title of the
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in any of
their <hi>common-place-Books;</hi> therefore plain
Mother-wit must help them, and so it hath
bravely. But before they again attempt this
matter, I desire them to consider these things,
least they should in a desperate humour utterly
give up the cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unable to defend that of their
<hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Whether there can be any greater <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism,</hi>
than a false pretence to immediate
divine Revelation? For what can more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
men to all the follies and delusions imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
than this will do? what actions can be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50175:74"/>
so wild and extravagant but men may do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a pretence of <hi>immediate Revelation</hi>
from <hi>God?</hi> what bounds of order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
can be preserved? some may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a Revelation to take up Arms against
their Prince, or to destroy all they meet
(which is no unheard of thing) others may
not go so far, but may have revelations of the
unlawfulness of Kingly Government; others
may pretend revelations of a <hi>new Gospel,</hi> and
a more <hi>spiritual dispensation</hi> than hath been
yet in the World, as the <hi>Mendicant Friers</hi>
did.</p>
            <p>2. Whether we are bound to believe all
such who say, They have divine revelations?
or whether persons may not be deceived in
thinking they have revelations, when they are
only delusions of their own Fancies or the
Devil? if not; then every one is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
who pretends to these things, and then
all follies and contradictions must be fwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which men say they have by immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
and every <hi>Fanatick</hi> must be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to have divine revelation who believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
though he be only deluded by his own
Imagination, or become <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> by the
power of a disease in his head, or some great
heat in his blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50175:74"/>
3. Whether there must not be some <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rules</hi> established whereby all persons, and
even <hi>competent authority</hi> it self, must proceed
in judging these pretences to revelation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be true or false? for if they proceed
without rule, they must either be inspired too,
or else, must receive all who pretend to divine
revelations: if there be any certain rules,
whereby the revelation is to be judged; then
if any persons receive any revelation against
those rules, whether are other persons bound
to follow their judgement against those
rules?</p>
            <p>4. Whether there can be any more certain
rule of judging, than that two things evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory to each other, cannot both
come from divine revelation? For then God
must contradict himself, which is impossible
to be supposed, and would overthrow the faith
of any divine revelation. And this is the
plain case of the revelations made to two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> S. <hi>Brigitt</hi>
and S. <hi>Catharine;</hi> to one it was revealed,
<hi>that the B. Virgin was conceived with Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin;</hi> to the other, <hi>that she was not:</hi> both
these have <hi>competent Authority,</hi> for they
were both <hi>Canonized</hi> for <hi>Saints</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> and their <hi>Revelations</hi> approved,
and therefore (according to <hi>I. W.)</hi> neither
of them were <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> though it is certain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50175:75"/>
that one of their Revelations was false. For,
either God must contradict himself, or one of
these must be deceived, or go about to deceive,
and what greater <hi>Fanaticism</hi> can there be, than
that is? if one of these had only some <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Enthusiasm,</hi> and the other <hi>divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
then <hi>competent authority</hi> and <hi>submission
to the judgement of the Church,</hi> is not a rule
to judge <hi>Fanaticism</hi> by; for those were equal
in both of them.</p>
            <p>5. Whether there be an equal reason to
look for revelations now, as in the time of the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles?</hi>
or whether God communicates revelations to
no other end, but to please and gratifie some
<hi>Enthusiastical</hi> tempers? and what should be
the reason he should do it more now, than in
the age wherein revelations were more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary?
In those times God revealed his mind
to men, but it was for the benefit of others;
when he sent them upon particular messages, as
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or made known some future
events to them of great importance to the
Church, as the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> &amp;c. or
Inspired them to deliver weighty doctrines to
the world, as he did both the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Apostles:</hi> why should we think, that God
now, when the revelations of these holy and
inspired persons are upon record, and all things
necessary to his Church are contained therein,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50175:75"/>
should vary this method of his, and entertain
some melancholy and retired women, or other
Enthusiastical persons with visions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of no use to his Church?</p>
            <p>6. Whether God doth ever Inspire persons
with immediate revelations without giving
sufficient evidence of such Inspiration? For if
he did, it were to leave men under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Infidelity without means to withstand
it; if he doth not, then we have reason to
examine the evidence, before we believe the
revelation. The evidence God gave of old
was either the Prophecy of a succession of
<hi>Prophets,</hi> by one whose commission was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by great miracles, as <hi>Moses,</hi> who told
the Israelites, they were to expect <hi>Prophets,</hi>
and laid down <hi>rules</hi> to judge of them by; or
else by <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by themselves as by
the <hi>Apostles</hi> whom our <hi>Lord</hi> sent abroad to
declare his will to the world. And where
these are not, what reason is there to receive
any new Revelations as from <hi>God,</hi> especially
when the main predictions of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are of <hi>false Prophets,</hi> and <hi>false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Whether the <hi>Revelations</hi> of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Saints</hi> being <hi>countenanced</hi> by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of their <hi>Church,</hi> be equally received
among them, with the Revelations contained
in <hi>Scripture?</hi> if they be, then they ought to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50175:76"/>
have equal reverence paid to them, and they
ought to read them as <hi>Scripture,</hi> to cite their
Authority as divine, and to believe them as
infallible as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> if they
be not, than whatever they pretend, they are
not looked on as divine revelations by them,
as manifestly appears, because they are wholly
rejected by some of the wisest of them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, and disputed by others, as it were easie
to prove were it not too large a subject for
this discourse, but by none received as writings
of divine authority, and equal with the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
which they must be if they came from
the same Spirit. And since they are not, it is
evident that they are no otherwise esteemed
among themselves, than as the <hi>Fanatick</hi> heats
of some devout persons of disturbed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Fancies; whom notwithstanding they
are willing to cherish, partly because they are
loth to discountenance any pretence to an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit</hi> in their Church, and partly that
there may never be wanting matter to make
<hi>Saints</hi> of, when the <hi>Pope</hi> thinks fit, and good
consideration is offered. This may suffice to
make good this charge of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> against
the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> and to shew that I am
as far from the appearance of any contradiction
therein (although their Revelations are not
from a real one) as <hi>I. W</hi>'s vain and Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
talk is from any appearance of reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50175:76"/>
The last contradiction charged upon me,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
is,<note place="margin">No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the charge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> divisions.</note> 
               <hi>about the Divisions of the Roman Church.</hi>
The occasion of which discourse was, that
<hi>divisions</hi> were objected to me as another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> upon which I
thought my self obliged to enquire into the
<hi>Vnity</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> and I have at large
proved from undenyable Instances, attested by
their own Authors, that they have no reason
to insult over other <hi>Churches</hi> on account of
their divisions, nor to boast of their own
Unity and Peace. For I have there proved
that there have never been greater disturbances
in the Christian World, than what they call
the means of Unity, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi>
hath procured, no where greater or more last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Schisms,</hi> no where fiercer disputes about
matters of order and doctrine, than among
them. I considered all their <hi>salvo's</hi> and from
them shew'd, that if they have no divisions
among themselves neither have we; nay the
same arguments which prove they do not differ
in matters of faith from each other, do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
prove that they and we do not differ
from each other in those things. And what
saith <hi>I. W.</hi> to all this? Instead of healing
their own divisions, he only designs to prove
me to be divided against my self, that he
might make up the full Tale of his contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50175:77"/>
But <hi>I. W.</hi> had so much forgot himself as
to make good the very thing I designed; and
by that very argument he uses to prove that
I contradict my self, he manifestly proves that
there are no more divisions in matters of
faith, between the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and <hi>us</hi> than
there are among themselves. This I shall
make very evident, but I must proceed as he
doth with his Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>No divisions from the Roman Church are
divisions of the Roman Church.</hi> This is a
very subtle principle of unity among them,
and by this rule there would be an admirable
Unity in the Roman Church, if the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
were left alone in it. For all others
would only be <hi>divided from</hi> it, and I would
allow the <hi>Pope</hi> to be at a very good Agreement
with himself, which is more than <hi>I. W.</hi> will
allow me: In this case indeed there would be
<hi>Vnity,</hi> but where would be their <hi>Church?</hi>
Suppose a shepherd should boast of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Government of a great Flock he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his command, and the Unity and peace
they lived in; and a by-stander should tell
him that he saw others pretend to the same
authority over that flock that he did, and
part followed one and part another, he saw
some of the chief of the Leaders set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against him disputing his authority, he
saw many of the sheep continually fighting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50175:77"/>
with each other, and some had wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
him; would it not be a pleasant thing
for this shepherd to say that notwithstanding
all this they had great peace and Unity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as many as did not quarrel were very
quiet, and those that were divided from his
Government were not under it? But our
question is, whether such authority be the
means to preserve the whole flock under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
when we see it prevents no divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but causes many? He might have spoken
more to the purpose if he had framed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
thus, <hi>there can be no divisions in the
Roman Church, but such as divide men from
it;</hi> and in that case the <hi>Roman Church</hi> would
have been reduced to a very small number.
But if there may be such <hi>divisions</hi> which are
as contrary to Unity and peace as divisions
<hi>in matters of faith</hi> are, to what purpose is it
to shew that they have none in one kind if
they have very great in all others? But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this be not sufficient to demonstrate
their <hi>Vnity,</hi> yet it is enough for his purpose,
if it doth shew that I contradict my self.
But where lyes the contradiction? The force
of it lyes here. <hi>I charge them with divisions
in matters of faith, when divisions in matters
of faith make them not to be members of the
Roman Church; therefore there can be no
divisions in the Roman Church in matters of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50175:78"/>
faith.</hi> Again (for in these two arguments
the substance of his own propositions is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by himself) <hi>All those who assent unto the
ancient Creeds are undivided in matters of
faith; but all Roman Catholicks assent unto
the ancient Creeds;</hi> ergo, <hi>all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
are undivided in matters of faith, and
consequently it is a calumny in me to say
they are divided in these matters.</hi> Now,
what an easie matter is it to disposses me of
this <hi>Spirit of contradiction,</hi> which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
me <hi>possessed with?</hi> I need no holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or sacred charms and exorcisms to do it
with. There needs no more but understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is meant <hi>by matters of faith;</hi> when
<hi>matters of faith</hi> are spoken of by me in the
place he refers to,<note place="margin">Rational <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. p. 56.</note> it is evident to every one
that reads it, and by his own words I speak
only of <hi>the Fundamental and necessary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of faith, which are necessary to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all and to the very being of a Church;</hi>
of which kind I say none ought to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that were not admitted into the ancient
<hi>Creeds.</hi> But when I charge them with divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<hi>in matters of faith,</hi> I do not mean that
they reject the ancient Creeds, but I take
<hi>matters of faith</hi> in their own sense for <hi>things
defined by the Church;</hi> and if <hi>I. W.</hi> had
sought for any thing but words to raise cavils
upon, he might have found it so explained in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50175:78"/>
the very place where I speak of this. For
that discourse is to answer an objection of
theirs,<note place="margin">Divis. of the Rom. Church. s. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 397. 2. ed.</note> 
               <hi>that they do not differ in those things
which they esteem matters of faith;</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I insisted upon that, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be sure whether they differ <hi>in matters of
faith</hi> or no, because they are not agreed what
makes things to become <hi>matters of faith.</hi>
Can this be understood any other way than
of their <hi>own sense</hi> of matters of faith? And
is not this fair dealing to make me contradict
my self because where I argue against them
I take <hi>matters of faith</hi> in <hi>their sense,</hi> and
where I deliver my own opinion, I take them
in <hi>another sense?</hi> And this being the sense
of matters of faith the trifling of his arguing
appears; for do all these cease to be members
of their <hi>Church</hi> who dispute any thing which
others account <hi>matter of faith</hi> among them?
Are the <hi>Iesuits</hi> all out of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
because they deny the efficacy of <hi>Grace</hi> which
the <hi>Domini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ans</hi> account <hi>a matter of faith?</hi> Are
the <hi>Iansenists</hi> and <hi>oral Traditionists</hi> divided
from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> because they deny
the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi> which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a matter of faith? If not, then <hi>all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in matters and articles of faith, are
not divisions from the true Church and from all
her members;</hi> and so his second Proposition
comes to nothing: and so likewise the third, <hi>that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50175:79"/>
all divisions in matters of faith, so esteemed by
them, are divisions from the Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the fourth and fifth Propositions are the
most healing Principles that have yet been
thought on. Fie for shame! why should we
and they of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> quarrel thus
long? we are very well agreed in all <hi>matters
of faith,</hi> and I shall demonstratively prove it
from the argument of <hi>I. W.</hi> drawn from his
two last <hi>Propositions. All who assent unto the
ancient Creeds are undivided in matters of
faith, by</hi> Prop. 4. but both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
do <hi>assent unto the ancient Creeds;</hi> ergo,
<hi>they are undivided in matters of faith</hi> And
hath not <hi>I. W.</hi> now done his business, and very
substantially proved the thing he intended?
But I hope we may enjoy the benefit of it, as
well as those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that
they will not hence forward charge us with <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
from their Church</hi> in any matters of
faith, since we are all agreed in owning the
<hi>ancient Creeds;</hi> and seeing, we cannot be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the Church</hi> but by differing <hi>in
matters of faith</hi> according to his <hi>Propos.</hi> it
follows that we are still members of the <hi>true
Church,</hi> and therefore neither guilty of <hi>heresie</hi>
nor <hi>Schism.</hi> But if those who do own and
assent to the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> may yet be divided
<hi>in matters of faith,</hi> as they charge us by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>definitions</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50175:79"/>
there is no shadow of a contradiction left in
my charging them with <hi>differences</hi> in matters
of faith among themselves, though I say, they
own the <hi>ancient Creeds.</hi>

            <p>And now,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> Reader, thou seest what all these

shall take as little notice of them as I have done
of those. Cannot a dull Book come out with
<hi>my name in the Title,</hi> but I must be obliged to
answer it? no, I assure them I know better how
to spend my time. I say still, let a just answer
come forth, that deals by me as I did by the
Book I answered, and then let them blame me,
if I neglect it. But at last he gives one general
reason why no great matter is to be expected
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50175:80"/>
to come abroad in Print: <hi>not, but that they
have men of learning among them:</hi> No doubt
of it: but alas for them! they are so persecuted
in the Printing Houses that nothing of theirs is
suffered to come abroad, only by great good
fortune this complaint is in Print and comes
abroad openly enough. How long I pray have
these days of persecution been? For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you imagine I was so far <hi>from having any
hand in it,</hi> that the first time I ever heard of
it, was from your complaints. Have you not
formerly complained thus, when Books too
many have been Printed and published in
<hi>England?</hi> And what assurance can you give us
that you do not still complain without cause?
But, not to suffer you to deceive the people
any longer in this kind (by pretending that this
is the reason why you do not answer our Books,
because you have no liberty of the Press) I
have at this time a Catalogue by me of above
two hundred <hi>Popish Books</hi> Printed in our own

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50175:82"/>
to be of so great importance as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a sober debate. And the Controversie
in short is this, Whether Protestants who
reject the Roman Churches Authority and
Infallibility, can have any sufficient Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to build their faith upon? This we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,

deny; and on this account do charge
us with the want of Principles, <hi>i. e.</hi> sufficient
grounds for our faith. But this may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
two ways. 1. That we can have

on two accounts. 1. To shew that the
Roman Churches Authority and Infallibility
cannot be the Foundation of Christian faith,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50175:82"/>
and so we may be very good Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any thing to do with the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That this might serve as a
sufficient answer to a Book entituled <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
without Principles.</hi> Which being
in some part of it directed against me I had
reason, not only to lay down those <hi>Principles,</hi>
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to do it in such a manner as did most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
overthrow the principles of that Book.</p>
            <p>Which being only intimated there, I must
now to make my proceeding more clear and
evident, produce those assertions of <hi>E. W.</hi> for
which mine were intended.<note place="margin">Protestants without Principles, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> In the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he designs to prove, <hi>That all men must be
infallible in the assent they give to matters
of faith. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>If they disown such
infallible believers, they must joyntly deny all
infallible faith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 17.</note> and a little after, <hi>an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
verity revealed to us forcibly requires
an answerable and correspondent infallible
faith in us:</hi> and therefore he asserts <hi>a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
Infallibility in true believers.</hi> And
from hence he proves <hi>the necessity of Infallible
teachers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> for <hi>infallible believers and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
teachers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> he saith, <hi>seem neer correlatives.</hi>
In the second Chapter he saith, <hi>he that hears
an infallible teacher hath the Spirit of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 20.</note>
               <hi>and he that hears not an infallible teacher
wants this Spirit of truth;</hi> by which he
does not mean an infallible Revealer of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50175:83"/>
doctrine at first; but the immediate teachers
of the revealed doctrine,<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> for, saith he, <hi>no man
can be a Heretick that denies the objective
verities revealed in Gods word, unless he be
sure that his teacher reveals those verities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 22.</note>
He proposes the objection of <hi>a Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plician,</hi>
as he calls him, <hi>that he builds his
faith and Religion, not on any Preachers talk
but on the objective verities revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
to which he answers, <hi>that unless he
first learn of some infallible Oracle, the sense
of Scripture in controverted places, he can
never arrive to the depth of Gods true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or derive infallible faith from those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
revealed Verities.</hi> He yet farther
asserts,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
               <hi>that every Catechist, or Preacher that
hath a lawful mission, and is sent by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Church to teach Christs Sacred Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
if he Preach that doctrine which Christ
and his Church approves of, is then under
that notion of a member conjoyned with an
Infallible Church, infallible in his teaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and thence concludes,<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
               <hi>that infallibility doth
accompany both teachers and hearers: and
from denying this Infallibility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> he saith, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
an utter ruine of Christian Religion yea
and of Scripture too.</hi> And afterwards he
goes about to prove that no man can have
any divine faith without infallibility in the
proponent;<note place="margin">P. 42, 43.</note> for, faith he, <hi>as long as the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50175:83"/>
of a Revelation stands remote from me
for want of an undoubted application made by
an infallible Proponent, it can no more trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
Certainty into Faith, than Fire at a great
distance, warm.</hi> This is the sum of the
<hi>Principles</hi> of that <hi>Metaphysical wit;</hi> but sure
a man must have his brains well confounded
by <hi>School Divinity</hi> and hard words, before he
can have common sense little enough to think
he understands them. But because I never
loved to spend time in confuting a man, who
thinks himself the wiser for speaking things,
which neither he nor any one else can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
I rather chose in as short a way as I
could, to put together such Propositions, as
might give an account of <hi>Christian Faith</hi>
without all this <hi>Iargon</hi> about Infallibility.
In order to this, I first laid down the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
wherein all parties are agreed; and then
such Propositions as I supposed would suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
give an account of our faith, without
any necessity of such an infallibility as he
makes necessary for the foundation of it.</p>
            <p>But for our clearer proceeding in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of this importance,<note place="margin">§. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> it will be necessary
to state and fix the notion of <hi>Infallibility</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come to particulars.<note place="margin">Or the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</note> For as it is used it
seems to be a rare word for <hi>Iugglers</hi> in <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to play tricks with; for sometimes they apply
it to the <hi>object</hi> that is believed, and call that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50175:84"/>
               <hi>infallibly true;</hi> sometimes to the <hi>subject</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of believing, and say persons ought to be
<hi>infallibly certain</hi> that what they believe is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
true;</hi> and sometimes to the <hi>means</hi> of
conveying that infallible truth to the faculties
of men, and these they say must be <hi>infallible,</hi>
or else there can be no <hi>infallible certainty</hi> of
any thing as <hi>infallbly true.</hi> But the subtilty
of these things lies only in their obscurity; and
the School-man is spoiled when his talk is
brought down out of the clouds to common
sense: I will therefore trie to bring these
things out of their terms to a plain meaning;
and surely we may speak and understand each
other in these matters without this doubtful
term of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For if it signifies any
thing, we may make use of the thing it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
in stead of the word, and by applying the
thing signified by it, to that which it is spoken
of, we shall soon discern how justly it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to it. <hi>Infallibile</hi> is that which cannot be
deceived; now if no one will say, That a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
cannot be deceived,</hi> it is absurd to say
<hi>that it is infallibly true;</hi> therefore the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
revealed considered <hi>as objective verities,</hi>
as our <hi>schoolman</hi> speaks, are not capable of
<hi>Infallibility;</hi> which cannot belong to the
<hi>truth</hi> proposed, but to him that propounds or
believes it. For <hi>to be deceived</hi> or <hi>not to be
deceived,</hi> are proper only to <hi>persons;</hi> and the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50175:84"/>
impossibility of being deceived does in truth
belong only to an infinitely perfect understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for what ever understanding is imperfect,
is of it self liable to errour and mistake. And
yet an understanding liable to be deceived may
not be deceived, and be sure it is not. The
highest assurance of not being deceived, is from
Gods revealing any thing to men; for we
know it impossible that God should be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or go about to deceive mankind in what
he obliges them to believe as true. This then
is granted, that whatever any person speaks
immediately from God, he cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in it; but men may be deceived in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they speak from God when they do not.
There is then no difficulty in the first, that
what ever persons are inspired by God are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
in what they speak; but the main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
is about the assurance which <hi>God</hi> gives
to <hi>men</hi> that they are inspired. Two ways it may
be conceived that men cannot be deceived in
this matter. 1. If God inspires every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person with the belief of this, and gives
him such evidence thereof as cannot be false.
2. Or if God shall inspire some persons in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Age to assure the World, that those before
them were inspired: but notwithstanding this,
particular persons may be deceived, in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
those inspired who are not; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this, nothing can be sufficient but divine
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50175:85"/>
revelation to every particular person that he
hath appointed those <hi>infallible Guides</hi> in his
<hi>Church,</hi> to assure men that he had at first setled
his <hi>Church</hi> by persons that were <hi>infallible;</hi>
but then, why might not such a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
assure men as well immediately that
Christ and his holy Apostles were <hi>infallible,</hi>
as that the <hi>Guides</hi> of the present <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi>
For it is unconceivable that persons
should be more infallible in judging the Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the present Guides, than of the first
Founders of the Church. And supposing men
not inspired, they may be deceived in believing
this <hi>infallibility</hi> of the present Church, and if
they may be deceived, how can their Faith be
<hi>infallible?</hi> so that nothing can make the
faith of particular persons infallible, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
inspiration which must resolve all Faith
into <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and immediate revelation.
And nothing can be more absurd than to say,
<hi>That there are infallible Believers without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Inspiration;</hi> or <hi>that an infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
can transfuse infallibility into faith,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the infallibility of that Proponent be first
made known to the Believer in such a way as
he cannot be deceived in. For in matters of
divine Revelation, the main thing we are to
enquire after, is the <hi>infallibility</hi> of those who
delivered this doctrine to the World. And
although the reason of believing what God
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50175:85"/>
saith, be his own infallibility, which is natural
and essential to him; yet the reason of my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to this or that doctrine, as coming from
God, must be an assurance that God hath secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
those persons from mistake whom he hath
imployed to make known the doctrine to the
World. Those persons then whom God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
are the <hi>Proponents of matters of faith
to us:</hi> and if they give us sufficient reason to
believe that they were inspired, we are bound
to believe them, otherwise not. But to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that we cannot believe the first infallible
<hi>Proponents,</hi> unless there be such in every Age,
is to make more difficulties, and to answer
none. For then all my belief of the <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of the <hi>first Proponents,</hi> must depend on
the evidence which the <hi>present Guides</hi> of the
Church give of their <hi>infallibility,</hi> who yet
cannot pretend to the same evidence which
they had: and here is no difficulty answered,
for we are certainly bound as much to enquire
into the reason of our believing the present
Guides of the Church <hi>infallible,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
and if men cannot be infallible in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> unless there be other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<hi>Proponents</hi> in every Age, to assure
them that the Apostles were inspired, why
must not the infallibility of these present <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents</hi>
be likewise so attested as well as of the
Apostles? and what undoubted application
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50175:86"/>
can be made of the Churches <hi>infallibility,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there be some other <hi>infallible Proponent</hi>
still to <hi>transfuse certainty into my belief</hi> of
that, by vertue of which, I must believe all
other matters of Faith, which is the <hi>Churches
Infallibility?</hi> So that the <hi>last Proponent</hi> must
either be believed for himself without any
further evidence, and then the shorter way
would be to believe the first so, or else there
will be an <hi>endless infallibility;</hi> or at last all
must be resolved into the <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> of every
particular person, if we do not rest satisfied with
the <hi>rational evidence</hi> which those persons, who
were inspired by God, did give to the World
that they were sent by him: and then let the
World judge whether <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>
did not give stronger evidence that they were
sent from God, than the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>Guides</hi> of
the present <hi>Church</hi> do? and if so, whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vice to
Christianity, than to suspend our belief of the
<hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Founders</hi> of the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> on a thing, at least, far less evident than
the thing to be believed by it is? but in plain
English, on a thing notoriously false; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the arrogant pretence of an usurping Faction,
which thinks it easier boldly to say that it
<hi>cannot be deceived,</hi> than to defend it self against
the just accusations both <hi>of deceiving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceived.</hi>

            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50175:86"/>
            <p>These things being premised,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> I now come

               </note> for
the end for which I intended them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of them was to shew, that we may have
sufficient <hi>Certainty</hi> of our Faith, without the
<hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
hath yielded some things and denied
others. I shall therefore first lay down his
<hi>Concessions,</hi> and see of what force they are to
the issue of this Controversie, and then come
fairly to debate the matters in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</p>
            <p>I. For his Concessions.</p>
            <p>1. He yields, <hi>That there is no necessity at
all of Infallibility under natural Religion:</hi>
which was implied in the second and third
<hi>Propositions</hi> which are granted by him.</p>
            <p>For in the second Proposition I assert,<note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> That
Man being framed a rational Creature capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of reflecting upon himself, may antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to any external Revelation certainly
know the being of God, and his dependence
upon him; else there could be no such thing as
a Law of Nature, or any Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion: <hi>which,</hi> he saith, <hi>may be
granted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All supernatural and external Revelation,<note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note>
must suppose the truth of Natural Religion;
for unless we be antecedently certain that there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50175:87"/>
is a God, and that we are capable of knowing
him, it is impossible to be certain, that God
hath revealed his Will to us by any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
means. <hi>Let this be granted,</hi> saith he.
From whence it follows that we have sufficient
certainty of the Principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
without any such thing as <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He yields, <hi>That Reason is to be judge
concerning divine Revelation;</hi> which appears
by the next Proposition.</p>
            <p>Nothing ought to be admitted for Divine
Revelation,<note place="margin">Prop. 4.</note> which overthrows the certainty of
those Principles which must be antecedently
supposed to all Divine Revelation: for that
were to overthrow the means whereby we are
to judge concerning the truth of any Divine
Revelation. Of which, he saith, <hi>Let this also
be granted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>He yields,</hi> That the Will of God may
be sufficiently declared to men by writing, <hi>for</hi>
he grants <hi>the tenth Proposition, which is
this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Will of God cannot be sufficiently
declared to men by writing,<note place="margin">Prop. 10.</note> it must either be,
because no writing can be intelligible enough
for that end, or that it can never be known to
be written by men infallibly assisted; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is repugnant to common sense, for words
are equally capable of being understood, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or written; the latter overthrows the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50175:87"/>
of the Scriptures being known to be
the Word of God. <hi>This,</hi> saith he, <hi>is
granted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>He yields,</hi> That the written will of God
doth contain all things simply necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>For in his consideration of the 14.
Proposition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 22. S. 15.</note> 
               <hi>these are his words:</hi> Mean while
as touching the Perfection of holy Scriptures,
Catholicks now, as the holy Fathers anciently,
do grant that they contain all points, which are
simply necessary to be of all persons believed for
attaining salvation.</p>
            <p>5. He yields,<note place="margin">P. 52.</note> 
               <hi>That no person is infallibly
certain of or in his Faith, because the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
thereof is infallible, unless he also certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know, or have infallible evidence that he is
infallible;</hi> only he adds, <hi>That for begetting
an infallible assent to the thing proposed, it is
sufficient if we have an infallible evidence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the thing proposed, or of the Proponent
only.</hi> Which is all I desire as to this matter.
But he quarrels with me for saying, Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
21. It is necessary therefore in order to
an infallible assent, that every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be infallibly assisted, in judging of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
proposed to be believed: <hi>Because,</hi> saith he,
<hi>it is not necessary to have an infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the truth of the things proposed, i. e.
from the internal principles that prove or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
them; but it is enough that he have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50175:88"/>
an infallible or sufficiently certain evidence only
of the infallibility of the external Proponent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Where there are two things to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. 1. That by the <hi>matters proposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi>
he would seem to understand me only of
the things that are to be believed by vertue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Proponent supposed infallible; whereas I
meant it of all such things to which <hi>an infallible
assent</hi> is required, and chiefly of that by which
we are to believe the things revealed; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>that the Church is infallible,</hi> is in the
first place to be believed upon their principles,
and either an <hi>infallible assent</hi> is required to
this or not; if not, then <hi>infallibility is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to faith;</hi> if it be, then this infallible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
must be built on an infallibility antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to that of the Church; and then my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
necessarily follows, that the ground
on which a necessity of some external infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proponent is asserted, must rather make
every particular person infallible, if no divine
Faith can be without an infallible assent, and
so renders any other Infallibility useless.</p>
            <p>2. That he explains <hi>infallible evidence</hi> by
that which is <hi>sufficiently certain,</hi> which is
meer shuffling: for he knows well enough that
we contend for <hi>sufficiently certain evidence</hi>
as much as they; our only Question is about
<hi>infallibility,</hi> whether that be necessary or no?
If <hi>sufficiently certain evidence</hi> will serve for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50175:88"/>
the Churches Infallibility, why may it not for
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or any matters of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein? If they mean no more by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
but <hi>sufficient certainty,</hi> why do they
make so great a noise about it, as though there
could be no Faith and we no Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Infallibility? when we all say that the
matters of Faith have <hi>sufficient certainty,</hi> nay
the highest which such things are capable of.
Is <hi>infallible Faith</hi> come to be <hi>sufficiently cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
only? for all that I know an <hi>infallible</hi>
Pope may by such another explication become
like one of us.</p>
            <p>6. He yields, <hi>That a right and saving faith
may be without any infallible assurance concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Churches Infallibility. Which,</hi> he
saith,<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> 
               <hi>is abundantly declared by Catholick
Writers.</hi> I only desire to know, why a like
right and saving faith may not be had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> without their <hi>Churches</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility?
For from hence it follows, that an
<hi>infallible assent</hi> is not requisite to saving faith;
directly contrary to my former Adversary
<hi>E. W.</hi> for one saith, <hi>it is necessary to faith,</hi> and
the other, <hi>that it is not.</hi> But above all, how
will he ever answer this to Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> who hath
written a whole Book purposely against this
Principle, as impious and atheistical? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
this way of defending the main founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Faith by Principles so directly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50175:89"/>
contradicting one another looks a little scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously,
and brings an odd suspition upon
their Cause, as if it were very hard to be made
good, when our Adversaries cannot agree by
which of two quite contrary Principles it was
best be maintained.</p>
            <p>7. He yields,<note place="margin">P. 56.</note> 
               <hi>That the utmost assurance a
man can have of the Churches Infallibility, is
only moral;</hi> but to make it up, he calls it a
<hi>moral infallibility;</hi> which, how strangely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it sounds, yet his meaning is good; for it is
such an infallibility, as is not infallibility. Hath
the dispute been thus long among us, whether
<hi>infallibility</hi> be necessary or no to faith, and now
at last one comes and tells us, Yes surely, a <hi>moral
infallibility</hi> is necessary. I have heard of a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
dispute between two Gentlemen about <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
very earnest they were on both
sides; at last another falls into their company
and asked them what it was they were about;
they told him <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> very well,
said he, but I pray tell me what you mean by
it; one said it was <hi>standing</hi> at the Eucharist,
and the other <hi>kneeling.</hi> Much such another
explication is this here of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> only
this is somewhat worse, for it is joyning two
words together which destroy each other; for
if it be only <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> it is not <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;</hi>
if it be <hi>infallible,</hi> it cannot be barely
<hi>moral.</hi> I expect to hear shortly of an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50175:89"/>
Transubstantiation, a co-ordinate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
as well as a <hi>moral Infallibility.</hi> But
we are to suppose that by <hi>Infallibility</hi> he means
no more than <hi>Certainty,</hi> because he explains
it <hi>by the Certainty of universal Tradition:</hi>
this were well enough, if in the precedent Page
he had not said,<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
               <hi>That a particular person may
be infallible in the assent he gives to some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proposed,</hi> viz. <hi>to this, that the Church is
infallible;</hi> I would fain understand what this
<hi>infallible assent</hi> is grounded upon, and if the
evidence be only <hi>sufficiently or morally infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
which are his own terms, how the <hi>assent</hi>
which is built upon it, comes to be more
than so. It is very pleasant to observe how
Mr. <hi>Cressey,</hi> and some other late <hi>Writers</hi>
of their Church are perplexed about this
word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as if they had a Wolf by
the ears, they cannot tell how to hold it, and
they are afraid to let it go. And very loth is
is our <hi>N. O.</hi> to part with the sound of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
although his own Concessions perfectly
overthrow it, as will yet further appear by this
last, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>That moral Certainty is a sufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for Faith.</hi> This will appear by my
27.<note place="margin">Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 27.</note> Proposition, which is this: The nature of
certainty doth receive several names either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of the proof, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the Assent. Thus Moral Certainty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50175:90"/>
may be so called, either as it is opposed to
Mathematical evidence, but implying a firm
assent upon the highest evidence that Moral
things can receive: Or as it is opposed to a
higher degree of Certainty in the same kind,
so Moral Certainty implies only greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
of one side than the other. In the
former sense we assert the certainty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith to be Moral, but not only in the
latter.<note place="margin">P. 67.</note> To which he saith, <hi>This Principle is
granted, if importing only that Christians
have or may have a sufficiently certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
evidence of the truth of their Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
Whereby it is plain that though he
useth the term <hi>infallible,</hi> yet he means no
more than I do, or else he ought not to have
brought that as an explication of my principle
which is contrary to it, as in this Controversie,
<hi>Moral Certainty</hi> is opposed to strict demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Infallibility. But if he by <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
means only <hi>sufficient certainty,</hi> I shall be
content for quietness sake, that he shall call it
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> if he pleases. And that he can
mean no more by it, appears not only by what
he hath said before, but by what he saith after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in these words.<note place="margin">P. 94.</note> 
               <hi>A Natural or Moral
Certainty (though not such a one as cannot
possibly be false, but which according to the
Laws of Nature and the common manners and
experience of Men is not false) is sufficient on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50175:90"/>
which to ground such a faith as God requires of
us; in respect of that Certainty which can be
derived from humane sense or reason, and
which serves for an introductive to the reliance
of this our faith upon such Revelation as is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us divine; and which if divine, we know
is not possibly fallible; In respect of its relying
on which Revelation, an infallible object, and
not for an Infallible Certainty as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it is that this our Faith is denominated a
Divine Faith. Now this Natural or Moral
Certainty is thought sufficient for the first ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Introductive and Security of our Faith,
not only by the Doctor in his 27. Principle,
but also by Catholick Divines in their Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Prudential Motives.</hi> Very well
said, and I were a very disingenuous man, if I
should not heartily thank him for so free a
Confession, by which, if I understand any
thing, he very fairly gives up the Cause of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
as to the necessity of it in order to
Faith: As will easily appear by the managing
of it, so far as I have been concerned in it.
It is evident to any one that will cast an eye on
the Controversie of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> between the
Arch-bishop and his Adversaries, that it was
raised on this account, because those of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> asserted, that the Infallible
Testimony of the Church was necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the believing the Scriptures to be the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50175:91"/>
Word of God: and so much is endeavoured to
be defended by him who pretended to answer
my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Book, who goes upon
this Principle, <hi>That this is to be believed with
a divine Faith, and a divine Faith must be
built upon an infallible Testimony;</hi> the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of which, I at large shewed in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Resolution of Faith. Since the
publishing whereof, the Metaphysical Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
before mentioned, pretended to answer
that part of it which concerns <hi>Infallibility</hi> and
<hi>Moral Certainty.</hi> Some of his assertions I
have laid down already, as contrary to this
of <hi>N. O.</hi> as may be; for he not only asserts
the necessity of <hi>Infallibility for a foundation
of Christian Faith,</hi> but spends some Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

them to dispute it among themselves.</p>
            <p>Thus far then we are agreed;<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> I now come
to consider where the controversie still remains,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>N. O's.</hi> Principles laid down.</note>
and why the rest of my <hi>Principles</hi> may not pass
as well as these. In order to this, I must, by
taking a view of his several exceptions and
answers, draw together a <hi>Scheme</hi> of those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
which he sets up in opposition to mine;
and if I do not very much mistake, they may
be reduced to these three.</p>
            <p>1. That God hath given an infallible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to the Guides of the Church in all Ages
of it, for the direction of those who live
in it.</p>
            <p>2. That without this infallible assistance
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50175:92"/>
there can be no certainty of the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>3. That all the Arguments which overthrow
the Churches Infallibility; do destroy the
Churches Authority.</p>
            <p>These, as far as I can perceive, contain the
whole force of his <hi>Considerations;</hi> and in the
examination of these the remaining discourse
must be spent; In which I shall have occasion
to take notice of whatever is material in his
Book.</p>
            <p>1. The main controversie is, whether God
hath given an infallible assistance to the Guides
of the Church in all Ages, for the conduct of
those who live in it? For if he hath not, my
Adversary cannot deny, but the <hi>Principles</hi> laid
down by me must hold. For in case there be
no infallibility in the Guides of the Church,
every one must be left to the use of his own
understanding, proceeding in the best manner,
to find out what the Will of God is in order to
salvation. We do not now dispute concerning
the best helps for a person to make use of in a
matter of this nature; but the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estion is,
whether a man ought to resign his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that of the Church, which pretends to
be infallible as to all necessaries for salvation?
or supposing no such infallibility, whether a
person using his Faculties in the best manner
about the sense of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> with the helps of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50175:92"/>
divine Grace, may not have sufficient cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
thereby what things are required of
him in order to happiness? Hereby I exclude
nothing that may tend to the right use of a
mans understanding in these things, whether it
be the direction of Pastors; the decrees of
Councils, the sense of the Primitive Church,
or the care, industry, and sincerity of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer;
but supposing all these, whether by
not believing the Guides of the Church to be
infallible, <hi>the foundation of this persons faith
can be nothing else but a trembling Quicks and,</hi>
as <hi>N. O.</hi> speaks in his Preface; only from the
supposing <hi>an errability in the Guides of Gods
Church.</hi> And a little after he lays down that
as his fundamental Principle, <hi>that the only
certain way not to be misled, will be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
our internal assent and belief to Church
Authority;</hi> or as he elsewhere speaks, <hi>to the
infallible Guideship of Church Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ors.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
Here then two Questions necessarily arise:
1. Whether there can be no certainty of Faith
without this infallibility? 2. What certainty
there is of this infallibility?</p>
            <p>1. Whether there can be no certainty of
Faith without <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Guides of the
Church, and submitting our internal assent and
belief to them? For the clearing of this
we must consider what things are agreed
upon between us, that by them we may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50175:93"/>
proceed to the resolution of this Question.</p>
            <p>1. It is I suppose agreed, That every man
hath in him a faculty of discerning of truth and
falshood.</p>
            <p>2. That this Faculty must be used at least
in the choice of infallible Guide; for
otherwise a man must be abused with every
pretence of Infallibility, and <hi>George Fox</hi> may
as well be followed as the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
to what purpose are all prudential motives and
arguments for Infallibility, if a man must not
judge whether they be good or no, <hi>i. e.</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to prove the thing?</p>
            <p>3. That God is not wanting in necessaries
to the salvation of mankind.</p>
            <p>4. That the Books of Scripture received
on both sides do contain in them the Will of
God in order to salvation.</p>
            <p>5. That all things simply necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
are contained therein, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
mentioned before.</p>
            <p>These things being supposed,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> the Question
now is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>N. O's.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions answered.</note> Whether a person not relying on the
infallibility of a Church, may not be certain
of those things which are contained in those
Books in order to Salvation? For of those ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
present enquiry is, and not about the sense of
the more difficult and controverted places; and
if we can make it appear that men may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50175:93"/>
as to matters of salvation without infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
let them prove (if they can) the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of infallibility for things which are not
necessary to salvation. But of the sense of
<hi>Scripture</hi> in those things afterwards; I now
enquire into the certainty men may attain to,
of <hi>the necessaries to salvation in Scripture:</hi>
and concerning this, I laid down this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>Although we cannot argue against any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way of Revelation from the necessary
Attributes of God,<note place="margin">Prop. 13.</note> yet such a way as writing
being made choice of by him, we may justly
say, that it is repugnant to the nature of the
design and the Wisdom and Goodness of God
to give infallible assistance to persons in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Will for the benefit of Mankind,
if those Writings may not be understood by
all persons who sincerely endeavour to know
the meaning of them in all such things as are
necessary for their salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Principle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> he saith, <hi>is unsound;</hi> which,
if he can prove, I may have more reason to
question it than I yet have. And I assure him
I expect no mean proofs to shake my belief of
a principle of so great importance to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. For it being granted by him,
<hi>that all things simply necessary to salvation, are
contained in the Books of Scripture,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know whether <hi>things simply necessary</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50175:94"/>
ought not to be delivered with greater plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than things which are not so? Whether
God appointing the Evangelists and Apostles
to write these things, did not intend that they
should be so expressed as they might most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be understood? Whether our Saviours
own Sermons vere capable of being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by those who heard them, without some
infallible Interpreter? Whether the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
did not faithfully deliver our Saviours
Doctrine? If they did, how that comes to be
obscure now, which was plain then? so that
either Christ himself must be charged with
not speaking the Will of God plainly, or the
Evangelists cannot be charged with not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
it so. There are no other Books in
the World that I know of, that need an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Interpreter: and we can tell certainly
enough what any other Religion requires, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it to be written in the same way that
the Christian is: Is it not possible for a man
to be certain what the Law of Moses required
of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> by reading the Books
of that Law, without some infallible Guides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Do the ten Commandments need an <hi>Infallible
Comment?</hi> Or can we have now no certainty
of the meaning of the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> because
there is no High-priest or Sanhedrin to explain
it? And if it be possible to understand the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
of that dark dispensation in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50175:94"/>
with the Gospel, are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r eyes now blinded
with too much light? Is not Christianity
therefore highly recommended to us in the
New Testament, because of the clearness and
perspicuity wherein the Doctrines and Precepts
thereof are delivered? And yet after all this,
cannot the most necessary parts of it, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by those who sincerely endeavour to
understand them? By which sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
we are so far from excluding any useful
helps, that we always suppose them. The
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m then of what he is to confute, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
although the Apostles and Evangelists did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Mind of God to the World in their
Writings, in order to the salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
although they were inspired by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Wisdom for this end, although all things
simply necessary to Salvation are contained in
their Writings, although a Person useth his
sincere endeavour by all Moral helps, and the
Divine Grace assisting him to find out in these
Writings the things necessary to Salvation,
yet after all he cannot certainly understand the
meaning of them. Which to me appears so
absurd and monstrous a Doctrine, so contrary
to the honour of the Scriptures and the design
of Christianity, that if I had a mind to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
it, I would begin with this and end with
Transubstantiation. For in earnest Sir, did
not our Saviour speak intelligibly in matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50175:95"/>
so great importance to the Salvation of
Mankind? Did he not declare all that
was necessary for that end, in his many
admirable discourses? Did not the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
record his words and actions in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and that as one of them saith expresly,
<hi>That we might believe that Iesus is the Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 20, 31.</note>
               <hi>the Son of God, and that believing we
might have life through his name?</hi> And after
all this, cannot we understand so much as
the common necessaries to salvation by the
greatest and most sincere endeavour for that
end? But it is time now to consider his
exceptions against this Principle: which are
these.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That God may reveal his mind so in
Scripture as that in many things it may be clear
only to some persons more versed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13.</note>
               <hi>and in the Churches Traditional sense
of them, and more assisted from above accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their imployment; which persons he
hath appointed to instruct the rest.</hi> But what
is all this to our purpose? our Question is not
about <hi>may be's,</hi> and possibilities of things, but
it is taken for granted on both sides, that God
hath revealed his mind in writing; therefore
he need not make the supposition of <hi>no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
at all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> as he doth afterwards: the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, Whether these Writings being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50175:95"/>
for divine revelations of the Will of
God, he hath expressed the necessaries to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
clearly therein or not? That God may
delivers his mind obscurely in many things, is
no question; nor that he may inspire persons
to unfold his mind, where it is obscure; but
our question is, whether or no these Writings
being acknowledged to contain the Will of
God, it be agreeable with the nature of the
design and the Wisdom and Goodness of God
for such Writings not to be capable of being
understood in all things necessary to salvation,
by those who sincerely endeavour to understand
them? But when I had expresly said, <hi>things
necessary for salvation,</hi> why doth he avoid
that which the dispute was about, and only
say <hi>many things</hi> in stead of it? I do not doubt
but there are many difficult places of Scripture,
as there must be in any ancient Writings pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in an Idiom so very different from ours.
But I never yet saw one difficulty removed by
the pretended Infallible Guides of the Church;
all the help we have had, hath been from meer
fallible men of excellent skill in Languages,
History, and Chronology, and of a clear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
and we should be very unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to acknowledge the great helps we
have had from them, for understanding the
difficult places of Scripture: But for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guides,</hi> they have dealt by the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50175:96"/>
of Scripture, <hi>as the Priest and the Levi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e</hi>
in our Saviours Parable, did by the <hi>wounded
man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10. 31, 32.</note> they <hi>have fairly passed them by,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
no care of them. If these Guides did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
themselves infallible, they have made
the least use of their Talent that ever men did;
they have laid it up in a Napkin, and buried it
in the earth, for nothing of it ever appeared
above ground. How could they have obliged
the World more, (nay, it had been necessary to
have done it for the use of their Gift) than to
have given an Infallible sense of all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Places; and then there had been but one
dispute left, whether they were infallible or
not? but now, supposing we believe their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
we are still as far to seek, for the
meaning of many difficult places. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
God had once bestowed this Gift of
Infallibility upon the Guides of the Church,
he might most justly deprive them of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the no use they have made of it; and
we might have great reason to believe so
from our Saviours words,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 29.</note> 
               <hi>To him that hath
shall be given, but from him that hath not,
shall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi>
So that not making use of this Talent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
gives us just reason to question,
whether God continues it, supposing he had
once given it to the Guides of the Church,
since the Apostles days: which I see no reason
to believe.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:50175:96"/>
            <p>2. His next exception is from a saying of
Dr. <hi>Fields,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> 
               <hi>who,</hi> he saith, <hi>seems to advance a
contrary Principle in his Preface to his Books
of the Church.</hi> But O the mischief of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place-Books!
which make men write
what they find, and not what is to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For after all, Dr. <hi>Field</hi> doth but seem
to advance another Principle in his opinion,
and doth not so much as seem to do it in mine.
For that learned and judicious Writer sets
himself purposely to disprove the Infallibility
of the Church in the beginning of his fourth
Book; and is it probable that any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
understanding would assert that in his
Preface, which he had disproved in his Book?
It is a known distinction in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> of the Church Virtual, representative
and essential; by the two first are meant
Popes and Councils; and of these two,
Dr. <hi>Field</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Field <hi>of the Church</hi> l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. ch 5. p. 350.</note> 
               <hi>that they may erre in matters
of greatest Consequence;</hi> yet these are <hi>N. O's.</hi>
infallible Guides, whose conduct he supposeth
men obliged to follow, and to yield their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
assent to. Concerning the essential
Church, he saith,<note place="margin">Ch. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>That it either comprehends
all the faithful that are and have been since
Christ appeared in the flesh; and then,</hi> he
saith, <hi>it is absolutely free from all errour and
ignorance of divine things, that are to be
known by Revelations; or as it comprehends
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50175:97"/>
only all those Believers that are and have been
since the Apostles times; and in this sense,</hi> he
saith, <hi>the whole Church may be ignorant in
sundry things, which are not necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but he thinks it impossible for the
whole Church to erre in anything of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But in things that cannot be clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Rule of Faith, and word of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and heavenly Truth, we think it possible,
that all that have written of such things might
erre and be deceived. But if the Church be
taken only as it comprehends the Believers that
now are, and presently live in the world,</hi> he
saith, <hi>it is certain and agreed upon, that in
things necessary to be known and believed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and distinctly, it never is ignorant, much
less doth erre. Yea in things that are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be known and believed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
and distinctly, we constantly believe
that this Church can never erre, nor doubt
pertinaciously, but that there shall ever be some
found ready to embrace the truth, if it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
to them, and such as shall not wholly
neglect the search and enquiry after it, as times
and means give leave.</hi> But if we mean by a
Church, any particular <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 5.</note> he determines,
<hi>That particular men and Churches may erre
damnably, because notwithstanding others
may worship God aright; but that the whole
Church at one time cannot so erre, for that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50175:97"/>
then the Church should cease utterly for a time,
and so not be Catholick being not at all times;
and Christ should sometimes be without a
Church; yet, that errors not prejudicing the
salvation of them that erre may be found in
the Church, that is at one time in the world, we
make no doubt; only the Symbolical and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
which is and was being wholly free from
error.</hi> Which several expressions amount to
no more than this, that there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
some true Christians in the World;
but what is this to infallible Teachers and
Guides, in a Church that pretends to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
against all the sense and reason in the
World? And is it now imaginable after all
this, that Dr. <hi>Field</hi> should make any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church infallible? No, all that he means
in his Preface, is this, that <hi>among all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of men, persons who have not leisure or
capacity to examine particular Controversies,
ought diligently to search which is the true
Church, and having done this, to embrace
her communion, follow her directions, and rest
in her judgment, i.e.</hi> Suppose a man by that
very Book of Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> should be convinced
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is a very corrupt and
tyrannical Church, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is a sound and good Church (which was
the design of his writing it,) he being thus far
satisfied, ought <hi>to embrace the communion of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50175:98"/>
this Church, and so follow her directions, and
rest in her judgment,</hi> so, as not to forsake her
communion for any cavils that are raised about
particular Controversies of which he is not a
capable judge. And doth this make the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> infallible? If we say that
a man being first satisfied of the skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of a Lawyer, ought to follow his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and <hi>rest in his judgment;</hi> doth this
make that Lawyer <hi>infallible?</hi> so we say here,
the <hi>resting in the judgment of a Church,</hi> of
whose integrity we have assurance before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
implies only the supposition of so much
honesty and skill in a Church, as may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
the Judgments of persons who either have
not leisure or capacity to understand particular
Controversies which require skill in Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
search into the Fathers and later Writers
on both sides. If we say, that unlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
ought in such things to trust the learned,
whose integrity they have no ground to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
this doth not certainly make the more
learned infallible? But we may rest in the
judgment of those whom we have no reason
to suspect, though we believe them not to be
infallible: and it was the former Dr. <hi>Field</hi>
meant, and by no means any infallibility, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he plainly contradict himself.</p>
            <p>3. He excepts,<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That this brings in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errability
of every particular Christian in all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50175:98"/>
points necessary, if such Christians will, that is,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f only they shall sincerely endeavour to know
the meaning of them.</hi> The force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be easily discerned if we put another
parallel to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they who assert from
Scripture the assistance of Divine Grace to
the sincere endeavours of men, do make all
men imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccable <hi>if they will;</hi> as well as those
who assert, that God will not be wanting in
necessaries to salvation to those who sincerely
endeavour to know them, make all such men
so far infallible, if they will. If any one thing
be plain in Scripture, the goodness of God is;
and who can believe that, and yet think that
he will suffer those who sincerely endeavour to
know what is necessary to their salvation,
not to understand it? But besides, how often
doth the Scripture promise a greater degree of
knowledge <hi>to the meek and humble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to the
diligent and industrious;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>to those that ask
and seek wisdom from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 11. 13.</note> 
               <hi>to those that do
the will of God,</hi> to whom our Saviour hath
expresly promised,<note place="margin">John 7. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that they shall know of his
doctrine, whether it be of God or no?</hi> And
if this be the <hi>inerrability</hi> he means, he sees
what grounds we have to assert it. But we
understand not by it, that such persons cannot
erre in their judgments about what things are
necessary, and what not; nor that they cannot
erre in other things which are not so necessary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50175:99"/>
to salvation; but that Gods goodness is so
great, and his promises so plain, and his word
so clear in necessary things, that no one who
sincerely endeavours to know them, shall ever
miss of salvation. And if such an infallibility
will satisfie them, we do not deny it to Popes
themselves, or other Guides of the Church,
on condition they do not think themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
beyond these bounds; for they are
only the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> whom God hath
promised <hi>to teach his way,</hi> and not such who
will be infallible whether God will or no.</p>
            <p>His other exceptions from <hi>this principle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
Church-Authority, from the parity
of reason for Church Governors, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
places of Scripture</hi> shall be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
afterwards.</p>
            <p>2. I now come to examine what certainty
there is for this Infallibility?<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Here I shall lay
down some principles of common reason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>N. O's.</hi> Proofs of Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> by
which we may better understand the force of
his arguments.</p>
            <p>1. That the Proof ought always to be
more evident than the thing that is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by it. For otherwise it is of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the proof of it, if it have but the same
degree of evidence; but is a great prejudice to
it, if it have less: so that if the proofs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
be equally obscure and difficult with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50175:99"/>
those things which are to be believed by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of it, this Infallibility is of no use; but if
they be less evident, the pretence of it is both
very ridiculous and prejudicial to the Christian
Faith.</p>
            <p>2. The greater concernment any Law is of,
and the greater danger in mistaking the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, the more plain and distinct ought
the terms of that Law to be. As a Law about
the succession of the Crown ought to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with all the clearness and distinctness
imaginable, because the peace and security of
a Nation depends upon it. So in case Christ
hath appointed any Successor in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Church, or entailed Infallibility
upon the Guides of it: this being a matter of
such infinite concernment to the whole
Church; it is most unreasonable to conceive
that whatever other parts of his Will were
obscure, those which relate to the matter
of Succession and Infallibility, should be
so; but rather so plain, that no one can miss
of understanding them, because the weight of
all the rest depends upon these two; and it is
so horrible a presumption in any to pretend to
them, in case they have no right to them, and
the danger so great in relying upon them if
there be no such thing.</p>
            <p>3. A Law of such universal concernment to
the Faith and Peace of the Christian Church
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50175:100"/>
being supposed, the practice of the best and
purest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Ages of the Church must be supposed
agreeable thereto, <hi>i. e.</hi> that in all matters
of difference they did constantly own these
infallible Judges, by appealing to them for a
final issue of all debates, and resting satisfied
with their decisions. But if on the contrary,
when great differences have happened in and
nearest the first times, no such Authority was
made use of, but other ways put in practice to
make an end of them; if when it was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it was slighted and rejected; nay, if the
persons pretending it, were proceeded against
and condemned, and this not by a popular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but by just and legal Authority; we
may thence conclude that such Judges have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
that power to themselves, which was
not given them by the Supreme Legislator.
These things being premised, I come to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Arguments, which lie scattered<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>up and
down; but to give them the greater strength,
I shall bring them nearer together. And they
are drawn either from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi>
or <hi>parity of Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>From Scripture.</hi> And in truth the only
satisfactory Argument in a matter of so great
concernment to the Christian Church, ought
only to be drawn from thence, unless we will
suppose the Scripture defective in the most
important things. For this being pleaded as a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50175:100"/>
thing necessary for the Peace of the Church
by some, and for the Faith of Christians by
others; so much greater the necessity of it is,
so much clearer ought the evidence of it to be
in Scripture, supposing that to be intended to
reveal the Will of God to us in matters of
the greatest necessity. But it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by our Adversaries, that the places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by them for a constant Infallibility in
the Guides of the Church, do not necessarily
prove it; because they are very capable of
being understood, as to the Infallibility only
of the Apostles in the first Age and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Christian Church: is it then to be
imagined that if Christ had intended such an
Infallibility as the foundation of the Faith and
Peace of his Church, he would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
his mind more plainly and clearly than
he is pretended to do in this matter? How
easily might all the contentions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World have been prevented, if Christ
had caused it to be delivered in terms so clear,
as the nature of the thing doth require? If he
had said, <hi>I do promise my Infallible Spirit to
the Guides of the Church in all Ages, to give
the true sense of Scripture in all controversies
which shall arise among Christians, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
an obedience suitably to all their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:</hi>
or, more particularly, <hi>I appoint the
Bishops of Rome in all Ages for my Successors in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50175:101"/>
the Government of the Church, who shall be the
standing and infallible Iudges of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
among Christians;</hi> this dispute might
never have happened among us. For we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them that we account the peace of the
Church so valuable a thing, and obedience to
Christs Commands so necessary a duty, that
we are well enough inclined to embrace the
doctrine of Infallibility, if we could see any
ground in Scripture for it. But we cannot
make persons infallible by believing them to
be so, but we may easily make our selves fools,
as others have done, by believing it without
reason. The controversie then is not, whether
Infallibility in the Guides of the Church be a
desirable thing or not, for so we say impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is too; but the question is, whether
there be any such thing promised by Christ to
the Guides of his Church, and whether all
Christians on that account are bound to yield
their internal assent, as well as external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all their decrees? which we deny,
and desire to see it clearly proved from his
words who alone could grant this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>For if an infallible Judge be therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
because the Scripture is not sufficiently
clear for ending of Controversies, and that
God hath actually constituted such a Judge,
cannot be proved but by Scripture, surely we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50175:101"/>
have all the reason in the World to expect that
the Scripture should be abundantly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all contradiction clear in this point, to
make amends for its obscurity in the rest: For
if this Point be not clearly proved, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the nearer an end of Controversies: because
the business stops at the very head, and they
may beg their hearts out, before we shall ever
be so good natured as to grant it them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof. And they who have been so bold
(shall I say? or blasphemous) as to charge our
Lord with <hi>want of discretion,</hi> in case he have
not provided his Church with such an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judge, do certainly render him much
more obnoxious to this imputation, in suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him to have constituted such a Judge, if
he have no where plainly declared that he hath
done so. And let them, if they can, produce one
clear Text of Scripture to this purpose, which
by the unanimous consent of the Fathers is so
interpreted; and which, to the common sense
of Mankind, is more sufficiently clear for the
ending this Controversie, than the Scripture
is said by them to be in other necessary Points
of Faith. And till they have done this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own way of arguing, we have
as much reason to deny their Infallibility, as
they have to demand our assent to it, upon the
presumed obscurity and insufficiency of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:50175:102"/>
When I came thus prepared to find what
the Considerator would produce in a matter
of such consequence,<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> I soon discerned how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
mind he had to insist upon any proofs of
that,<note place="margin">Of the Arguments from Scripture for Infallibility.</note> which is his only Engine to overthrow
my Principles. For after the most diligent
search I could make, the only Argument from
<hi>Scripture</hi> I found produced, was from the Old
Testament, (where I confess I least looked for
it) but however, this is thought so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as to be twice produced;<note place="margin">

               </gap>oves the Judges in <hi>Westminster</hi>

any Guide of the Christian Church. For the

               <hi>according to whose
sentence matters were to be determined, upon
penalty of death in case of disobedience.</hi> But
what then? doth this imply infallibility? no,
that he dares not stand to, but absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,;
which we are ready to yield when
we see the like absolute command for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Judges of Controversies of Religion,
as there was among the <hi>Iews</hi> for their supreme
<hi>Iudges</hi> in matters of Law. But of this place I
have already spoken at large,<note place="margin">Ration. Account. p. 1. ch. 8. Sect. 2. p. 239.</note> and shewed how
impertinently it is produced for Infallibility in
the Book, he often referrs to, and might, if he
had thought fit, have answered what is there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50175:102"/>
said before he had urged it again, without any
new strength added to it.</p>
            <p>But since he produces no other proof for it,
I must consider how he goes about to weaken
mine against it. Two things I insisted upon
against such a pretence of Infallibility, <hi>viz.</hi>
That such a pretence implying an Infallible
Assistance of the Spirit of God, there were but
two ways of proving it, either, 1. By such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as the Apostles wrought to attest their
infallibility, or 2. By those <hi>Scriptures</hi> from
whence this Infallibility is derived. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both these I laid down two Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the Proof by <hi>miracles.</hi> The
Proposition was this.</p>
            <p>There can be no more intollerable usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Faith of Christians than for any
Person or Society of men to pretend to an Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
as Infallible in what they propose,<note place="margin">Prop. 16,</note> as
was in Christ or his Apostles, without giving
an equal degree of evidence that they are so
assisted as Christ and his Apostles did, <hi>viz.</hi>
by miracles as great, publick, and convincing
as theirs were; by which I mean such as are
wrought by those very persons who challenge
this Infallibility, and with a design for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of those who do not believe it.</p>
            <p>To this he answers:<note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 1. <hi>That I am equally
obliged to produce miracles for the Churches
Infallibility in Fundamentals, which I had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50175:103"/>
asserted in the defence of the Archbishop.</hi> But
this admits a very easie answer; for when I
speak of Infallibility in Fundamentals, I there
declare that I mean no more by it, than that
there shall be always a number of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the World. And what necessity is
there now of miracles for men to believe, since
they receive the doctrine of the Gospel upon
those miracles by which it was at first attested.
Neither is there any need of miracles to shew
that any number of men are not guilty of an
actual errour in what they believe, supposing
they declare to believe only on the account of
that divine Revelation which is owned by
Christians; for in this case the trial of doctrine
is to be by Scripture. But in case any persons
challenge an Infallibility to themselves ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
to the belief of Scriptures, and by
vertue of which, they say, men must believe
the Scriptures, then I say such persons are
equally bound to prove their infallibility by
miracles as the Apostles were.</p>
            <p>2. Not resting in this, he proceeds to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer,<note place="margin">P. 28, 29.</note> the sum of which is, <hi>That the
Infallibility of the Church not being so large
or so high as the Apostles, but consisting only
in the Infallible delivery of the same doctrine,
there is no necessity of miracles in the present
Church.</hi> To this I answer, That the doctrine
of the Gospel may be said to be new two ways;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50175:103"/>
1. In respect of the matter contained in it,
and so it was new only when it was first revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
2. In respect of the person who is to
believe it: so it is new in every age to those
who are first brought to believe it. Now the
Apostles had their infallibility attested by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
not barely with a respect to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of new matter, for then none would
have needed miracles but Christ himself, or
the Apostles that made the first Sermons; for
afterwards the matter was not new, but the
necessity of miracles was to give a sufficient
motive to believe, to all those to whom the
Gospel was proposed; and therefore miracles
are said to be a <hi>a sign to unbelievers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 22.</note> For by
these, Unbelievers were convinced that there
was sufficient ground for receiving the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel on the Authority of those
who delivered it;<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>God himself bearing them
witness with divers miracles and gifts of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> Suppose then, any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
after their first preaching continued only
to inculcate the same doctrine for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of more Unbelievers; in this case the
evidence of miracles was the reason of relying
on the Authority of those persons for the
truth of the Doctrine delivered by them.
From whence it follows, that where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith is to be received on the Authority
of any persons in any Age, those persons
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50175:104"/>
ought to confirm that Authority by miracles,
as the Apostles did. For without this, there
can be no such Authority whereon to rely, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
to the embracing the Christian
Faith. Now, this is the case of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> they pretend not to deliver any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
wholly new, but what was one way or
another delivered by Christ and his Apostles;
(although we therein charge them with fraud
and falshood) but yielding this, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that no man can have sufficient ground
for believing the Word of God, but from
their Churches Infallibility; in this case it is
plain that they make their Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to be as much the reason of persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
as the Infallibility of the Apostles in
their time was; and therefore I say, they
ought to prove this Infallibility in the same
way, and by miracles, as great, publick, and
convincing, as the Apostles did. 3. Yet he is
very loath to let go the miracles of their
Church, done in later times as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.<note place="margin">P. 29.</note>
It would be too large a task in this
place to examine the miracles of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, (that may be better done on another
occasion,) all that I have here to say is, that
all the miracles pretended among them, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
nothing to our present purpose, unless those
miracles give evidence of the Authority and
Infallibility of those by whom they were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50175:104"/>
done; and they would do well to shew, where
ever in Scripture God did bestow a gift of
miracles upon any but for this end: and what
reason there is that God should alter the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and course of his providence, in a matter
of so great concernment to the Faith of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Such miracles as were wrought by
Christ and his Apostles we defie all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
in the World to produce any like them
to confirm their Doctrine; but such as the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends, scarce any Religion
in the World but hath pretended to the same.
And <hi>for his most credible Histories</hi> he vouches
for them, I hope he doth not mean <hi>the Church
History written by S. C.</hi> nor any other such
<hi>Legends</hi> among them; if he doth, I assure
him they have a very easie Faith that think
them credible. And if <hi>all miracles</hi> that are so
called, by those among whom they are done,
<hi>be an Argument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P 30.</note> as he saith, <hi>of the security of
salvation in the Communion and Faith of that
Church wherein they are done,</hi> I hope he will
be so just, to allow the same to the <hi>Arrians,
Novatians, Donatists,</hi> and others, who all
pretend to <hi>miracles</hi> as well as the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> as any one that is versed in <hi>Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
may easily see. But of this more at large
elsewhere.</p>
            <p>2. Concerning the proof of <hi>Infallibility</hi>
from <hi>Scripture,</hi> I said down this Proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50175:105"/>
Nothing can be more absurd,<note place="margin">Prop. 17.</note> than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the necessity of such an infallible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and assistance to assure us of the truth
of those Writings, and to interpret them; and
at the same time to prove that Commission
from those Writings from which we are told,
nothing can be certainly deduced, such an Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
not being supposed; or to pretend that
Infallibility in a Body of men, is not as liable
to doubts and disputes, as in those Books
from whence only they derive their Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>He grants the former part of this,<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> 
               <hi>if by it
be intended to prove such Commission only, or
in the first place from these writings. But,</hi> he
saith, <hi>a Christians Faith may begin either at
the Infallible authority of Scriptures, or of the
Church:</hi> It seems then, there may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground for a Christians Faith, as to the
Scriptures, without believing any thing of
the Churches Infallibility; and for this we
have reason to thank him, whatever they of
his own Church think of it. For, by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
we may believe the Scriptures Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without ever believing a word of the
Churches Infallibility; and let them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
prove it from <hi>Scripture</hi> if they can.
Nay he goes yet farther, and saith, <hi>That the
Infallibility of Scriptures as well as the Church
may be proved from its own testimony:</hi> but he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50175:105"/>
first supposes, that the Infallibility of one of
these, be first learnt from <hi>Tradition.</hi> And
therefore in the remainder of his discourse on
this Subject, he shews <hi>how the Infallibility of
the Church may be proved from Tradition</hi> not
shewing at all how the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> can be proved from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scripture being thus deserted,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> as to the
proof of the Churches Infallibility,<note place="margin">Of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> I must
pursue him to his other Hold of Tradition.
The method of his discourse is this; <hi>That the
Infallibility of the Guides of the Church was
antecedent to the Scriptures;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>That the Apostles
did not lose their infallibility by committing
what they preached to writing; That their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
were to have this infallibility preserved
in them, if there had been no writings; and
cannot be imagined to have lost it because of
them, because these give testimony to it; That
this Infallibility is preserved by Tradition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
from Age to Age, as we say the Canon
of Scripture is delivered to us; And lastly,
That the Governours of the Church always
held and reputed themselves infallible, appears
by their Anathematizing dissenters.</hi> In this
Discourse there are some things supposed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason, and other things asserted without
proof. The Foundation of all this Discourse
proceeds upon the supposition that the same
Infallibility which was in the Apostles, must
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50175:106"/>
be continued in their Successors through all
Ages of the Church, for which I see not the
least shadow of reason produced. <hi>Yes,</hi> saith
he, <hi>supposing there had been no Writings, and
no Infallibility, Christian Religion would have
been no rational and well grounded, no stable
and certain Religion.</hi> Two things in answer
to this, I desire to be informed of: 1. What he
thinks of the Religion of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who
received their Religion by Tradition, without
any such Infallibility? 2. What he thinks
of those Christians who receive the Scriptures
or Churches Infallibility by vertue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and universal Tradition (which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the ground of the one, and supposed by
him to be of the other) whether the Faith
of such persons be rational and well-grounded,
stable, and certain, or not; if it be, then there
is no such necessity of Infallibility for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
if it be not, then he doth hereby declare
that the Faith of Christians is <hi>irrational</hi> and
ill-grounded. For whatsoever is received on
the account of Tradition antecedent to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Infallibility, cannot be received on the
account of it; but the belief of either Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or Churches Infallibility, must be first
received by vertue of a principle antecedent to
the Scriptures or Churches Infallibility, <hi>viz.</hi>
Tradition. By this it appears, that his very
way of proving, destroys the thing he would
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50175:106"/>
prove by it: For if the Tradition may be a
sufficient ground of Faith, how comes Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to be necessary? But if this Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be not necessary without the Scriptures,
much less certainly is it now, since it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
on both sides, that the Apostles
were infallible in their Writings, and that
therein the Will of God is contained as to all
things simply necessary to salvation. <hi>But these
successors of the Apostles were not deprived of
their infallibility by the Apostles Writings;</hi>
No certainly, for none can be deprived of what
they never had; but where are the reasons all
this while, to shew that there was the same
necessity of Infallibility in the Apostles suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
as was in them? Two I find rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
than insisted upon. 1. <hi>That the Church
would otherwise have failed, if there had been
neither Writings nor Infallibility;</hi> But if this
Argument hold for any thing, it is for
the necessity of the Scriptures, and not of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;
for we see God did furnish the
Church with one, and left no footsteps of the
other. We do not dispute how far the Church
might have been preserved without the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
we find it hath been hard enough to
preserve it pure with them: but we always
acknowledge the Infinite Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, that hath not left us in matters of
Faith and Salvation to the determinations of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50175:107"/>
men liable to be corrupted by Interest and
Ambition, but hath appointed men inspired
by himself to set down whatever is necessary
for us to believe and practise. And upon
these Writings we fix our Faith, as on a firm
and unmovable Rock; and on the veracity of
God therein contained and expressed, we build
all our hopes of a Blessed Eternity. And one
great benefit more we have by these divine
Books, that by them we can so easily discover
the fraud and imposture of the confident Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Infallibility. Which is the true
reason why the Patrons of the Church of
<hi>Romes</hi> Infallibility have so little kindness for
the Scriptures, and take all occasions to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
them, by insinuating that they are good
for nothing but to breed Heresies in the Heads
of the People; upon pretence of which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they hide this Candle under a Bushel, lest
it should give too much light to them that are
in the House, and discover some things which
it is more convenient to keep in the dark.</p>
            <p>2. He saith, <hi>The Infallibility of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
successors, receives a second evidence from
the testimony thereof found also in these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
I confess I have seen nothing like the
<hi>first</hi> evidence yet, to which this should be a
<hi>second;</hi> but if by the <hi>first</hi> be meant that which
I mentioned before, this is a proper <hi>second</hi> for
it. Neither of them, I dare say, intend any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50175:107"/>
mischief to any body; both first and second
are forced into the Field, where they stand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for dumb shews, and wonder what they are
brought for. But whereabouts I pray doth
this <hi>second Testimony</hi> stand? what are its wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons?
I hope not <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> nor <hi>Dabo tibi
Claves,</hi> nor any of the old rusty Armour which
our modern Combatants begin to be ashamed
to appear with in the Field. And to speak
truth, <hi>N. O.</hi> seems to understand his Art better
than to meddle with such heavy and Antique
Armour, which every one hath been foiled
with that hath undertaken to combat with
them; only it seems a little for the credit of
their Cause to point to such a Magazine, which
in the days of Ignorance and Credulity, the
Romantick Age of the Church, was in great
request. But we must now buckle our selves
to a new manner of Combat, which is from
the Tradition of the Church, and that of the
very same nature with what we have for the
<hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> This I confess is bright
shining Armour, and may do great service if it
will hold; but that must be judged upon trial,
which I now set my self to. But we shall find
that no weapons formed against Truth can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper:
and it hath been long observed of <hi>Rome</hi>
that it could never endure a close Siege.</p>
            <p>The Question now is, whether they of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church have the same universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50175:108"/>
for the Infallibility of the Guides of it,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have for the Canon of Scripture? w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he
asserts. It is I suppose agreed on both sides, That
the Tradition on w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we receive and believe the
Scriptures to be the Word of God was universal
as to all Ages and Times of the Church; that
from the beginning all disputes in Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
true Christians, were built upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of it; That in no Age any persons were
allowed to be good Christians who made doubt
of it; That every Age doth afford plentiful
testimonies of the belief of it. This is that
universal Tradition we receive the Scriptures
upon; and let any thing like this be produced
for the Infallibility of the Guides of their
Church, and we yield up the Cause to them.
Can any fairer terms than these be desired?
But we expect proofs, and so I perceive we
may do to the Worlds end. I commend the
Ingenuity of <hi>N. O.</hi> for endeavouring to escape
out of the circle any way; but I believe they
think themselves as wise, who still dance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, knowing the impossibility of doing any
good in this other way. The only Argument
he insists upon is so weak, that I wonder he had
not considered how often it had been answered
by their own Writers. For it is certain that
Provincial Councils as well as General, have
<hi>Anathematized dissenters, and pronounced
them Hereticks,</hi> which is his only Argument
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50175:108"/>
to prove this Tradition of the Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility;<note place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. l. 2. c. 10.</note>
and they had no way to answer it,
but by saying, this doth not imply their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
And if it doth not in the case of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils; why should he think it doth
in the case of General? For the <hi>Anathema's</hi>
of <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> did not relate to the
acceptation of their Decrees, either by the
Pope, or the whole Church, as <hi>N. O.</hi> supposes,
but did proceed upon their own assurance of
the truth of what they decreed; otherwise
their <hi>Anathema's</hi> would have been only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
and not absolute and peremptory as
we see they were. But I need give no other
answer to this Argument than in the words of
Dr. <hi>Field</hi> whom <hi>N. O.</hi> appealed to before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>l. 4 c</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>viz.
That Councils denounce Anathema not because
they think every one that disobeyeth the Decree
of the Council to be accursed, but because they
are perswaded in particular, that this is the
eternal truth of God which they propose, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they accurse them that obstinately shall
resist, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>willeth every Christian man
to Anathematize an Angel coming from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if he shall teach him any other doctrine
than he hath already learned: yet is not every
particular Christian free from possibility of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
If the Argument then were good from
Anathematizing dissenters, and calling them
Hereticks, every particular person must by it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50175:109"/>
be proved Infallible; who are bound to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize
even Angels from Heaven in case
of delivering any other doctrine from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
so that this, which is his only Argument
in stead of proving an universal Tradition
would prove an universal Infallibility.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader now judge in his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whether here be any thing offered in the
way of Tradition for the Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that may bear the least proportion with
the Tradition on which we receive the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures?
And yet if this had been true, it had
been almost impossible that any one Age
should have passed without remarkable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of it. For no Age of the Church hath
been so happy as not to have occasion for an
Infallible Judge of Controversies, if any such
had been appointed by Christ: and therefore
it cannot be imagined, but that Christians
must in all Controversies arising have appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, and stood to his determinations;
which must have been as well known in the
practice of the Church, as Judges trying Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall. But I challenge him
to produce any one Age since the Apostles
times to this day, wherein the Infallibility of
a standing Judge of Controversies appointed
by Christ, hath been received by as universal
a consent as the Authority of Scripture hath
been in that very Age. Nay, I except not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50175:109"/>
that Age which hath been since the Council
of <hi>Trent;</hi> for the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
have been received of all sides, but
the Infallibility of a standing Judge is utterly
denied by one side, and vehemently disputed
between several parties on the other. Some
making only the Essential Church infallible,
others the representative in Councils, others
again the virtual, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
any infallible Judge necessary; it stands
to reason it should be rather in one than in a
multitude, and rather in a constant succession
of Bishops in one See, than in an uncertain
number who cannot be convened together as
often as the necessities of the Church may
require. But this is so far from being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as an Universal Tradition in that very
Age wherein we live, that onely one busie
Party in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do maintain it,
Many others eagerly opposing it, and all the
Princes and States in Christendom do in their
actions, if not in words, deny it. And is not
this now an Universal Tradition fit to be
matched with that of the Scriptures? I had
once thought to have brought testimonies o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
of every Age of the Christian Church mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
disproving any such Tradition of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility;
and that not only of private persons
when there were no Councils, but from the
most solemn Acts of Councils, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50175:110"/>
of their own Writers; but that would
swell this Answer to too great a Bulk, and is
not needful where so very little is offered for
the proof of it. And yet I shall be ready to
do it, when any thing more important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it.</p>
            <p>I now return to his exceptions against the
latter part of the former proposition, <hi>viz. That
Infallibility in a Body of men, is as liable to
doubts and disputes, as in those Books from
whence only they derive their Infallibility.</hi>
The plain meaning of which is, that it is a
foolish thing to make use of a <hi>medium</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
as the thing which is to be proved by
it; and therefore if the Infallibility of the
the Church be as liable to doubts and disputes
as that of the Scriptures, it is against all just
Laws of reasoning to make use of the Churches
Infallibility to prove the Scriptures by. And
to this no answer can be proper, but either by
saying that there is no absurdity in such a way
of proving; or else that the Infallibility of the
Church is more certain and evident than that
of the Scriptures. Which I should be glad
to see undertaken by any man who pretends to
sense; which <hi>N. O.</hi> doth too much to meddle
with it; and therefore fairly shuffles it off, and
turns my words quite to another meaning, as
though they had been spoken of the <hi>doubtful
sense of the Decrees of Councils,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50175:110"/>
elsewhere I had sufficient reason to
speak of, yet that was not pertinent to this
place. But this was a way to escape by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something, though not at all to the purpose;
and yet he gives no sufficient answer to that
sense he puts upon my words, by bringing a
Commentary upon them out of words used by
me in another Discourse. Wherein I did at
large argue against the Infallibility of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils,<note place="margin">Rat. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. ch. 1. Sect. 4. p. 510.</note> and after disproving it in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
I undertook to prove, that no man can
have any certainty of Faith as to the Decrees
of any Council; because men can have no
certainty of Faith that this was a General
Council, that it passed such Decrees, that it
proceeded lawfully in passing them, and that
this is the certain meaning of them; all which
are necessary in order to the believing those
Decrees to be infallible with such a Faith as
they call divine. The words produced by
him do speak of the doubtful sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Decrees of Councils, by which I
shew that men can have no more certainty of
the meaning of them, than of doubtful places
of Scripture, not as though I supposed it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<hi>for Councils to give a clear decision
in matters of controversie, so as that men might
understand their meaning;</hi> but I expresly
mention such Decrees as are purposely fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in general terms, and with ambiguous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50175:111"/>
pressions to give satisfaction to the several dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Parties; for which I instanced in
some of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> whose ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
is most manifest by the disputes about
their meaning raised by some who were present
at the making of them. I am far enough from
denying <hi>that a Commentary may make a Text
plainer, or that a Iudges sentence can be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
than the Law; or that any Council can, or
hath decided any thing clearer than the thing
that is in controversie;</hi> which are his exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions:
but I say, if Councils pretend to do
more than the Scriptures, and to decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
for the satisfaction of the World,
and that men ought to have that certainty of
Faith by them, which they cannot have by
the Scriptures, they ought never to be liable
to the same ambiguity and obscurity upon the
account of which the Scripture is rejected from
being a certain rule of Faith. <hi>For,</hi> as he saith
well, <hi>Infallibility alone ends not Controversies,
but clearness; clearness in the point contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:</hi>
which if Councils want, they are as
unfit to end Controversies as the Scriptures
can be pretended to be. But this is not the
thing intended by me in this Proposition and
therefore it needs no farther answer; for the
only subject of that Proposition, is the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church, and not the clearness of
the Decrees of Councils.</p>

But I cannot admire the ingenuity of this
way of answering me, by putting another sense
upon my words than they will bear; and by
drawing words out of another Discourse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shewing the purpose for which they are
there used, and leaving out the most material
passages which tended to the clearing of them.
If <hi>N. O.</hi> thinks fit to oppose that whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
against the Infallibility of General
Councils, and set down fairly the several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
I should be then too blame not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
a just answer: but I am not bound to
follow him in such strange excursions, from
the 17. Proposition of this Book to a single
passage in a larger Book, and from that back
to another at a mighty distance in the same
Book; which being dismembred from the
Body of the Discourse, must needs lose much
of their strength. Yet with all the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he takes them (which is such, that the
best Book in the World may be confuted in
that manner) he hath no great cause to glory
in the execution he hath done upon them. In

it is easily answered, that the event
shews it to be far otherwise, for how many
disputes are there concerning the power of
determining matters of Faith? to whom it
belongs, in what way it must be managed,
whether Parties ought to be heard in matters
of Doctrine, what the meaning of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are when they are made, which raise as
many divisions as were before them; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Decrees of the Council of

to the five Propositions; so that upon
the whole it appears setting aside force and
fraud, which are excellent Principles of
Christian Unity, we are upon as fair terms
of Union as they are among themselves.</q> I
do not therefore say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath no advantage at all in point of Unity, but
that all the advantage it hath, comes from
<hi>force</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> and setting these aside, we
are upon as good terms of Union as they; and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50175:112"/>
we do not envy them the effects of Tyranny and
Deceit. It is the Union of Christians we
contend for, and not of Slaves or Fools; we
leave the Turk and the Pope to vie with each
other in this kind of Unity, (although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Turk hath much the advantage in
it) and I freely yield to <hi>N. O.</hi> that they have
a juster pretence to <hi>Vnity without Truth</hi> than
we. Which is agreeable to what he pleads

pretences to Unity on both sides, that I have
at large done in a whole Chapter in the late
Book, and if <hi>N. O.</hi> had intended any thing to
purpose against me on this subject, he ought
much rather to have fallen on a just Discourse
than two such lame Clauses as he makes these
to be by his citation of them. And when he

               <hi>that it is repugnant to the nature of the

persons who sincerely endeavour to know the
meaning of them in all such things as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to their salvation; from hence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs,</hi>
That if every Christian may become thus
infallible in necessaries, from 1. a clear rule.
2. a due Industry used; 3. and a certainty
that it is so used; may not the Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
still much rather be allowed Infallible,
and so retain still their infallible Guideship;
and the people also, the more clear the rule of
Faith is proved to be, the more securely be
referred to their direction? and have we not
all reason to presume that the chief Guides of
the Church (even a General Council of them,
or if it be but a major part of this Council,
'tis sufficient) in their consults concerning a
point necessary to salvation delivered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
use at least so much endeavour (for more
needs not) as a plain Rustick doth, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the meaning of it, and also the like sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity?
For what they define for others, they
define for themselves also, and their salvation
is as much concerned as any other mans is, in
their mistakes. And next, why may not these
Governours upon such certainty of a sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50175:113"/>
and clearness of the rule take upon
them to define these points and enjoyn an assent
to and belief of them to their subjects; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since it is affirmed that all those from
whom they require such obedience, if they please
to use a sincere endeavour may be certain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as well as they? And are we not here again
arrived at Church-infallibility, if not from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
divine assistance, only sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
being supposed? And thus doe not
his conditional Infallibility of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in necessaries, the condition being so easie,
necessarily inferr a moral impossibility of the
Churches erring in them; especially those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
being contracted to the Apostles Creed,
as it is by some.</p>
            <p>To lay open the weakness of this Discourse,
which appears fair and plausible at first view,
I shall give an account of these two things.</p>
            <p>1. What Infallibility I attribute to private
persons.</p>
            <p>2. How far the parity of reason will extend
to the Infallibility of the Guides of the
Church.</p>
            <p>1. As to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> by me attributed
to private persons; no such thing can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from my words; and I wish <hi>N. O.</hi> would
have kept to my own expressions, and not foist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that term of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> without which
all his Discourse would have betrayed its own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50175:114"/>
weakness. For take the terms which I laid
down, and apply them to the Guides of the
Church, and see what a mighty Infallibility
springs from them. For if it be repugnant to
the nature of the design, and to the wisdom and
goodness of God to give infallible assurance
to persons in writing his Will for the benefit
of mankind, if those Writings may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by all persons who sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to know the meaning of them in all such
things as are necessary for their salvation,
how doth it hence follow that the Guides of
the Church must be infallible in teaching
matters of Faith? If I had asserted that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons were infallible in determining
what was true, and what not; then I grant the
Argument would have much more held for
those whose office it is to guide and direct
others. But what he means by mens <hi>being
infallible in necessaries,</hi> I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
for it is capable of three several mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
1. That either men are infallible in
judging of necessaries to salvation; 2. or, That
men are infallible in teaching others what art
necessaries to salvation. Or 3. That men are
infallible in believing such things as are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> that such is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, and the clearness of Scriptures,
that no man who sincerely desires to know
what is necessary to salvation shall be deceived
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50175:114"/>
therein; and what is this any more than to
assert that God will not be wanting in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to mankind; and although I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for using the term of <hi>Infallibility</hi> thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
yet the thing it self I assert in that sense,
but in neither of the other: and what now can
be inferred from hence by a parity of reason,
but that the Guides of the Church, supposing
the same sincerity shall enjoy the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
which I know none ever denied them;
but what is this to their infallibility in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all matters of Faith? which is the only
thing to be proved by him. If he can prove
this as necessary for the salvation of mankind
as the other is, then he would do something
to his purpose, but not otherwise. So that all
this discourse proceeds upon a very false way
of reasoning from believing to teaching, and
from necessaries to salvation, to all matters of
Faith, which the Guides of the Church shall
propose to men.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>But may we not inferr, that if God will
not be wanting to particular persons in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
necessary to their salvation, much less
will he be wanting to the Guides of the Church
in all matters of Faith?</hi> No certainly, unless
it be proved that their Guidance is the only
means whereby men can understand what is
necessary to salvation; which is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by us, God having otherwise provided for
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50175:115"/>
that, by giving so clear a Rule in matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that no man who sincerely endeavours
to know such things shall fail therein. <hi>But
will not the same sincerity in the Guides of the
Church, extend to their knowing and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all matters of Faith?</hi> This is a thing
possible, and supposing God had entrusted
them with the infallible delivery of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, were not to be questioned; but
that is the thing still in dispute, and is not to
be supposed, without proving it by plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from those Books which are agreed on
both sides to contain the Will of God. Besides,
that no man that is acquainted with the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> will see reason to
be over-confident of the sincerity of Councils so
palpably influenced by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as
that was. <hi>But however is it not fit in these
matters that particular persons should rather
yield to the guidance of others, than to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their own reason?</hi> Which is <hi>N. O</hi>'s.
farther Argument in this matter, <hi>viz. That
a Fallibility being supposed, it is more fitting
to follow prudent and experienced, though
fallible persons direction rather than our own.</hi>
To this I answer in these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That God hath entrusted every man
with a faculty of discerning Truth and
Falshood;<note place="margin">§ 10.</note> supposing that there were no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the World to direct or guide him.<note place="margin">Of the Authority of the Guides of the Church</note> For
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50175:115"/>
without this there were no capacity in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to be instructed in matters of Religion;
and it were to no purpose, to offer any thing
to men to be believed, or to perswade them
to embrace any Religion. To make this
plain, I will suppose a Person come to years
of understanding, not yet professing any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Religion to whom the several Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in the world are proposed by men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the truth of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
the Jewish, and the Mahumetan:
He hears the several arguments brought for
each of them, and hath no greater opinion
of the teachers of one than of another, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know whether this person may not
see so much of the truth and excellency of
Christian Religion, above the rest as to
choose that and reject all the rest. I hope
no one will deny this; now if a man does
here upon his own judgment and reason
choose the Christian Religion, so as firmly
to believe it, then God hath given to men
such a faculty of judging, that upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of truth and falshood, he may embrace
the true Religion and reject the false, and
such a Faith is acceptable and pleasing to
God; Otherwise no man could embrace Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
at first upon good grounds.</p>
            <p>2. This faculty is not taken away, nor
men forbidden the exercise of it in the choice of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50175:116"/>
their Religion by any principle of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion; for our Saviour himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the Judgement of the persons he
endeavored to convince;<note place="margin">John 5. 36, 9.</note> he made use of many
arguments to perswade them, he directed
them in the way of finding out of truth, he
reproved those who would not search into the
things delivered to them. All which were
to no purpose at all, if men were not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the exercise of their own Judgements
about these matters. Accordingly we find
the Apostles appealing to the Judgements of
private and fallible persons concerning
what they said to them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 15</note> although themselves
were infallible, and had the greatest Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them; we find them, not bidding
<hi>the Guides of the Church p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ove all things and
the people held fast that which they delivered
them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 21.</note> but Commanding them indifferently
<hi>to prove all things and hold fast that which is
good, i. e.</hi> what upon examination they found
to be so; we find those commended, who
<hi>searched the Scriptures daily whether the
things proposed to them were so or no.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts: 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note> So
that we see the Christian Religion d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th not

Apostles do belong to those who are already
Christians, and that concerning the matters
proposed by their Guides; nay they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly

are all these things said, if men being once
Christians are no longer to exercise their own
Judgements, but deliver them up into the

               <hi>When the blind lead the blind

            </p>
            <p>4. The Authority of Guides in the Church
is not absolute and unlimited but confined
within certain bounds. Which if they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
they are no longer to be followed.<note place="margin">

with an infallible Spirit, than any other
Guides of the Church could pretend to be
ever since. Therefore no present Guides,
what ever names they go by, ought to usurp
such an Authority over the minds of men
which the Apostles themselves did not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50175:117"/>
although there were greater reason for
men to yield up their minds wholly to their
guidance. We are far from denying all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and just authority to be given to the
Guides of the Church; but we say that their
Authority not being absolute is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ined to

others to Judge of their proceedings; and
consequently men must exercise their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about the matters they determin whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be agreeable to that r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t.</p>
            <p>5. Where the Rule by which the Guides of
the Church are to proceed hath determined
nothing, there we say the Authority of the
Guides is to be submitted unto. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
there would be nothing le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the just Authority of the Guides it, in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50175:118"/>
exercise of that power which is committed to
the Governours of it; as the successours of the
Apostles in their care of the Christian
Church, although not in their Infallibility.</p>
            <p>6. We allow a very great Authority to the
Guides of the Catholick Church in the best
times of Christianity; and look upon the
concurrent sense of Antiquity as an excellent
means to understand the mind of Scripture in
places otherwise doubtful and obscure. We
prosess a great Reverence to the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church: but Especially when
assembled in free and General Councils; We
reject the ancient heresies condemned in
them; which we the rather believe to be
against the Scripture, because so ancient, so
wise and so great persons did deliver the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
doctrine, not only to be the sense of the
Church in their own time but ever since the
Apostles. Nay we reject nothing that can
be proved by an universal Tradition from the
Apostolical times downwards; but we have
so great an opinion of the Wisdom and Piety
of those excellent Guides of the Church in
the Primitive times, that we see no reason to
have those things forced upon us now, which
we offer to prove to be contrary to their
doctrine and practice. So that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
between us is not about the Authority
of the Guides of the Church, but whether
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50175:118"/>
the Guides of the Apostolical and Primitive
times ought not to have greater Authority
over us, than those of the present Church in
things wherein they contradict each other?
This is the true State of the Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us; and all the clamours of rejecting
the Authority of Church Guides are vain and
impertinent. But we profess to yield greater
reverence and submission of mind to Christ,
and his Apostles, than to any Guides of the
Church ever since: we are sure they spake by
an Infallible Spirit, and where they have
determined matters of Faith or practice, we
look upon it as arrogance and presumption in
any others to alter what they have declared.
And for the Ages since, we have a much
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eater esteem for those nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
times and so downwards, till Ignorance,
Ambition, and private Interests sway'd too
much among those who were called the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the Church. And that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of those who were members of it at the
same time; which makes us not to wonder
that such corruptions of doctrine and practice
should then come in: but we do justly wonder
at the sincerity of those who would not have
them reformed and taken away.</p>
            <p>7. In matters imposed upon us to believe
or practise which are repugnant to plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Scripture, or the Evidence offense,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50175:119"/>
or the grounds of Christian Religion; we
assert that no Authority of the present Guides
of a Church, is to overrule our faith or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
For there are some things so plain,
that no Man will be guided by anothers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in them; If any Philosopher did think
his Authority ought to overrule an Ignorant
Mans opinion, in saying the snow which he
saw to be white was not so; I would fain
know whether that Man did better to believe
his eyes or the prudent, experienc'd Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher?
I am certain, if I destroy the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of sense I must overthrow the grounds
of Christian Religion; and I am as certain if
I believe that not to be bread which my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
tell me is so, I must destroy the greatest
Evidence of sense; and which is fitter for me,
to reject that Evidence which assures my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to me, or that Authority which by
its impositions on my faith overthrows the
certainty of sense? We do not say that we are
to reject any doctrine delivered in Scripture
which concerns a Being infinitely above our
understanding, because we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all things contained in it; but in matters
lyable to sense and the proper objects of it,
we must beg pardon if we prefer the grounds
of our common Christianity before a novel
and monstrous figment, hatched in the times
of Ignorance and Barbarism, foster'd by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50175:119"/>
faction, and imposed by Tyranny. We find no
command so plain in Scripture that we must
believe the Guides of the Church in all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
as there is that we must not worship Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that we must pray with understanding, that
we must keep to our Saviours Institution of the
Lords supper; but if any Guides of a Church
pretend to an Authority to evacuate the force
of these Laws, we do not so much reject their
Authority, as prefer Gods above them. Doth
that Man destroy the authority of Parents, that
refuses to obey them, when they Command
him to commit Treason? That is our case in
this matter, supposing such Guides of a Church
which otherwise we are bound to obey, if they
require things contrary to a direct Command
of God, must we prefer their Guidance before
Gods? If they can prove us mistaken we yield,
but till then the Question is not, whether the
Guides of the Church must be submitted to
rather than our own reason? but whether Gods
authority or theirs must be obeyed? And I
would gladly know whether there be not some
Points of faith, and some parts of our duty,
so plain, that no Church-Authority deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the contrary ought to be obey'd?</p>
            <p>8. No absolute submission can be due to
those Guides of a Church who have opposed
and contradicted each other, and condemned
one an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther for errour and here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. For then
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50175:120"/>
in case of absolute submission a Man must
yield his assent to contradictions; and for the
same reason that he is to be a Catholick at one
time, he must be a heretick at another.
I hope the Guides of the present Church
pretend to no more infallibility and Authority
than their predecessours in the same Capacity
with themselves have had; and we say they
have contradicted the sense of those before
them in the matters in dispute between us.
Yet that is not the thing I now insist upon;
but that these Guides of the Church have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
each other to be fallible by condemning
their opinions and practices; and by that
means have made it necessary for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
those not to be infallible, unless both
parts of a contradiction may be infallibly true.
Suppose a Man living in the times of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of Arrianism, when almost all the
Guides of the Church declared in favour of
it, when several great Councils opposed and
contradicted that of Nice, when Pope <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
did subscribe the Sirmian confession
and Communicated with the Arrians, what
advice would <hi>N. O.</hi> give such a one if he must
not exercise his own Judgement, and compare
both the doctrines by the rule of Scriptures?
must he follow the present Guides even the
Pope himself? Then he must joyn with the
the Arrians. Must he adhere to the Nicene
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50175:120"/>
Council? but there were more numerous
Councils which condemned it. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
can be supposed in such a case, but that
every person must search and examine the
several doctrines, according to his best ability,
and judge what is best for him to believe and
practise? No answer can be more absurd in
this case than that which some give, that
Liberius only erred in his <hi>External profession
of faith and not in the belief of it;</hi> for
we are now speaking of such as are to be <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
to others, and on whose direction they
are to rely, which must be something which
may be known to them. Supposing then,
that Liberius when he subscribed and joyned
with the Arrians, was a Catholick in his
heart this takes as much off from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Guide, as Errour would do. For
who dare rely upon him who acts against his
conscience and believes one way and does ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Would any in the Church of Rome
think it fit to submit themselves to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of such persons, whom they were assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
did not believe one word of what they
professed; but joyned in communion with
that Church only for some temporal ends?
But in truth <hi>Liberius</hi> went so far, that <hi>Hilary</hi>
denounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> against him, and all
that joyned with him. Neither was this the
only case of this nature to be supposed; for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50175:121"/>
the Councils of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ineffectual for the suppression of the Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
and Eutychian heresies, and rather greater
disturbances arising in the Church after the
later of these, because the writings of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>

<hi>Cyril,</hi> and of <hi>Ibas</hi> to <hi>Maris</hi> the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consent of the four Eastern Patriarchs, he

the Bishops of <hi>Istria</hi> continued in their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Roman Church for 70. years,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was till the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> A. D. 626.)
when another was started, which gives us yet a
more ample discovery of the more than falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Guides of the Church in that
Age, when a Pope was condemned for a
Heretick by a General Council; in which
case, I would fain know whether of them
was infallible? and to which of the Guides
of the Church a man owed his internal assent,
and external obedience? This being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of so high a nature, that the truth of
it being supposed, the pretence of absolute
Authority and Infallibility in the Guides of
the Roman Church must fall to the ground,
no wonder, that all imaginable arts have been
used by those of the Church of Rome to
take away the force of it; among whom
<hi>Pighius, Baronius, Bellarmin, Petavius,</hi>
and <hi>Petrus de Marcâ</hi> have laboured hardest
in acquitting <hi>Honorius,</hi> but have proceeded
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50175:124"/>
in different ways; and the two last are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the Pope should be condemned for <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plilicity</hi>
and <hi>negligence,</hi> the better to excuse
him from <hi>heresy;</hi> but one would think these
two were as contrary to the office of a <hi>trusty
Guide,</hi> as <hi>heresy</hi> to one that pretends to be
<hi>infallible.</hi> But the better to understand the
force of this Instance, I shall give a brief
account of the matter of fact, as it is agreed
on all sides; and the representing the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
among the <hi>Guides</hi> of <hi>the Church</hi> at that
time, will plainly shew how unreasonable it
had been, to have required absolute sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to such who so vehemently contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
each other.</p>
            <p>We are therefore to understand, that the
late <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> being found
unsuccessful, for bringing the <hi>Eutychians</hi>
and their off-spring, to a submission to the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> another <hi>expedient</hi> was
found out for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
two natures in Christ they should
agree in owning that there was but one will
and operation in him after the Union of both
natures: because will and operation were
supposed to flow from the Person and not
barely from the nature; and the asserting
two wills would imply two contrary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in Christ which were not to be supposed.
This <hi>Expedient</hi> was first proposed to <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:50175:124"/>
the Emperour by <hi>Athanasius</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verian</hi>
and approved by <hi>Sergius</hi> Patriarch of
Constantinople, and by <hi>Cyrus</hi> of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
and <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of Pharan near
Aegypt. <hi>Cyrus</hi> proceeded so far in it as by
that means to reconcile the <hi>Theodosiani,</hi> a
sort of Eutychians in Alexandria, to the
Church, of which he gives an account to
<hi>Sergius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and sends him the
<hi>Anathema's</hi> which he published, among
which the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> was against those who asserted,
more than one operation in Christ. <hi>Sergius</hi>
approves what <hi>Cyrus</hi> had done; but <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
a learned Monk, coming to Alexandria
vehemently opposed <hi>Cyrus</hi> in this business;
but <hi>Cyrus</hi> persisting he makes his address to
<hi>Sergius</hi> at <hi>Constantantinople,</hi> and tells him of
the dangerous heresy that was broaching
under the pretence of Union; after some heats
<hi>Sergius</hi> yielded, that nothing should be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said of either side. But <hi>Sophronius</hi> being
made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he publishes an
Encyclical Epistle wherein he asserts two
operations and Anathematizes those who held
the contrary and were for the Union; and
writes to <hi>Honorius</hi> then Pope, giving him
an account of this new heresy of the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi>
the same year <hi>Sergius</hi> writes to him
likewise of all transactions that had hitherto
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50175:125"/>
been in this matter, and desires to know his
judgement in such an affair, wherein the
Peace of the Church was so much concerned.
<hi>Honorius</hi> writes a very solemn letter to <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
wherein he condemns the contentious
humour of <hi>Sophronius,</hi> and makes as good a
confession of his faith as he could, in which
he expresly asserts that there was but <hi>one Will
in Christ</hi> and agrees with <hi>Sergius that there
should be no more disputing about one or two
operations in Christ.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Heraclius</hi>
by the advice of <hi>Sergius</hi> publishes his <hi>Ecthesis</hi>
or <hi>declaration</hi> to the same purpose, which
was approved by a <hi>Synod</hi> under <hi>Sergius;</hi>
but opposed by <hi>Iohn 4. Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet
still maintained at <hi>Constinople</hi> not only by
<hi>Sergius,</hi> but by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi> his
successours, who were both excommunicated
by <hi>Theodorus</hi> succeeding <hi>Iohn;</hi> after him
<hi>Pope Martin</hi> calls a <hi>Council,</hi> wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
all the Eastern Bishops who favoured
this new heresy, and the two <hi>Edicts</hi> of silence
published by <hi>Heraclius</hi> and <hi>Constans:</hi> but
was for his pains sent for to Constantinople
and there dyed. These contentions daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
after the death of <hi>Constans, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinus
Pogonatus</hi> resolves to try all ways
for the peace of the Church; and therefore
calls a General Council at <hi>Constantinople</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here we are now come to the main point;
we see a Pope delivering his judgement in a

               </gap>le Church
condemned for a <hi>Heretick</hi> by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for so doing: either he was rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
or not; if rightly, what becomes
of the infallibility of the Pope when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to teach the whole Church in a matter
of faith? If not rightly, what becomes of
the authority and sincerity of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
if a Council so solemnly proceeding

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld condemn one for Heresy, that not
only did not err; but if some may be believed,
could not? Surely the Council never thought
of that, when they make no scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
him with the rest. What? were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50175:126"/>
Pope <hi>Agatho</hi>'s Legats there present, and
could not inform the Council of their presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in judging the Infallible See? But no
such thing was heard of in those times; these
latter Ages have been only blessed with the
knowledge of this unerring priviledge; and
happy had it been if all the records of former
times had been burnt, that no Instances
might have been brought to overthrow it.
Yet wit and industry have not been wanting
to bring poor <hi>Honorius</hi> off, if it had been
possible: the sum of all may be reduced to
these 3. Answers. 1. Either that the Acts
of the Council are falsifyed. Or. 2. That
the Pope did not err in faith. Or. 3. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
he did err, it was only as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and not as Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>1. That the Acts of the Council are falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.
This is a shrewed sign of a desperate
cause, when against the consent of all ancient
Copies, both Greek and Latin, and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of several Popes and Councils after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
learned men are driven to so miserable
a shift as this. The first I find, who made
this answer was <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>Franciscus
Torrensis</hi> (afterwards better known by the

by <hi>Baronius, Hosius, Lindanus,</hi> and others,
writ a Book of the 6. 7. and 8. Synod, wherein
he severely chastises <hi>Pighius</hi> for his ill usage of
this <hi>sixth Council,</hi> and saith that in this matter
he shewed more prejudice than judgement. For,
whereas he suspects that the letter of <hi>Honorius</hi>
to <hi>Sergius</hi> was not sufficiently examined and
compared with the Original, this betray's saith
<hi>Turrianus,</hi> his great negligence in reading
the Acts of the Council; for in the latter end
of the 12. Session, it is expresly said that
the Authentick Latin Epistle of <hi>Honorius</hi> was
produced and compared by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Porto;</hi>
Besides how comes, saith he, the name of
<hi>Honorius</hi> to be no less than 9.<note place="margin">P. 11. 12.</note> times in the
Council? and if all this had been by the
Greeks corrupting the Copies, surely they
would never have left that passage remaining
concerning the corrupting the letters of
<hi>Mennas</hi> and <hi>Vigilius:</hi> How comes <hi>Leo</hi> 2. in

by name as guilty of heresy; some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50175:127"/>
saith he, may say this is counterfeit
too, (so do <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius)</hi> but they
have nothing but their bare conjecture for it,
no argument, or authority to confirm it.
Not only the Greek Writers, but the Latin
confess he was there condemned, so doth
<hi>Bede,</hi> saith he, so doth the <hi>Pontifical Book</hi>
in the life of <hi>Leo</hi> 2. and in the Council under
<hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> the Epistle of <hi>Paulus</hi> to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>

How came all the Copies to be corrupted at

none left sound to correct others by? But
that which he insists upon as the strongest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of all is, from <hi>Hadrian</hi> 2. who calling

A very considerable Testimony; not only to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50175:127"/>
prove that <hi>Honorius</hi> was comdemned for
heresy, but that a Pope may be guilty of it
and be lawfully proceeded against for it, and
that Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> did himself consent to the
condemnation of <hi>Honorius.</hi> Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
these arguments of <hi>Torrensis, Baronius</hi>
seeing that no other defence could be made,
persists in the same accusation of <hi>Forgery:</hi>
and out of his own head frames an improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
story of the corrupting the Copies of the
Council by <hi>Theodorus, who being,</hi> saith
he,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>A. D.</hi> 681. n. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Anathematized as a Monothelite, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged
his own name and put in that of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius.</hi>
A fiction so groundless and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that nothing but meer despair could
drive a man of common understanding to it.
For there is not the least countenance for it in
any Author; not the least colour of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the thing. For, that, all the Copies of
the Council should be corrupted by one man,
and neither the Popes Legats present at the
Council nor any else should take notice of it;
That, no succeeding Popes should discover
it, when they were concerned to vindicate
<hi>Honorius,</hi> but did own the thing to be true;
that <hi>Theodorus</hi> then living should be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before it was known whether he would
submit to the Council or not; that, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
and eighth Councils this should not be
at all suspected, but the condemning <hi>Honorius</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:50175:128"/>
expresly mentioned in both; that, a man at
that time deposed from his Patriarchat of
Constantinople should be able to make such
a razure and forgery in the Copies of the
Councils; that the Emperour Constantine
who took so much care about the Council
should suffer such a thing to be done, do all
make this figment of <hi>Baronius</hi> so remote from

saying,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pontifice l. 4. c. 11.</note> 
               <hi>without doubt it is so:</hi> and he grants

that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was condemned,
but he saith they were deceived by the false
Acts of the Council. But however they must
believe that the Pope might fall into heresy
and be condemned by a Council for it. Yet
<hi>Bellarmim</hi> hath a fetch in this case beyond
<hi>Baronius</hi> viz. <hi>That either the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

Honorius without reason; For all
the evidence they produce against him is from

all;<note place="margin">Petav dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. Theol. l. 1. c. 21. s. 11</note> and this way is taken by <hi>Petavius,</hi> and

to prove by most evident arguments, that
the Acts of the Council were never corrupted

by the Council; but not for heresy,
but only for negligence and remissness. I think
there needs nothing to shew the weakness
of this, but barely reading the <hi>Anathema</hi> of
the Council against him, which is not, <hi>for
bare negligence but for confirming the wicked
doctrines of Sergius.</hi> And I am apt to think,
that learned person saw the weakness of his
design too much to go on with it: and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and Bellarmin</hi> saw well enough, that
whosoever was there Anathematized it was
upon the account of <hi>heresy</hi> that he was so;
and therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Anathema</hi> belonged to <hi>Theodorus</hi>
and not to <hi>Honorius. Petavius</hi> thinks that

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50175:129"/>
his <hi>simplicity and weakness,</hi> not understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Controversy aright. So of old
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. and <hi>Maximus</hi> in his dispute with
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> defended <hi>Honorius,</hi> that he spake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of <hi>one Will, but that,</hi> say they, <hi>was
to be understood only of one Will in his humane
nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Combesis. c. 2. sect. 3.</note> Which as <hi>Combesis</hi> saith, is <hi>a more
pious than solid defence of him;</hi> and would
as well serve, for <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for
<hi>Heraclius</hi> his <hi>Ecthesis</hi> and <hi>Constans</hi> his <hi>Type,</hi>
as <hi>Honorius</hi> his letter. For who ever will
peruse them, will find they all proceed on
the same argument, that there could not be
two wills in Christ but one must be contrary
to the other. But that which I insist on is
this, that it is certain the Council approved
by the Pope did condemn him for heresy;
I desire therefore again to know whether he
was rightly condemned or not; if he was,
then the <hi>Pope</hi> must be guilty, and so not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;
if not, than the Council must be,
according to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> guilty of <hi>intolerable
impudence and errour;</hi> but in either case,
there was no infallibility in the <hi>Guides</hi> of the

            <p>Thus far I have shewn that those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the most to be infallible Guides of the
Church have opposed and condemned each
other; from whence it necessarily follows
that no absolute submission is due to them,
unless we can be obliged to believe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.
I might pursue this much further,
and draw down the History of these contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
to each other, through the following
Ages of the Church; wherein Bishops have
been against Bishops, Popes against Popes,
Councils against Councils, Church against
Church; especially after the breach between
the Eastern and Greek Churches, the Greek
and the Roman, and the Roman and those
of the Reformation; But a man who is bound
to rely only on the Authority of his Guides,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50175:130"/>
must suppose them to be agreed; and in case
of difference among them, he must first
choose his Religion and by that his Guide.</p>
            <p>9. In the present divided State of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, a man that would satisfy his
own mind, must make use of his judgement
in the choice of his Church, and those Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
he is to submit to. Unless a man will say,
that every one is bound to yield himself abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to the Guidance of that Church which
he lives in whether <hi>Eastern</hi> or <hi>Greek, Roman</hi>
or <hi>Protestant:</hi> which I suppose <hi>N. O.</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yield to, for a reason he knows because
then no Revolter from us could be justified.
The true State then of the present case con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
is this; that it hath been now for many Ages
rent and torn into several distinct Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
every one of which Communions, hath
particular <hi>Guides</hi> over it, who pretend it to
be the duty of men to live in subjection to
them, because every <hi>Church</hi> doth suppose
it self to be in the right; now the Question
proposed is, whether it be not fitter for me
to submit to the <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> than to trust my own judgement? I
should make no scruple in all doubtful matters
to resolve the affirmative, supposing that all
the Guides of the Catholick Church were
Agreed; for I should think it arrogance and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50175:130"/>
presumption in me to set up my own private
opinion in opposition to the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all the Guides of the Catholick
Church, in such a case; but that is far from
ours, for we find the Christian World di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into very different Communions. The
<hi>Eastern Churches</hi> are still as numerous, though
not so prosperous as the <hi>Roman;</hi> the extent
of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> alone is very great, but
besides that, there are two other distinct
Churches in those parts who break off Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the <hi>Greek</hi> on the Account of the
Councils of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and the
latter sort especially are very far spread in
those parts, from <hi>Armenia</hi> to the <hi>Abyssine
Empire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob. de Vitriaco hist. Orient. Cap. 77.</note> In the time of <hi>Iacobus de Vitriaco,</hi>

makes these Churches to be left out in our
Enquiries after the Guides of the Catholick
Church? Are these such inconsiderable parts
of the Body, that no regard is to be had to
them? I believe upon a strict examination,
notwithstanding the reproach of heresy and
Schism, which those of the Church of Rome
cast upon all but themselves, they will be

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50175:131"/>
Church, than the Roman Church is
Five great Bodies or Communions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are at this day in the World. 1. The
most <hi>Eastern Christians,</hi> commonly called
<hi>Nestorians</hi> whether justly or no I shall not now
examine, these are spread over the most Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
parts, and all live in subjection to the
<hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Muzal.</hi> 2. The <hi>Iacobites,</hi>
who are dispersed through <hi>Mesopotamia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,
Aegypt</hi> and the <hi>Abyssine Empire,</hi> and
live under several <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of their own.
3. The <hi>Greek Church,</hi> of which, besides
the <hi>Moscovites,</hi> are to be reckoned the <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi>
or <hi>Suriani,</hi> and the <hi>Georgians;</hi> for
though their language be different, they all
agree in Doctrine. 4. The <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
taking under it all in the Eastern parts who
have submitted to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> 5. The
<hi>Protestant Churches</hi> who have cast off sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Pope, and Reformed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
they charge the Church of Rome
with. Now of these 5. parts, 4. of them
are all agreed, that there is no necessity of
living in subjection to the <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church;</hi> but they are all under their own
proper Guides, W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they do not Question will
direct them in the right way to Heaven. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those of the Church of Rome take upon
themselves against all sense and reason to be
the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and so exclude 4. parts
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50175:131"/>
of 5. out of a capacity of Salvation; and
challenge Infallibility as belonging to the
Guides of it alone. In this case, the Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of the pretence, the uncharitableness
of rejecting so mighty a number of Christians
from the possibility of Salvation, are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make any Man not yield up his Faith
at the first demand; but to consider a while,
whether there be no other Churches, or Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in those Churches? when he finds so many
and those not inferiour to the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
in any thing save only in pomp, pride, and
uncharitableness; and all opposing those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
pretences of Authority and Infallibility
in it, what reason can he have, supposing
that he is to submit to any Guides, that he
must submit only to those of the Roman
Church? Why not as well to those of the
Eastern, Greek, or Protestant Churches?
If any one goes about to assign a reason, by
charging them with <hi>heresy,</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> he
unavoidably makes him Judge of some of the
greatest difficulties in Religion, before he
can submit to his Infallible Guides. He must
know what <hi>Nestorianism, Eutychianism,
Monothelism</hi> mean, how they came to be
<hi>heresies,</hi> whether the Churches accused
be justly charged with them? He must
understand all the subtilties of Personalitie,
subsistence, Hypostatical Union; whether
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50175:132"/>
the Union of two natures in Christ be substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
natural, or accidental? whether it be enough
to say that the Divine and humane are one
by inhabitation, or one by consent, or one
by Communion of operation, or one by
Communion of dignity and honour, all which
the <hi>Nestorians</hi> acknowledged, only denying
the union of two natures to make one Person?
supposing a man be come to this, he must then
be satisfied that the present <hi>Eastern Christians</hi>
do hold the Doctrine of the old <hi>Nesiorians,</hi>
for they acknowledge Christ to be perfect
God and perfect Man; and that the <hi>B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi>
may be called the <hi>Mother of the Son of
God, or the Mother of the Word,</hi> but they
stick only at calling her <hi>the Mother of God.</hi>
Then for the other Churches which are
charged with <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tychianism,</hi> he must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
the exact difference between <hi>nature</hi>
and <hi>Person,</hi> for if there cannot be two natures
without two Persons, then either the <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
were in the right who asserted two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or the <hi>Eytychians</hi> who denyed two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but this being granted, he must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that, those called <hi>Iacobites</hi> are <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi>
although they disown <hi>Eutyches,</hi>
and follow <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> asserting that there
were two natures before the Union, and but
one after; and that <hi>Dioscorus</hi> was rightly
condemned in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on;</hi> but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50175:132"/>
supposing they are willing to leave the dispute
of two natures, on condition, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature be only made the <hi>Instrument</hi> of
the <hi>Divine</hi> in its operations, whether they
are justly charged with <hi>heresy</hi> in so doing?
All these things a Man must fully be satisfied
in, before he can pronounce those Churches
guilty of <hi>heresy,</hi> and so not to be followe.
But supposing those Churches be rejected,
why must the <hi>Greek,</hi> which embraces all the
<hi>Councils</hi> which determined those subtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies?
Here comes the mystery of
the procession of the Holy Ghost to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
whether from the Father alone or
from the Father and the Son? but supposing
this to be yielded, why may he not joyn with
those Churches, which agree with the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> in all those points, as the <hi>Protestant
Churches</hi> do? Here a Man must examine the
notes of the Church, and enquire whether
they be true notes, whether they agree only
to the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> And one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of those notes being <hi>consent with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church,</hi> a Man that would be well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
must go through all the disputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and the Church of Rome, and by
that time he is well settled in them, he will
see little use, and less necessity of an Infallible
Guide. So that a Man who would satisfy
himself in this divided State of the Christian
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50175:133"/>
Church, what particular Communion he
ought to embrace and what <hi>Guides</hi> he must
follow, must do all that, for the preventing of
which an Infallible Guide is said to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>i.e.</hi> he must not only exercise his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in particular controversies, but must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to it, and joyn with that Church
which upon Enquiry he judges to be the Best.</p>
            <p>10. A prudent submission is due to the
Guides of that Church, with which a person
lives in Communion. Having shewed that
absolute submission is not due, all that can be
left is a submission within due bounds, which
is that I call a prudent submission. And those
bounds are these following.</p>
            <p>1. Not to submit to all those who challenge
the Authority of Guides over us, though
pretending to never so much Power and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
When <hi>N. O.</hi> would perswade me to
submit my understanding to the Infallible Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the Church; He must think me a very
easy man to yield, till I be satisfied first that
God hath appointed such to be my <hi>Guides,</hi>
and in the next place that he hath promised
Infallibility to them. And that is the true
State of the Controversy between us and those
of the Church of Rome in this matter; they
tell us we are bound to submit to the <hi>Guides</hi>
of the <hi>Church;</hi> we desire to know whom they
mean by these <hi>Guides;</hi> and at last we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50175:133"/>
them to be the Bishop of Rome and his
Clergy. Here we demur, and own no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
the Bishop of Rome hath over us; we
assert that we have all the <hi>Rights</hi> of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triachal
Church</hi> within our selves, that we owe
no account to the Bishop of Rome of what
we believe or practise; it is no Article of our
Creed that God hath made him <hi>Iudge either of
the quick or the dead;</hi> We have Guides of our
Church among our selves, who have as clear
a succession and as good a title as the Bishops
of any Church in the world. To these, who
are our Lawful Guides, we promise a due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and are blame worthy if we give it not;
but for the Bishop and Clergy of Rome, we
own none to them, let them challenge it with
never so much confidence, and arrogant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to Infallibility. So that here is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of <hi>Right</hi> in the case, antecedent to any
duty of submission, which must be better
proved than ever it hath yet been, before we
can allow any dispute, how far we are to
submit to the Guides of the Roman Church?</p>
            <p>2. Not to submit to those who are Lawful
Guides in all things they may require. For
our dispute is now about Guides supposed
to be fallible, and they being owned to be
such may be supposed to require things to
which we are bound not to yield. But the
great difficulty now is, so to state these things,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50175:134"/>
as to shew that we had reason not to submit
to the Guides of the Roman Church, and
that those of the Separation have no reason
not to submit to the Guides of our Church.
For that is the obvious objection in this case,
that <hi>the same pretence which was used by our
Church against the Church of Rome, will
serve to justify all the Separations that have
been or can be made from our Church.</hi> So my
Adversary <hi>N. O.</hi> in his preface saith, <hi>that by
the principles we hold, we excuse and justify
all Sects which have or shall separate from our
Church.</hi> In answer to which calumny I shall
not fix upon the perswasion of conscience,
for that may equally serve for all parties; but
upon a great difference in the very nature of
the case, as will appear in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. We appeal to the Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the truly Catholick Church in the
matters of difference between us and the
Church of Rome: we are as ready as they to
stand to the unanimous consent of Fathers,
and to <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> his Rules, of
Antiquity, universality and consent; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
let the things in dispute be proved to
have been the practice of the Christian
Church in all Ages, we are ready to submit to
them: but those who separate from the
Church of England make this their Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50175:134"/>
principle as to worship, (wherein the
difference lyes,) that nothing is Lawful in
the worship of God, but what he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
commanded; we say all things are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
which are not forbidden, and upon this
single point stands the whole Controversy of
separation as to the Constitution of our
Church. We challenge those that separate
from us to produce one person for 1500. years
together, that held Forms of prayer to be
unlawful; or the ceremonies which are used
in our Church: We defend the Government
of the Church by Bishops to be the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Apostolical Government, and that
no persons can have sufficient reason to cast
that off, which hath been so universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in all Ages since the Apostles times:
if there have been disputes among us about
the nature of the difference between the two
orders, and the necessity of it in order to the
Being of a Church, such there have been in
the Church of Rome too. Here then lyes a
very considerable difference, we appeal and are
ready to stand to the judgement of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church for interpreting the letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in any difference between us and the
Church of Rome; but those who separate
from our Church will allow nothing to be
lawful but what hath an express command in
Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:50175:135"/>
2. The Guides of our Church never chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
any Infallibility to themselves; which
those of the Church of Rome do, and have
done ever since the Controversy began.
Which challenge of Infallibility makes the
Breach irreconcileable while that pretence
continues; for there can be no other way but
absolute submission where men still pretend
to be infallible: It is to no purpose to propose
terms of Accommodation between those who
contend for a Reformation, and such who
contend that they can never be deceived; on
the one side, errours are supposed; and on the
other, that it is impossible there should by
any. Until therefore this pretence be quitted,
to talk of Accomodation is folly, and to design
it madness. If the Church of Rome will allow
nothing to be amiss, how can she Reform any
thing? and how can they allow any thing to be
amiss, who believe they can never be deceived?
So that while this Arrogant pretence of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in the Roman Church continues, it is
impossible there should be any Reconciliation:
But there is no such thing in the least pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Church,<note place="margin">Article 21.</note> that declares in her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,<note place="margin">Articl. 3.</note>
               <hi>that General Councils may err, and
sometimes have erred even in things par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to God; and that all the proof of
things to be believed is to be taken from Holy
Scripture.</hi> So that as to the Ground of Faith
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50175:135"/>
there is no difference between our Church and
those who dissent from her; and none of them
charge our Church with any errour in doctrine;
nor plead that as the reason of their separation.</p>
            <p>3. The Church of Rome not only requires
the belief of her errours but makes the belief
of them necessary to Salvation: which is
plain by the often objected Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> 4.
Wherein the same necessity is expressed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the additional Articles, which are
proper to the Roman Church, as of the
most Fundamental Articles of Christian
Faith. And no Man who reads that <hi>Bull</hi>
can discern the least difference therein made
between the necessity of believing one and the
other; but that all together make up that
Faith, without which no man can be saved;
which though only required of some persons
to make profession of, yet that profession is to
be esteemed the Faith of their Church. But
nothing of this nature can be objected against
our <hi>Church</hi> by dissenters, that excludes none
from a possibility of Salvation meerly because
not in her Communion, as the Church of
Rome expresly doth: for it was not only <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
8.</hi> who determined as solemnly as he
could,<note place="margin">Concil. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran. A. D. 15 16. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that it was necessary to Salvation to be
in subjection to the Bishop of Rome;</hi> but the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> 10. decreed the
same thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50175:136"/>
4. The Guides of the Roman Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to as immediate authority of obliging the
Consciences of men, as Christ or his Apostles
had; but ours challenge no more than teaching
men to do what Christ had Commanded them,
and in other things, not commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
to give rules, which on the account
of the General Commands of Scripture,
they look on the members of our Church as
obliged to observe. So that the Authority
challenged in the Roman Church encroaches
on the Prerogative of Christ, being of the
same nature with his; but that which our
Governours plead for, is only that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them as Governours over a Christian
Society. Hence in the Church of Rome it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as much a mortal sin to disobey their
Guides in the most indifferent things, as to
disobey God in the plain Commands of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
but that is not all they challenge to
themselves, but a power likewise to dispence
with the Law's of God, as in matter of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and with the Institution of Christ as in
Communion in one kind; and promise the
same spiritual effects to their own Institutions
as to those of Christ, as in the 5. Sacraments
they have added to the two of Christ, and to
other ceremonies in use among them.</p>
            <p>5. Setting aside these considerations, we
dare appeal to the judgement of any person
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50175:136"/>
of what perswasion soever, whether the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
we plead for separation from the Church
of Rome be not in themselves far more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
than those, which are pleaded by such,
who separate from our Church? <hi>i.e.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Churches imposing of three Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
declared to be indifferent by those who
require them, can be thought by any men of
common sense so great a burden to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
as all the load of superstitious fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
in the Roman Church? whether pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a prescribed form of words be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture, as praying in an unknown
tongue? Whether there be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
kneeling at the Sacrament upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
Principles and the Papists adoration
of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st? Whether Transubstantiation,
Image worship, Invocation of Saints, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,
Purgatory, the Popes supremacy,
be not somewhat harder things to swallow,
than the Churches power to appoint matters
of order and decency? Which particulars
make the difference so apparent between the
separation of our Church from the Church
of Rome, and that of dissenters from our
Church; that it seems a very strange thing
to me that this should be objected by our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
on either side. And thus much may
suffice to clear this point of submission to the
Guides of a Church, of which I have the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50175:137"/>
more largely discoursed, not for any difficulty
objected by <hi>N. O.</hi> but because the thing it
self did deserve to be more amply considered.
But some other things relating to Church-Authority
I must handle afterwards, and
therefore now return to my Adversary.</p>

in a right belief of several necessary Articles

which he determines that men must fluctuate

the Scriptures are ambiguous in their sense and
drawn with much art to several Interests.

            </p>
            <p>Here are two things to be discussed.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50175:138"/>
1. What necessity there is for the Salvation
of persons, to have an infallible interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of controverted places of Scripture?
2. Whether the denying such an Infallible
Interpreter makes men uncapable of attaining
any certain sense of doubtful places? For
if either it be not necessary that men should
have an infallible interpretation; or men
may attain at a certain sense without it, then
there can be no colour of an argument drawn
from hence to prove the necessity of an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Guide.</p>
            <p>1. We are to enquire into the necessity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
such an infallible interpretation of doubtf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
places of Scripture. There are but three
grounds on which it can be thought necessary
either that no man should mistake in the
sense of Scripture, or that the Peace of the
Church cannot be preserved, or that mens
Souls cannot be saved without it. If i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
were necessary on the first account, then every
particular person must be infallible; which
being not pleaded for, we must consider the
other two grounds of it. But here we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
take notice, that the matter of our prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
enquiry is concerning the clearness of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in order to the Salvation of particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
persons; of which the Proposition laid dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do any thing to overthrow this, he mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:50175:138"/>
prove, not that there are doubtful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
places which no one denies, but that
the sense of Scripture is so doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
in the things which are necessary to mens
Salvation, that persons without an Infallible
Guide cannot know the meaning of them.
If he prove not this, he doth not come near
that which he ought to prove. We do not
therefore deny, that there are places of great
difficulty in the Books of Scripture; but we
assert, that the necessaries to Salvation do
not lye therein; but those being plain and
clear, men may be saved without knowing
the other. As a Seaman may safely direct
his compass by the Stars, although he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
solve all the difficulties of Astronomy.
Can any man in his senses Imagine that
Christs coming into the world to dye for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the precepts of a holy life which
he hath given, and the motives thereto from
his second coming to Judge the World, are
not more plain than the Apocalyphical visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or the proofs for the Church of Romes
Infallibility? If a person then by reading and
considering those things which are plain, may
do what Christ requires for his Salvation;
what necessity hath such a one to trouble
himself about an Infallible Guide? For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he may go to heaven without him, or
not? if he may, let them shew the necessity
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50175:139"/>
he is of to that end, which may be attained
without him; if not, then the things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation cannot be known without
him. Let this be proved, and I will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
yield the whole cause: and till it be
proved my Principles remain unshaken. But
saith <hi>N. O. the Scripture is obscure in some
great and important points, because S.</hi> Peter
<hi>saith, that men unlearned and unstable,
(though it may be diligent enough) wrested
some places of Scriptures hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to their own destruction.</hi> But doth S.
<hi>Peter</hi> say that <hi>the Scriptures are so hard to
be understood</hi> that sober and devout minds
cannot learn therein, what is necessary to
their Salvation? This had been indeed to
their purpose: but it is far enough from St.
<hi>Peters.</hi> He only saith that <hi>in St.</hi> Pauls <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
there are some difficult passages,</hi> which
men that wanted judgement and constancy,
and it may be diligence too, were ready to
pervert to their own mischief. But if there
be such difficulties, is there nothing plain and
easy? if bad men may pervert them, may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
good men make a good use of them? If some
may destroy themselves by their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and folly, may not others be saved by
their diligence and care? If it were proved
by <hi>N. O.</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> charged all this upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them for want of adhering to their Guides,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50175:139"/>
that would approach nearer his business;
but if St. <hi>Peter</hi> had intended any such thing
as <hi>N. O.</hi> insinuates, what fairer opportunity
had there been of preventing this Instability
in others by telling them, that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
infallible Guides in his Church to
prevent such abuses of Scripture, and that, so
long as they adhered to them, they were safe;
but there is not the least word in St. <hi>Peter</hi> to
this purpose, when it had been most necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have given such advice; but he only
bids them,<note place="margin">2 Pet 3. 17, 18.</note> have a care of <hi>imitating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
of such wicked men, and grow in the
grace and knowledge of Iesus Christ.</hi> If on
so fair and just an occasion offered, St. <hi>Peter</hi>
himself whom they believe to have been Head
of the Church at that time, and at Rome
at the writing of this Epistle, doth wholly
omit referring men in the sense of obscure
places to Infallible Guides; what can we else
infer but that St. <hi>Peter</hi> knew of no such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of Christ, or thought no such thing
of necessity for his Church. For if he had,
such was his care and faithfulness, he would
never have omitted so necessary a thing; if the
Salvation of mens souls had depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be not then necessary to mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have an infallible interpretation of

doubtful places;<note place="margin">§ 12. Of a Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            </p>

upon the supposition of the necessity of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining

the parties in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se at all to wonder
that there should happen to be Controversies
among men about there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; when we
see them daily happen about the Laws of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50175:140"/>
every Country. The only Question now is,
whether as the necessities of people have made
it necessary that there should not only be
Laws but Judges, who should be as the most
equal Arbitrators to put an end to such
differences as may happen among men about
matters of Right and Law, it be thus in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
too? And this Question is plainly
about a matter of Fact <hi>i.e.</hi> whether Christ
hath appointed such Judges in all Ages, who
are to determine all emergent Controversies
about the difficult places of his Law? And
in this case we think it is all the reason in the
World, that they who <hi>Affirm</hi> should <hi>Prove,</hi>
especially, when they Affirm a matter of
their own Right, and challenge a submission
from others on the Account of it. We desire
them who challenge to be our infallible Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
that they would shew their Commission,
and produce their Patent: For as we are ready
to yield <hi>obedience,</hi> if they crave it, so we
think it Treason and Tyranny in them to
usurp it, if they have it not. And it is to no
purpose to talk of the Benefits that would
come to the world by an infallible Judge of
Controversies, unless they first prove that
there is one. But we must not allow men to
prove things to be, meerly because they
think it fitting they should be; for that is to
make themselves Wiser than Christ and rather
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50175:141"/>
to tell him what he should have done, than
prove what he hath done. What if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ
having provided for the necessaries of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by a clear Revelation should leave other
things in the dark, to exercise the Wits of
some and the Charity of others? What if,
he thought it sufficient to oblige men to the
greatest honesty and Integrity in knowing and
doing the Will of God, and hath promised
to pass by the errours and failings men are
subject to barely as men? What if, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
this matter of ending Controversies
would be an occasion of raising one of the
greatest in the Christian World, and become
a pretence of the most intolerable Tyranny
over the minds of men? And therefore what
if, he thought it reasonable to leave the
failings of mens understandings and lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same terms, so as to give sufficient
means to prevent either, but not effectually
to hinder men from falling into either of
them? What if, the nature of Religion will
not bear such a determination of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
as civil matters will? because, civil
matters concern the right and wrong of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, in which it is not the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Judge so much as the Civil force
whereby it is backed which puts an end to
the dispute; but in matters of Religion, the
ending Controversies can be no effect of force
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50175:141"/>
and power, but of reason and conviction of
Conscience; and all the pretended infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the World can never satisfy my mind,
unless I be first assured of that infallibility.
In all civil causes, it is agreed on both sides
that such Judges are appointed to determine
cases of Law; and on the supposition of this
men proceed to tryal before them; but in
our case this is the main thing in dispute, and
he that pretends to be the Judge is the most
accused partie, and what reason can there
be, that only on the pretence of greater
peace, if Controversies were referred to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judge, we must therefore allow every
one that pretends to it to be such an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Guide? And we must on the same
ground allow every one, if we must not first
be satisfied of the grounds on which it is
challenged by any one. And withal, since
Christ is the best Judge of what is fittest
for his Church, we must see by his Laws
whether he hath made it necessary for all
Controversies to be ended by a standing
Judge, that should arise about the sense of
Scripture? If he hath not done it, it is to
no pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pose to say, it is fit he should have
done it; for that is to upbraid Christ with
weakness and not to end differences in his
Church.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing it necessary that Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50175:142"/>
should be ended, it may as well be done
without an infallible Judge of the sense of
Scripture as with one; for all that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be done by an infallible Judge is
to give a certain sense of controverted
places; so that men are either bound to look
on that which they give as the certain sense
on the account of the infallibility of the
Interpreter, or that such an infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
being set aside, there is no way to
know the certain sense of Scripture. If the
first, then no man can be more certain of the
sense of any doubtful place, than he is of the
infallibility of his Interpreter: I desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be resolved in this case. I am told
<hi>I can arrive at no certainty of the sense of
doubtful places of Scripture without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Interpreter,</hi> I say the places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which are alledged for such an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judge are the most doubtful and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
of any; I would fain understand by
what means I may come to be certain of the
meaning of these places, and to find out the
sense of them? Must I do it only by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guide? but that is the thing I am
now seeking for, and I must not suppose that
which I am to prove. If I may be certain
without supposing such an infallible Guide
of the meaning of these very doubtful and
controverted places, than why may I not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50175:142"/>
by the same way of proceeding arrive at the
certainty of any other less doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
places? unless there be some private
way to come at the sense of those places
which will hold for none else besides them,
which is not so easy to understand.</p>
            <p>2. I come the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore to the second enquiry,
which is about the means of attaining the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sense of Scripture in doubtful places,
without the supposition of an infallible
Guide. It will not I hope be denyed, that
the Primitive Christian Church had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
way of understanding the sense of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
places, as far as it was necessary to be
understood, and that they wanted no means
which Christ had appointed for the ending
of Controversies. But I shall now shew, that
they proceeded by no other means than what
we use, so that, if they had any means to
come to a certain sense of Scripture, we have
the same; and it would be a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y hard case
if by the use of the same means we cannot
attain the same end. I shall therefore give
an account of the proceeding of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church in this weighty Controversy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the sense of Scripture in doubtful
places; and if no such thing was then heard
off as an infallible Judge, it is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
they thought there was none
appointed; because the disputes that happened
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50175:143"/>
then required as much the Authority of such
a Judge as any that are at this day in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church.</p>
            <p>In the first Ages of Christianity, there
were two sorts of Controversies which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed

               <hi>and interpreted the

who undertook to confute these Hereticks
were not only to vindicate the true sense of
Scripture, but to dispute with such, who did
not own the same Books which they did;
and therefore were forced to use such ways
of arguing as were proper to them: as may
be seen at large by the proceedings of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50175:144"/>
and <hi>Tertullian</hi> against them. But because the
<hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> did endeavour
to suit their extravagant fancies to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
allowed by them, it will be necessary
for us, to enquire by what means they went
about to clear the true sense of Scripture from
their false Glosses and Interpretations. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
in the beginning of his Book, relating
at large the Doctrines of the <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith, <hi>that by the perverse interpretations and
corrupt expositions of the Scripture, they
drew away unstable minds from the true faith;
for they pretended to find out deeper and more
mysterious things in the Scripture, than
others were acquainted with,</hi> viz. <hi>That Christ
intimated the 30. Aeöns by not appearing till
the 30. year of his Age. That the parable of
men called at the first, the third, the sixth,
the ninth, the eleventh hour referred to the
same thing, for those hours make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 30. That St.</hi> Paul <hi>often mentions these
Aeöns and the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uctions of them; that

years of Age, and in the choice of the 12. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:
and the remaining</hi> 18. By his <hi>abiding
18. months as they said with his Disciples
after his resurrection: and where ever in
Scripture they met with words suitable to the
description of their Aeöns, they pretended
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50175:144"/>
that they did refer to their notions, but were
obscurely expressed on purpose: for which end
they made use of Parables, and the first of
St.</hi> John <hi>and many passages in St.</hi> Pauls <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles.</hi>
What course now doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> take
to clear the sense of Scripture in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
places? Doth he till them that God
had appointed Infallible Guides in his
Church, to whom appeal was to be made in
all such cases? Nothing like it, through his
whole Book; but he argues with very good
reason that no such thing as they imagined
could be intended by the Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. From the scope and design of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which ought chiefly to be regarded;
whereas they only took some particular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
which served most to their purpose,
without looking to the series of the discourse
wherein they were. Therefore saith he,
<q>they make only a rope of sand, when they
apply the Parables of our Saviour, or the
sayings of the Prophets or Apostles to their
opinions;<note place="margin">Iren. l. 1. c. 1.</note> for they pass over the order and
connexion of the Scriptures; and as much
as in them lyes loose the members of truth
from each other; and then transform and
change them from one thing to another,
thereby deceiving men. As if, saith he,
a man should take an excellent Image of a
Prince, done with a great deal of art in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50175:145"/>
stones; and remove those stones out
of their proper places and turn them into
the shape of a Dog or a Fox, ill put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and should then affirm, that because
the stones are the same, that this Image of
a Dog or a Fox, was the Image of the
Prince made by such an excellent Artist:
after the very same way, saith he, do
they use the Scriptures. Or as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
expresseth it, they take several
words and names here and there, and put
them together, much after the way of those
who would apply the words of <hi>Homer</hi> to
any argument proposed to them; which
some have done so artificially, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
men have been perswaded that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
did mean that very thing when he
wrote his Poem. As one did the going
of <hi>Hercules</hi> to <hi>Cerberus</hi> so exactly in the
words of <hi>Homer,</hi> (put together in the
<hi>Greek</hi> fragments of <hi>Irenaeus,)</hi> that those
who did not consider upon what different
occasions those words were used by him,
some being spoken of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> some of
<hi>Priamus,</hi> some of <hi>Maenelaus,</hi> and <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi>
and some of <hi>Hercules,</hi> might
Imagine that the Poet intended to describe
what the other expressed by him. But he
that will examine the several places will find
that the words indeed are <hi>Homers,</hi> but the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50175:145"/>
sense his that so applyed them. So it is in
this case, the words are the Scriptures,
but applyed quite in another way, than
they were intended; the stones are the
same, but yet the Image of the Fox is
not to be taken for that of the Prince: and
when he hath taken the pains to put every
thing in its proper and due place, he will
then easily find out the deceit.</q> And by
the help of this rule <hi>Irenaeus</hi> vindicates the
places of Scripture, which the <hi>Valentinians</hi>
made use of; and makes it evident that could
not be the sense of them which they put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. As he doth particularly prove
that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> by the beginning of his Gospel
could not mean the first <hi>Ogdoad</hi> of the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians.</hi>
To the very same purpose doth
<hi>Tertullian</hi> argue against their way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
<hi>Scripture;</hi>

to have wit and easiness in it, yet it is no
more than is often practised on <hi>Virgil</hi> and
<hi>Homer</hi> as well as the Scriptures. For we

words turned quite to another sense; as

                  </gap>
wonder, saith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
should be so abused, it being much
more fruitful, and applicable to several
purposes than other Writings are. Nay
saith he, I am not afraid to say, that the
Scriptures were so framed by the Will of
God, that they might afford matter for
Hereticks to work upon; since I read that
there must be heresies, which cannot be
without the Scripture.</q> And surely then,
he did not Imagine that God had appointed
an infallible Judge on purpose to prevent the
being of Heresies, by giving an infallible
sense of Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. From the repugnancy of the sence they
gave to other places of Scripture. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
observes,<note place="margin">Iren. l. 2. c. 46.</note> 
               <q>that the Hereticks delighted
most in dark places, and left the plain ones;
whereas we ought most to rely upon the
plain places and by them interpret the
obscure. For such who loved God and the
truth would study most those things which
God put under our command and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and those are things which are plain
before our eyes, and are open and without
ambiguity laid down in Scriptures; and
to these Parables and dark places ought to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50175:146"/>
be fitted, and by this means they may be
interpreted without danger, and of all
alike and the body of truth remains entire
with a suitableness of all its parts. But
without this every man interprets as he
pleases, and there will be no certain rule
of Truth; but every interpretation will be
according to the opinion of the Interpreter,
and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n will contradict each other as the
Philosophers did. And by this means
men will be always seeking and never fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
because they cast away the means of
finding. Seeing therefore, saith he, that
all the Scriptures both Prophetical and
Evangelical are plain and clear, and may
be heard alike of all: they must be very
blind that will not see in so great light, but
darken themselves in Parables, wherein
every one of them thinks he hath found a
God of his own. And from hence he very
much blames the Hereticks, since they
could not so much as pretend that any thing
was plainly said for them in Scripture,
but only intimated in dark sayings and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
that they would leave that which
is certain and undoubted and true, for that
which was uncertain and obscure. Which,
he saith, is not to build the house upon
the firm and strong ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k; but upon the
uncertainty of the sand; on which it may
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50175:147"/>
be easily overturned. This excellent rule
for interpreting Scripture <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes
great use of in his following discourse, and
in the very next Chapter urges this as the
Consequence of it, that having truth for
our Rule, and so plain Testimony of God,
men ought not to perplex themselves with
doubtful Questions concerning God, but
grow in the love of him who hath done and
doth so great things for us, and never fall
off from that knowledge which is most
clearly revealed. And we ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with what is clearly made known in
the Scriptures, because they are perfect,
as coming from the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd and Spirit of God.
And we need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>onder if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in Religion above our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
since there are so in natural
things which are daily seen by us: as in
the nature of Birds, Water, Air, Meteors,
&amp;c. of which we may talk much, but
only God knows what the truth is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why should we think much if it be so
in Religion too? wherein are some things
we may understand and others we must
leave to God, and if we do so we shall keep
our faith without danger. And all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
being agreeable to it self, the dark
places must be understood in a way most
suitable to the sense of the plain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:50175:147"/>
3. The sense they gave of Scripture was
contrary to the Doctrine of faith received by
all true Christians from the beginning:
which he calls <q>the unmoveable rule of
faith received in Baptism;<note place="margin">Iren. l. 1. c. 1.</note> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the
Church dispersed over the Earth did equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive in all places;<note place="margin">C. 2.</note> with a wonderful
consent. For although the places and
languages be never so distant or different
from each other,<note place="margin">C. 3.</note> yet the faith is the very
same as there is one Sun which inlightens
the whole World; which faith none did
enlarge or diminish. And after having
shewn the great absurdities of the Doctrines
of the Enemies of this faith, in his first and
second Books, in the beginning of the
third he shews that the Apostles did fully
understand the mind of Christ,<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 1.</note> that they
preached the same Doctrine which the
Church received, and which, after their
preaching it, was committed to writing by
the Will of God in the Scriptures, to be
the pillar and ground of Faith. Which
was the true reason why the Hereticks did
go about to disparage the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were condemned by them:<note place="margin">C. 2.</note>
therefore they would not allow them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authority, and charged them with
contradictions, and so great obscurity that
the truth could not be found in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50175:148"/>
the help of Tradition, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the key to unlock all the difficulties
of Scripture. And was not to be sought
for in Writings, but was delivered down
from hand to hand; for which cause St.
<hi>Paul</hi> said we speak wisdom among them
that are perfect. Which wisdom they
pretended to be among themselves. On
this account the matter of Tradition came
first into dispute in the Christian Church:
And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> appeals to the most eminent
Churches and Especially that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 3.</note>
because of the great resort of Christians
thither, whether any such tradition was
ever received among them and all the
Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> received the same faith
from the Apostles, and knew of no such
Tradition as the <hi>Valentinians</hi> pretended
to.<note place="margin">C. 4.</note> and there was no reason to think,
that so many Churches, founded by the
Apostles or Christ, should be ignorant of
such a tradition; and supposing no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
at all had been written by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
we must then have followed the
Tradition of the most ancient and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches, and even the most Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
nations that had embraced Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without any Writings: yet fully agreed
with other Churches in the Doctrine of
Faith, for that is it he means by the <hi>rule</hi> of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50175:148"/>
                  <hi>faith,</hi> viz. a summary comprehension of
the Doctrine received among Christians,
such as the Creed is mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus;</hi>
               </q>
               <note place="margin">L. 1. 6. 2.</note>
and afterwards he speaks of the <hi>Rule</hi> of the
<hi>Valentinians</hi> in opposition to that of the sound
Christians.<note place="margin">L. 4. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</note> From hence <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proceeds
to confute the Doctrine of the <hi>Valentinians</hi>
by Scripture and Reason in the third,<note place="margin">L. 5. Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat.</note> fourth
and fifth Books: All which ways of finding
out the sense of Scripture in doubtful places,
we allow of and approve; and are always
ready to appeal to them in any of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
controverted between us and the Church
of Rome. But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> knew nothing of
any Infallible Judge to determine the sense
of Scripture; for if he had, it would have
been very strange he should have gone so
much the farthest way about, when he
might so easily have told the <hi>Valentinians</hi>
that God had entrusted the Guides of his
Church, especially at <hi>Rome</hi> with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of interpreting Scripture, and that
all men were bound to believe that to be the
sense of it which they declared and no other.
But men must be pardoned if they do not
write that which never entred into their
Heads. After <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the most to dispute against those who
opposed the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and
the method he takes in his <hi>Boo</hi> of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:50175:149"/>
of <hi>Hereticks</hi> is this.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That there must be a certain unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tertull. de praescript haeret. c. 8.</note> For he that believes,
doth not only suppose sufficient grounds
for his faith, but bounds that are set to it;
and therefore there is no need of further
search since the Gospel is revealed. This
he speaks to take away the pretence of the
<hi>Seekers</hi> of those days,<note place="margin">C. 9.</note> who were always
crying, <hi>seek and ye shall find:</hi> to which
he replys, that we are to consider not
the bare words, but the reason of them;
And in the first place we are to suppose this,
that there is one certain and fixed Doctrine
delivered by Christ which all nations are
bound to believe, and therefore to seek,
that when they have found they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it.<note place="margin">C. 10</note> Therefore all our enquiries are to
be confined within that compass; what that
Doctrine was, which Christ delivered: for
otherwise there will be no end of seeking.</p>
               <p>2. He shews what this <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is,
by repeating the Articles of the Ancient
Creed, which he saith was universally,
received among true Christians and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by none but Hereticks.<note place="margin">C. 13.</note> Which <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Faith</hi> being embraced, then he saith,
a liberty is allowed for other enquiries in
doubtful or obscure matters. For faith
lyes in the Rule;<note place="margin">C. 14</note> but other things were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50175:149"/>
matters of skill and curiosity; and it is faith
which saves men, and not their skill in
expounding Scriptures: and while men keep
themselves within that Rule, they are safe
enough, for to know nothing beyond it,
is to know all.</p>
            </q>
            <p>3. But they pretend Scripture for what
they deliver, and by that means unsettle the
minds of many. <hi>To this he answers several
ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That such persons as those were,
ought not to be admitted to a dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the sense of Scripture; because
they rather deserved to be censured than
disputed, for bringing such new heresies
into the Church;<note place="margin">C. 16.</note> but chiefly because it
was to no purpose to dispute with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the sense of Scripture, who received

2. In this dispute about the sense of
Scripture, the true Ancient faith is first to
be enquired after, for among whom that
was, there would appear to be the true
meaning of Scripture.<note place="margin">C. 19.</note> And for finding
out the true faith, we are to remember,
that, Christ sent abroad his Apostles to
plant Churches in every City, from whence
other Churches did derive the faith,<note place="margin">C. 20.</note> which
are called Apostolical from their agreement
in this common faith at first delivered by
the Apostles; that, the way to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Apostolical faith is to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Apostolical Churches;<note place="margin">C. 21.</note> for
it is unreasonable to suppose that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should not know the Doctrine of
Christ,<note place="margin">22.</note>
                  <note place="margin">C. 23.</note>
                  <note place="margin">C. 24.</note>

                  <note place="margin">C. 27.</note> (which he at large proves) or
that they did not deliver to the Churches
planted by them the things which they
knew; or that the Churches misunderstood
their Doctrine because all the Christian
Churches were agreed in one Common
faith:<note place="margin">C. 28.</note> and therefore there is all the reason
to believe that so universal consent must
arise from some common cause, which can
be supposed to be no other than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
delivery of it by all the Apostles. But
the Doctrines of the Hereticks were novel
and upstart;<note place="margin">C. 29.</note> and we must say all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Christians were baptized into a false
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50175:150"/>
faith, as not knowing the true God or
the true Christ if <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Valentinus</hi>
did deliver the true Doctrine,<note place="margin">C. 30.</note> but that
which is first is true and from God, that
which comes after is foraign and false. If
<hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Valentinus, Nigidius</hi> or
<hi>Hermogenes</hi> broach new opinions and set
up other expositions of Scripture than the
Christian Church hath received from the
Apostles times, that without any farther
proof,discovers their imposture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>3. Two senses directly contrary to each
other cannot proceed from the same Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
persons. This <hi>Tertullian</hi> likewise insists
upon to shew that although they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Antiquity, and that as far as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
times, yet the contrariety of their
Doctrine to that of the Apostles would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
manifest the falshood of it. For saith
he, <q>the Apostles would never contradict
each other or themselves;<note place="margin">C. 32.</note> and if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
persons had contradicted them,
they had not been joyned together in the
Communion of the same faith; which all
the Apostolical Churches were. But the
Doctrines broached by these men, were in
their seeds condemned by the Apostles
themselves;<note place="margin">C. 33.</note> so <hi>Marcion, Apelles,</hi> and
<hi>Valentinus</hi> were confuted in the <hi>Sadducees,</hi>
and first corrupters of Christianity. But
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50175:151"/>
the true Christians could not be charged
by their Adversaries with holding any thing
contrary to what the Church received from
the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ,
and Christ from God. For the succession
of the Churches was so evident,<note place="margin">C. 36.</note> and the
<hi>Chairs</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> so well known,<note place="margin">C. 37.</note> that
any one might satisfy his curiosity about
their Doctrine, especially since their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Epistles are still preserved therein.
But where a diversity of Doctrine was
found from the Apostles, that was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
evidence of a false sense that was put
upon the Scriptures.</q>  Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi>
lays down the rules of finding out the sense
of controverted places of Scripture, without
the least insinuation of any infallibility
placed in the Guides of the Church for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the certain sense of them.</p>
            <p>But lest by this way of <hi>Prescribing</hi> against
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> he should seem to decline the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the cause out of distrust of being able
to manage it against them, he tells us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
elsewhere he would set aside the ground
of <hi>prescription,</hi> or just exception against
their pleading, (for so <hi>prescription</hi> signifies
in him) as against <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes</hi>
and <hi>Praxeas</hi> and refute their opinions upon
other grounds. In his Books against <hi>Marcion,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:50175:151"/>
he first lays down <hi>Marcions rule,</hi> as he calls it,
<hi>i.e.</hi> the sum of his opinion, which was making
the Creator of the World, and the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ two distinct Gods,
the one nothing but goodness, and the other,
the Author of evil: which opinion he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
from principles of reason,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <q>because

on the same grounds he makes two he may

be known by his works,<note place="margin">C. 11. 12.</note> and he could not be
God that did not create the World; and
so continues arguing against <hi>Marcion</hi> to
the end of the first Book. In the second
he vindicates God the Creator from all the
objections which <hi>Marcion</hi> had mustered
against his goodness. In the third he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
that Christ was the Son of God the
Creator;<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 5.</note> first by reason and then by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and lays down two rules for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Prophetical predictions relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the manner of expressing future things
as past, and the aenigmatical way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
plain things: afterwards he
proves in the same manner from Scripture
and Reason,<note place="margin">C. 8. 9.</note> that Christ did truly assume
our nature and not meerly in appearance;
which he demonstrates from the death and
resurrection of Christ and from the evidence
of sense; and makes that sufficient evidence
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50175:152"/>
of the truth of a body that it is the object of
three senses, of sight, and touch and hearing.</q>
Which is the same way of arguing we make
use of against Transubstantiation, and if <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>
had been so subtle to have used the
Evasions those do in the Roman Church, he
might have defended the putative body of
Christ in the very same manner that they do

Against <hi>Hermogenes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertull. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mog. c. 19.</note> he disputes about

to the Creation of things; <hi>Tertullian</hi>
proves <hi rend="margQuotes">that all things were made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because it is not mentioned out of

they were made out of matter; because it

<hi>Tertullian</hi> shews from reason the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy

of God:<note place="margin">C. 20. 21.</note> he compares several places

Scripture. I adore, saith he, the fulness
of the Scripture which shews me both the

likewise discovers by whom all things were
made. But the Scripture no where saith
that all things were made out of matter.

the arguments on both sides are drawn from
the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but <hi>Tertullian</hi> well observes,
<q>that they insisted upon two or three places
of Scripture, and would make all the rest
though far more, to yield to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the fewer places ought to be understood
according to the sense of the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But this saith he, is the property
of all Hereticks because they can find but

is against the nature of a rule, wherein the

                  </gap>.</note> proposes that
objection, against Christianity, that there
were many Heresies among Christians, and
therefore men could believe nothing. To
which he answers, <q>That there were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
among the Jews and Philosophers;
and that objection was not thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
against <hi>Iudaism</hi> or Philosophy, and
therefore ought not to be against Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Besides the coming of Heresies was
foretold, and what ever is foretold must
come to pass. The <hi>Physitians</hi> saith he differ
in their opinions, yet men do not neglect
to make use of them, when they are sick.
Heresies should only make men more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
what they choose. Men ought thereby
to endeavour the more to find out truth
from falshood; as if two sorts of fruit be
offered to a man real, and waxen; will a
man abstain from both, because one is
Counterfeit, or rather find out the true
from the apparent? When several ways
offer themselves for a man to go in, he
ought not therefore to sit down and not stir
a step further; but he uses the best means
to find out the true way and then walks in
it. So that they are justly condemned who
do not discern the true from the false; for
they who will, saith he, may find out the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50175:154"/>
truth. For either there is demonstration
or not; all grant demonstration, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who do not destroy our senses; If
there be demonstration there must be
search and enquiry made; and by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
we may demonstratively learn how
Heresies fell of, and that the exactest
knowledge was to be found in the truth and
the ancient Church. Now the true
searchers will not leave till they find Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the Scriptures. To this end,
he commends the exercise of mens reason
and understanding, impartiality or laying
aside opinion, a right disposition of Soul,
for when men are given over to their lusts
they endeavour to wrest the Scriptures to
them. But he establishes the Scripture as
the only principle of certainty to Christians,
and more credible than any demonstration:
which who so have tasted are called faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but those who are versed in them are
the truly knowing men.</q> The great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
now is, <hi>that Hereticks make use of
Scripture too:</hi> 
               <q>I but they, saith he, reject what
they please, and do not follow the Body
and Contexture of Prophecy; but take
ambiguous expressions and apply them to
their own opinions: and a few scattered
phrases without regarding the sense and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of them. For in the Scriptures
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50175:154"/>
produced by them, you may find them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
making use of meer names, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the significations of them; never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the scope and intention of them.
But truth, saith he, doth not lye in the
change of the signification of words (for
by that means all Truth may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown)
but in considering what is proper
and perfectly agreeable to our Lord and
Almighty God, and in confirming every
thing which is demonstrated by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
out of the same Scriptures.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> lays down such rules
as he thought necessary to find out the certain
sense of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> by considering the
scope and coherence of the words, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense and importance of them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of Scripture with Scripture, and the
Doctrine drawn from it with the nature and
properties of God, all which are excellent
Rules, without the least intimation of the
necessity of any Infallible Interpreter to give
the certain sense of doubtful places.</p>

that we see the main of the Controversie did

the Catholick Christians of that Age
had. I shall therefore give an account of what
way the best Writers of the Church in that
time took to find out the sense of Scripture
in the Controverted places. Of all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
against them <hi>Athanasius</hi> hath justly the
greatest esteem, and <hi>Petavius</hi> saith that God
inspired him with greater skill in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
than any others before him. The
principle he goes upon in all his disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Arians,</hi> is this, <hi>that our true faith
is built upon the Scriptures,</hi> so in several
places of his conference with the <hi>Arian</hi> and
in the beginning of his Epistle to <hi>Iovianus</hi>
and elsewhere. Therefore in the entrance of
his <hi>Disputations</hi> against the <hi>Arians,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
all that would secure themselves from
the impostures of Hereticks,<note place="margin">Athans. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <q>to study the
Scriptures; because those who are versed
therein stand firm against all their assaults;
but they who look only at the words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
understanding the meaning of them are
easily seduced by them.</q> And this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
he gives, after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> had
decreed the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine to be <hi>Heresie;</hi>
and although he saith, <q>other ways may
be used to confute it, yet because the Holy
Scripture is more sufficient than all of
them, therefore those who would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
instructed in these things, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50175:158"/>
them to be conversant in the divine
Oracles.</q> 
               <hi>But did not the</hi> Arians <hi>plead
Scripture as well as they? how then could
the Scripture end this Controversie, which
did arise about the sense of Scripture?</hi> This
objection, which is now made so much of
against the Scriptures, was never so much
as thought of in those days; or if it were, was
not thought worth answering; for they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not in the least desert the proofs of Scripture,
because their Adversaries made use of it too.
But they endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to shew that their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
Doctrine had no solid Foundation
in Scripture, but theirs had <hi>i.e.</hi> that the
<hi>Arians</hi> perverted it, because they did not
examine and compare places as they ought
to do, but run away with a few words
without considering the scope and design of
them; or comparing them with places plainer
than those were which they brought. Thus
when the <hi>Arians</hi> objected that place <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

compare that with other places, such as <hi>My

argued <hi>that Christ was only Gods instrument

Christs saying, <hi>all things are delivered to

to <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. to <hi>Phil. 2. 7.
1 Iohn</hi> 5. 20. and others which he thought
the plainest places for Christs eternal Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and by these he proves that the other
were to be interpreted, with a respect to his
humane nature, and the State he was in upon
Earth. So that the greatest Defender of the

saw no necessity at all of calling in the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

but he thought the Scripture plain enough to
all those who would impartially examine it;

intention was to confound their rage and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
out of writings of the Prophets and
Apostles: and to that end desires of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that they would conceive of God not
according to the Laws of their own beings,
but according to the greatness of what he had
declared of himself. For he is the best Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Scripture, who doth not bring his sense
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50175:159"/>
to the Scripture, but takes it from it, and
doth not resolve before hand to find that
there, which he concluded must be the sence
before he reads. In things therefore which
concern God, we must allow him to know
himself best, and give due Reverence to
his word. For he is the best witness to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
who cannot be known but by himself.</q>
In which words he plainly asserts that the
Foundation of our Faith must be in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and that a free and impartial mind is
necessary to find out the true sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And after he had said in the second
Book, that Heresies arise from misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Scripture, and charged in his
fourth Book the <hi>Arians</hi> particularly with it,
he proceeds to answer all the places produced
by them out of the old and new Testament,
by comparing several places together, and the
antecedents and consequents, and by these
means proving that they mistook the meaning
of Scripture. So in the beginning of his
ninth Book rehearsing the Common places,
which were made use of by the <hi>Arians,</hi> he
saith,<note place="margin">Hilar. l. 9.</note> 
               <q>they repeated the words alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enquiring into the meaning, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of them; whereas the true sense of
Scripture is to be taken from the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and consequents: their fundamental
mistake being the applying those things to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50175:160"/>
his Divine nature, which were spoken of
his humane:</q> which he makes good by a
particular examination of the several places in
Controversie.</p>
            <p>The same course is taken by <hi>Epiphanius,
Phaebadius</hi> and others of the ancient Writers
of the Church, who asserted the Eternal
Divinity of Christ against the <hi>Arians. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
therefore charges them which mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>So that it is observable in that great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
which disturbed the Church so many
years, which exercised the wits of all men
in that time to find out a way to put an end
to it, after the Guides of the Church had in
the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> declared what was the
Catholick faith: yet still the Controversie
was managed about the sense of Scripture,
and no other ways made use of for finding it,
than such as we plead for at this day. It is
a most incredible thing, that in a time of so
violent contention, so horrible confusion,
so scandalous divisions in the Christian
Church, none of the Catholick Bishops
should once suggest this admirable Expedient

taken from the Guides of the Church,</hi> what
security could any man have against <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism?</hi>
since the Councils which favoured it,
were more numerous than those which oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and condemned it. Yea so mean was the
opinion which some of the greatest persons
of the Church at that time had of the <hi>Guides</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> met together in <hi>Councils,</hi> that

certainly rules not where the other do? Yet
this de declares to be his mind upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

had lived to those blessed days of the Councils
of latter Ages, with what zeal and Rhetorick

think, that men may come to any certainty
about the true meaning of Scripture? of that
he is best able to give us an account himself
having written purposely in this subject in his
Books of Christian Doctrine the substance
of what he there says may be comprehended in
these Rules.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That the main scope of the Scripture
is to perswade men to the Love of God
and our Neighbour,<note place="margin">Aug. de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctri. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith, no man doth truly understand it;
but whosoever interprets Scripture to the
advancing of that, though he may be
mistaken as to the sense of the words, yet
his errour is not dangerous.</p>
               <p>2. That in order to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Scripture men must apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to it with minds duly prepared for
it;<note place="margin">L. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 7.</note> by a fear of God, humility, prayer,
sincerity, and purity of heart.</p>
               <p>3. That all those things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation are plainly laid down
in Holy Scriptures; This is in terms assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50175:162"/>
by him,<note place="margin">L. 2. c 9.</note> as a fundamental principle,
that in those things which are plainly set
down in Scripture, all things are to be
found which contain our faith and rule of
life. <hi>i.e.</hi> All things which are necessary
to the Love of God and our Neighbour, and
consequently to the making us happy. And
these things men ought especially to read
the Scriptures for; and the more they find
of them, the larger their understanding of
Scripture is.</p>
               <p>4. That the obscure places of Scripture
are to be understood by the plain. For
which end he requires frequent reading,
and using ones self to the language of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,<note place="margin">Ib.</note>
and drawing examples from plain
places to illustrate difficult, and those
which are certain to clear the doubtful.<note place="margin">L. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 26.</note>
For, scarce any thing, saith he, is drawn
out of the most difficult places,<note place="margin">L. 2. c. 6.</note> but what is
very plainly set down elsewhere.</p>
               <p>5. That in regard of the infinite variety
of Latin Interpreters (which it seems were in
his time) in matters of doubt it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to have recourse to the Original
Hebrew and Greek:<note place="margin">L 2. c. 10.</note> the knowledge of
which tongues might therefore be necessary
to the knowledge of Scripture, because
several words are preserved untranslated;
but those being few the necessity is not so
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50175:162"/>
great on their account, as the diversity of
Interpreters;<note place="margin">C. 11.</note> for although those who had
translated the Hebrew into Greek might be
reckoned up, the Latin Interpreters could not.
Which diversity of translations doth rather
help than hinder the understanding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
if the Readers of it be not negligent;
for some doubtful places are cleared by the
difference of readings.</p>
               <p>6. Where the ambiguity lyes in proper
words, the clearing of it depends on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the place;<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 4.</note> in so much that
he determines, that it is a very rare and
difficult thing to find such an ambiguity in
the words of Scripture, which may not be
cleared from the intention of the Writer, or
comparing places, or searching the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Language.</p>
               <p>7. Men must carefully distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
proper and figurative expressions; for
to understand figurative expressions lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
is to subject our understanding to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conceptions of things;<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 5.</note> and that is,
saith he, a miserable slavery of mind, to
take signs for things; such signs he tells us
under the Gospel are the two Sacraments
of Baptism and the Lords supper.<note place="margin">C. 9.</note> The
great difficulty herein, lyes in the finding
out the difference between proper and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
expressions, for which he lays down
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50175:163"/>
this rule, if the words of Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what is good and forbid what is evil,<note place="margin">c. 15, 16.</note>
it is no figurative expression; but if it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
what is good, or command any thing
that is evil, it must be figuratively under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
For which he instances in those
words of our Saviour <hi>unless ye eat the flesh,
and drink the blood of the Son of man
ye shall have no life in you.</hi> Which seeming
to command something evil, must be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
understood of Communicating in
the Passion of Christ, and calling to mind
that his flesh was crucified and wounded for
us.</p>
               <p>8. There is no danger in different senses
being given of the same place of Scripture,
if every one of those senses appear by other
places to be agreeable to Truth:<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 26.</note> This being
supposed that the person do sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the sense of the Author; For,
saith he, that Divine Spirit might easily
foresee how many several senses those words
are capable of, which being agreeable to
other parts of Scripture, though not the
particular meaning of those words, the
mistake cannot be dangerous therein.</p>
               <p>9. Where such a sense is given which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved by other certain Testimonies
of Scripture, it must be made manifest to be
the sense by clear Evidence of Reason.<note place="margin">L. 3. c. 28.</note> But
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50175:163"/>
he rather approves the way of proving the
sense of Scripture by other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
where the interpretation is doubtful.
So that the way in doubtful places which
he prescribes is this, either to draw such a
sense from them as hath no dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its being a true Proposition, or if
it have, that it be confirmed by other places
of Scripture.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Besides these, he lays down the 7. rules of
<hi>Ticonius</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi> which are not of that
consequence to be here repeated; that which
I take notice of is, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> thought
the rules he gave sufficient for understanding
the meaning of Scripture in doubtful places;
but he doth not in the least mention the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of the <hi>Guides of the Church</hi> as a
necessary means for that end. But he doth
assert in as plain terms, as I have done, <hi>that
Scripture is plain in all necessaries to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to any sober enquirer,</hi> and what ever
consequences are charged upon me for making
that a Fundamental principle, must reflect
as much upon St. <hi>Augustin</hi> as me; and I do
not fear all the objections can be made against
a principle so evident to reason, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
not only to St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but the
Doctrine of the Catholick Church both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after him.</p>
            <p>The next after St. <hi>Augustin</hi> who hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50175:164"/>
writ of this argument about the sense
of Scripture is <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vincent. Lerin. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor. p. 4.</note> about
4. years after St. <hi>Augustins</hi> death and 3. after
the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who seems to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more to the <hi>Guides of the Church</hi> than
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth, yet far enough short of
<hi>Infallibility.</hi> He saith, <q>that every man
ought to strengthen his faith against Heresie
by two things, first by the Authoriry of
the divine Law, and then by the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Catholick Church: which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he makes necessary, not by way of
addition to the Scripture, for he allows
the perfection and sufficiency of that for
all things; but only to interpret Scripture
by giving a certain sense of it, there being
such different opinions among men about
it. For all the Hereticks whom he there
names had different senses of Scripture, as
<hi>Novatianus, Sabellius, Donatus, Arius, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius,
Photinus,</hi> &amp;c. But then he bounds
this tradition within the compass of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
consent of Antiquity as well as the
present Church; or as he expresseth it,
within those things which were believed
<hi>every where, always,</hi> and <hi>by all persons.</hi>
               </q>
That we may therefore consider how far
these rules of <hi>Vincentius</hi> will serve for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the sense of Scripture, we are to take
notice of the restrictions he lays upon them</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:50175:164"/>
1. That they are to be taken together, and
not one of them separate from the rest. As
for instance, that of <hi>Vniversality</hi> in any one
Age of the Church, being taken without the
<hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is no sufficient rule,
to interpret <hi>Scripture</hi> by. For <hi>Vincentius</hi>
doth suppose that any one Age of the Church
may be so overrun with Heresie, that there is
no way to confute it, but by recourse to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
<q>For in the case of the <hi>Arian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
he grants that almost the whole
Church was overspread with it, and there
was then no way left but to prefer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Antiquity before a prevailing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty.</q>
In some cases the Universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the present Church is to be relyed upon
against the attempts of particular persons,
as in that of the <hi>Donatists;</hi> but then we are
to consider, that <hi>Antiquity</hi> was still pleaded
on the same side that <hi>Vniversality</hi> was, and
supposing that all the Ancient Church from
the Apostles times had been of the same mind
with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the greater number of
the same Age opposing them, would have
been no more cogent against them, than it was
afterwards for the <hi>Arians.</hi> It is unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe that in a thing universally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by all Christians from the Apostles
times the Christian Church should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
but it is quite another thing to say,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50175:165"/>
that the Church in any one or more Ages
since the Apostles times may be deceived;
especially if the Church be confined to one
certain Communion excluding all others,
and the persons in that Church have not
liberty to deliver their opinions, for then
it is impossible to know what the Judgement
of the whole Church is. And so <hi>universality</hi>
is not thought by <hi>Vincentius</hi> himself to be
alone sufficient to determine the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
supposing that <hi>universality</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
according to the honesty of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times <hi>for a free and general consent</hi>
of the Christians of that Age in which a man
lives; but since the great divisions of the
Christian world, it is both a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to know the consent of Christendom in
most of the Controverted places of Scripture,
and withal the notion of <hi>Vniversality</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
and corrupted, and made only to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the consent of one great Faction, which
is called by the name of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
but truly known by the name of <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That great care and Judgement must
be used in the applying those Rules; for</p>
            <p>1. The consent of Antiquity is not equally
evident in all matters in dispute, and therefore
cannot be of equal use.</p>
            <p>1. There are some things wherein we may
be certain of such a consent, and that was in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50175:165"/>
               <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Vincentius</hi> and most of
the ancient Writers call it <hi>i.e.</hi> the summary
comprehension of a Christians duty as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith, which was not so often called
the <hi>Symbol</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that I mean
which was delivered to persons, who were to
be baptized and received into the Church,
this the ancient Church Universally agreed in
as to the substance of it. And as to this <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi>
tells us his Rule is especially to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.<note place="margin">Commonit. 1. c. 39. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </note>
               <q>For saith he, this consent of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
is not to be sought for in all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that may arise about the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but only or at least chiefly in the
Rule of Faith: or as he elsewhere explains
himself,<note place="margin">Commonit. 2. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which concern the Fundamentals
of the Catholick Doctrine: which were
those contained in the Rule of Faith, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to all that were to be baptized.</q> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
men now should stretch this Rule beyond
the limits assigned it by <hi>Vincentius,</hi> what
security can there be from him that it shall
be a certain rule, who confined it within such
narrow bounds? Not that I think, his Rules
of no use at all now; no, I think them to be
of admirable use and great importance to
Christianity, if truly understood and applyed.
<hi>i.e.</hi> When any Persons take upon them to
impose any thing upon others as a necessary
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50175:166"/>
matter of faith to be believed by them, we
can have no better rules of Judgement in this
case than those of <hi>Vincentius</hi> are, <hi>viz. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Consent;</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
cannot be proved by these Rules ought
to be rejected by all Christians. To make this
plain, the Ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> we allow on both
sides to have been universally received by
the Catholick Church; but now the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> adds new Articles to be believed, we
desire to put the whole matter upon this issue:
Let the Popes Supremacy, the Roman
Churches Infallibility, the Doctrines of
Transubstantiation, Purgatory, &amp;c. be
proved by as Universal Consent of Antiquity
as the Articles of the Creed are, and then
let them charge us with <hi>Heresie</hi> if we reject
them. But we say the measure of Heresie in
the Ancient Church was the rejecting the
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> universally received among
Christians, this <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> we stand to,
and say no other can be made upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

not barely allowed, but pleaded for by us, in

of them, how then are we to find out the

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50175:167"/>
might err in this matter, or speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
in it before the matter came to be
throughly discussed;</q> if so, how comes the
Testimony of <hi>erroneous</hi> or <hi>unwary Writers</hi> to
be the <hi>certain means</hi> of giving the <hi>sense</hi> of
<hi>Scripture?</hi> And in most of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of the Church this way hath been
used to take off the Testimony of persons,
who writ before the Controversie began, and
spake differently of the matter in debate. I
do not deny the truth of the allegation in
behalf of those persons; but to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it plainly shews the incompetency of
<hi>Tradition</hi> for giving a certain sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
when that Tradition is to be taken
from the Writers of the foregoing Ages: and
if this had been the only way of confuting
<hi>Arius,</hi> it is a great Question how he could
ever have been condemned, if <hi>Petavius</hi> or
St. <hi>Hierome</hi> say true? But since a General
Council hath determined the contrary to
the opinion of these Writers before, which
Council hath been received by the Universal
Church, I will not deny that they had better
opportunities of knowing what the sense of
the Ancient Church was, when so many
writings were extant which are now lost,
than we can have at this distance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we yield all submission to a <hi>Council</hi> of
that nature and proceeding in that manner
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50175:167"/>
which that of <hi>Nice</hi> did; who did not meerly
determine that Controversie by the number
of Writers on their side before them, but by
comparing the opinions afterwards with the
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and in this regard we
acknowledge a great Reverence due to the
decrees of such General Councils as that was.
Therefore next to the Rule of Faith we allow
a great veneration to the determinations of
lawful General Councils Universally received;
which <hi>Vincentius</hi> himself pleads for: But
supposing no general Councils or such which
are not allowed, or received for such; we
are yet to enquire into the ways of finding out
Catholick tradition, which may interpret
Scripture. For this end he proposes another
means which is, <hi>The gathering together the
opinions of those Fathers alone;</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 39.</note> 
               <hi>who living
holily, wisely and constantly in the faith and
communion of the Catholick Church have
died in that faith, or else for it.</hi> But still
with this reserve, <hi>that what either all or
many of them manifestly, frequently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
as it were by a Council of them,
have confirmed by their receiving, holding,
and delivering of it, that ought to be held for
undoubted, certain and firm; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
any one though holy and learned, though
a Bishop, confessour or Martyr, hath held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the opinion of others that ought not to be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50175:168"/>
looked on as the judgement of the Church, but
as his own private opinion, and therefore not
to be followed.</hi> Which words I shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
with all the severity that some have
done, for then the proving these conditions
to have been observed by any one person
would require more pains, and be less capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of resolution than the matter it self
is; but I say, that in most of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
this day in the Christian world,
it may be much more satisfactory to examine
the merits of the cause than the integrity of
the witnesses, these conditions being supposed.
And yet after all this, we must not misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him, as though this way would serve
to confute all heresies; For he tells us yet
farther.</p>
            <p>2. <q>This course can only hold in some
new and upstart heresies <hi>i.e.</hi> in case of the
pretence of some new revelation when men
pretend to some special grace without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
industry to discover some divine
truth, not known before;<note place="margin">C. 37.</note> but in case of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and inveterate heresies;<note place="margin">C. 39.</note> he saith we
have no way to deal with them, but either
only by Scripture, or else by plain decrees
of General Councils, for when heresies
have been of long continuance, then, saith
he, we may have ground to suspect they
have not dealt fairly with the Testimonies
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50175:168"/>
of ancient times.</q> And thus we see what
<hi>Vincentius</hi> hath offered towards the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this great Question, <hi>how we may be
sure of the certain sense of Scripture in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
places;</hi> wherein is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
but what we are willing to stand to;
and very far from the least supposition of any
infallibility in the present Guides of the
Church for that end.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have taken the pains to search
into the opinion of the Primitive Church in
this important Controversie; which I might
carry yet farther, if it were at all needful.
The substance of what is delivered by them
is this, that if any Controversie arise in the
Church concerning the sense of Scripture,
if the Persons do not allow the Scripture,
then we are to proceed by the best means we
can have without it, <hi>viz.</hi> The tradition of
Apostolical Churches from the beginning;
if they do allow the Scripture then we are to
examine and compare places of Scripture
with all the care and judgement that may be.
If after all this, the dispute still continues,
then if it be against the ancient Rule of Faith
universally received, that is a sufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
against any opinion; if not against
the Rule of Faith in express words, but about
the sense of it, then if ancient General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
have determined it which had greater
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50175:169"/>
opportunities of knowing the sense of the
Apostolical Church than we, it is reasonable
we should yield to them; but if there have
been none such, then the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Fathers is to be taken, so it be in some
late and upstart heresies, which men pretend
to have by Revelation or some special Grace
of God. Now either all these means were
sufficient or not to find out the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
if not, then the ancient Church was
wholly defective and wanted any certain way
of finding out the sense of Scripture; if these
were sufficient, then there is no necessity of
infallibility in the Guides of the Church to
give us a certain sense of Scripture: which
was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>But <hi>N. O.</hi> towards the conclusion of his
Book produces St. <hi>Augustin</hi> for the Churches
Infallibility,<note place="margin">§. 14. S. Augustins Testimo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

him, must be examined before I conclude
this discourse about the sense of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The place is out of his Answer to <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconius</hi>
concerning the obscure point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization;
in these words, since the holy

fear of being deceived by the obscurity of this
Question, consult the same Church about it,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50175:169"/>
which Church the holy Scripture doth without
all ambiguity demonstrate. And before,
the truth of the Holy Scriptures is held by us
in this matter, when we do that which hath
pleased the Vniversal Church, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scripture does commend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
All which is false and said to no purpose <hi>saith
N. O.</hi> if the Scripture be not clear in this,
that this Church can determine nothing in
such important contests contrary to the verity
of the Scriptures, and that we ought to give
credit to what she decides; for then it would
not be true, what he says the truth of the same
Scripture in this matter is held by us: and
he who is in fear of being deceived by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
of this Question, is no way relieved
in following the sentence of the Churth. <hi>To
which I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That St. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth not suppose, that
men cannot attain to any certainty of the
the sense of Scripture in this matter without
the Churches Infallibility; for, he saith,
in the Chapter preceding, <hi>that in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we follow the most certain Authority of
Canonical Scriptures;</hi> but he puts the case
<hi>that no certain example could be produced out
of Scripture,</hi> then he saith, <hi>they had the
truth of the Scriptures when they do that
which pleased the Vniversal Church,</hi> &amp;c.
For the explaining St. <hi>Augustins</hi> meaning,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50175:170"/>
we are to consider, that there were two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
then on foot in the Church
with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the one concerning <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization,</hi>
the other concerning the <hi>Church</hi>
the former he looks upon as more intricate
and obscure, by reason not only of the
doubtfulness of Scripture, but the Authority
of about seventy Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> who
had determined for it, among whom St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> was chief, which we see in all his
disputes with the <hi>Donatisis</hi> on this subject he
is very much perplexed with; therefore St.
<hi>Augustin</hi> finding that Controversie very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
was willing to bring it to that issue,
that what the Catholick Church after so
much discussing the point had agreed upon
should be received as the truth. By this
means the dispute would be brought to that
other Question, which he thought much more
easie, <hi>viz.</hi> Which was the true Church,
the Catholick or the <hi>Donatists:</hi> but by no
means doth St. <hi>Augustin</hi> hereby intend to
make the Churches Authority to resolve all
doubts concernig <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but he thought
it much easier to prove by Scripture which
was the true Church, than whether rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization
were lawful or not. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
his very next words are, <hi>but if you
doubt whether the Vniversal Church be that
which the Scripture commends, I will load
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50175:170"/>
you with many and most manifest Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture to that end.</hi> Which is the
design of his Book of the <hi>Vnity of the Church:</hi>
wherein he shews,<note place="margin">Aug. de u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. Eccles. c. 4. 5, 19.</note>
               <q>That those Testimonies
of Scripture which speak of the Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church, are very plain and
clear: and needed no interpretation at all,
that in this case we are not to regard what
<hi>Donatus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 10.</note> or <hi>Parmenianus,</hi> or <hi>Pontius</hi> hath
said; for neither, saith he, are we to yield
to Catholick Bishops themselves, if they
be at any time so much deceived as to hold
what is contrary to Canonical Scriptures.</q>
By which it is evident that he supposed no
infallibility in the <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
And in terms he asserts,<note place="margin">C. 16.</note>
               <q>that the Church
is to be proved by nothing but plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
neither by the Authority of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi>
or St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or innumerable
Bishops, nor Councils, nor Miracles, nor
visions and Revelations,</q> (whatever <hi>N. O.</hi>
thinks of them) now St. <hi>Augustin</hi> supposing
there was much less ambiguity in Scripture
in the Controversie of the <hi>Church</hi> than in
that of Rebaptization, he endeavours to
bring them to a resolution in the other point
for the clearing of this: and so he only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
the method laid down in the <hi>Books of
Christian Doctrine,</hi> to make use of plainer
places of <hi>Scripture</hi> to give light to the darker.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50175:171"/>
And when they were convinced by Scripture
that the Catholick Church was the true
Church of Christ, he doth not question but
they would follow that which was the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Catholick Church. But here
lyes the main difficulty, <hi>on what account the
sentence of the Church was to be followed?</hi>
In order to the resolution of it, we must take
notice of these things.</p>
            <p>1. That all the proofs which St. <hi>Augustin</hi>
brings for the <hi>Church</hi> do relate only to the
<hi>extent</hi> and <hi>Vniversality</hi> of it, and not to any
<hi>Infallibility</hi> that is promised to it; as will
easily appear to any one that will read his
discourses on that subject against the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That he asserts no infallibility in the
highest Authority of the Church; which in
many places of his</hi> Books <hi>of</hi> Baptism <hi>against
the</hi> Donatists <hi>he makes to be a</hi> Plenary <hi>or</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council;<note place="margin">Aug. de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptis. c. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. l 2. c. 1. c. 9. l. 4. c. 6. l. 2. c. 4. l. 3. c. 10. l. 6. c. 2.</note> whose Authority, <hi>he saith,</hi>
was to be preferred before that of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
or any particular Councils either in his time,
or before it; <hi>which he calls the</hi> Authority
and decrees of the Vniversal Church. <hi>So
that we see he resolves all the Authority of
the Church in this matter into that of a</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council: <hi>(whether that of</hi> Arles, <hi>or</hi>
Nice <hi>is not to my purpose to enquire) and we
shall then see what his opinion is of the
Churches infallibility by that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50175:171"/>
of</hi> General Councils; <hi>as well as any
other Church Authority compared with the
Scriptures, in these remarkable words.</hi>
Who knows not that the sacred Canonical
Scripture is contained within its certain
bounds,<note place="margin">De Bapt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

all latter writings of Bishops that there can
be no doubt or dispute at all made, whether
that be true or right which is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
but all latter writings of Bishops which
have been or are written, since the Canon
of Scripture hath been confirmed, may be
corrected if in any thing they err from the
Truth, either by the wiser discourse of any
more skilful person, or the weightier Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of other Bishops, or the prudence of more
learned men, or by Councils: And even
Councils themselves that are Provincial yield
without dispute to those which are General,
and called out of all the Christian World;
and of these General Councils the former are
often amended by the latter, when by some
farther tryal of things that which was shut is
laid open, and that which was hidden is
made known without any swelling of sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
pride, or stifness of arrogancy, or
contentin of envy; but with holy humility,
Catholick peace and Christian Charity. <hi>Can
any one that reads this excellent Testimony
of St.</hi> Augustin <hi>delivered in this same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50175:172"/>
ever imagine he could so plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
himself; as to assert the Churches
infallibility in one place and destroy it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Would he assert</hi> that all Councils how
General soever may be amended by following
Councils, <hi>and yet bind men to believe that
the decrees of the former Councils do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the unalterable will of God? A lesser
person than St.</hi> Augustin <hi>would never thus
directly contradict himself, and that about
the very same Controversie, which words of
his cannot be understood of</hi> unlawful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<hi>of</hi> matters of fact or practice, <hi>but do
refer to the great Question then in debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
rebaptizing Hereticks; and hereby he
takes off the great Plea, the Donatists made
from the Authority of St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>and his
Council, which they continually urged for
themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. He grants, that <hi>the arguments drawn
from the Churches Authority are but humane,</hi>
and that satisfaction is to be taken from the
Scriptures in this Controversie.<note place="margin">De Bapt. l. 3. c. 4.</note> 
               <q>For men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the obscurity of this Question, and
the great debates that had been about it
before the <hi>Donatists</hi> time among great and
good men, and diverse resolutions of
Councils and the settlement of it at last by
a plenary Council of the whole World;
but lest, saith he, I should seem to make
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50175:172"/>
use only of humane arguments, I produce
certain Testimonies out of the Gospel, by
which, God willing, I demonstrate how true
and agreeable to his Will the Doctrine and
practice of the Catholick Church is.<note place="margin">De Baptis. l. 2. c. 14.</note>
               </q> And

of men, but to the Lords ballance, <hi>viz.</hi>

of, but those of Scripture, and by them
they are to Judge of all others, and what
is agreeable to them they receive, what is
not they reject, though written by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of never so great Authority.</q> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this is it possible to believe that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
should make the Churches decree in a
General Council infallible? No: the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
by a careful consideration of his mind
in this matter that I can find, is; that in a
Question of so doubtful and obscure a nature
as that was, which had been so long bandied
in the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> and from thence
spread over all the Churches of the Christian
World, it was a reasonable thing to presume
that what the whole Christian World did
consent in was the truth, not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of infallibility, but the reasonable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that all the Churches of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50175:173"/>
World, would not consent in a thing
repugnant to any Apostolical Doctrine or
Tradition. And so St. <hi>Augustins</hi> meaning
is the same with <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> as to
the Universal attestation of the Christian
Church in a matter of Tradition; being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the decree of a General Council,
and that decree Universally received but only
by the litigant parties in <hi>Africa.</hi> To which
purpose it is observable that he so often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the <hi>Vniversal consent of Christians</hi>
in this matter; <hi>after it had been so throughly
discussed and considered, by the most wise
and disinteressed persons,</hi>

               <note place="margin">L. 4. c. 7.</note> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> replys
to him; <q>That the custom of the Church
having been always so and continuing after

and Testimonies of Scripture on both
sides, it may be now said, that we follow
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50175:173"/>
what Truth hath declared.</q> Wherein we
see with what modesty and upon what grounds
he declares his mind, which at last comes to
no more than <hi>Vincentius</hi> his <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Consent.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in such a matter as this was, which
had nothing but Tradition to be pleaded for it,
<hi>the Apostles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Bapt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>having determined nothing of
either side, in their Books as St Augustin</hi>
himself at last confesses in this matter. The
most then that can be made of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
alledged out of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is this,
that in a matter of so doubtful and obscure a
nature wherein the Apostles have determined
nothing in their Writings, we are to believe
that to be the truth, which the Universal
Church of Christ agreed in those times, when
the consent of the Universal Church was so
well known by frequent discussion of the
case and coming at last to a resolution in a
General Council. In such a case as this, I
agree to what St. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, and think
a man very much relieved by following so
evident a consent of the Universal Church:
not by vertue of any <hi>infallibility,</hi> but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of believing so many, so wise,
so disinteressed persons should be deceived.
Let the same evidences be produced for the
consent of the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> from the
<hi>Apostolical times</hi> in the matters in dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50175:174"/>
our <hi>Church</hi> and that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Controversie of <hi>Infallibility</hi> may be laid
aside; For such an universal consent of the
Christian Church I look upon as the most
Authentick Interpreter of Holy Scripture in
doubtful and obscure places. But let them
never think to fob us off, with the consent
of the <hi>Roman Faction</hi> for the <hi>Vniversal
Church,</hi> nor of some <hi>latter ages,</hi> for a <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Apostolical times,</hi> nor of a <hi>packed
Company of Bishops</hi> for a <hi>truly General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
And thus much may now serve to clear
that important Controversie about the sense
of Scripture in doubtful places.</p>
            <p>The last thing to be considered is, whether
the same arguments which overthrow infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,<note place="margin">§. 15. Of Church Authority.</note>
do likewise destroy all Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
For this is by <hi>N. O.</hi> frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

               <hi>and daily like to wane more and more
by this new taken up way of its Defence.</hi>
My Answer is, that I have carefully examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and searched my Principles and find no
such Gunpowder in them for blowing up Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
either of Church or State. For all
that I can discover, they are very innocent
and harmless; and if all other mens had been
so, we had never heard so much talk of this
way, of undermining and blowing up. But
is it not a pleasant thing to see, all of a sudden,
what zeal these men discover for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our Churches Authority? Alas
good men! It grieves them at the very heart,
to see the Authority of our Church weakned
and that by its own members. What would
not they do for the strengthening and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of it? What pity it is, such a Church
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50175:175"/>
should not stand, whose very enemies take such
care for its preservation; And are so ready to
discover the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of its own children against it?
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure, there is mischief intended when
enemies discover it; not by those whom they
accuse, but by the honest Informers; who
would be content to hold their peace, if
they thought they could not sow mischief by
pretending to discover it. It is a pretty plot
to make those who design to defend our
Church to be the underminers of it, and the
most professed Enemies its surest Friends.
But such plots are too fine to hold, and too
thin not to be seen through. How is it I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<hi>N. O. that my principles undermine all
Church Authority?</hi> Have I any where made
the Church a meer shadow, and an insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Cypher, a Society depending only on
the pleasure of men for its subsistence and
Authority? This had been indeed to the
purpose, but not the least word tending that
way can be drawn out of any Principles of
mine. For I verily believe that the Church
is a Society instituted by Christ himself, and
invested with Authority necessary for its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and preservation. <hi>But though I
cannot deny such an Authority I may render it
wholly useless.</hi> I cannot conceive any such
malignant influence in any Principles of mine,
but if there be, it must be from one of these
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50175:175"/>
things. 1. Either because I deny Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the Guides of the Church. Or 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I say that the Scriptures are plain in
things necessary to salvation. Or 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I deny the Authority of the Church of
Rome. Or 4. Because I am not for such an
effectual way of suppressing Sects and Heresies
as is in use in the Roman Church. But I hope
to make it appear that none of these do in the
least tend to weaken, or bring into contempt
the Church of <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds</hi> authority, nor the
just Authority of any Church in the World.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Not the denial of Infallibility.</hi> This
<hi>N. O.</hi> seems to suppose to be the very <hi>Faux</hi> in
the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> the instrument of setting
all on Fire. But is there any thing peculiar to
my Principles herein? Have not all who have
written against the Church of Rome opposed
the pretence of Infallibility? how then come
my principles to be of so mischievous a nature
above others? But I pray, Sir, are Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Infallibility all one in your account?
We suppose that Magistrates and Parents,
and Masters have all of them an unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Authority but I never heard yet of any
man that said they wre infallible: or that
there was no ground to obey them, if they
were not. Why may we not then allow any
Authority belonging to the Governours of
the Church, and yet think it possible for them
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50175:176"/>
to be deceived? Is this a sufficient reason for
any man to cast off his subjection to his Prince,
because it's possible he may require something
unlawful? or to disobey his Parents, because
they do not sit in an infallible chair? or to
slight his Master, because he is not Pope?
These are strange ways of arguing about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, which are ridiculous in any
other case. If the possibility of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
destroys no other Authority in the
world, why should it do that of the Church?
The Magistrate does not lose his Authority
though we say we are to obey God rather than
men, and consequently to examine whether the
Laws of men are not repugnant to the Laws of
God, which implys that he may require what
it is our duty not to do. The Authority of
Parents is not destroyed, because in some
cases we are bound to disobey them, when
they command men to destroy or rise up in
arms against their Soveraign. How comes
it then to pass, that all Church-Authority
is immediately gone, if we do but suppose a
possibility of errour in those which have it?
But it may be said <hi>it is their office to be Guides,
and if we do not follow them absolutely, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them from being our Guides.</hi> To which
I answer, there are two sorts of persons that
stand in need of Guides, the blind and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
the blind must follow their Guides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50175:176"/>
of an incapacity of seeing their way, the
Ignorant for want of Instruction. Yet neither
of these are bound to believe their Guides In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and to follow them at all adventures.
For even the blind by their own sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of frequent falling into ditches or
knocking their heads against Posts may have
reason to question, if not the skill, yet the
sincerity of their Guides, and though they
must have some, may seek new ones. The
ignorant follow their Guides only upon the
opinion of their skill and integrity; and when
they see reason to Question these, they know
of no obligation to follow their conduct over
rocks and precipices; if they are so careless
of their own welfare, others are not bound to
follow them therein. But we are not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
persons so wholly Ignorant, but they
have some general Rules by which to Judge
of the skill and fidelity of their Guides. If a
Person commits himself to the care of a Pilot
to carry him to <hi>Constantinople</hi> because of his
ignorance of the Sea, should this man still
rely upon his Authority, if he carried him
to find out the North West passage? No:
though he may not know the particular Coasts
so well; yet he knows the East and West,
the North and South from each other. If a
stranger should take a Guide to conduct him
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> although he may not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50175:177"/>
think fit to dispute with him at every doubtful
turning, yet is he bound to follow him when
he travels all day with the Sun in his face?
for although he doth not know the direct road,
yet he knows that he is to go Northward.
The meaning of all this is, that the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Guides in Religion doth depend upon
some common principles of Religion that are
or may be known to all, and some precepts
so plain that every Christian without any
help may know them to be his duty; within
the compass of these plain and known duties,
lyes the capacity of persons judging of their
Guides; if they carry them out of this beaten
way, they have no reason to rely upon them
in other things: if they keep themselves care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
within those bounds, and shew great
integrity therein, then in doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
things they may with more safety rely
upon them. But if they tell them they must
put out their eyes to follow them the better,
or if they kindly allow them to keep their
eyes in their heads, yet they must believe them
against their eye-sight, if they perswade them
to break plain Commands of God and to alter
the Institutions of Christ, what reason can
there be that any should commit themselves
to the absolute Conduct of such unfaithful
Guides? And this is not to destroy all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of faithful Guides, for they may be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50175:177"/>
of great use for the direction of unskilful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in matters that are doubtful and require
skill to resolve them, but it is only to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that their Authority is not absolute nor
their direction infallible. <hi>But if we take
away this Infallible direction from the
Guides of the Church, what Authority is
there left them?</hi> As much as ever God gave
them, and if they will not be contented with
that, we cannot help it; and that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
how vain and frivolous these exceptions
are, I shall now shew what real Authority
is still left in the Governours of the Church,
though Infallibility be taken away. And
that lyes in three things.</p>
            <p>1. An Authority of inflicting censures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offenders; which is commonly called the
Power of the keys, or of receiving into and
excluding out of the Communion of the
Church. This the Church was invested with
by Christ himself, and is the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of the being and institution of a
Christian Society, which cannot be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in its purity and peace without it. Which
Authority belongs to the Governours of the
Church, and however the Church in some
respects be incorporated with the Common-wealth
in a Christian State, yet its Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Rights remain distinct from it: of which
this is one of the chief to receive into and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50175:178"/>
exclude out of the Church such persons
which, according to the Laws of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Society, are fit to be taken in or shut out.</p>
            <p>2. An Authority of making Rules and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
about matters of order and decency in
the Church. Not meerly in the necessary
circumstances of time and place, and such
things the contrary to which imply a natural
indecency; but in continuing and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those ancient rites of the Christian
Church, which were practised in the early
times of Christianity, and are in themselves
of an indifferent nature. Which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church hath been not only
asserted in the Articles of our Church, but
strenuously defended against the trifling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of her Enemies,<note place="margin">Art. 20.</note> from Scripture, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
and Reason. And I freely grant, not only
that such an Authority is in it self reasonable
and just; but that in such matters required by a
Lawful Authority (such as that of our Church
is) there is an advantage on the side of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
against a scrupulous Conscience, which
ought to over-rule the practice of such who
are the members of that Church.</p>
            <p>3. An Authority of proposing matters of
<hi>faith</hi> and directing men in Religion. Which
is the proper Authority of Teachers, and
Guides, and Instructers of others; which
may be done several ways, as by particular
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50175:178"/>
instruction of doubtful persons, who are
bound to make use of the best helps they can,
among which that of their Guides is the most
ready and useful, and who are obliged to
take care of their Souls, and therefore to give
the most faithful advice and Counsel to them.
Besides this, there is a publick way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
by discourses grounded upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to particular congregations, assembled
together for the worship of God in places
set apart for that end and therefore called
Churches. And those who are duly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for this work, and ordained by those whose
office is to ordain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bishops, have an
Authority to declare what the mind and Will
of God is, contained in Scripture in order
to the Salvation and edification of the Souls
of men. But besides this, we may consider
the Bishops and representative Clergy of a
Church as met together for reforming any
abuses crept into the practice of Religion or
errours in Doctrine; and in this case we
assert that such a Synod or Convocation
hath the power and Authority within it self
(especially having all the ancient rights of a
Patriarchal Church) when a more general
consent cannot be obtained to publish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what those errours &amp; abuses are, &amp; to do
as much as in them lyes to reform them, <hi>viz.</hi>
by requiring a consent to such propositions as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50175:179"/>
are agreed upon for that end, of those who
are to enjoy the publick offices of teaching
and instructing others. Not to the end that
all those propositions should be believed as
Articles of Faith; but because no Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can be effected, if persons may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to preach and officiate in the Church in
a way contrary to the design of such a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>And this is now that Authority we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Governours of our Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we allow no Infallibility to them.
And herein we proceed in a due mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the extremes of robbing the Church of
all Authority of one side; and advancing it
to Infallibility on the other. But we cannot
help the weakness of those mens understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
who cannot apprehend that any such
thing as Authority should be left in a Church,
if we deny Infallibility. Other diseases
may be cured, but natural incapacity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Not, the making Scriptures plain to
all sober enquirers in matters necessary to
Salvation.</hi> This is that principle which <hi>N. O.</hi>
makes such horrible out-crys about, as though
it were the Foundation of all the heresies and
Sects in the World. <hi>This,</hi> he saith, <hi>makes
all Ecclesiastical Authority useless; for what
need is there of Bishops, Presbyters, or any

for undermining and blowing up of Towns
and Forts and Parliaments, but what are all
those to the blowing up a whole Church at

               </gap>achers and Officers that were; but

that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all their Articles, Constitutions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
have been composed and enjoyned by
an usurped Authority.</hi> Very sad consequences
truly! but like deep plots they lye very far
out of sight. For to my understanding, not
one of these dismal things follows any more
from my Principles, than from proving that
<hi>S. C.</hi> and <hi>N. O.</hi> both stand for the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Which will easily appear to any one
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that will but consider. 1. The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Principles. 2. The just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them.</p>
            <p>1. The intention of those Principles;
which was plainly to lay down the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Christians faith living in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of our Church; (which is expressed
in as perspicuous terms before them as may
be;) and to shew that the Roman Churches
Infallibility is no necessary Foundation of
Faith. Now, this being the design of those
Principles, to what purpose should I have
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50175:180"/>
gone about therein, to have stated the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and bounds of the Authority of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches. I no where in the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the use of all means and due helps of
Guides and others for the understanding the
sense of Scripture; and I no where mention
them; because my business was only about
the Foundation of Faith, and whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
was necessary for that or no? If I
have proved it was not, I have gained my
design; for then those who deny the Church
of Romes Infallibility may never the less have
a sure Foundation, or solid Principles to
build their Faith upon. Now to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in an account of the Principles of Faith
should I mention those things, which we do
not build our faith upon, I mean the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Guides; for although we allow
them all the usefulness of helps; yet those
are no more to be mentioned in the Principles
of resolving Faith, than <hi>Eulids</hi> Master was to
be mentioned in his Demonstrations. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he might learn his skill from him; yet
the force of his Demonstrations did not depend
upon his Authority. I hope it now appears,
how far I am from making <hi>Church-Authority
useless;</hi> but I still say our Faith is not to be
resolved into it, and therefore is not to be
reckoned as a Principle or Foundation of
Faith. To that end it is sufficient to prove.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50175:181"/>
that men in the due use of means, whom I
call <hi>sober enquirers,</hi> may without any Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, believe the Scriptures, and
understand what is necessary to their Salvation
herein: If this may be, then I say it follows
<hi>(Princ. 15.)</hi> that there can be no necessity
supposed of any infallible Society of men,
either to attest or explain these Writings,
among Christians. Not one word that takes
away the use of Authority in the Church,
but only of Infallibility; <hi>but it may be said that
although it might not be my intention, yet
it may be the just consequence of the Principles
themselves</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Therefore I shall now prove that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
drawn from them can infer this. For
what if all those things which are necessary
to Salvation are plain in Scripture, to all
that sincerely endeavour to understand them,
doth it hence follow that there can be no just
Authority in a Church, no use of Persons to
instruct others, must all the people become
Prophets and no bounds be set to the liberty
of Prophesying? These are bad consequences;
but the comfort is, they are not true. If I
should say that the necessary Rules for a mans
health are so plainly laid down by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
that every one that will take the pains
may understand them; doth this make the
whole profession of Physick useless, or license
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50175:181"/>
every man to practise Physick that will, or
make it needless to have any Professours in
that faculty? When the Philosophers of old
did so frequently inculcate that the necessaries
for life were few and easie; did this make all
Political Government useless, and give every
man power to do what he pleased? Men of
any common understanding would distinguish
between the necessaries of life and civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
so would any one but <hi>S. C.</hi> or <hi>N. O.</hi>
of the necessaries to Salvation, and to the
Government of the Church; For men must
be considered first as Christians, and then as
Christians united together: as in civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
they are to be considered first as men,
and then as <hi>Cives;</hi> to say, that a man hath
all that is necessary to preserve his life as a
man, doth not overthrow the Constitution
of a Society, although it implys that he might
live without it: so when men are considered
barely as Christians no more ought to be
thought necessary for them as such, but what
makes them capable of Salvation; but if we
consider them as joyning together in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Society, then many other things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for that end: For then there must be
Authority in some and subjection in others,
there must be orders and Constitutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all must be kept within their due bounds,
and there must be persons appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50175:182"/>
the Ignorant, to satisfy the doubting,
to direct the unskilful, and to help the weak.
It belongs to such a Society not barely to
provide for necessity but safety, and not
meerly the safety of particular persons but of
it self; which cannot be done without pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
orders, fixing the bounds of mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and not suffering every pretender
to visions and Revelations to set up for a new
Sect, or which is all one a new Order of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men. How comes it now to pass that
by saying that men, considered barely as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
may understand all that is necessary to
their Salvation, <hi>I do overthrow all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Church and make all men Prophets?</hi>
Do I in the least mention mens teaching
others, or being able themselves to put a
difference, between what is so necessary
and what not; or doth <hi>S. C.</hi> suppose that all
that understand what is necessary to Salvation
have no need to be ruled and governed? If he
thinks so, I assure him I am quite of another
opinion, and do make no question but that
Government ought to be preserved in a
Church, though the necessaries to Salvation
be known to all in it; and so I suppose doth
any one else that in the least considers what he
says. By this we see, that <hi>S. C'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> on our Church, by
vertue of this principle is as feeble as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50175:182"/>
he hath made for his own, of which
he may hear in due time. But if there be any
<hi>Fanaticism</hi> in this principle, we have the
concurrence of the greatest and wisest persons
of the Christian Church in it: Two of them
especially have in terms said as much as I
have done, St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his Books of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine already mentioned: and St.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> in as plain words as may be.

               <hi>that I cannot find out one single short

to be; and for the finding out the sense

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50175:183"/>
I have produced more out of Antiquity in this
discourse, than either he or his whole partie
will be able to Answer.</p>
            <p>3. Not <hi>the denying the Authority of the
Church of Rome.</hi> Which I must do till I see
some better proofs for it, than I have ever
yet done. But how doth this, <hi>destroy all
Authority in a Church?</hi> can there be none,
but what is derived from <hi>Rome?</hi> I do not
think, I do in the least diminish the Kings
Authority, by denying that he derives it
from the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> or the <hi>Great
Mogol:</hi> although they may challenge the
Lordship of the whole Earth to themselves:
and may pretend very plausible reasons that it
would be much more for the quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of mankind to be all under one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Monarch, and that none have so fair
a pretence to it, as they that have challenged
the Right of it to themselves: and yet for all
this, I do verily believe the King hath an
unquestionable right to his Kingdom, and a
just Authority over all his subjects. The
time was when the first of <hi>Genesis</hi> would
serve to prove the Popes title, and <hi>the Suns
ruling by day</hi> was thought a clear argument
for his supremacy; but the world is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and all the wit and subtility that hath
been since used hath not been able to make
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50175:183"/>
good that crackt title of Universal Pastorship,
which the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have taken to
themselves. But although we disown the
Popes Authority as an unjust usurpation,
we assert and plead for the Authority of the
Church and the Bishops who are placed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
who derive their power to Govern the
Church from Christ and not from the Pope.
And I dare appeal to any Person, whether the
asserting the Bishops deriving their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Christ or from the Pope, be the
better way of defending their Power? We
are not now disputing what Authority were
fit to be entrusted in the Popes hands, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
all other differences composed, and
that things were in the same State wherein
they were in the times of the 4. General
Councils; in which case, it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
how far it might be convenient to
give way to such an Authority so apt to grow
extravagant, and which hath been stretched
so very far beyond what the Canons allowed,
that it hath challenged Infallibility to it self;
but the thing at present under debate, is,
whether the disallowing the <hi>Papal Hierarchy</hi>
doth overthrow all Authority in the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal;
which is in effect to ask, whether
there be any other power besides the Popes in
the Church? for if there be any other, the
denying the Popes Authority over us cannot
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50175:184"/>
in the least diminish the just Authority of
Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The only considerable Question in this
case, is, whether the rejecting that</hi> Hierarchy
<hi>which was in being at the the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
doth not make way for the peoples
rejecting the Authority of our Bishops, and
consequently no Authority in the Church can
be maintained, unless we again yield to the</hi>
Papal <hi>Authority. This I suppose to be</hi> N. O.
<hi>meaning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Praeface to Principles considered.</note> 
               <hi>when he tells us</hi> by Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>he means</hi> that Superior and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
Body of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy;
which in any dissent and division of the Clergy,
according to the Church Canons ought to be
obeyed. And any particular Church divided
from this more universal cannot with the
least pretence of reason challenge submission
from her subjects, since she her self (and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Church of <hi>England)</hi> refused the
same to all the Authority extant in the world,
when she separated her self. <hi>To this I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Reforming
her self did not oppose any just Authority
then extant in the World. It is to no purpose
to make s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch loud clamours about our
Churches refusing submission to all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
then extant in the World, unless
there be better Evidence produced for it, than
we have yet seen. For it is very well known
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50175:184"/>
that the dispute was then concerning the
Popes Supremacy over our Church, which
we have all along asserted to have been a
notorious encroachment upon the liberties of
our Church. And the Popes usurpations were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> injurious both to the Ecclesiastical and
Civil Government, that those who adhered
to the Religion of the Roman Church yet
agreed to the rejecting that Authority which
he challenged in <hi>England.</hi> Which is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
known to have been the beginning of
the Breach, between the two Churches.
Afterwards, when it was thus agreed that
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no such Authority as
he challenged, what should hinder our
Church from proceeding in the best way it
could for the Reformation of it self? For the
Popes Supremacy being cast out as an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
our Church was thereby declared to
be a <hi>Free Church,</hi> having the Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
within it self. And what method
of proceeding could be more reasonable in
this case, than by the advice of the Governours
of the Church and by the concurrence of civil
Authority to publish such Rules and Articles,
according to which Religion was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
and the worship of God setled in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
And this is that which <hi>N. O.</hi> calls <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
submission to all the Authority then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the world;</hi> was <hi>all the Authority then
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50175:185"/>
extant,</hi> shut up in the Popes Breast? was
there no due power of Governing left, because
his unjust power was cast off, and that first by
Bishops, who in other things adhered to the
Roman Church? <hi>But they proceeded farther
and altered many things in Religion against
the Consent of the more Vniversal Church.</hi>
It is plain since our Church was declared to
be <hi>Free</hi> they had a Liberty of enquiring and
determining things fittest to be believed and
practised; this then could not be her fault.
<hi>But in those things they decreed, they went
contrary to the consent of the Vniversal
Church:</hi> Here we are now come to the merits
of the cause; and we have from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Reformation defended, that we
rejected nothing but innovations, and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but Abuses. <hi>But the Church
thought otherwise of them.</hi> What Church I
pray? The Primitive and Apostolical? that
we have always appealed to and offered to be
tryed by. The truly Catholick Church of
all Ages? That we utterly deny to have
agreed in any one thing against the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> But the plain <hi>English</hi> of all is, the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was against the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and no wonder, for the Church
of <hi>England</hi> was against the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but we know of no Fault we are guilty of
therein; nor any obligation of submission to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50175:185"/>
the Commands of that Church. And <hi>N. O.</hi>
doth not say, that we opposed the whole
Church, but <hi>the more Vniversal Church, i. e.</hi>
I suppose the greater number of Persons at
that time. But doth he undertake to make
this good, that the greater number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
then in the world, did oppose the
Church of <hi>England?</hi> How doth he know that
the Eastern, Armenian, Abyssin and Greek
Churches did agree with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
against us? No: that is not his meaning; but
by <hi>the more Vniversal Church,</hi> he fairly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
no more but the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
And that we did oppose the Doctrine and
practices of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we deny not;
but we utterly deny that to be the <hi>Catholick
Church;</hi> or that we opposed any lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in denying submission to it. <hi>But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Canons of the Church we are
to obey, in any dissent or division of the Clergy,
the Superior and more comprehensive Body
of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy.</hi> What he
means by this, I do not well understand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it must be the Authority of the Pope and
Councils of the Roman Church, or a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council of all the Catholick Church.
For the first, we owe no obedience to them,
for the second, there was no such thing then
in the world, and therefore could not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
And <hi>for the Canons of the Catholick
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50175:186"/>
Councils</hi> before the breaches of Christendom,
no Church hath been more guilty of a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, than the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
since <hi>the Rules of the Fathers</hi> have been turned
into <hi>the Royalties of S.</hi> Peter. We are no
Enemies to the ancient Patriarchal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Christian Church, and are far
more for preserving the Dignity of it, than the
Roman Church can be: For we should think
it a happy State of the Christian Church,
if all the Patriarchs did enjoy their ancient
power and priviledges, and all Christendom
would consent to a truly Free and General
Council; which we look on as the best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
on earth, for composing the differences
of the Christian World, if it might be had.
But we cannot endure to be abused by meer
names of titular Patriarchs, but real Servants
and Pensionaries of the Popes, with combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of interested parties instead of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, with the pleasure of Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of ancient Canons. Let them reduce
the ancient Government of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its due bounds; let the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
content himself with the priviledges he then
en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyed; let debates be free and Bishops
assemble with an equal proportion out of all
Churches of Christendom; and if we then
oppose so gener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l a consent of the Christian
Church, let them charge us <hi>with not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50175:186"/>
to all the Authority extant of the
world.</hi> But since, the State of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath been so much divided, that a truly
General Council is next to an impossible
thing, the Church must be Reformed by its
parts, and every <hi>Free Church,</hi> enjoying the
Rights of a Patriarchal See, hath according
to the Canons of the Church a sufficient power
to Reform all abuses within it self, when a
more general consent cannot be obtained. By
this we may see how very feeble this charge
is <hi>of destroying all Church-Authority</hi> by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
submission to the Roman Hierarchy:</hi>
and how very pityful an advantage can from
hence be made by the dissenting parties among
us, who decry that Patriarchal and ancient
Government as Anti-christian which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
as Prudent and Christian. But of the
difference of these two case, I have spoken
already.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>But yet</hi> N. O. <hi>saith,</hi> my principles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no effectual way or means in this Church
of suppressing or convicting any Schism,<note place="margin">P. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my Principles are dest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ctive to all Church-Authority.
To which I answer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the design of my Principles was
to lay down the Foundations of Faith, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50175:187"/>
not <hi>the means of suppressing heresies.</hi> If I
had laid down the Foundations of Peace and
left all Persons to their own judgements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to Authority, this might have
been justly objected against me; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this way, it might have been objected
to <hi>Aristotle</hi> that he was an Enemy to civil
Government, because he doth not lay down
the Rules of it in his <hi>Logick,</hi> or that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
favoured the <hi>Chymists</hi> and <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks,</hi>
because he saith not a word of the
<hi>Colledge of Physitians.</hi> If I had said any
thing about the Authority of particular
Churches, or the ways of suppressing Sects;
then how insultingly had I been asked; What
is all this to the Foundations of Faith? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Protestant principles of Faith! They
begin now to resolve faith into the Authority
of their own Church: or else to what end is
this mentioned, where nothing is pretended
to but laying down the Foundations on which
Protestants do build their faith? But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no way of escaping imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
objections, yet it is some satisfaction
to ones self to have given no occasion for
them.</p>
            <p>2. I would know what he understands by
his <hi>effectual means of suppressing Sects or
Heresies.</hi> We are sure the meer Authority
of their Church hath been no more <hi>effectual
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50175:187"/>
means,</hi> than that of ours hath been; but
there is another means they use which is far
more <hi>effectual</hi> viz. the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> This in
truth is all the <hi>effectual means</hi> they have above
us; but God keep us from so Barbarous and
Diabolical a means of suppressing Schisms;
The <hi>Sanbenits</hi> have not more pictures of
Devils upon them, than the Inquisition it
self hath of their Spirit in it; however that
Gracious Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 4. attributed the settling
of it in Spain <hi>to the Inspiration of the Holy
Ghost;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. judic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viol. Relig. Tit. 68. n. 18.</note> not that Holy Ghost certainly, that
came down from Heaven upon the Apostles;
but that which was conveyed in a Portmantue
from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But
if this be <hi>the effectual means</hi> he understands,
I hope he doth not think it any credit to the
Authority of their Church, that all who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it must endure a most miserable life or
a most cruel death. All the other means
they have are but probable; but this, this
is the most <hi>effectual.</hi> How admirably do Fire
and Faggots end Controversies! No general
Council signifies half so much as a Court
of Inquisition; and the Pope himself is not
near so good a Judge of Controversies as the
Executioner, and <hi>Dic Ecclesiae</hi> is nothing to
<hi>take him Gaoler.</hi> These have been the kind,
the tender, the primitive, the Christian
means of suppressing Sects and Heresies in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50175:188"/>
the Roman Church! O how compassionate
a Mother is that Church, that takes her
froward Children in her hands to dash their
brains against the stones! <hi>O how pleasant a
thing it is for Brethren</hi> to be destroyed for lack
of <hi>Vnity! How beautiful upon the 7. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are the Feet of those who shed the Blood
of Hereticks!</hi> Never were there two men
had a more Catholick Spirit, than <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
and <hi>Bishop Bonner.</hi> Men may talk to
the worlds end of Councils and Fathers and
Authority of the Church and I know not
what insignificant nothings; come, come,
there is but one <hi>effectual means,</hi> which the
good <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> suggested to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
<hi>Arise Peter, kill and eat.</hi> Let the
Hereticks talk of the kind and merciful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our Saviour who rebuked his Disciples
so sharply for calling <hi>for fire from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Samaritans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 9. 55.</note> and told them <hi>they did not
know what Spirit they are of:</hi> let them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
never so much against the cruelty and
unreasonableness of such a way of confuting
them; let them muster up never so many
sayings of Fathers against it; yet when all
is done, what ever becomes of Christianity,
it was truly said of <hi>Paul 4. that the Authority
of the Roman See depends only upon the office
of the Inquisition.</hi> And that we may think,
he was in good earnest when he said it,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50175:188"/>
               <hi>Onuphrius</hi> tells us it was part of the speech
he made to the Cardinals before his death.<note place="margin">Onuphr. vit. Pauli 4.</note>
Was not this think we, a true Vicar of
Christ? a man of an Apostolical Spirit? that
knew the most <hi>effectual means</hi> of suppressing
heresies and Schisms and advancing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Roman See. And that we may
not think their opinion is altered in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
one of the late Consulters of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
hath determined that the practice of

is <hi>reasonable,</hi>

to, in the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>3. It is very well known that we do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as much as lyes in us, to reclaim all
Dissenters; but God never wrought Miracles
to cure incorrigible persons, and would not
have us to go out of the way of our duty to
suppress Sects and Heresies. The greatest
severities have not effected it, (which made

destroyed above 100000. Persons for heresie,
(as they call it) it was so far from being
suppressed or weakned that it was extremly
strengthened and increased. What wonder
is it then, if dissenters should yet continue
among us, who do not use such Barbarous
ways of stopping the mouths of Hereticks
with burning lead, or silencing them by a
rope and flames. But we recommend as much
as they can do to the people the vertues of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Obedience, due submission to their
Spiritual Pastors and Governours, and that
they ought not to usurp their office, and become
their own Guides:</hi> which <hi>N. O.</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
blames us for not doing. Yet we do not
exact of them a blind obedience, we allow
them to understand the nature and Doctrine
of Christianity, which the more they do, we
are sure they will be so much the better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and the more easily Governed. So that
we have no kind of Controversie about
Church-Authority it self but what it is, and
in what manner, and by whom to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised;
but surely <hi>N. O.</hi> had little to say,
when from laying down the Principles of
Faith, he charges me with this most absurd
consequence of destroying all Church-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>I have thus far considered the main
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50175:189"/>
Foundations upon which <hi>N. O.</hi> proceeds in
