            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sleepe is but deaths el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother, and death is
but a sleepe nicknam'd;
why should I more
feare to goe to my <hi>grave</hi>
than to my <hi>bed,</hi> since
both tend to my rest:
when I lye downe to
sleepe, I will thinke it
my last, and when I rise
againe, account my life

               <p>Too much <hi>labour</hi>

rise with an appetite, lest
if I once surfet, I ever
loath it.</p>
               <p>How hard it is for a
man to forget his sinne,
or remember his God,
not to doe that evill
which he should not, and
not to leave undone that
good which hee should
doe, every man can tell
by experience. I were
no man, if I had no sinne,
but if I am a Christian
I must not delight in sin;
if I cannot <hi>avoyd</hi> some
sinnes, yet I will <hi>stand</hi>
in none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:27778:6"/>
To doe any thing to
thinke to be talk'd of, is
the vainest thing in the
world; to give almes
and aske who sees, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the prayse and the
reward: I may be seen to
give, I will not give to be
<hi>seene,</hi> that others are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to my piety is not
my fault, nor my praise;
I will never bee so ill a
friend to my selfe to sell
heaven for vaine-glorie.</p>
               <p>The obedience of good
children proceeds not
from feare, but love; it is
a very bad nature will
doe nothing without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27778:7"/>
blowes; to turne to
our vomit as soone as
God is turn'd from his
rod, and aske who is the
Lord till a new plague,
is a state I know not
whether more to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or pittied: if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoyd correction, I
will mend with it; not
bee beaten twice for the
same fault.</p>
               <p>I know not which is
worse; the <hi>bearer</hi> of tales
or the <hi>receiver,</hi> for the
one makes the other: I
will no lesse hate to <hi>tell</hi>
then to heare slaunders:
If I cannot stop others
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27778:7"/>
mouthes, I will stop my
owne eares. The receiver
is as bad as the thiefe.</p>
               <p>With God a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
goes beyond a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie,
a sigh or a groane,
that cannot bee uttered,
beyond a long prayer
with ostentation: Care
not how long, or how
<hi>lowd</hi> thy prayer be, but
how <hi>hearty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Woman was first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to man for a helpe,
since for a remedy, what
shall we thinke of those,
that turne the remedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a disease, and hold it
in all cases for some, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27778:8"/>
in some cases for all, not
onely dangerous but
damnable to marry;
what is this but to teach
God what Hee hath to
doe? I have ever counted
it safe and wise to leave
that indifferent which
God hath left so.</p>
               <p>GOD cannot endure
a Pharisee that saies and
doth not: with His disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
saying and doing
must not bee two mens
offices; if thou canst doe
but little, promise the
lesse; so though thou
maist bee thought nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly,
because thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27778:8"/>
so little, yet thou
shalt be knowne just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou promised'st no
more.</p>
               <p>A good man would
so be <hi>honourable,</hi> as hee
may still bee <hi>honest,</hi> not
broker for preferment;
if not worthy, let him
want it, but if deserving,
why should he buy his
due? I will neither grow
<hi>great</hi> by buying honour,
nor <hi>rich</hi> by selling it.</p>
               <p>In injuries it is better
to take many, than give
one, in benefits the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
I will requite the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27778:9"/>
first with bearing them,
the second with <hi>requiting</hi>
them.</p>
               <p>Evill communication
corrupts good manners.
<hi>Peter</hi> denied his master
among the Iewes, whom
he confessed among the
Apostles: I may have a
bad man of my familie,
I will never have a bad
familiar; or if at any
time of my <hi>court,</hi> never of
my <hi>counsell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So live with men as
considering alwaies that
God sees thee, so pray
to God, as if every man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27778:9"/>
heard thee; doe nothing
which thou wouldest not
have God see done; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing which may
either wrong thy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>aske,</hi> or Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to <hi>graunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every night is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of death, in this,
that in both we rest from
our labours: I will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to long for my rest
in heaven, and I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be loth to goe to bed
to the earth, who would
not desire to dye that he
might be with Christ?</p>
               <p>It is good in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27778:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make roome for
adversity, that however
it come <hi>unsent</hi> for, it
may not come <hi>unlook'd</hi>
for; if it doe not come,
wee are never the worse,
if it doe come we are the
better provided; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
if it doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
crosses, yet it lessens
them.</p>
               <p>Earthly things are like
dreames, awake to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
like shadowes set
with the sun, wealth and
honour will either leave
us, or we them. I will
labour onely for those
pleasures which never
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27778:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall have an end, and be
more delighted that I
shall be happy, than that
I <hi>am</hi> so.</p>
               <p>'Tis a good Signe,
when GOD chides us,
that He loves us, nothing
more <hi>proves</hi> us His than
blowes, nothing sooner
<hi>makes</hi> us His: God can
love His children well,
and not make wantons
of them; if I suffer, it is
that I may raigne. How
profitable is that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that carries me to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
               <p>Suffering is the way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27778:11"/>
to glory, sometime in
this World: <hi>Ioseph</hi> had
never beene a Courtier,
had hee not first beene a
prisoner.</p>
               <p>Gods children are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better for being
miserable, and end in
that; It is good for mee,
that I have been afflicted;
let God use me how Hee
will on <hi>earth,</hi> so I may
have what Hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to those that love

Gods Church must
be a lillie among thorns,
and while I am a member
of the Church, I must
not looke to fare better
than the whole Body, if
they have call'd the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the house Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,
well may it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
to those of the
household; my comfort
is if I am reviled for His
sake, I shall be blessed.</p>
               <p>Prosperity is like <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
merum,</hi> all wine; it
makes drunke the soule,
and therefore God min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27778:12"/>
it, that He may keep
us sober; feeds His chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with a bit and a
knocke, ever dishes His
sweete meate with sowre
sause: if wee <hi>did alwaies
abound</hi> wee would grow
proud, and forget our
selves; and if not <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi>
wee would despaire
and forget our God: I
will pray with <hi>Salomon,</hi>
give me neither wealth
nor poverty, but a meane;
or if wealth, grace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it, if poverty, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to endure it.</p>
               <p>Afflictions are the
medicines of the minde,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:27778:12"/>
if they are not tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
let it suffice, they
are wholesome; 'tis not
required in Physicke
that it should please, but
heale, unlesse we esteeme
our pleasure above our
health: let me suffer, so I
may reigne, be beaten, so
I may be a son. Nothing
can be ever too much to
endure for those pleasures
which endure for ever.</p>
               <p>There was never good
but was hard to get: the
prison and the hatchet,
sores and crums leade to
<hi>Abraham's</hi> bosome, and
the way thither is by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27778:13"/>
weeping-crosse: if many
tribulations will carry
me to heaven, on Gods
name let me have them;
welcome the poverty,
which makes me heire
to those riches that never
shall have an end.</p>
               <p>I will deale for my
soule, as for my body,
never refuse health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Phisicke that
should procure it, is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
let it distast me, so it
heale me.</p>
               <p>There are in the
world that thinke it too
great sawcinesse to be our
owne spokes-men to God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:27778:13"/>
and therefore goe to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
Some-body to preferre
their petitions for them:
I shall ever hold it good
manners to goe of my
owne errants to God, He
that bids me Come, will
bid me welcome; God
hath said, Come unto me
&amp;c. It is no unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
to come when I
am call'd.</p>
               <p>All <hi>consciences</hi> like
all <hi>stomacks</hi> are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
how many doe we
see digest those sinnes
with ease, which others
cannot get downe with
struggling, one straines
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:27778:14"/>
at a gnat, when another
swallowes a camell: hee
that will keepe cleere of
great sinnes, must make
conscience of all. I will
thinke no sinne little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the least endangers
my soule, and it is all one
whether I sell my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVR
for thirty pence,
with <hi>Iudas,</hi> or for halfe
I am worth, with <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi>
whether I goe to hell
for one sin, or for many.</p>
               <p>This life is but a journey
unto death, and every day
we are some spannes nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the grave; how is it
that wee which are so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27778:14"/>
neere our death, are so
farre from thinking of it?
Security is a great enemy
to prevention, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
that wee shall
not dye <hi>yet,</hi> makes men
that they doe not prepare
to dye <hi>at all:</hi> it is good
taking time while time
is; if it come suddenly
and find thee unprepared,
miserable man that thou
art, who shall deliver
thee from the body, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Therefore hath Nature
given us two eares and
but one mouth, that we
should heare twice as
much as wee should
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27778:15"/>
speake: with all thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
trust neither thy
<hi>wife</hi> nor thy <hi>friend,</hi> hee
that is thriftie of his owne
tongue shall lesse feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers.</p>
               <p>There are that affect
not so much to have true
friends as to have <hi>many,</hi>
and whisper to that
friend what they heare
from this, and againe,
to this, what from that:
and glory to have it
knowne, how much
they are trusted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they were therefore
trusted that it might not
be knowne: I have ever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27778:15"/>
thought it a maxime in
friendship, that he which
will bee intimate with
<hi>many,</hi> is entirely <hi>nones;</hi>
let me love and be lov'd
of all, I will bee inward
onely with a few: I had
rather have one meane
friend that I may call my
<hi>owne,</hi> than the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
where I must share
with <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that provides not
for his owne is worse
than an infidell; 'tis not
the blame of charity that
it begins at <hi>home,</hi> it is
that it ends not <hi>abroad:</hi>
I am not borne all to my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27778:16"/>
selfe, somewhat to my
friend, to my neighbour.
I will so care for my
<hi>owne,</hi> as I may relieve
<hi>others,</hi> and so doe for <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
as I wrong not my
<hi>owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much <hi>knowledge</hi> not
much <hi>speech,</hi> Emblem's
a wise man. I shall ever
hold it neither safe nor
wise, alwaies to speake
what I <hi>know</hi> of my
owne affaires, nor what
I <hi>thinke</hi> of others; a man
may speake too much
truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:27778:16"/>
Pleasures like the Rose
are sweet but prickly,
the hony doth not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile
the sting, all this
worlds delights are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and end in vexation;
like <hi>Iudas</hi> while they
kisse, they betray. I
would neither be a <hi>Stoick</hi>
nor an Epicure, allow
of no pleasure, nor give
way to all: they are
good sause, but naught
to make a meale of, and
were given not to fill
the belly, but to relish
the meate: I may use
them sometimes for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
never for food.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:27778:17"/>
In crosses these two
things must be thought
on; first <hi>whence</hi> they
come, from God, Hee
strikes thee that made
thee, next <hi>wherefore</hi> they
come, for thy good
either to try thee or to
mend thee, if they bee
harsh, yet they be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
I shall ever count it a
good change, to have
the <hi>fire</hi> of persecution
for the <hi>fire</hi> of hell, who
would not rather smart
for a while then for ever:
let me rather have that
<hi>fire</hi> which is rewarded
with heaven, than these
<hi>pleasures</hi> which shall be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27778:17"/>
rewarded with <hi>fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi>'s, Rejoyce oh
young man in the dayes
of thy youth, were the
finest thing in the world
if it were not for that
which follows, for all
this thou shall come to
judgement; to goe well,
lye soft, sleepe hard, if
there were noe after-reckoning;
who would
not say out of delight
what the Apostles did
out of amazement, It is
<hi>good for us to be here;</hi>
but when I have a
stewardship to account
for, and God knowes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27778:18"/>
how soone, my master
returning and my talent
to seek; the Bridegroome
entering and my oyle to
buy, I have more reason
to care how to <hi>redeeme</hi>
my time past, than to
<hi>spend</hi> the present.</p>
               <p>To grow heavy or
lumpish with crosses, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
not so much want of
courage, as grace: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more soyles the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a Christian,
than to have his minde
droope with his Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
what if health,
friends, meanes, have all
forsooke thee, wilt thou
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27778:18"/>
lose thy wittes together
with thy goods? all the
afflictions in this world,
cannot answer the joyes
of that other. I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
care whose these plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<hi>I see</hi> be, while those
<hi>I doe not see</hi> are mine, and
the fountaine of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
whom I shall one
day <hi>see,</hi> as I am <hi>seene,</hi> shall
be mine.</p>
               <p>Let another praise
thee and not thine owne
mouth; either we are far
from neighbours or ill
beloved among them,
when wee are faine to be
our owne trumpet, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27778:19"/>
blaze our selves: the <hi>Iews,</hi>
not the <hi>Centurion,</hi> say, He
loved our Nation and
hath, &amp;c. It is both hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and humble to heare
of our praises, and tell of
our unworthinesse.</p>
               <p>Many a little make a
mickle, every day a mite
will encrease our store; I
wil be ever adding to my
heape of knowledge, of
faith, &amp;c. That when the
Master returnes I may be
able to say, behold <hi>Lord,</hi>
thy two Talents have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
other two.</p>
               <p>The building of the
soule, like that of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27778:19"/>
world, is not done in a
day; grace like <hi>Ezekiel's</hi>
waters, is first to the
ancles, then to the knees,
&amp;c. In vaine doth any
thinke to bee perfect at
once, in an instant; well
is it for us, if after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lessons learn'd, and
heard in CHRIST'S
Schoole, wee get past
the spoone, and with
some yeares of teares and
prayers come to a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a growth; and with
clambering and paines,
like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> get to see
<hi>Christ</hi> time was when it
was said to the Apostles,
<hi>Oh yee of little faith;</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27778:20"/>
hee was once afraid to
confesse CHRIST, that
was not afterward afraid
to die for him: like Bees,
while we are here, we are
ever gathering, in His
good time wee shall bee
perfect, in the meane time
LORD suffer us not to
bee tempted above that
we are able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is that to the soule
which the Sunne is to the
world, <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> and
with them comforts and
stores it: he that hath <hi>God</hi>
hath every thing; <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is a world of friends
against millions of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27778:20"/>
then will I thinke
my selfe poore, misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
distressed, <hi>left,</hi> when
He <hi>leaves</hi> me.</p>
               <p>Every thing almost we
see, borrowes its nature
from its soile; thus the
body and temper of men
differ with the aire; and
the soule like the body,
commonly savours some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the company it
keepes, and we grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with their sinnes,
together with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
at first winke at
them, then imitate them,
then defend them. I will
not bee more scrupulous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27778:21"/>
in the choyce of any
thing than of this: hee
can hardly have a <hi>good</hi>
soule, that hath a <hi>bad</hi>
companion.</p>
               <p>Sinne at first is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and goes disguised
with <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Endor,</hi> that
after a while growes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
and dares looke
bare-fac'd on the world;
first perswades to civill
recreations, thence bids
to unlawfull delights.
Hee that will prevent
the <hi>growth</hi> of sinne, must
resist the <hi>beginning;</hi> the
remedy is thought of too
late, where the disease is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27778:21"/>
past cure; 'tis easier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
a sicknesse, than
recovering it.</p>
               <p>Custome as it lessens
favours, so it lessens sins;
else the same sinne would
still be monstrous, which
in time is not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of.</p>
               <p>Goodnesse is not the
gift of all but some, but
perseverance onely of a
few; how many like <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi>
sun have gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and forsaken their
first love? How many
have we seene, that with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27778:22"/>
                  <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> would have rent
their cloaths at the name
of blasphemie, have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sworne by the life
of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> what we <hi>are,</hi> is
no argument for what we
<hi>will be;</hi> every man knows
his beginning, not his end;
what hee is, not what he
shall be; let him that thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
he stands, take heed
lest he fall.</p>
               <p>When I take a serious
view of my selfe, and see
(besides inward discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents)
so many outward
enemies of quietnesse
every where, every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute;
want, sicknesse, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27778:22"/>
losse of friends, of
health, of life, threatning
if not pursuing me: and
to these my spirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
so strong, my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
so many, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
so continuall,
and my selfe so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched
with all these:
with <hi>Peter</hi> I beginne to
sinke, and I could wish I
had not beene, since I
must be miserable, but
when I looke up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and those joyes I am
going to, I would not be
lesse miserable to be so
happie. GOD is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Angels are my
fellowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heaven is my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27778:23"/>
Inheritance; now if my
inheritance be in heaven,
why is not my desire
there? Where our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is, there will our
heart be also, where our
treasure and our heart is,
there shall we be one day:
who would exchange his
future happinesse for a
present?</p>
               <p>Contentation is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
not wealth; true ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
consist not so in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
much, as in not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
more: why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then
doe wee so labour to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi>
and not rather to
be <hi>content?</hi> If I have but a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27778:23"/>
little, my account is the
lesse; if I have much, and
doe not more good, I
shall adde to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
together with
my store: I will ever
studie rather to use my
little well, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it.</p>
               <p>I will not care to bee
rich, but to be good; this
onely is that treasure,
that never shall have an
end: let mee be rich in
goodnesse, and I cannot

To speake little, is a
note of a wise man, to
speake well of a good
man: goodnesse is not
seene in the length or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of our speech, but in
the matter, the streames
of the tongue runs from
the current of the heart,
and are like the fountaine;
it is a signe we have <hi>little
goodnesse in</hi> us, when there
comes <hi>little out</hi> of us: if
GOD were more in our
hearts, He would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our mouthes, and
with more reverence.
Though I will never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to <hi>speake</hi> of my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:27778:24"/>
yet I will shew it in
my <hi>speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that will be a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
of others actions,
had need look well to his
owne: 'tis a foule shame
to have that found in our
selves, which we would
take upon us to mend in
others: in this I will ever
follow my <hi>Saviours</hi> rule,
first get out mine owne
beame, and I shall see bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to helpe my brother
out with his more.</p>
               <p>Injuries, if they dye
not, they kill: Here one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a CHRISTIAN
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27778:25"/>
must learne to forget: for
if wee forgive not men
their trespasses, neither
will our Father, &amp;c. In
this case my care shall be
onely how to put them
up, and leave vengeance
to whom it belongs, <hi>God</hi>
is ever his Iudge, that is
not his owne.</p>
               <p>The malicious man is
so much no mans foe as
his owne; for while he is
out of charitie with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
GOD is so with
him; if he lov'd himselfe,
hee would not hate his
brother. I will love all
men for His sake that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27778:25"/>
made them: but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
because he is GODS
sonne, I will love doubly,
for his owne sake, for his
Fathers sake.</p>
               <p>GOD lookes not at
what we have beene, but
what we are: it is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to have beene
an Israelite. That we once
did well, addes to our
condemnation together
with our sinne; and if the
righteous man forsake
his righteousnesse, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is lost: our former
goodnesse will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our present evill,
the end crownes us:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27778:26"/>
what ever my beginning
hath beene, I shall ever
pray and endevour that I
may dye the death of the
righteous; and my latter
end may be like unto his,
for as the tree <hi>falls,</hi> so it
<hi>lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man till hee sinned
was naked and was not
ashamed, clothes are not
more our <hi>covering</hi> than
our <hi>shame,</hi> and wee may
justly blush every time
wee looke on them, not
bragge; the best orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body, is the
minde, and the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of the minde, is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27778:26"/>
honesty: that best <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,</hi>
which best <hi>beseems,</hi>
not that which is most
us'd, But most decent.
I will neither looke
what others doe, nor
what I may doe, but
what I ought to doe,
many things are lawfull
which are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>To doe well and say
nothing is Christianly,
to say well and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is Pharisaicall; if
the hands bee not <hi>Iacobs</hi>
as well as the voice, wee
are but impostors, cheats:
If we are good trees, by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27778:27"/>
our fruit they shall know
us. I will not lesse hate
not <hi>to doe</hi> good, than <hi>to
tell</hi> of it: my faith is dead
if it beare not.</p>
               <p>Eating was the first
sinne in the world, and it
is now the sinne almost
of all the world; and as
before the building of
<hi>Babel</hi> so still in this, all
the Earth is of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
what shall we eat,
or what shall we drinke,
and wherewith, &amp;c. Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Drinking have
taken away our stomacks
to spirituall things: I will
never be so greedie as to

eat my selfe out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
He loves his belly

               </p>
               <p>Great mens Words
are like dead mens shoos,

or what hee meanes
not: is for the first a <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and for the last an
<hi>Hypocrite;</hi> by such an one,
I will bee deceived but
once.</p>
               <p>Dissimulation is state-policie,
and wise men set
out themselves as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
did his bookes, not
to bee understood at first
sight. He that alwayes
speakes what hee <hi>knowes,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:27778:28"/>
is not wise, but hee that
doth not alwayes speake
what hee <hi>meanes,</hi> is not
honest. As I will not have
my heart at my tongues
end, yet I will have my
tongue speake from my
heart, it is not necessary
I must be <hi>dishonest,</hi> or a
<hi>foole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commonly your
open eares are open
mouth'd, and they that
are craving to heare, are
apt to tell: I will neither
desire to <hi>know</hi> much of
another mans estate, nor
<hi>impart</hi> much of my own;
never any man repented
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27778:29"/>
him of saying nothing.</p>
               <p>A Parasite of all Trades
is the basest, and in two
things like an Eccho; first,
that he speakes only what
he heares others; and that
he is nothing but voice,
words: next to an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull</hi>
man, I would
not be a <hi>flatterer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinnes grow like
Grapes close, but in clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
Wee usually say,
He that will sweare, will
lye; and he that will lye,
will steale; and hee that
will doe all these, will
doe any thing. Satan
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27778:29"/>
is a Serpent, if the head
bee once in, his whole
bodie will not bee long
behinde.</p>
               <p>It is better to goe into
the House of mourning,
than into the House of
laughter, &amp;c. Hee is
worse than madde, that
with <hi>Herod</hi> will part with
a kingdome for a dance.
Hee takes little thought
for his sinnes, that thinkes
to put them out of his
head, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>
did with Musicke: Hee
that truly considers those
joyes which never shall
have an end, cannot
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:27778:30"/>
but desire to have an end
of these: Where the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is, there will the
heart be also.</p>
               <p>Gods promises doe
not binde Him to keep us
in our wickednesse, our
sinnes quit Him of His
<hi>promise,</hi> and us of His
<hi>protection,</hi> when wee
leave to be of His <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
wee are none of His
<hi>Charge,</hi> His Friendship
keepes pace with ours.
If thou doest well, shalt
thou not bee accepted?
(sayes Hee to <hi>Cain</hi>) doe
well, and have well, such
as wee behave our selves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27778:30"/>
towards God, such shall
wee finde God towards
us; now if we doe smart,
thanke our selves.</p>
               <p>Wee have too many
that have a double heart
in one body, but very
few that have but one
heart to two bodies, yet
so is it with friends, the
one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not laugh when the
other weepes; one friend
is the looking glasse of
the other, where face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
face, when the one
smiles the other smiles,
when the one is sad the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is trobled, there is no
Amity where there is no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27778:31"/>
Sympathy; If I doe not
suffer in my SAVIOVR,
I doe not love Him. Can
the Head be ficke and the
Body not feele it.</p>
               <p>There is a time to
laugh as well as a time to
mourne, we are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
the use of mirth, but
the excesse, it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Fruit. Hee who
gave Oyle to cheere the
Countenance, gave Wine
also to glad the heart:
And I will not say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Salomons</hi> draught be
not sometimes in season;
Drinke, that thou maiest
forget thy poverty; yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27778:31"/>
so as thou remember thy
God. God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
religion should make
men Stoicks, as if to mew
up our selves from the
World, were to single
out our selves to God:
And because He hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the abuse of things,
not to use them; thus
we should abstaine from
drink, because some men
have beene drunke: If
that which is one mans
meate proove another
mans poyson, the fault
is not in the meate, but in
the stomake. If they be
so easily abus'd, the more
our thankes, our praise,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27778:32"/>
if we doe not abuse them
wee shall be commended
for our temperance: we
cannot for our want of
them; GOD makes us
but to use them as wee
should, and wee cannot
have too much of them.</p>
               <p>Where should Ioy be
but in the Fountaine of
Ioy, or how doe wee
partake of that Fountaine
and rejoice not; that Ioy
must beginne to fill here
that will be full here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Hee shall never
sing <hi>Halelujah's,</hi> that
doth not first sing <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's:</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:27778:32"/>
Hee is no sound
Christian that is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the glory hee
shall have, and rejoyce
in this, that his name is
written in the Booke of
Life.</p>
               <p>God ever helpes at a
pinch, when all helpes
fail then is He seen, when
<hi>Iacob</hi> wants at home then
<hi>Ioseph</hi> is heard of abroad,
and when the prodigall
wants abroad then God
makes him thinke of
home. What if he will
not deliver <hi>Ionah</hi> from
the Tempest, yet Hee
will from the Whale:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27778:33"/>
If the danger bee great,
His Glory shall bee the
more; never despaire
then thou drooping soule,
why art thou cast down,
why art thou so disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp;c? The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of thy God endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
yet daily.</p>
               <p>The Contention of
<hi>Christs</hi> time is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of all the world,
who shall be the greatest,
and most men envy to be
out-gone in any thing,
even by those they love
best: If <hi>Ioseph</hi> be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Brethrens eye-sore: and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27778:33"/>
I doubt me whether <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
brothers were more
glad that <hi>Goliath</hi> was
slaine, or angry that by
their brother: bad na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whom they cannot
reach by imitation, they
will by detraction: He
casteth out Devills
through Beelzebub, was
the Pharisees of Christ:
it argues very little
goodnesse in us when we
malice it in others, none
but a <hi>Cain</hi> (that ever I read
of) will envy, because
his workes are evill, and
his brothers good; they
are desperately wicked
that love not the lookes
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27778:34"/>
of godlinesse.</p>
               <p>It is an hard matter
for a man to know much
or have much and know
himselfe, and whence hee
hath it, if we would think
worse of our selves, we
should be better thought
of, but now our selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitednesse
breaks our
necke.</p>
               <p>Most men are Pharisies
in this, that they love the
upermost seats, all would
be sonnes of <hi>Anak:</hi> if their

He hath beene happie too

               <p>My Friends faults as

I will remedie: I may

them to others, never to

kill him with kindnesse,
and lest I should lose a

guilty of the losse of that

not.</p>
               <p>Some Friends there
are, such as <hi>Ionadab</hi> to
<hi>Ammon,</hi> Pandors to their
wickednesse: Brethren
they are but in iniquitie;
He shall be no friend to
me that is a friend to my
faults: and I am no friend
to my selfe, if I think him
my enemy that tells me
of them, one day, if not

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:27778:35"/>

               <p>There is a friend to

his charitie beginnes at

there is a friend for gain,

some love CHRIST,
because they feare Him,
He can destroy both soule

because they neede him,
but if we be true friends,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:27778:36"/>
though there were none
of these wee would love
Him.</p>
               <p>Friend of all compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

               <p>Therfore did not God

Death was given for
punishment of sinne, but
is the end of it; when we
lost <hi>Paradise,</hi> we met with
this, and againe when we
part with this wee meet
our <hi>Paradise:</hi> they that

themselves gone, and say

another sense, <hi>Arise, let us
goe hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Through how many
dyings doe wee come to
our Death? And how
many deaths may wee
come to? Infinite are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27778:45"/>
our waies out of this life,
that have but one way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: Our life is compos'd
of nothing but deaths:
for that wee may live, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures die; again,
our child-hood dyes and
is forgotten when we are
growne up: Our youth
dyes when wee are men:
Our man-hood dies when
we are aged; at last Our
age dyes and all dyes, and
wee dye with it: every
day dyes at night; now
if my life consist of <hi>dayes,</hi>
what doe I else but dye
<hi>daily?</hi>
               </p>

Favour is a thing to
esteeme, but not to build
on; hee that stands upon
others leggs knowes not
how soone they may
faile him: Greatnesse is
not eternall. I will never
leane so hard upon any
man, that if he breake he
shall give me a fall.</p>
               <p>The things of this

but apparitions, not so
indeed: all our Pompe
is but like the strowing
of Boughes before our

is like that of the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:27778:46"/>
apt to moulder, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to the theefe, and the

and stole, wee have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but like those of
<hi>Marah,</hi> bitter; we have
riches, but we have cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
sweete meate but
sowre sauce: they make a
fair shew but they last not;
I may say of them, what
my <hi>Saviour</hi> did of <hi>Israel,
their goodnesse is but as a
cloude, &amp;c.</hi> I will use
this <hi>world,</hi> but I will bee
in love with that better

This world is a region
of <hi>Ghosts,</hi> or of dying
men, if not dead; our life
is but one continued sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and we are ever in a
comsumption, wasting:
wee now accompany
those to the grave, whom
shortly wee must keepe
company with in the
Grave: Every man must
have his turne, and GOD
knowes whose turne is
next; it may bee <hi>thine,</hi>
it may bee <hi>mine,</hi> and
<hi>mine</hi> before <hi>thine,</hi> GOD
knowes; thou hast more
<hi>yeares,</hi> (it may be) and
therefore as thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27778:47"/>
some strides before;
I am no lesse subject to
<hi>diseases,</hi> and therefore no

no lesse to mee, than
age doth to others: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ache, every stitch <hi>tolles</hi>
the <hi>bell</hi> in mine eares, for
some have dyed of these;
but every strong sicknesse
<hi>digs</hi> the <hi>grave,</hi> and sayes
service over mee, and
cries, <hi>Dust to dust,</hi> &amp;c.
Since there is a time to
dye, and I know not the
time, I will provide for
it at all times: <hi>Blessed is
that servant whom when
the Master comes he shall
finde watching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:27778:48"/>
No man thinkes hee
shall live <hi>ever,</hi> yet most
men thinke they shall not
dye <hi>yet;</hi> otherwise, they
would dye <hi>better,</hi> and
more care for the heaven
they shall have, than the
earth they must part with;
this world will not last
alwaies.</p>
               <p>Our life is but a day, it
is now noone: who
knowes how soone it shal
be night? I have a great
way to goe, and but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to spend (a little time
I meane) my care shall
be to make it hold out.</p>
               <p>As we doe not gather,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27778:48"/>
so wee doe not looke for
grapes on thornes, or
figgs on thistles: such as
the seed is, such will the
fruit bee, and such as the
fruite is, so will the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
be, and one day (if
not now) God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his workes, and
ill shall be ill requited.</p>
               <p>Sinne and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are like the <hi>shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
and the <hi>body,</hi> never
apart, like <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi>
they follow one at the
heeles of another. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sinne went unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;
the end of all sinne
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27778:49"/>
if it be not repentance, is
hell: if I cannot have the
first, to be innocent, I wil
labour for the second, to
repent; next to the not
<hi>committing</hi> of a fault, is
the <hi>being sorry</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>That which we usually
say of men, is sometimes
true of <hi>Christians,</hi> foule in
the cradle, and faire in the
saddle; an unhappie boy
may make a good man;
he that should have seene
<hi>Saul killing,</hi> would little
have thought ever to
have heard him preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
we may not judge of
the future by the present.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:27778:49"/>
He runs farre that never
turnes. 'Tis not with <hi>God,</hi>
as with men, to say I will
<hi>forgive</hi> it, but I will ne're
<hi>forget</hi> it; with Him sins
<hi>repented of</hi> are as not
done, as a broken bone
well set is the faster ever
after. <hi>God</hi> lookes not at
what we have beene, but
what we are. Repentance
makes us frends with <hi>God,</hi>
re-intailes us in the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and by I know

Our life is but a walke,

               <p>When our <hi>Saviour</hi>
would put to silence the
<hi>distrusters</hi> of his time, He
points them to the Lilies
and the Crowes: the
Lilies of the field, not of
the garden, which are
digg'd and dung'd; but
of the field which have
no gardiner, but the Sun,
no watering pots but the
clouds, and <hi>your heavenly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27778:59"/>
Father</hi> (sayes He) <hi>clothes
these:</hi> Doth my Father
provide for others, and
will he see me goe naked?
What will He thinke too
much for His sonnes, that
is so bountifull to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
How will Hee
cloath them, that so
cloathes the grasse? If
<hi>Salomon</hi> in all his royalty
was not arrayed like one
of these, the Sunne in all
his height, shall not shine
like one of us; when He
shall have chang'd our
vile bodies, that they may
be like unto His glorious
body.</p>

Distrust is a sinne
which custome hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
made commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Every man layes
up Manna for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
forgetting that if
that be not wormes, they
themselves may be so. As
if there were no <hi>heaven,</hi>
but pleasure and <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:</hi>
no other <hi>hell</hi> but
<hi>affliction</hi> and want; if
their purse grow light,
their heart grows heavy,
their mirth ends with
their store, and they think
no man can say to his
soule, <hi>take thy ease,</hi> that
hath not wealth layd up
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27778:60"/>
for many yeares: but we
are not yet what wee
<hi>should bee,</hi> if wee cannot
be content to be what we
<hi>are,</hi> what ever it be. Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
must not be chusers;
'Tis not for us to teach
God which way He shall
bring us unto heaven, let
us thanke Him that we
come thither any way,
and if He will have us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
before we shall raigne,
downe on our knees, kisse
the rod, and not a word,
not a sob.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:27778:61"/>
Whereever God is,
there are these two, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and multiply; Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Lot</hi> cannot
dwell together while
they dwell with him,
and I see <hi>Israel</hi> once to
bigge for <hi>Goshen,</hi> that is
now too little for <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>
give a man God
and throw him into the
Sea, with <hi>Israel, Ionah,</hi>
and he sinkes not; needs
must he swim that is held
up by the chin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:27778:61"/>
In apparell we are not
to respect meerly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
but decency. God
never meant religion
should make men slovens
or <hi>Stoicks,</hi> as if a man
could not weare good
cloathes and goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or a Christian were
ever bound in conscience
to be out of fashion: We
are not tyed to wander,
or to weare sheep-skins
and goat-skinns, because
the <hi>Apostle</hi> tels us some
did, <hi>some of whom the
world was not worthy,</hi> God
meant that those holy
men should bee patternes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27778:62"/>
of <hi>piety,</hi> not of <hi>fashions.</hi>
I will never be niggardly
of another mans purse,
deny my selfe that which
God hath not.</p>
               <p>There may be pride
in the meanest things in
the world; no lesse the
<hi>Cynick</hi> of his <hi>tub,</hi> than
<hi>Alexander</hi> of all the <hi>world</hi>
besides: <hi>Sackcloth</hi> and
Ashes in the same bill
with <hi>purple</hi> and fine
linnen, both condemn'd
of pride; to fast and to
fare deliciously is strange
but true; and so much
worse is that pride than
this, by how much it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27778:62"/>
hath a better face; <hi>small
drinke</hi> and Camels haire
goes away Sainted,
though but counterfeited
when <hi>open pride</hi> is cryed
downe of all hands: and
of the two the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
is the more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
I am sure the
more incurable. A
knowne disease is every
mans cure, which when it
lyes hid is never medled
with: There is lesse hope
of an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> than an
<hi>Atheist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afflictions are Gods
mould in which He casts
His Children, <hi>spare the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27778:63"/>
rod, and spill the child</hi> is as
true in grace as nature.
God receiveth no sonne
whom He chastiseth not,
but tis with a gentle hand,
He leaves no markes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
and He hath soone
throwne away His rod, if
with unfained resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you will doe so no
more. God though He
beate many of His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

never beates any for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There is a double life
in man, and must bee a
double nourishment, men
live as if there were no
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27778:63"/>
more to bee done, but
<hi>feede</hi> and be <hi>warme,</hi> food
and rayment are the
maine businesses of the
World: 'Tis true, wealth
and friends and health are
things to thanke God for,
but better desires better
becomes Christians; the
Christian man <hi>lives not by
bread onely, &amp;c.</hi> Meate

God hath given us
this aire to breathe in,
it doth not <hi>give</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>
life, 'tis the <hi>meanes</hi>
of living not the <hi>Author</hi>

many make this world
their God, and serve it:
and God (as it were) but
their World to make use

               </p>
               <p>God though He be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the same in Himselfe,
He is not alwaies so in us,
though Hee love those
whom He doth love unto
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27778:64"/>
the end, yet not without
Intermission. Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
never know the
benefit of a thing but by
the absence of it; wee
could not so well esteeme
of <hi>health,</hi> if it pleased not
God we were sometime
<hi>sicke:</hi> the long absence of
a desired friend makes
him more welcome at
his returne; thus <hi>Christ</hi> is
pleas'd sometime to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
His presence, that
with more earnestnesse
we might be drawne to
seeke Him: <hi>Tell mee Oh

               <p>

As when many eyes
are <hi>fixed</hi> upon one pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctture,
every one thinkes
the eyes of the picture to
be <hi>fixed</hi> on him; so with
our soules, all looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at God, but every
one must appropriate
Him to himselfe. To
know that God is the
God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
God of <hi>Isaack,</hi> and the
God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> is but a
weake assurance that He
will provide for me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
also He be my God;
our faith as our charity,
must begin at home, and
say, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi>

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:27778:65"/>
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth not
say, doe unto others as
others doe unto you, but,
as you would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe unto you. If

doe so to him though he

               <p>As he cannot <hi>rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine</hi>
the resurrection of

It is necessary that hee
which will bee borne

that will once rise the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

<hi>dye twice.</hi> That I may

               <p>That two contraries

as it is <hi>Philosophy;</hi>
Good and evill are like
Fire and Water, ever
contending till the one

               </p>
               <p>It is the fault of a great
many, if God <hi>beare</hi> with
them in their sinnes, they
thinke hee <hi>countenances</hi>
them: if they be not
presently striken dead
with <hi>Vzzah,</hi> they goe on;
when they smart not,
they beleeve not, and he
is not fear'd till felt. Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

forgetting that the long

lead them to repentance,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:27778:67"/>
he forbeares us that hee

               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> as He is infinite in

and as His mercy extends
to thousands in them that
love him, so do His judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them that hate
Him. That He is long in
<hi>comming</hi> is no argument
that Hee will <hi>not come,</hi>
forbearance is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance:
the longer

               <p>The relation betweene
sinning and falling is so
neere, that they are us'd
promiscuously the one
for the other. Now it is
a hard matter to fall

matter to rise without

hard to rise; if we love

               <p>Most men feare to

where the adversary is

               </p>
               <p>Charity so forgives of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
that it is ready not

and thinkes it selfe not

injuries if wee doe
onely not revenge them,
if wrongs tye our hands
from doing good where

prove <hi>sinnes</hi> to us, that
were but crosses; and we
wrong our selves more
by not <hi>doing</hi> than by

               <p>It cost <hi>God</hi> more to

<hi>gives</hi> life; wee are in

the Vine, whence we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
life. Let our care
be to offer up our selves
living sacrifices to him,
of whom wee live and
moove: 'Tis all hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
an egge of his

of that time which hee
hath given us. What can

turne requires another,
if I love not those that

of Infidells.</p>
               <p>Selfe-conceitednesse is
the sinne in fashion, 'Tis
a hard matter not to
thinke well of our selves;
I am not behinde the least

than he was before in his

from what he

ashamed of what hee is
and fall yet lower: <hi>Oh
Lord, I am lesse than the
least of thy mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Malice never wants a
marke. He who hath
<hi>nothing,</hi> hath <hi>something</hi> to
bee envied for, and if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, he is envied
for this, that he is content
with his <hi>nothing.</hi> It is
hard to bee prosperous,
and bee loved at once:
Those that will be great,
shall be envied; it is hard
but safe, to be contented
with a little: but if I
cannot avoyd ill tongues,
my care shall be no to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27778:73"/>
deserve them; and then,
let <hi>Shimei</hi> curse.</p>
               <p>I seldome see sinne but
in a religious tire: Nay
<hi>but I reserv'd them for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
was <hi>Sauls</hi> to <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi>
for sacrifice not for

best disguise of evill, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>seeme</hi> what thou art,
or be what thou <hi>seemest:
God</hi> is not mocked.</p>
               <p>Their sinne is more
unpardonable that sinne
of purpose: malice leaves
the owner as without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
so without hope:
Sinnes of ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27778:74"/>
a <hi>tanto,</hi> save some

               <p>What more glorious
Master than <hi>God?</hi> What
better Mother than the
Church? How glorious
is that calling that at once
serves such a Master, and
such a Mother? As it is
our glory to <hi>serve</hi> them,
so it must be our glory to
doe them good <hi>service.</hi>
God in us sets the world
copies of piety, and wee
must live to others no
lesse than preach: As we

are more <hi>eye,</hi> so we are

the <hi>person,</hi> that are scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
meerely for the

in us a reproach: seeing

               <p>Promotions are neither

He that hath them and

with a vengeance who
would not rather wish to

               <p>There was never any

every man is borne a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
onely some more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative

of all men I most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at those that are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
onely to be talk'd

not, onely this I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27778:75"/>
will care for, that God
may not say to me in the

               <p>Pride is good to none,
worst to it selfe: when
<hi>Adam</hi> would better his
<hi>knowledge,</hi> hee lost his
<hi>dwelling</hi> in Paradise; and
when those builders of

<hi>dwelling,</hi> they lost their
<hi>knowledg.</hi> The itch of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great, potent, or poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at, how many hath
it undone? I will never
care to be or to know,
that which I know shall
repent me: what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
is it to have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27778:76"/>
beene some-body?</p>
               <p>The tongue is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betrayer of the minde:
The foole while he is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
is not discovered. I
will not be more thriftie
of any thing, than of my
speech; I had rather be
<hi>thought</hi> to know a little,
than be <hi>knowne</hi> to know
nothing.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing
a Christian need desire of
God, that's a cleane heart:
<hi>Create a new heart, &amp;c.</hi>
there is but this one thing
that God desires of a
<hi>Christian,</hi> his heart: <hi>My
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27778:76"/>
sonne, give me thy heart;</hi>
and this I will onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to <hi>have,</hi> that I may
<hi>give. A broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
heart, Oh God, thou
wilt not despise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings daughter</hi> is
all glorious within, but
yet her rayment too is of
wrought gold; our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
our life must tell the
world what we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
If our lives doe not
answere our profession,
we are Pharisees, we say
and doe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:27778:77"/>
It is a common fault
to forget what we have
beene, when wee are
changed for the better:
how many have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
for heaven in their
sicknesse, that in their
whole skinne have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
it, and requited
the recovery of the body
with a relapse of the soule
To receive good at the
hands of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not
evill, is unreasonable to
expect: but to receive
good at the hands of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> and returne evill, is
wicked and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.
I will never pray
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27778:77"/>
more hartily to <hi>God</hi> for
a blessing than for grace
to manage it; Wherefore
should I be blessed to my
cost?</p>
               <p>With God all things
are not onely alike possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but easie, and he can
as well of <hi>stones</hi> make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
children as of Iews.</hi>
I will never despaire of
him that can do al things,
I cannot be so infinitely
sinful as God is merciful.
<hi>Oh God, if thou wilt, when
thou wilt thou canst make
me whole;</hi> why should I
give my selfe over, where
my <hi>Physician</hi> doth not?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:27778:78"/>
Workes without faith
are like a suite of <hi>clothes</hi>
without a body, emptie:
Faith without workes is
like a body without
<hi>cloathes,</hi> no warmth,
want hear; Workes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith are not good
workes, &amp; faith without
good workes is as good
as no faith, but a dead
Faith. Then onely are
they themselves, when
they are together, what
God hath joyned let no
man put asunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:27778:78"/>
Our actions are never
pleasing to God, when
our light doth not shine
before men; let your
light so shine before men
that they may see your
good workes, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your Father which is
in heaven; that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in heaven
may one day glorifie
you.</p>
               <p>With men, confesse
and suffer is good justice,
but with God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to confesse our sins
is the next way to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
them; that soule is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27778:79"/>
past hope that lyes

pray; <hi>Oh Lord, open thou
my lips, and my mouth shall
shew forth thy praise, and
my owne sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray for them that curse
you, doe good to them
that, &amp;c. Is <hi>durus sermo,</hi> a
hard saying, and against
the haire; 'tis not so easie
a matter to <hi>forget</hi> an ill

this must be if we will be
<hi>Christians:</hi> hee that will
not be in charity shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

should I doe my selfe a

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27778:79"/>
would?</p>
               <p>It was the divell that
first made us enemies to
<hi>God,</hi> and it is still he that
makes us enemies to one
another; it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(I have thought) that
he is painted with a clove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
foote, hee loves <hi>divisions</hi>
so well, and there is no
greater argument of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
incarnate than a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious

beleeve thee against
scripture, that thou lovest
God whom thou hast
not seene, that lovest not
thy brother whom thou
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27778:80"/>

               <p>If we will be <hi>Christs</hi>
Disciples we must leave
all, but its not all, wee
must take up our crosse

up, not of our selves, but
if it be layd upon us, we

our selves into the fire.
He that bids us <hi>suffer,</hi> bids

It is our commendation

the Faggot, it is not to

runnes without discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
warrant, it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes more haste, than
good speed; CHRIST
would have us innocent,
but wise too, Serpents as

our lives for His sake, but
not <hi>fling</hi> them downe;
we must neither goe like

               <p>That which I heare
from <hi>David,</hi> I would
heare from every good
man, Thy word is a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne</hi>
to my feete, &amp;c. To

alone; if we use the Word
of <hi>God</hi> onely to gaze on,
and see fine stories, to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
by, not <hi>live</hi> by it;
wants his use, and wee
want our goodnesse, and
shall want our glory:
knowledge without pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
adds to our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27778:81"/>
together with our

               <p>Workes of piety must
never goe without humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
he that prayes and
is not humbled, like the
<hi>Pharisie</hi> in the parable,
goes away worse than
hee came. When thou
prayest, thou askest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and doe it on thy
knees, if to your earthly
father, how much more
to your heavenly: Men
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:27778:82"/>
have inverted the course
now, they <hi>drinke</hi> their
health upon their knees,
and <hi>pray</hi> for their health
upon their <hi>tailes,</hi> God
shall answere such men
according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
proudly. Why
should GOD stoope to
their wants, that stoope
not to their owne? we
cannot bee too humble
when we are to speake to
that Majestie, whom we
cannot see and live, and
whom wee shall one day
see and live to our cost,
if we be not humbled;
thanke God thou hast
knees to howe, how ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27778:82"/>
would that have not;
why shouldest thou bend
and cringe and bow, to
thy father or thy friend,
or thy betters, and not to
thy God.</p>
               <p>Prayer is the <hi>Iacobs</hi>
ladder of the soule wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it goes up and downe
to God, and conferres
with Him; in our praiers
wee <hi>blesse</hi> Him, and by
our prayers wee <hi>blesse</hi>
our selves: there is no
part of Gods worship
more acceptable or more
profitable than this of
prayer, and none more
slighted, men come to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:27778:83"/>
prayer as to a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
wilfull negligence
in leaving it undone, and
coldnesse in doing of it,
are the sinne almost of

doe thou be mercifull to the

               </p>
               <p>There are many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and many Masters,
and yet no man can serve
two masters, that is, two
of a contrary disposition;
for there is the world,
the flesh, and the divell,
and ye may serve all these

serve one and not all, the

&amp; with <hi>Esau</hi> sells his
birthright his blessing for
pottage: the drunkard
he serves I know not
well what, whether the
drinke, or the company,
or his appetite, or all, but
instead of quenching his
thirst, drownes his soule:
the envious man, and the

the envious man <hi>with

braines others so long till

himselfe: the usurer he

serves his gold; the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
he serves his lust, but
all serve one chiefe Lord,
one Master, the Divell,
and shall all receive the

Why should God pay

that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane kine

The <hi>Arke</hi> &amp; <hi>Dagon</hi> were

But dyed indeed:</hi> we doe

that He may leave us <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:27778:106"/>
wash His hands

do well: and yet it is not
<hi>wishing,</hi> but <hi>doing</hi> well
that doth the deed. I will
do what I can, and I will
desire to do what I should
and cannot. God accepts
a <hi>willing</hi> mind, and if I am
willing beyond my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
He will either make

O God,</hi> thou that workest

that I may not onely will

               <p>God doth not looke
for every <hi>thing</hi> from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>one:</hi> for ten talents
where He left but <hi>two:</hi>
onely Hee there exacts
much, where He hath <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
much: if the seed of

bring forth <hi>no</hi> fruit, or
<hi>withered,</hi> it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell;
but where He hath
<hi>dung'd</hi> and <hi>gooded,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a crop is but <hi>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
The more I have, the

               <p>All lands do not yeeld

as He doth to these, to
some strength of <hi>body,</hi> to
another strength of <hi>wit,</hi>

could the <hi>best</hi> of

hard and rare to see that
in others, which we want
our selves, and would
have, and be still. Whil'st
I am in this world, I shall

and if I cannot make a

I will with my <hi>heart:</hi>
Since I cannot but see it,
I will learn not to repine

               <p>Earth is but our rode

he is his owne tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

which yet is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27778:110"/>
so he robs himselfe, both
of the pleasure of <hi>this</hi> life,

               <p>Our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation

the hypocrit, like a glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme,
shines but burnes
not; others, like hell fire,
burne but shine not: and
must looke to have their
portion in the fire, they
resemble. We are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
if we doe onely
shine and not burne, or
burne and not shine; the

the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> because
they wanted heate; the

               <p>Rest is the <hi>whetstone</hi> of

breake: wherefore <hi>God</hi>
hath given for every <hi>day</hi>
a <hi>night</hi> to rest in, and for

<hi>night.</hi> We could not live

First, with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
we must be <hi>borne</hi> againe,
and then we must dwell

from strength to

from reading the

of knowers <hi>doers</hi> of

to perfection, or
rather from imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to perfection, from
persecuting the Church,
with <hi>Paul</hi> to preaching
to it: till we come from
<hi>Dives</hi> doore to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
bosome, from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking, from
marrying and giving in

               <p>Many live as if they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27778:117"/>
came but into this world,
to make merry and away,
and after some yeares of
quaffing with <hi>Nabal,</hi> die
of a drunken fit: it were

have liv'd like <hi>beasts,</hi> if
they could die like them
too, never to <hi>live</hi> againe:
but <hi>alas</hi> they cannot, her's
their miserie; that they
only leave their pleasures

<hi>speake</hi> to us; without these
we could not speake, not

in a word, by these (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

we are; but some ther are
that <hi>cannot</hi> heare, others
that <hi>will not</hi> heare. It is a

The Sun is plac'd in

               <p>Men usually measure

               <p>Olde men are twice

The end of all our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVRS
miracles, for

not to be seene, but not

Gods service requires
<hi>reverence,</hi> as well as <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
Many go to <hi>God</hi> as

which they

that it sees nothing but

that it sees none, or takes

when <hi>one</hi> cheek is struck,

when it can turne no

wrong, doth but pluck
more fistes about his

him too: who, if hee
would but be quiet, wold
revenge it to his hands;
unlesse we doubt of His
<hi>power,</hi> wee will trust <hi>God</hi>
with our wrongs; and
stay His leasure, that is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27778:134"/>
the fittest time for our

open to GOD, veil'd to

in some cases He loves
our talent in a <hi>napkin,</hi> lapt

Hee <hi>knowes</hi> thee, that will
<hi>reward</hi> thee: others, if
they commend thee not,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27778:134"/>
it is because they know
thee not; or if they doe
commend thee, there's
all, and it may bee to

thou lose Heaven for

               <p>It is the <hi>fault</hi> of the

will serve his turne: and
thinke one <hi>sigh</hi> at their

about thorowly to make

the best have their

hath <hi>least</hi> and <hi>fewest.</hi> I
can never be so holy as

               <p>Youth, and holinesse,
doe not meet often, to
see a young man dead to
sin and ready for death,
is <hi>admirable,</hi> but <hi>rare;</hi> it is
a good thing to be good
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:27778:138"/>
betimes, sinnes as they
growe old they growe
lusty, and if they once
get head, they know no
master, it is a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>restore</hi> to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
than to <hi>make</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for there must be a
<hi>dedocebo te, &amp;c.</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaching
of that evill,
which they before lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
before there can be
an insertion of that good
which they must after
practise. Custome will
alter <hi>nature,</hi> and an use of
sinning make them in
love with sinne; it is
rarely seene that a young
<hi>divell</hi> proves an old <hi>Saint.</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:27778:138"/>
I will so begin, as I would
hold out, with GOD;
otherwise, it is ill that I
have begun, but worse
that I hold not out.</p>
               <p>GOD <hi>desires</hi> not the
death of a sinner, but that
is not all, He doth not
onely not <hi>delight</hi> in our
ruine, but He desires our
<hi>recoverie.</hi> If we <hi>repent,</hi>
He <hi>spares</hi> us, if we returne
Hee receives us: for the
first, mercy to forgive;
for the <hi>second,</hi> an <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
bosome to receive;
if we wander, He recalls
us, if we be obstinate, he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:27778:139"/>
intreats us: if we come
but slowly, He will stay
for us: in <hi>all</hi> His workes
He is wonderfull; but in
His workes of <hi>mercy,</hi> He
exceeds. I will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
of that goodnesse
that hath no bounds; my
sinnes are infinite, but not
<hi>unpardonable.</hi> Hee was
once a <hi>persecutor,</hi> who
was after an <hi>Apostle:</hi> and
not behind the best of the
Apostles, that was once
before the worst of the
<hi>Iewes</hi> for cruelty: <hi>God</hi> is
able to make of a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,
a <hi>convert;</hi> of a
theefe, a <hi>disciple:</hi> of <hi>stones,</hi>
children: of dead men,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27778:139"/>
living Saints, if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
be desperate, the cure
is the glorie of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;
the recoverie is
more remarkeable of a
<hi>dead</hi> man to life, than of
a <hi>sicke</hi> man: if the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were not great, there
were lesse praise of our
redemption: but when
our sinnes are gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our heads; when the
beame of the timber, and
the stone in the wall crie
us guiltie; when thou art
possest, and not as <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> with a <hi>few</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
but with <hi>Legions:</hi>
not one sinne, or small
sinnes, or a few sinnes,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27778:140"/>
seven divels, as it is said
of her, but past number;
like the starres or the
sands; and of the worst
sort of divells too, that
cannot easily be cast out,
but with <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and hast not onely
<hi>committed</hi> them, but <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
in them, and art now
<hi>dead</hi> in them: when we
have thus lost our selves,
and <hi>Him,</hi> to bee found
of <hi>Him</hi> and brought to
our <hi>selves, pusles</hi> us for
thankes: His <hi>armes</hi> are
ever open, onely our
<hi>hearts</hi> are shut: wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not, because wee
<hi>aske</hi> not, wee are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27778:140"/>
because wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
not, or returne to
our vomit; It is but just,
when wee turne to our
sinnes, that GOD turne
to His judgements: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee must bee cut
off <hi>in</hi> our sinnes, or <hi>from</hi>
them.</p>
               <p>Salvation is the <hi>gift</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> it is <hi>given,</hi> and
yet it is <hi>got</hi> with a great
deale of struggling; thou
must <hi>fast,</hi> and <hi>watch,</hi>
and <hi>fight</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saies) and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
did too, not onely with
<hi>beasts,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:27778:141"/>
of men (though wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men are beasts in a
manner) but with <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,</hi>
and <hi>powers,</hi> not
the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakims,</hi>
Gyant sinnes,
growne temptations. My
glory shall be not to have
no sinnes, but to have the
<hi>mastery;</hi> not that I am not
set upon, but not <hi>beaten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we shall all dye,
we all know; <hi>when</hi> wee
shall dye, <hi>God</hi> knowes;
but how any man should
be <hi>dead</hi> while he is <hi>alive,</hi>
is strange wil some think,
and would bee glad to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27778:141"/>
know; yet so it is, sin is
a <hi>death,</hi> and every obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sinner is dead for the
time. Some with <hi>Iairus</hi>
daughter are not dead
but sleepe; others with
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> are not onely
<hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>stinke;</hi> and it is
with sinne as with sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it weakens by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
first it distempers
the palate of the soule,
or spoiles the stomake,
so that either it refuseth
meat, or distastes it, or
puts it up againe; and
next it takes away the
sense that they feele not
their sinnes, and then are
remedilesse; and as our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27778:142"/>
Saviour told the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
they wil dye in their sins;
and this is a death men
care not to be acquainted
with til they be past <hi>cure:</hi>
and then onely thinke of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> when they are
going to <hi>hell,</hi> and after
forty or fifty yeares li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
know not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to dying, more
than, with <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> to
turne their face to the
wall, and weepe when it
comes: The way to dye
willingly is to <hi>conne</hi> death
before hand; he that hath
spent his life in providing
for his death, is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at his <hi>death</hi> how to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27778:142"/>
be provided of a better
<hi>life.</hi> My care shall be not
how I may not dye, but
how I may live ever.</p>
               <p>Prosperitie is a great
enemy to goodnesse, how
hardly doe those which
have <hi>riches</hi> enter into the
Kingdome of Heaven?
I heare <hi>Israel</hi> praying in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> quarreling in the
<hi>wildernesse?</hi> When they
were at their bricke-kills,
they would be at their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi>
and no sooner are
they at <hi>ease,</hi> but they are
wrangling for their <hi>flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots;</hi>
I think many a man
had not been so bad, if he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27778:143"/>
had but been <hi>poore.</hi> It is
the saying of a wise Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>Salomons wealth</hi>
did him more hurt, than
his <hi>wisdom</hi> did him good.
<hi>Trouble,</hi> and <hi>want</hi> do that
many times, which faire
meanes cannot; <hi>wealth,</hi>
like knowledge puffes up,
when <hi>poverty</hi> (as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
did many in the
Gospell) make men flock
to CHRIST. I will
never pray more heartily
to <hi>God</hi> for His <hi>blessings,</hi>
than for grace to <hi>use</hi>
them, nor to lessen my
<hi>miseries,</hi> but to add to my
<hi>strength.</hi> Though my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
be <hi>many</hi> or <hi>often,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:27778:143"/>
so my strength be equall,
I shall get by them; the
stronger my <hi>tryall,</hi> the
greater will be both my
<hi>victorie</hi> and my <hi>reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way to live <hi>ever,</hi>
is to live <hi>well,</hi> there is no
way to <hi>everlasting life,</hi>
but a <hi>good</hi> life; it is not
living at <hi>ease,</hi> or at <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
or at <hi>rack</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
in <hi>pompe</hi> and <hi>plentie,
mirth</hi> and <hi>jollity,</hi> and with
<hi>Saul</hi> think to drive away
the divell with <hi>musike.
God</hi> cares not how <hi>rich,</hi>
or how <hi>powerful</hi> thou art,
but how <hi>good.</hi> We should
so live as wee may have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27778:144"/>
joy of our life, and bee
made partaker of those
joyes, and that life which
are for ever.</p>
               <p>There are many dead
men and manie deaths;
there is a death <hi>in</hi> sinne,
and a death <hi>for</hi> sinne, and
a death <hi>to</hi> sinne; the two
first we may thanke our
selves for, if wee had not
knowne sinne, we had not
known death, but the last
we must thanke <hi>God</hi> for,
it is from Him that wee
dye <hi>to</hi> sinne, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to dye <hi>for</hi> it, who
Himselfe dyed for us, and
hath taken our sins upon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:27778:144"/>
Him, and at once delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us from the sting of
death, and the strength of
sinne. And <hi>thankes be to
God who hath given us this
victorie, through our Lord
IESVS CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are in this world,
as <hi>Israel</hi> in the wildernes:
and <hi>Christ</hi> is to us as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was to them; if He
leave us, wee know not
which way to turne us;
<hi>nature</hi> cannot carrie us to
<hi>God.</hi> Here all our suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
is from Him, and
we say well in our praier,
<hi>for thine is the power and
the glorie;</hi> and it is by that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27778:145"/>
                  <hi>power,</hi> that wee come to
that <hi>glorie,</hi> our strength
is but <hi>borrowed;</hi> our stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
but leaning upon His
arme; our going, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in His hand. It is
with us as it was with S.
<hi>Paul</hi> upon the way, wee
must be led, we must be
carried to <hi>God;</hi> we must
pray, <hi>turne us, O Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee and wee shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
Of our selves wee
are unable to goe, yet
drawe us, and wee shall
runne after thee; so shall
wee come <hi>to</hi> thee, <hi>with</hi>
thee, that are rather <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
that have <hi>feete,</hi> and
<hi>walke</hi> not, <hi>without</hi> thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:27778:145"/>
It is betweene some
<hi>sinners</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
some men &amp; their
<hi>creditors;</hi> all their care is
how to be trusted, not
how to pay. My <hi>first</hi>
care shall be as little as I
can to come in <hi>Gods</hi> debt,
and my next care how to
come out of it.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>goodnesse</hi> must be
that part of the <hi>wallet</hi> that
hangs <hi>behinde</hi> us, seene of
<hi>others,</hi> not of our selves:
our <hi>sinnes</hi> must bee that
part that hangs <hi>before</hi> us,
seene both of others, and
our selves. To <hi>conceale</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:27778:146"/>
sinne, was never the way
to be <hi>forgiven</hi> it; or what
art thou the safer, that
thou canst <hi>conceale</hi> it from
<hi>men,</hi> and not from <hi>God?</hi>
I had rather be <hi>censur'd</hi>
for my sin, than be <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
for it.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Moralitie</hi> so in
<hi>Divinitie,</hi> not to goe <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
is to goe <hi>backwards;</hi>
and not to <hi>thrive</hi> in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is not to be good.
When I compare what I
<hi>am,</hi> with what I <hi>have</hi>
beene, I am not a little
proud; but when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
what I <hi>should</hi> bee,
with what I <hi>am,</hi> with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:27778:146"/>
I begin to <hi>sinke;</hi> only
here's my comfort, I
shall be receiv'd, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               </p>
               <p>Every good heart is
accuser, judge, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
of its ownfaults:
Why should I be afraid
of standing at the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
of my owne <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and not of <hi>God?</hi> at
one I must; and if I judge
my selfe, I shall not bee
judged: I will prevent
<hi>Gods</hi> judgements with my
owne, and the feare of
what I should suffer, with
the <hi>sorrow</hi> for what I have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:27778:147"/>
done; to him only is the
<hi>last</hi> judgement terrible,
that shunnes the <hi>first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wicked men as they
make most <hi>shew</hi> of mirth,
so they have <hi>least;</hi> their
<hi>heart</hi> and their <hi>face</hi> do not
agree; they carrie that in
their owne bosome, that
spoiles their <hi>laughing:</hi>
they are alwaies pursued
by themselves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with their own
thoughts. Their sleepe
is <hi>dreaming,</hi> and they
<hi>dreame</hi> of those judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in their sleepe,
which they have <hi>deserv'd</hi>
waking: every noyse is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27778:147"/>
of <hi>thunder,</hi> and everie
thunder of the <hi>last</hi> day;
every shadow is a spirit,
and their sinnes are so
many divels about them;
they have a double hell,
they dy a thousand deaths
here, and hereafter dye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.
There is no joy
like the joy in the <hi>Holy
Ghost:</hi> Nay, there is no
joy but <hi>that,</hi> and that is
as farre above all <hi>earthly</hi>
joy, as our <hi>heavenly</hi> joy
shall be above this. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah</hi>
above <hi>Hosanna.</hi>
Let mee but have this
<hi>within,</hi> and I care not how
the square goe <hi>without?</hi>

Death to the <hi>wicked</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

they see it in its
<hi>worst</hi> shape, <hi>ghastly.</hi> Faine
they would not goe, and
goe they must, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should <hi>live</hi>
still, but it is <hi>intolerable</hi>
to be still dying, which
is the life they are to live,
a <hi>living death.</hi> I will pray
<hi>God</hi> to season this life to
me, as I may not bee in

me of my <hi>death,</hi>
as I may not be <hi>afraid</hi> of
it; and in my life so to

that at my death I may

               <p>When I remember the

and some it may
be not throughly <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

some it may be not taken
<hi>notice</hi> of: so many of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie</hi>
stealing upon me,
and other <hi>stronger</hi> sinnes
breaking in upon me: I
doe not <hi>will</hi> that good
which I should, or want
<hi>power</hi> to that will, or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi>
to that power:
I am at a stand with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:27778:149"/>
                  <hi>Apostle,</hi> and thinke, <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man that I am, who
shall deliver me from this
body of death?</hi> Even He
that delivered His <hi>body</hi> to
<hi>death</hi> for me: Oh <hi>God,</hi>
thou that workest in me,
both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>doe,</hi>
worke <hi>my</hi> will to <hi>thine;

Give but power to <hi>obey,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Death is as hatefull to
man, as old <hi>age</hi> to <hi>beautie;</hi>
and we are ever complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the shortnesse of

which yet if they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

they wished for,
<hi>death:</hi> as I will not be in
love with <hi>tribulations,</hi> so
I will not love my life the
worse for them, nor the

if <hi>prosperity</hi> make me fond
of <hi>living,</hi> or afraid of <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
it had been better for

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is better to go into the

nay, the way to the house
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27778:150"/>
of <hi>laughter,</hi> is through
the house of <hi>mourning;</hi> so
our <hi>Saviour, Blessed are

like <hi>Salomons</hi> strumpets,
leads to the chambers of

World, as hee came <hi>into</hi>
it, <hi>crying;</hi> and into <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

is nothing but <hi>weeping.</hi> It
is a great weaknesse to

There were no such
<hi>tyrant</hi> upon earth, as the
<hi>envious</hi> man, if he had but
his <hi>will,</hi> no man should
live a quiet life, or dye a
naturall death, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
hee sees his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
house burning, and
<hi>warmes</hi> him by the fire,
and is refreshed: there is
no <hi>estate</hi> that he hath not
a quarrell to, no <hi>person;</hi>
his <hi>equals</hi> hee hates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are his equals;
his <hi>inferiors,</hi> because they
are not his equals; and
his <hi>superiors,</hi> because he is

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27778:151"/>
but most of all to his <hi>own,</hi>
and I think if he were put
to it, himselfe knowes
not what hee would be,
or have others be. It is
the greatest vanity in the
world, to runne mad for
others pleasures: what if
I have not the same <hi>thing,</hi>
or in the same <hi>measure?</hi>
I have enough to serve
my turne, if they have
<hi>more,</hi> yet they must <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
for it, and I will
never envy any man, that
he hath more to answere

I shall not account for

               <p>

                  <hi>Gods blessings,</hi> and our
<hi>thankes</hi> must ever goe
hand in hand, one good
turne requires another.
Wee must not thinke to
serve our selves of <hi>God,</hi>
and not serve Him; His
blessings are not only <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi>
or <hi>rewards,</hi>
but <hi>bonds.</hi> Of these, the

we <hi>owe,</hi> and our care must
be, not onely to <hi>receive,</hi>
but to repaie. Why
should we strive to come
out of every mans debt,
but GODS.</p>
               <p>The charity of <hi>forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:27778:152"/>
is more difficult

more worth, by how
much our <hi>selves</hi> are more
deare to us than our

<hi>doers,</hi> but in the other
<hi>sufferers,</hi> and many a man
would <hi>doe</hi> for another,
that would not <hi>suffer</hi> for
him: I am but halfe a
Christian if I have only
learn'd to <hi>pitie,</hi> and not
to <hi>forgive:</hi> we cannot at

and our wrongs,
if they bee <hi>small,</hi> the
matter is the lesse; if they
be <hi>great,</hi> our glorie is the

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:27778:152"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gluttony</hi> is not onely a

onely to be <hi>forbidden,</hi> but
to bee <hi>afraid</hi> of; other
<hi>sinnes</hi> hurt in <hi>future,</hi> this
in <hi>present,</hi> and robbes not
only of <hi>eternall</hi> life, but of
<hi>this,</hi> and destroies the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
together with the <hi>soule.</hi>
Our bodies were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for <hi>cellarage,</hi> to lay

               <p>I have seldome known

desire no other Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,
but GOD and the
<hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the accusation
of the <hi>old</hi> world, that <hi>they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27778:153"/>
were eating and drinking,
till they entred, &amp;c.</hi> and is
still of <hi>this,</hi> and will be
so to the end, though this
were not the end of our

of it: I will use
my <hi>meat,</hi> as others doe
their <hi>Physicke,</hi> onely for

               </p>
               <p>We see men set not
their best wares upon the
<hi>stalls,</hi> but <hi>within, lapp'd</hi> up;
it is neither <hi>commendable,</hi>
nor <hi>wise</hi> to shew our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:27778:154"/>
(as <hi>Musicians do</hi>)
in all companies; what
are we the better, that we
thinke well of our selves
while others thinke not
so? Or what are we then
worse, that others thinke
meanly of us, while we
think so too? Since those
art never the better for
thy <hi>selfe-conceitednes,</hi> nor
the worse for thy <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi>
why shouldst thou
make thy selfe envied for
those graces which thou
hast, by <hi>shewing them,</hi> and
derided for making shew
of those thou hast not,
and would'st seeme to
have? and art at once
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27778:154"/>
noted of men for a <hi>boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and of <hi>God</hi> for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler?
I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

that I may bee high in

               </p>
               <p>A handsome garment
is no argument of a strait

the <hi>best</hi> men that
make the most <hi>shew</hi> of
holinesse. <hi>Demurenesse</hi>
may stand with falshood:
<hi>Pretences</hi> are evermore

ever <hi>perfum'd,</hi> 'tis to be
thought have naturally
ill breaths, we must not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27778:155"/>
ever beleeve our senses:
goodnesse is plaine, and
would be knowne by her
<hi>workes,</hi> but not tell of
them, whilest <hi>hypocrisie</hi>
is painted to hide 'its

taken for better than it is,
and with the <hi>figge-tree,</hi> it
shall be curst for flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing;
if wee are true

               <p>Goodnesse doth not

you shall have that from

forty yeeres old; and yet
it is not <hi>forwardness</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

Some men, like

in the <hi>blossome,</hi> but wither
ere they be <hi>pluck'd;</hi> others
like some <hi>graine,</hi> lye long

to <hi>deferre long,</hi> but
it is worse not to <hi>hold
out.</hi> I will love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
<hi>early</hi> holinesse; yet
it is better to <hi>begin late,</hi>
than to have <hi>done betimes,</hi>
there is a penny for him
that comes at the <hi>eleventh</hi>
houre: If thy <hi>youth</hi> have
been <hi>faulty,</hi> it is comfort
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27778:156"/>
that thy <hi>age</hi> is <hi>otherwise.</hi>
It is no disparagement to
<hi>have beene</hi> wicked, but to
<hi>continue</hi> so; who hath not
bin overseen sometime?
<hi>Hee</hi> was once a <hi>Persecutor</hi>
that was after an <hi>Apostle.</hi>
I will glorie, not that

               <p>As <hi>promotion,</hi> so <hi>pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
is neither from the

but from <hi>God. Hee</hi> hath

Why doe men <hi>grudge</hi> at

their wants, when it is
not <hi>chance</hi> but <hi>provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce?</hi>
It is lesse praise to be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
than to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not to bee so: our

The lesse I <hi>have,</hi> the more

how are we bound to thy

               <p>GOD, saies the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
hath <hi>woollen</hi> feet, but

Where Hee will judge,

<hi>softly,</hi> but strikes <hi>home,</hi>
and is upon them ere

love in His corrections,

               </p>
               <p>There is no living

               <p>Holinesse is not <hi>borne</hi>
with us, nor doth <hi>growe</hi>
up with us: sometime,
you shall see the <hi>hoare-head,</hi>
come short almost
of the <hi>long coates.</hi> I will
never regard how <hi>long</hi> I

Some men drawe <hi>nigh</hi>
unto <hi>God,</hi> but with their
<hi>lips,</hi> as <hi>Iudas</hi> did; others
drawe nigh unto Him
with their whole <hi>bodie,</hi>
and will for outward
complement come short
of none: into their <hi>sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath</hi>
with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and
downe upon their knees
with face with <hi>Saul;</hi> they
will dye the death of the
<hi>Righteous</hi> as well as any,
if <hi>wishes</hi> will doe it; but
their <hi>heart</hi> is not sound.
Not to drawe nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
GOD at all, is open
<hi>rebellion;</hi> to drawe nigh
unto GOD, and not all,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27778:161"/>
by <hi>halves</hi> is secret <hi>dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi>
then only doe wee
come as we should, when
wee come (like S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Sacrifice,) <hi>our selves, our
soules and our bodies:</hi> and
thus if I draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>God,</hi> He will draw nigh
unto me.</p>
               <p>If <hi>God</hi> only saw as we,
there were no difference
between holinesse in <hi>jest,</hi>
and in good <hi>earnest. Ahab</hi>
is in ashes as well as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivie;</hi>
nay, what doth
<hi>Ninivie</hi> more than <hi>Ahab,</hi>
to the eye? What doe

the <hi>Pharisies,</hi> or <hi>Iohns</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27778:161"/>
than theirs? they
fast, pray, give: by the
<hi>out-side</hi> wee cannot tell
who serves <hi>God</hi> with his
<hi>bodie,</hi> or with his <hi>heart;</hi>
wee see they are <hi>painted,
God</hi> onely sees they are
<hi>sepulchers;</hi> wee see their
<hi>fairenesse,</hi> but not their
<hi>rottennesse;</hi> onely GOD
which sees their heart,
shall one day <hi>unmaske</hi> it,
and as they have before
been applauded for what
they <hi>seemed,</hi> so they shall
then be punish'd for what
they <hi>are.</hi> If I have only
the <hi>rin'd,</hi> the <hi>out-side</hi> of
Christianity, and not the
<hi>bulke,</hi> I am sure to be cast
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:27778:162"/>
out: what I can, I will so
carry my selfe, as I may
neither bee condemn'd
for beeing worse than I

               <p>There is no musike

of <hi>Christs</hi> time:
men have eares to heare,
but not that; any musike
but that of the <hi>Cymbals;</hi>
any Harpe but <hi>Davids;</hi>
any Bells but those of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron:</hi>
they can heare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
revil'd, or <hi>God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan'd,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27778:162"/>
or themselves
sooth'd; they have eares
to their commendations,
but not to their faults: the
sluggard hath his eares in
his pocket; the drunkard
hath his eares in his pot;
the proud man hath no
eares, but to his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
the covetous man
hath no eares but to his
profit; the luxurious man
hath no eares but to his
pleasure; there is no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike
but in trumpets, nor
in them but at banquets.
But he that will not heare
now, shall one day crie

doome, <hi>Depart from me,
ye workers of iniquitie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that lake, where there is
nothing but crying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is strange, no men
would be sicke, and yet
some men will not bee
well; for they take cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to overthrow their
health; as if <hi>God</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe but to waite
on them: they are never
well when they are <hi>well,</hi>
but when they are doing
of <hi>ill;</hi> where the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is <hi>Gods,</hi> wee may
challenge Him of helpe;
where the disease is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchnes,
He may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27778:163"/>
us of sinne: when
our sicknesse is His cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
it is comfortable,
but when we need to bee
corrected for our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it is fearefull: what
<hi>God</hi> laies upon us is to be
boarne; what men bring
upon themselves, is not
to be answered; and if in
mercy thou art delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Go and sinne no more,
lest a worse thing come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ill weeds grow apace;
wicked men like <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

when the good, like <hi>Noah</hi>
in his Arke, are two or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27778:164"/>
three in a corner: our
blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> (as Hee
could never say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
said true, The way
had neede be wide that
leadeth to destruction,
for many there bee that

               <p>They must looke to
<hi>suffer,</hi> that look to <hi>reigne;</hi>
this world is <hi>Gods</hi> house
of correction for His
<hi>Children:</hi> wee must not
think not to have crosses,
wee must studie to make
the best of them. I will
thinke of afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come, that
when they come, I may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27778:164"/>
bid them welcom; while
they tarrie, I will make
use of them, and when
they go, I will take leave
of them, onely as of an
<hi>Ague,</hi> for a well day or
two, but to come againe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Heaven</hi> all vessells
shall be <hi>full,</hi> but none shall
<hi>runne over;</hi> here on <hi>earth</hi>
I see some runne over,
and yet complain of <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse;</hi>
they have not <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough,</hi>
if they have not
all: Thus I have seene
some beasts, not knowing
when they were well,
burst with feeding: they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:27778:165"/>
had more than enough, if
they could be content a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
should have more
than they; if they could
but be lesse envious, they
would be lesse covetous:
all Vessels beare not the
same sailes, those do but
speed a <hi>tall</hi> Ship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a Bark is overborn:
wee know not our owne
strength, submitte our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Him that doth:
Hee that gives us all wee
have, knowes we have all
we should have, and that
if wee had more, wee
would sinke: that man
that thinkes hee is never
full, is never <hi>thankfull.</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:27778:165"/>
Whether I <hi>abound,</hi> or am
<hi>poore,</hi> I will endevour but
these two, to be <hi>thankfull,</hi>
and to be <hi>content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Crosses are <hi>harsh,</hi> but
they are the best <hi>Physike;</hi>
I know not whether <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity</hi>
have lost, or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
recover'd more; none
praies so heartily for His
<hi>daily bread,</hi> as Hee that
wants it: miserie like <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's</hi>
fish sends them to
their prayers that never
thought of GOD under
their <hi>goard;</hi> it is pitty faire
weather should doe any
harm; yet it is often seen,
we even adore those <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:27778:166"/>
in our sicknesse
which being recovered,
wee onely salute with a
complement; abundance
makes many forget those
friends, which want wold
make crouch to; how
welcom should that state
be which makes us fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with <hi>God?</hi> I will not,
I may not wish for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
nor meet them.
I am good Christian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough,
if I can be content
to be poore, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous.
Our practice must
be not to make much of
crosses, but to make <hi>use</hi>
of them; yet I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endure a world of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27778:166"/>
crosses to come to <hi>God,</hi>
than to be crossed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this world, and
once <hi>want him:</hi> let my
sinnes rather be <hi>punished,</hi>
then <hi>sooth'd:</hi> oh <hi>God,</hi> let
my <hi>hell</hi> be <hi>here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CHRIST hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>followers,</hi> but few dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
GOD hath many
creatures, but few sonnes.
GODS flocke is a little
one, one of a family, two
of a tribe, like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Esaiahs</hi> tall Tree,
heere and there a berrie
in the toppe of a bough:
there are many of <hi>Israel,</hi>
but few <hi>Israelites,</hi> many
that have <hi>Abraham</hi> to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27778:167"/>
their father, but a few his
children. Many that came
out of his loines, but few
that shall sit in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
Goodnes goes not
by multitude: the many
followers may shew thy
greatnesse, not thy holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
the most are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the worst. How
fondly then, how falsely
do any boast of the truth
of their religion by their
multitude?</p>
               <p>Every thing, we say,
is the worse for wearing;
it is true of the world;
the older the more <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:</hi>
we are forewarn'd
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27778:167"/>
of the last daies, that they
shall be notoriously wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
the world did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
begin with sinne,
but it shall end (in a
manner) with nothing but
sinne, and that in fire:
Here's our comfort, the
just are no part of the
world.</p>
               <p>If we had not knowne
<hi>sinne,</hi> we had not knowne
<hi>sicknes,</hi> and now we know
not how to be wel of our
sinne, but by Him against
whom wee have sinned;
our health is from <hi>God,</hi>
our sicknesse is from our
selves: <hi>Heale thy selfe,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:27778:168"/>
is only for that Physician
to whom it was upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it is not <hi>Saul</hi> and his
<hi>witch,</hi> or <hi>Asa</hi> and his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
can prevent death
or a disease, without <hi>God;</hi>
all is <hi>originally</hi> from
him, yet <hi>derivatively</hi> by
meanes. I will use the <hi>one,</hi>
but I will <hi>trust</hi> onely the
other; if wee are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
either <hi>without</hi> them,
or <hi>in</hi> them, we presume.</p>
               <p>Whilest we are here,
we are in continuall want
of somewhat, either our
<hi>mindes</hi> are <hi>sicke,</hi> or else
our <hi>bodies,</hi> diseases or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.
How should
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:27778:168"/>
wee long for that place,
where we shall enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>rest,</hi> and want
nothing but a <hi>consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of our rest?</p>
               <p>This world is a <hi>lyer,</hi>
and he will find it so, that
serves it: <hi>riches</hi> like their
master, are full of deceit,
promise that they have
not. How many have
we seen that have thoght
no joy but in abundance,
have, after, ended their
joy where they begin to
abound, and at last envied
the quiet rest and merry
meales of their labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?
To <hi>impatient, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:27778:169"/>
mindes, the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
state is ever cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and they would
change thogh for a <hi>worse;</hi>
If wee can but make the
best of our owne, and
thinke our selves well, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when others thinke
not so, wee are happy
men. Why should I think
that grievous which <hi>God</hi>
thinkes fit? If there were
no <hi>providence,</hi> I would
struggle: but now it is
hard <hi>to kicke against the
prickes.</hi> Lord, be it unto
thy servant according to
thy will.</p>
               <p>Pleasures are <hi>pleasing,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:27778:169"/>
but they are <hi>vanishing:</hi>
the <hi>Pharisies</hi> were not so
truly painted sepulchers,
as these, <hi>faire</hi> but <hi>rotten,</hi>
fading nor onely <hi>dying,</hi>
but <hi>killing.</hi> Like guilded
<hi>pills</hi> (save that they are
not <hi>Physicke</hi>) but small,
and ill tasted; if they were
either not <hi>short,</hi> or but
<hi>sweet,</hi> there were some
colour for loving them.
But now they are not <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi>
and yet <hi>unsavoury:</hi>
Why are we not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of those pleasures,
which are beyond al time
for <hi>length,</hi> and all conceit
for <hi>sweetnesse?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:27778:170"/>
Some men are afraid to
<hi>sinne,</hi> because they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to <hi>smart</hi> for their
sinne, they would goe <hi>on</hi>
in their sinnes, if they
could go <hi>away</hi> with them;
it doth not so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to be <hi>wicked,</hi> as
to be <hi>tormented,</hi> and their
study is not that they
may not <hi>provoke God,</hi> but
that they may run away
from Him. Oh <hi>God,</hi> if
we could runne out of the
world, we should run far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thy <hi>judgements.</hi>
Oh <hi>God,</hi> if we go downe
into <hi>hell,</hi> thou art there,
there is no running from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27778:170"/>
the <hi>punishment,</hi> till from
the <hi>sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All sicknesse is not of
the <hi>body:</hi> every <hi>leprosie</hi> is
not in the <hi>skinne,</hi> it were
well for some men it
were: every <hi>sinne</hi> is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
our soules are no
lesse subject to infection,
than our <hi>bodies;</hi> some are
diseas'd and do not <hi>know</hi>
it, others are diseas'd and
doe not <hi>care</hi> for it: both
cases are hard, but the
last is desperate. To make
light of sin, and because
thy soule is sicke even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>death,</hi> to say with the
<hi>Atheist</hi> &amp; <hi>Epicure, Let us
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27778:171"/>
eat and drinke, for we must
dye,</hi> is to shake hands with
vengeance: Hee that will
not so much as <hi>aske</hi> to be
heal'd; how justly shall
he dye in his leprosie.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>strange,</hi> but it is
<hi>ordinary</hi> to see every man
greedy to continue this
life, and not to procure a
better: If the head doe
but <hi>ake,</hi> strait to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
with the Shunamite,
to the <hi>Physicians</hi> with
<hi>Asa:</hi> If they bee but
talk'd to of <hi>dying,</hi> with
<hi>Ieroboam's</hi> wife they run
and ride, and send; and
as the Cripple to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27778:171"/>
pul downe the tiles
to come at him; but in
the matter of their <hi>soule,</hi>
they are <hi>deafe</hi> to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:
why are wee not as
industrious for <hi>Heaven,</hi>
as for our <hi>health;</hi> and to
live <hi>ever,</hi> as to live <hi>long?</hi>
Alas! what is age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>goodnesse,</hi> but a fairer
marke for <hi>vengeance?</hi>
What is <hi>Dives</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to out-live LAZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVS,
and at last dye and
be <hi>damn'd?</hi> Let others
trouble themselves and
the world, how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this <hi>body,</hi> my care
shall bee how to <hi>subject</hi>
it: whilest I employ my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27778:172"/>
soule only for the setting
out of my flesh, what am I
else but a glorious slave?</p>
               <p>Diseases though they
were the fruit of <hi>sinne,</hi>
and brought upon us by
our selves, yet they are
not dispos'd of amongst
us but by <hi>God,</hi> they head
doth not ake but with his
leave: nor leave aking
but with His helpe; it is
from above both that
wee are sicke, and that
wee are made whole; to
whom should I not only
owe my life, but bestow
it, but to him of whom
<hi>I live and move?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:27778:172"/>
As it is in <hi>extremities,</hi>
for men to remember
<hi>God,</hi> but with <hi>repining;</hi>
so it is hard in <hi>prosperity,</hi>
to remember themselves,
and what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of <hi>God;</hi> we are apt
to forget what wee have
bin, when we are chang'd
for the better; <hi>Pharaoh's</hi>
butler hath forgot he was
a prisoner: it is too true,
that too many love <hi>God</hi>
for their owne sakes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are <hi>poore,</hi> and
would be rais'd; or they
are <hi>sicke</hi> and would bee
heal'd; and like <hi>beggers,</hi>
no sooner are they <hi>serv'd</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:27778:173"/>
but they are gone. I may
both love my <hi>selfe,</hi> and
<hi>God;</hi> I may not love <hi>God</hi>
for my selfe, I would not
love my selfe but for that
I am <hi>His,</hi> and I will love

               <p>When I consider the

me thinkes they are
<hi>few,</hi> but <hi>evill;</hi> evill not in

but of <hi>sin,</hi> and I am found
guilty: if I consider the
present, (if there be any
<hi>present,</hi> when it is ever
<hi>passing</hi>) I do but adde to
my score, and if I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the time to come (if
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27778:173"/>
I have any to come, <hi>God</hi>
knowes) I do but adde to
the measure of my owne
sinnes, and <hi>Gods</hi> wrath
together with my yeeres;
since I must live, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but sinne, I will stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
how my sinnes may
not hinder me of a better
life; first, I will <hi>abhorre
them,</hi> and then I will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
<hi>my selfe</hi> for them;
and if I could not before
break my heart of them,
I will now breake it for
them: <hi>A broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite

they are, and prove <hi>reall:</hi>
the comparing of what
he hath <hi>enjoi'd,</hi> with what
he hath <hi>lost,</hi> and that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
lesse than <hi>nothing</hi> of
time which he hath liv'd,
with the <hi>eternitie</hi> of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hee is to dye in,
makes him curse the time
of his birth, since there
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27778:175"/>
is a time of <hi>death,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
death beyond all
<hi>time;</hi> so the <hi>godly</hi> and the
<hi>wicked</hi> differ not more in
their <hi>lives,</hi> than in their
<hi>deaths,</hi> but most of all
<hi>after</hi> death. Oh my <hi>God!</hi>
as thou hast made mee
of the best sort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
a <hi>man,</hi> and of the
best of that sort, a <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi>
so let mee be yet
better, by beeing one of
those whom thou hast
sorted for thy selfe; what
am I better, if I am only
<hi>call'd</hi> and not <hi>chosen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All bookes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
easie; those that are,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:27778:175"/>
are not all alike profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
some would profit
more, if they did but rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
others would rellish
better, if they were more
profitable; he doth well
that doth both, <hi>utile dulci;</hi>
I will neither drowne my
meat in sauce, nor dish it
dry.</p>
               <p>They are not the only
robbers that breake hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
guile is worse theft
than outrage; it is alike
wicked to make wine of
other mens grapes (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
did of <hi>Naboth's</hi>) and
to be drunk of our owne;
hee that will have riches
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27778:176"/>
in spight of heaven shall
have hell to boote.</p>
               <p>The malicious man is
his owne moth; that <hi>God</hi>
is better to him than hee
can expect, is nothing,
whilest He is better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
than Hee is to him:
like <hi>Gideon's</hi> first miracle
hee would have all the
ground dry but his fleece;
if <hi>Cain's</hi> sacrifice miscary,
<hi>Abel</hi> must not bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and live; no man may
bee either <hi>greater</hi> or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with safetie. I will not
looke at what I <hi>have,</hi> but
what I <hi>deserve,</hi> and I shall
never thinke my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> owne
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27778:176"/>
little, or anothers too
much: that is a <hi>wicked</hi>
heart that would have
all men <hi>worse</hi> than it selfe,
and <hi>hates</hi> all those whom
others thinke better.</p>
               <p>God is therfore boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to us, that we might
be so to others; to feast
those, that cannot bid us
againe, and to build for
those that cannot lodge
us againe, is the way to
that marriage-feast, and
those buildings, whose
Builder &amp; Maker is <hi>God:</hi>
he alone hath the true use
of wealth that receives
it onely to disburse it; if
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:27778:177"/>
of wealth that receives it
only to disburse it; if men
were their owne friends
they would make others
so with this Mammon;
why should the rust of
that gold rise up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against thee, the
use of which will set thee
with those that shall sit
in judgement?</p>
               <p>Persecution is the dore
to happines, <hi>Canaan</hi> hath
still the same way, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse;
who can looke
for heaven cheape, that
sees his SAVIOVR blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
I may not afflict
my selfe, yet I shall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27778:177"/>
my selfe without
affliction; calmes are
no lesse dangerous than
stormes.</p>
               <p>Some men doe not
climbe, but vault into
preferment at a leape; I
know not their sleight, I
mistrust their quicknesse;
few men were ever great
and good in an instant.
All the harme I wish
these, is, that their early
rising do them no harme;
they that are their owne
brokers in these, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their owne theeves in
better; and steale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:27778:178"/>
Favours are more bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but aflictions are
more profitable; to have
much is more glorie, but
to be content with that
we have is more victory;
there is no conquest like
that of our selves, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of our selves like
that of want; it is a hard
matter not to find pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a burden, or prosperity
a snare; this religion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
us, that if we are not
<hi>richer</hi> than others, yet we
are content to be poorer;
he only hath enough that
would have no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:27778:178"/>
Our endevors are in
vaine without <hi>God's</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
yet in vaine shall he
challenge a blessing that
endevors not; sloth is
no lesse guiltie than <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
I can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without <hi>God,</hi> yet I
will not looke <hi>God</hi> shall
doe all.</p>
               <p>The cause of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is sinne; and
the end of all sinne is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or to come; how
then doe we love to be
punished, and yet love
to sinne? if we could but
be innocent, we could not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:27778:179"/>
but be safe; while I am
here I cannot but sinne,
but I hope to avoid the
punishment through Him
who hath borne the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and the sinne.</p>
               <p>Our life is but a breath;
at first God breath'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
man the breath of life,
&amp;c. And it is gone with a
breath, if He breath upon
us in displeasure we die,
for at the breath of His
nostrills wee are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd:
since we doe not
live but by His leave,
why doe we not live to
His glorie? Oh God, I
have not liv'd long, yet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:27778:179"/>
so much of my life as I
have not liv'd to thee, I
have liv'd too much; all I
desire is, that as this life
was thy gift to me, so it
may be my gift to thee; I
I can afford God little, if
not His owne.</p>
               <p>All punishments are
from the same hand, <hi>Iobs</hi>
boyles are no lesse Gods
finger than <hi>Pharaohs;</hi> but
all are not with the same
end; those are but chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
upon some, that are
judgements upon others.
God strikes His owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He loves them, He
strikes the wicked because
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:27778:180"/>
they love not Him; those Hee
corrects but these He executes; it
is a signe Hee loves us when Hee
strikes us, and if his strokes bring
us to love him, wee may brag
with <hi>David,</hi> it is good for us that
we have beene afflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is all eare and all eye, and
all in all; grant <hi>Lord,</hi> that as I am
alwaies <hi>seene</hi> of thee, so I may be
alwaies <hi>heard</hi> of thee: and may
alwaies <hi>heare</hi> thee in thy <hi>Word,</hi>
and contemplate thee in thy
<hi>workes;</hi> that I may one day see as
I am seene, and heare and bee
heard in that heavenly quire of
<hi>Hallelujah's, Glorie, and power,
and honour be unto the Lambe, and
to Him that sitteth on the Throne,
for evermore.</hi> Amen.</p>
