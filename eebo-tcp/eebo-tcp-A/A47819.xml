            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe Character of a Popish Successor</hi> were an excellent <hi>Piece</hi> in
the kinde, if it had not too much <hi>Sublimate</hi> in it; For I
have heard of some people, that, with only holding their
Noses over it, but one quarter of an hour, have run stark mad upon't:
And when This Fume has once taken the Brain, there's nothing in
the world, but the <hi>Powder of Experience,</hi> (the Remembrance of
things past) to set a man Right again. The Truth of it is, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
has made the <hi>Figure</hi> of his <hi>Successour</hi> too Frightful, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
Sawcer-ey'd and Cloven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ooted; and when he has painted
the Monster as black on the <hi>One</hi> side, as Ink and Words can make
him; he finishes his <hi>Master-Piece</hi> with a <hi>Paradox,</hi> on the <hi>Other;
(Fol.</hi> 4.) by the Supposal of a most Excellent Person, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him the greater <hi>Devil</hi> for his <hi>Virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Fortitude</hi> (he says) makes him only the more Daring in the Cause
of <hi>Rome;</hi> his <hi>Justice</hi> makes it a Point of <hi>Conscience</hi> to deliver us up to
the <hi>Pope;</hi> his <hi>Temperance,</hi> in the Government of his Passions, makes
him the more close and steady; and his <hi>Prudence</hi> crowns the Work, by the
assistance it gives him in the Menage of his <hi>Policies</hi> and <hi>Conduct: And
so he goes on.</hi> Wbat booss it (<hi>says he</hi>) in a Popish Heir, to say, he's
the Truest <hi>Friend,</hi> the Greatest of <hi>Hero, s,</hi> the best of <hi>Masters,</hi> the Justest
<hi>Judge,</hi> or the Honestest of <hi>Men?</hi> All meer treacherous Quicksands for a
people to repose the least glimpse of Safety in, or build the least hopes upon.</p>
               <p>This is fairly push'd, I must confess, but 'tis only a cast of his
<hi>Rhetorique:</hi> For every body knows, that all <hi>Christian Princes</hi> thus
Qualify'd, and under Articles of <hi>Treaty</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> keep touch,
even with Infidels; nay, and <hi>Infidels</hi> with <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I go any further, let me recommend to the Reader, one
<hi>Remarque,</hi> as a thing worthy of his Attention: He cuts all the way
upon the <hi>Successor,</hi> as presupposing him to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>`Dangerous,</hi> and <hi>Insufferable,</hi> by reason of <hi>That Perswasion.</hi>
And very magisterialy he gives us his own bare word for the <hi>dangers</hi>
of that <hi>Perswasion.</hi> Why does he not rather tell us in express and
particular Terms, <hi>These</hi> and <hi>These</hi> are the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Rome?</hi> and then make his Inference, from those <hi>Principles</hi> to


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65670:3"/>
the Dangers that attend them; and so leave the unbyass'd part of
the world to judge of the <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> betwixt such <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and such <hi>Effects?</hi> For <hi>His</hi> dilating himself thus at random upon
his Character, and striking so <hi>point-blank</hi> at the <hi>Rescinding</hi> of the
<hi>Succession,</hi> makes men apt to imagine, that his Pique may be rather
to the <hi>Person,</hi> then the <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will behove me, in this place, to inform the Reader, that I do not
charge him for not producing the dangerous <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Papists;</hi>
as if I thought there were no <hi>Instances</hi> of that Quality to be given:
(For I am better acquainted with their <hi>Ecclesiastical Politiques,</hi> then
so.) But the true Intent of my <hi>Quaere</hi> upon that <hi>Objection,</hi> was to
shew the Authours <hi>Prudence</hi> in reserving himself upon those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
For if he had said, <hi>Behold! Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>se are the Positions of the
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and they are not to be endur'd in any</hi> Government;
I should have ask'd him presently, <hi>How comes it then</hi> that <hi>you your self,
under the Colour of</hi> Rooting out Popery <hi>One way, are</hi> Planting <hi>it An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and Erecting the very same Pestilent</hi> Positions <hi>that you condemn<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Insomuch, that while you would be thought zealous to</hi> Abolish <hi>the</hi> Name
<hi>of</hi> Popery, <hi>you are no lesse zealous<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to</hi> Establish <hi>the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of it;</hi>
Whereof, at leisure.</p>
               <p>The suddain bolting out of this <hi>PhantÃ´me</hi> from behinde the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
may so far serve a present turn, as to startle, and surprise
the undiscerning Vulgar: Yet, when, upon Second<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and Recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoughts, this <hi>Mormo</hi> shall come to be examin'd, and taken to
pieces; the very <hi>multitude</hi> themselves, that were affrighted at the
<hi>Apparition,</hi> will be asham'd of the <hi>Imposture.</hi> The thing that I
would say, is this; that the <hi>Truth</hi> is somewhat too much <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,</hi>
in a Declamatory Torrent of Words, and Exuberance of
Phansy, without any one Concluding and Convincing Period. If
<hi>Apollo</hi> had been of <hi>Counsell</hi> with the Authour, he would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him to the Moderating of his <hi>Character,</hi> as he does <hi>Olaus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
in <hi>Boccalini,</hi> to moderate the Greatness of his <hi>Northern Eagles,</hi>
that prey'd upon <hi>Elephants;</hi> as being a very Extraordinary thing
for a <hi>Bird</hi> to trusse an <hi>Elephant,</hi> and fly away with him. (which is,
perhaps, the more Venial Excess of the two.) It is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Indignities that can be put upon the simplicity of a <hi>Just Truth,</hi>
the dawbing of it with Embrodery and Flourish, and the over-doing
of it. If Little <hi>Epictetus</hi> had been at his Elbow, he would have
minded him, that <hi>some things are in our our own Power, and others are
not so;</hi> and that the subject matter of his Discourse being wholly
out of <hi>His</hi> Cognizance, he might have done well to have left the


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65670:3"/>
business of the <hi>Succession</hi> to the Ordering of Gods <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Subject (I know) that whoever touches upon it, treads
upon <hi>Burning Coals;</hi> and there must be great <hi>Caution,</hi> as well as
<hi>Innocence,</hi> to carry a man through this <hi>Ordeal:</hi> For who shall dare to
Dispute the danger of a <hi>Popish Successor?</hi> But so far am I from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
that Province, that I'le compound the matter with him
beforehand; and take all his suppositions of Difficulties and Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
in the Case, for Granted. But then I must distinguish betwixt
the unhappy circumstance of being under the Allegeance of a Prince
of that Perswasion, who is actually in the <hi>Possession</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of
his Power, and the remote <hi>Possibility</hi> only of that Danger; and a
<hi>Possibility</hi> too of such a condition, as a thousand things may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
to prevent it: As the Contingences of <hi>Issue, Survivorship,</hi> &amp;c.
and at the Worst, this dismal apprehension amounts, at last, but to
the Contemplation of a Prince of <hi>That Communion,</hi> in a Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
betwixt a <hi>Predecessor,</hi> and a <hi>Successor,</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not but that I am as much against the Principles, and Practises
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>rted
from that Communion, as any man living, that keeps himself
within the compass of <hi>Christian Charity, Humanity,</hi> and <hi>good Manners.</hi>
And so far, I shall heartily joyn with the Compiler of the <hi>Character,</hi> by
a previous Concession of the Inconveniences (as I have said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
that may arrive, by reason of that Religion. But then I must
take this Consideration along with me.</p>
               <p>That <hi>First;</hi> there are many <hi>Dreadfull Dangers,</hi> which we cannot
avoid, but by incurring <hi>Greater.</hi> As the Leaping of a Garret-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
when the Fire has taken the Stair-Case; which is only a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Election (under a Calamitous Necessity) of the less evil of the
Two. Now the same Action, which would have been a madness
<hi>Without</hi> that necessity, becomes an Act of <hi>Prudence, With</hi> it; the great
danger of the <hi>Leap</hi> being warranted by the greater danger of the
<hi>Fire:</hi> And there must likewise precede a Deliberation upon the
difficulties <hi>Both</hi> ways, to justifie the Resolution: For otherwise at the
best, a man does well but by chance. Now it would have been fair
play, in the <hi>Character-writer,</hi> if he had candidly Ballanc'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and told us, <hi>This</hi> is the danger <hi>One</hi> way, and <hi>That Another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It happens, many times, that we have no other Choice
before us, but either to suffer the Highest Degree of Misery, that
can befall us in this world; or else, to Prostitute our <hi>Souls,</hi> for the
saving of our <hi>Skins,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes.</hi> Now under such an Exigent as
This, let the Prospect of things be never so Terrible, we are to


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65670:4"/>
oppose, the Duties of <hi>Christians,</hi> of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and of <hi>Honest men,</hi>
to all hazzards whatsoever; and patiently to <hi>endure</hi> whatever
we cannot, with <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> either <hi>Resist,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline:</hi>
according to the Practise of the <hi>Primitive Martyrs,</hi> who
witnessed their <hi>Profession</hi> with their <hi>Bloud,</hi> as <hi>Christians;</hi> and Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> without <hi>Resistance.</hi> So that we are not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our selves by a Naked Speculation of the Perils that we are to
encounter, and the Means of avoiding them; without enquiring into
the Consistency of those means with the Measures of <hi>Conscience</hi> and
<hi>Duty.</hi> But there is one <hi>Main</hi> point yet behind; which is in effect
the very <hi>Hinge</hi> of the Controversie. And this is it. If there shall be
any thing sound in this <hi>Character of a Popish Successour,</hi> that shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
operate upon the Legal Constitution of the <hi>English Monarchy,</hi>
or Reflect <hi>Personally</hi> upon the <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Justice</hi> of his <hi>Majesty</hi> now in
Being; the Pretext of the <hi>Succession</hi> will be look't upon only as a <hi>Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Horse</hi>
to Countenance an approach to some further Design: In
which Case, the <hi>Question</hi> will not be any longer the <hi>Religion</hi> of a <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,</hi>
but the very <hi>Right</hi> it self of <hi>Kingly-Power.</hi> And here I must
expound my self once again; that I Speak only to the <hi>Anonymus
Character</hi> of a <hi>Popish Successour,</hi> without the least Reference to any
<hi>Publique,</hi> and Authoritative <hi>Debates,</hi> or <hi>Counsels.</hi> And so I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
(in the First place) to the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>Masquerade.</hi>
               </p>

Pulpit against <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> Then Pope. He was accused upon Oath; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Queen and Councill for an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and a Sower of <hi>Sedition;</hi> and
Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> took his Examination, (<hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Fire-brands, Pa. 7.)

his Justification. He got out of <hi>England</hi> afterwards by a Trick; and,
with one <hi>Farewell Sermon,</hi> 130 l. for a <hi>Viaticum.</hi> Not long after, he
was clapt up at <hi>Rome</hi> for Reviling the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
But he Pleaded for himself, that he had done his Holiness, and the Church
considerable Service; for, by Preaching against <hi>Set-Forms of Prayer,</hi> and
calling the <hi>English Prayers, English Masse,</hi> he put them upon the Humour
of <hi>Extemporary Prayer;</hi> which took so much with the People, that they
were come to hate the Church of <hi>England</hi> as much as the Church it self hated
the <hi>Mass.</hi> Whereupon, the Pope gave him a Reward of <hi>Two Thousand

               <p>The matter of Fact is sufficiently clear'd, and the Practise too No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
to be deny'd; As to the Influence that these Papists have (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of <hi>Dissenting Protestants</hi>) upon the Unity of the Church,
and the Peace of the State. But the Craft (as they say) lyes in
the Catching of them: For the Test of Oaths will never do the
Business, as we have found by their Swearing to so many Contrary,
and Inconsistent Purposes, and Interests, throughout the whole
Course of our Late Troubles.</p>
               <p>So that we have no other way left that I can Imagine, of knowing
a <hi>Disguised Jesuit</hi> from one that calls himself a <hi>Dissenting Protestant,</hi>
but by comparing their <hi>Principles;</hi> which would infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the Credit, and Advantage of the Conscientious sort of
the Divided Party. And without such a Test of Discrimination
the Project of Uniting Dissenters seems to be utterly Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable;
unless to the Extream Hazzard of Authorizing the most
pernicious sort of <hi>Popery,</hi> and Incorporating a <hi>Jesuitical Leaven</hi> into
our very Constitution; according to the Method which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>
himself had projected, as the most probable Expedient for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of <hi>Popery</hi> into this Kingdom. The Removal of this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
will open a way to a General Accomodation; to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Security both of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> And this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be done by applying the <hi>Maxims</hi> of those that we suspect here
for <hi>Jesuits,</hi> to the Standard of those Detestable <hi>Principles</hi> which we
so much abominate in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And where ever we

The States-men of <hi>Forty One</hi> that defended the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the way to uphold it, is to suppress those that would destroy it.
That is to say, to suppresse those that enter into <hi>Protestations, Oaths,</hi>

Churches were turn'd into Stables, our Clergy hunted like Partridges
in the Mountains, our Pulpits Stuff'd with Blasphemy, and Blew A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prons;
and in the Conclusion, a hundred Heresyes let loose among

the whole Nations Vnanimous Prudence, and indefatigable Care for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

sworn Fealty to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and taken Orders in Foreign <hi>Seminarys,</hi>
are the greatest Seducers of the Kings liege People, and the most notorious.
Incendiaries, and subverters of the Protestant Christianity and Loyalty;
and for that Cause their several Laws declare them Traytors; by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
these are the Potent and dangerous Enemies, which in defense of the
Protestant Cause, this Popish King is oblig'd to suppress and Punish; and
these the very Laws he is bound to Execute. Fol. 2.</p>

Proposal set afoot; But brought in, God knows, by Head
and shoulders, under the Countenance of Religion, and Succession.
It is possible there may be no more in it then a Well-meaning mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
But there must be an Infinite. Tenderness of Conscience, and
a most untainted Loyalty to justify the Authour. But to return to
my Character.</p>
               <p>As to the Influence which a Popish Successour may have upon Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
matters, (as in the Character) there needs no more to
be sayd in't then this; that the King hath been gratiously pleased
to offer the Passing of any Bill for securing the Protestant Religion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
without barring, or diverting the Succession. And such Expedients
have been also fram'd to that effect, as have been by great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
judg'd Competent for the Obviating of that Difficulty.</p>
               <p>As to the Rest, I will not deny but that it is a hard thing for a
Prince to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eize and persecute a People of his own Religion, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>eo nomine</hi> for their being so: And it is very Probable too that he
will connive at men of that Perswasion, in many Cases, where the
Law directs a Punishment. And what is there more in this the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
what has been done already more or less from the Date of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
themselves to This very day: and what is done by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self toward the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> at this Instant? where is
the great hurt now (upon this Admittance) in not punishing


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65670:11"/>
the Papists; so long as the Protestants are not Persecuted? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Fanatical Papists did not only in defiance both of Law, and
Gospel, engross all Offices, Benefits and Priviledges to themselves,
but without Mercy or Distinction destroy'd the rest of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> A very pretty <hi>Chimaera!</hi> Which is as much as to make this
Popish King the greatest Barbarian in the Creation; a Barbarian that
shall cherish and maintain the Dissenters from Truth, and punish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Pillars of Christianity, and Proselites of Heaven: Which is no
other then to speak him the basest of Men, and little lesse then a Monster.
Beside, at the same time that we suppose that King, that dares not uphold
nor encourage his own Religion, we render him the most deplorable of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
a Coward so abject, that he dares not be a Champion even for his
God. And how consistent this is with the Glory of a Crowned Head, and
what hope <hi>England</hi> has of such a Successour, I leave all men of sense to
judge. Fol. 3.</p>
               <p>Behold here's the upshot of this high-flown Paragraph. [A Popish
Prince that puts the Laws in Execution for the punishing of Papists,
and for the protecting and countenancing of Protestants, is little
less then the basest of Monsters.] How comes it then that the Crown
of <hi>France</hi> has not treated the Protestant Subjects there, as this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture-drawer
pronounces, that a Popish Successour would treat his
Protestant Subjects here? The Protestants have now and then been
severely handled I know in <hi>France;</hi> as the Papists, upon some Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
have been in <hi>England;</hi> And now of late worse then usual.
All which has been Influenc'd well by Reasons of State, as by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
of Religion. But shall we Pronounce the most Christian
King the greater Monster, for his better usage of us? If a potent
Aversion to us in matter of Religion had transported the <hi>French</hi>
King's into so mortal a Detestation of us to all other purposes, they
would never have committed so many Eminent Charges both in
Councells and in Arms, to the Honour and Trust of Protestant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Commanders. But the Convenience and Utility of the
State preponderated against Disagreements in Religion. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisms
of the <hi>Holy League</hi> were the Results of a Sanguinary Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well in Civil Government, as Religion. And one Egg is
not Liker another then the <hi>League</hi> of these <hi>Dissenting Papists</hi> to the
<hi>Covenant</hi> of our <hi>Jesuitical</hi> and <hi>Dissenting Pseudo-Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come now to the Reason and Conscience of this Elaborate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65670:11"/>
Taking His Position for granted, that a Popish Prince is bound
by his Religion, contrary to Oaths and Promises, Honour and
Justice, the Dictates of Nature, the Laws of Nations, and the
Bonds of Humane Society; contrary to all This (I say) and to his
Interest also; to break Faith with Protestants; and those Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
his Subjects too. He must be unman'd, as well as Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian'd;
an Excomunicate to Humane Nature, and excluded from
all the Benefits and Offices of Mankind. And yet, we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
many Instances, in the <hi>French League,</hi> and the <hi>Scottish Covenant,</hi>
of an abandon'd Perfidy even to this degree. It must be a strange
Digestion sure, that can put over all other Impieties, and turn the
violation of all that is Sacred in Nature into a meritorious Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> Besides what mismatch'd incongruous Ingredients must go to
make up this Composition a King! His Hand and Heart must be
of no Kin to one another: He must be so Inhumane to those very dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Jesuites, that, like <hi>Mahomets</hi> Pidgeon, infus'd and whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
all his Heavenly Dreams into his Ears, that he must not only
clip their wings, but fairly Cage 'em too, even for the Charming Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
they breath'd him: And at the same Minute he must leave the
wide and open Ayr to those very Ravens that daily croak Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Confusion to them, and all their Holy Dreams, and their
false Oracles. Thus, whilest he acts quite contrary to all his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
against the whole Bent of his Soul, what does he but publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in force those Laws for the Protestant Service; till <hi>in fine,</hi>
for his Nations Peace he ruines his own, and is a whole Scene of War
within himself? Whilst his Conscience accusing his sloth on one side, the
<hi>Pope</hi> on the other, <hi>Rome</hi>'s continuall Bulls bellowing against him
as an undutifull Son of Holy Mother-Church, a Scandal to her Glory,
a Traytor to her Interest; and a Deserter of her Cause; one day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
the Lukewarmnesse of his Religion; another, the Pusillanimity
of his Nature; all <hi>Roman-Catholick Princes</hi> deriding the Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his Spirit, and the Tamenesse of his Arm; till, at long run, to
spare a Fagot in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> he does little lesse then walk on hot Irons
himself. Thus all the pleasure he relishes on a Throne is but a kinde of
<hi>Good-Fryday</hi>-Entertainment: Instead of Royall Festival, his Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all the Luxury of his Heart, to see <hi>Rome's Dagon</hi> worshipp'd;
<hi>Rome's</hi> Altars smoke; <hi>Rome's</hi> Standard set up; <hi>Rome's</hi> Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and his victorious <hi>Mother-Church</hi> Triumphant; his abject, and
poor-spirited Submission denyes himself the only thing he thirsts for: and

               <p>This Passage is only the same thing over again, in a diversity
of Words and Phrase. But it is well enough to answer the Ends
it was intended for; the tickling of the Phansy, and the moving
of a Popular Passion, without one syllable of weight to strike the
Judgement. My Reply upon the Last Paragraph shall serve for
This too; which I have not here Recited, as requiring any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
but to shew what pains he has taken with the Ornaments
of his Rhetorique, to supply the Defect of Argument. I cannot
liken it to any thing better then the Gaudy Glittering Vapour that
Children are used to Phansy in a Cloud. They'l Phansy <hi>Lions, Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi>
in it, or what other Figures they Please; but the first Breath
of Ayre scatters the Phantastique Images, and resolves the whole
into its original Nothing. And just so it is with this Character.
There are many things in it finely enough sayd, to work upon a
partial and an Easy Imagination; and to mislead a body at first fight
into an Opinion that there may be something of weight and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in it; but upon a second Thought it seems to be only a
plausible Strain of Words, which the Authour has as well Colour'd
yet, as the matter will bear.</p>
               <p>It serves however in <hi>English</hi> well enough for an Incentive and
Appeal to the Multitude: But if it should happen to be turn'd
into <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> it would become as ill as Office to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
abroad, as it is here to the Government. For what could
be of a more pernicious Consequence, from an unknown and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Pen, then for one of the Reform'd Communion to tell the
<hi>French</hi> King, that if he suffers one Protestant Subject to live in his
Dominions, he is all those Vile, Impious, and Abject things that
the Authour has here bundled up in the Character of his Popish
Successour.</p>
               <p>But for this Popish Successour of his, which is a Figure that has

the very fact it self is not Clearer then the Designe.
But however it is, the Authour has endeavour'd to prevent any
such Conjeeture, by a Complement upon the Memory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65670:13"/>
to make the better way to the venting of his spleen against
the Successor here in question.</p>
               <p>If there can be a Son of that Royal Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the First (<hi>says
he</hi>) a Prince so truly pious, that his very Enemies dare not asperse
his Memory or Life, with the least Blemish of Irreligion; A Prince that
Seal'd the <hi>Protestant Faith</hi> with his Bloud; who in his deplorable Fate,
and Ignominious Death, bore so near a resemblance to That of the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of the world, that his Sufferings can do no lesse then Seat him at the
Right hand of Heaven. If (<hi>I say</hi>) there can be a Son of that Royall

<hi>dooms</hi> (for <hi>deems</hi> I suppose) all that die without the Bosome of

               <p>The Authour has wrought up This Phansy to a high Pitch, as
well in respect of the Father, as of the Son; and he has shew'd
his skill in't too, for the more he advances the Reputation of the
One, the more scope he has, upon the Opposition, to depresse the
Esteem of the Other. I would charitably believe that he means
good Faith in the Honourable Mention he makes of that Venerable

that they order'd this Declaration to be forthwith Printed, and

Read in all Churches and Chappels in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales:</hi> calling
Heaven and Earth to Witnesse the Integrity of their Souls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all these Gross, and Scandalous Contradictions.</p>
               <p>Now to the Latter part of his Paragraph, First, he lays down a
false Supposition, and then he raises out of it a most uncharitable
Consequence. For the very Position that <hi>there is no Salvation out of
the Church;</hi> is qualifyed yet with an Exception, in case of an <hi>Invincible
Perswasion;</hi> But if this be so lew'd a Principle, in One Religion,
why is it not so in Another? There is not a fouler Character in Hell,
then he has drawn here of a Popish Successor. and he founds it
upon the Irresistible Impulses and Dictates of the Religion. which
being admitted, involves every Individual member of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the same Condemnation. So that he himself damns all
the Papists, as well as he makes Them Damn all the Protestants.</p>
               <p>So much for the <hi>Son of that Royal Protestant,</hi> as he expresses it. But
he says nothing all this while of the undutifull Subjects of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Martyr: Those that actually divided his Sacred Head from his
Body, and then glory'd in it as an Acceptable Sacrifice unto the
Lord.</p>
               <p>But was This Prince so pious, does he say, that <hi>his very Enemies
dare not asperse his Memory?</hi> &amp;c. What if I should shew him now (to
convince him of his Mistake) three or four of the Fiercest Sticklers

not Defend his Own Religion, because he dares not; but Sneaks upon a
Throne, and in Obedience to his Fear shrinks from the Dictates of his

               <p>He does well enough to pray for <hi>Jupiters Logg,</hi> considering what

so Base a things (says he) for a Prince to shrink from the <hi>Dictates</hi> of his
<hi>Conscience?</hi> What if his Majesty himself should make it a point of
Conscience not to entertein any Project for the Uniting, as they call
it, of Protestant Dissenters; in regard both of the Publike Peace, and
the Heretical Opinions that must be indulg'd under that Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

and so unnatural a Course to Establish <hi>Popery,</hi> it being so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
against the <hi>English</hi> Constitution, that it can never be introduced with

from so much Cruelty, &amp;c. <hi>Fol.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The Glory of a Papist! (<hi>says he, in Reply upon himself,</hi>) a pretty
Aiery Notion. How shall we ever expect that Glory shall steer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of a <hi>Popish Successour,</hi> when there is not that thing so Abject, that
he shall refuse to do, or That Shape or Hypocrisie so Scandalous, he shall not
assume, when <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Rome's</hi> Interest shall Command; nay, when his
own petulant Stubbornnesse shall but sway him? As for Example; for One
Fit he shall come to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, and be a member of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
notwithstanding at the same time his Face belies his Heart, and
in his Soul he is a <hi>Romanist.</hi> Nay, he shall vary his Disguises as often
as an <hi>Algerine</hi> his Colours, and change his Flag to conceal the Pyrat.
As for Instance, Another fit, for whole years together, he shall come nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to One Church nor th' other, and participate of neither Communion, till
ignoble he plays the Vnprincely, nay the unmanly Hypocrite, so long, that
he shelters himself under the Face of an <hi>Atheist</hi> to shroud a <hi>Papist;</hi> a Visor
more fit for a <hi>Banditto</hi> then a Prince. And This methinks is so Wretched
and despicable a Disguise, that it looks like being asham'd of his God.
<hi>Fol.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>If a Popish Successour will do any thing, though never so Abject,
he will comply then, and make his Religion Truckle to his Interest:
But how comes he to be so <hi>Abject,</hi> and Yielding in One Line, and
so <hi>Stubborn</hi> in the Next: If it be True that he will so Scandalously
play the Hypocrite as to Change his Shape, and Act any part for
his Advantage, which <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Romes Interest</hi> shall Impose upon
him; what should hinder him from making himself a <hi>Protestant</hi> to
the <hi>Law,</hi> though he continue a <hi>Papist</hi> still in his <hi>Heart?</hi> And where's
the Outcry then, against the <hi>Popish Successour?</hi> If he will do This,
the Exception is Remov'd; For he's no longer, in Construction of
Law, a Papist: And if he will not do it, he has great Wrong done
him in the Character. The Policy, or in Truth the Probability of his
running from One Communion to Another, I must Confesse I do not
understand. For if he can dispense with shuffling and shifting; his


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65670:14"/>
way would be to shift once for all into the shape of a <hi>Protestant;</hi>
(For That's a Turn would gain him his Point) and not to wander
thus from One Church to Another, to no manner of Purpose. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Matter, the Authour methinks might have treated
the Brother of his Sovereign with a little more regard to the Terms
of Decency, and Respect, and kept himself to the <hi>Cause,</hi> without
betraying so great an Animosity to the <hi>Person.</hi> But having to do
with a Prince of his own Creating, he thinks he may deal with him
at what rate he pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> Besides, If Glory could have any Ascendant over a <hi>Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,</hi>
one would think the word of a King, and the Solemn Protestations
of Majesty ought to be Sacred and Inviolable. But how many Presidents
have we in <hi>Popish</hi> Princes to convince us that their strongest Engagements
and Promises, are lighter then the very Breath that Vtters them. As
for Examples sake, How did their Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> promise the
<hi>Norfok</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Inhabitants the unmolested Continuation of the
<hi>Protestant</hi> Worship; calling her God (that God that saw the Falsenesse
of her Heart) to witnesse, <hi>That though her own Perswasion was of
the</hi> Romish <hi>Faith, yet she would content her self with the Private
Exercise of her own Devotion, and preserve the then Protestant
Government, with all her Subjects Rights and Priviledges, un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd.</hi>
Vpon which, those poor, credulous, honest, deluded Believers,
on the Security of such Prevalent Conjurations, led by the mistaken Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
they paid to a Protesting Majesty, laid their Lives at her Feet,
and were the very men that in That Contest of the Succession plac'd her
on a Throne: But immediatly when her Sovereign Power was securely
establish'd, and his pious Holinesse had bid her safely pull the Vizor off,
no sooner did <hi>Smithfield</hi> glow i'th Piles of Blazing Hereticks; But
Chronicles more particularly observe, that no people in her whole Kingdom
felt so signal marks of her Vengeance, as those very Men that raised her
to the Throne. Her Princely Gratitude for their Crowning her with a
Diadem, Crown'd Them with their Martyrdoms.</p>
               <p>But since we have mentioned her Princely Gratitude, 'twill not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
to recollect one Instance more of so Exemplary a Virtue. In the
Dispute betwixt Her's and the Lady <hi>Jane Grey's</hi> Title to the Crown, it
was remarkable, that all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> gave their Vnanimous
Opinions for the Lady <hi>Jane's</hi> Succession, except one of them only, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the Right of <hi>Mary:</hi> But it so fell out, that This man proving a
<hi>Protestant</hi> (notwithstanding of all the whole Scarlet-Robe he had been
her only Champion) was so barbarously persecuted by her, that being first


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65670:15"/>
degraded, then imprison'd and tortur'd for his Religion, the Cruelty of
his Torments was so savage, that with his own hand he made himself a
way to escape 'em. And well might the violence of his Despair testifie
his Sufferings were Intolerable, when he fled to so sad a Refuge as Self-Murther,
for Deliverance. <hi>Fol.</hi> 5. &amp; 6.</p>
               <p>See how he Confounds himself here in his way of Reasoning:
Because Q. <hi>Mary</hi> was not so good as her <hi>Word;</hi> therefore <hi>No Popish
Prince</hi> values himself upon his Honour. 'Tis true, she brake her
Promise with <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> (as he Reports it) that gave her
the First Lift toward the Crown: But it is more then he can justifie
to make it a premeditate Perfidy; as he renders it. For it is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of our best Writers, that she was rather wrought upon, <hi>ex
post facto,</hi> to that Violation; But a Violation it was however; and
there's no Excuse for't. And it was a mean Ingratitude to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Loyalty of those People, whom (under favour) she did not
treat worse then Others, but she did ill in not using them better.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns the matter of Title, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown upon a <hi>Statute</hi> of 35. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi>
being prevail'd upon afterward in his Death-sicknesse, contrary to
the Intent and direction of that Statute, to transfer the Succession,
by <hi>Will,</hi> to the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> in favour of a Faction that labour'd
the Disinheriting of the Ladyes <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> all the Judges
subscribed to the Disinherison of the Sisters, save only <hi>Sr. James
Hales;</hi> (Justice of the Common Pleas) who refused, upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the <hi>Right,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>Person</hi> of the Lady
<hi>Mary.</hi> This same <hi>Sr. James Hales,</hi> for giving a Charge afterward,
Derogatory to the Supremacy of the Pope, was commited to Prison;
but received Good Words and fair usage, some time after. He
Fell however into a deep melancholly, and in the Conclusion
Drown'd himself. But I see no warrantable Authority for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his being put to the Torture; only the Authour of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
finds it convenient to have it so, for the better grace of his
Story. But we need not trouble our selves to look so far back for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Breach of Faith; this Last Age having made us Famous
for <hi>Perjurious Practises,</hi> beyond all that ever went before it. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the whole Tract of our Late Troubles. But now comes Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Objection of his own, with His Reply upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65670:15"/>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> Suppose (<hi>says he</hi>) that the Conservation of a Nations Peace, the
Dictates of a Princes Glory, and all the Bonds of Morality, cannot have
any Influence upon a Popish Successour; yet why may there not be that
Prince, who in veneration of his <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi> shall defend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, notwithstanding all his Private regret and inclinations
to the Contrary? When, rather then incur the infamous Brand of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
he shall ty himself to the Performance of That which not the force
of Religion it self shall violate. And Then, how can there be That Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of a Subject, after so Solemn an Oath, that shall not believe him?</p>
               <p>Why, truly, I am afraid there are a great many of those Infidells,
(<hi>says he</hi>) and some that will give smart Reasons for their Infidelity: For,
if he keeps his Oath, we must allow, that the only Motive that Prompts
him to keep it, is some Obligation that he believes is in an Oath. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
he is of a Religion that can absolve Subjects from their Allegeance,
to an Heretical, Excommunicated Prince, nay Depose him, and take
his very Crown away: Why may it not much more release a King from
his Faith to an Excommunicated, Heretical People; by so much as the Tyes
of Vassals to Monarchs are greater then those of Monarchs to Vassals.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Obligation</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> I presume he means the <hi>Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
of it; because he speaks of <hi>That Obligation</hi> from which the
Pope pretends a power to absolve him. Now if this be his Mind;
<hi>That Obligation</hi> is not (as he says) the <hi>only Motive</hi> to the keeping
of his Oath; but there is a Super-Additional Reason of State, and
Political Contemplations, over and above. Take that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
once, that <hi>there's no Trusting to the Oath of a Roman Catholique
Prince;</hi> and ye cut the very Ligaments of Society, and Commerce.
There's an End of All Treatyes, and Alliances; amicable and
mutual Offices betwixt Christian Princes, and States: Nay, in
One word, erect but This Maxim; you turn <hi>Europe</hi> into a Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and put Christendom, without any more ado, into a State
of War. For where there's no Trust, there can be no Security:
And then we know upon Experience, that the Outrages of Jelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
for the Preventing of <hi>Imaginary Evills,</hi> are actually the most
dreadfull of <hi>Real ones</hi> themselves. This Opinion makes us a Scorn
and a Prey to <hi>Infidels,</hi> and Strips us of all that is Divine, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
in us, together.</p>
               <p>I am nor ignorant yet, either of the Doctrine, or of
the Practice of several Profligate Wretches of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion, in This Impious Particular. But they are such
then as are wholly lost in Brutality and Blindnesse, and


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65670:16"/>
I neither do, nor can believe all Papists to be equally suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of That Unchristian Impression. It is a Position that may be
made use of at a Dead Lift, to serve a Political Turn. And the
Trick will not passe neither, but upon some Enthusiastique Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
Zealot, that takes all his Dreams for Visions, and the
Vapours of his Distemper for Revelations. We have had of these
Romish Dispensations and Absolutions in abundance, among our
Own Fanatical Jesuites, and not only the Doctrie asserted, but
the Duty also of abjuring our Oaths of Allegiance and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Obedience inculcated, and press'd upon the pain of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
Plunder and Damnation. Yet God forbid that the Acts
of the Conclave of a Close Committee, and the Determinations
of an <hi>Ignatian</hi> Assembly of Divines (the True Counter-Part of
the Holy Society;) the Lord forbid (I say) that This Cabal of
audacious Extravagants, that took upon them to Discharge us
from the Obligations of the Ten Commandements, as well as of
the Laws of the Land, should reflect a Scandal upon the whole
Body of our Communion, as if Their Warrant were a Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Perjury and Rebellion, and the Doctrine of King-killing,
and Violence, were the Dictate of our Profession.</p>
               <p>He touches a little lower upon the French Kings breaking in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Flanders,</hi> contrary to his Oath. <hi>[All the Motives</hi> (says he)
<hi>that could provoke him to the Breach of his Oath, were only his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a Lust of being Great,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Fol. 6.]</hi> So that he has now found
out a Popish Prince, it seems, that sacrifices his Conscience to his
Glory, though but a little before he made it the Character of a
Popish Successour to sacrifice his Glory to his Religion. Now by
the way, I look upon Majesty as a Sacred Character, and not
to be handled but with Veneration: Wherefore whether his Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
be True of False, I shall speak to it only as a Supposition. He
proceeds now to the ballancing of the matter.</p>
               <p>If (<hi>says he</hi>) a Roman Catholique can break an Oath only for the Pleasure
of Conquering, which he knows is doing Ill; Shall not a Popish Prince in
<hi>England</hi> have ten times more Inclination to break an Oath for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own Faith, which his Conscience tells him is meritorious?</p>
               <p>I Answer, that the breaking of an Oath, out of a Lust of being
Great, is the Crime properly of an Ambitious Prince, not of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish:
For he does not consult his Religion, but only his Glory, in
the Committing of it. And the same Thirst of Dominion, with the
same degree of Indifference, as to the Businesse of Right or wrong,


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65670:16"/>
in concurrence with the same Advantages of Power and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would have produced the very same essects in a Prince of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Judgment. Well, but he does an Ill thing knowingly; and so
are most of the Ill things that are done in the World, without any
regard to the difference of Protestant or Papist. But Then his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of This Ill thing done to another Prince of the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
is only the cutting of One Diamond with another; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to our Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But much more will a Popish Prince in</hi> England (says he) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>â€”Does
it follow Here that because a man would rather forswear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to bring a Good thing to pass, then a Bad one, (though we
are to do no evill at all that Good may come of it) that therefore
for the compassing of a good end a man will forswear himself? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have I ever as yer heard of the Merit of propagating any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by Perjury: Or that the Consciences of any sort of Christians
could justifie them in a Crime which even Infidels themselves by the
meer instinct of Nature have in extreme abhorrence. And he follows
the point yet further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> He has Religion (<hi>says he</hi>) to drive the Royal <hi>Jehu</hi> on; Religion
that from the beginning of the world, through all Ags, has set all Nations
in a Flame; yet never confessed it self in the Wrong.</p>
               <p>These are strange words to come from the mouth of a pretender to
Scruples, and a Protestant Advocate. His Quarrel is not now so much
to a Popish, as to a Religious Successour. Nor is it any longer Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but Religion it self, that he strikes at, as the dangerous and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Incendiary. Nay and since Religion was in the world, it was
never otherwise he says. So that here is a very fair expedient hinted,
for the good of Christendom, <hi>to exterminate this Spirit of Discord</hi> (RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION)
<hi>from off the face of the Earth.</hi> If he had said only the <hi>Pretext</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> he might have Appeal'd, either to the <hi>Clamour</hi> of his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
or to <hi>his own Papers.</hi> For it is the <hi>Pretext</hi> that both Furnishes the
<hi>Fewel,</hi> and blows the <hi>Coal:</hi> while <hi>Religion</hi> lies <hi>burning</hi> in the <hi>Furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> Beside (<hi>says he</hi>) how can a Popish Prince, in attempting to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
his own Religion, believe he does his Subjects an Injustice, in that
very thing in which he does God Justice; or think he Injures Them, when
he does their Souls Right? <hi>Fol.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>This Pretense of <hi>doing God Justice,</hi> and <hi>the Souls of men Right;</hi> will
entitle a Prince, with a much more plausible Colour, and a better
Grace, to the breaking in upon the Territories and Subjects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes and States, under Countenance of the same Design: For
in that case, there's no Bar of an <hi>Oath</hi> upon him; whereas the


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65670:17"/>
same Violence upon his own Subjects renders him Guilty of a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what does he mean by an <hi>Attempt</hi> to establish his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
If it be by way of <hi>Argument;</hi> 'tis well. But if he makes
use of any compulsive act of Authority, contrary to his Oath, he
stands accountable to God for breach of Faith; and does no <hi>Justice</hi>
to <hi>God</hi> in it neither, nor <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of his <hi>People.</hi> For where's
the <hi>justice to God,</hi> in making use of his Name to an Imposture? and
in rendring him not only a <hi>Witness,</hi> but in some sort, a <hi>Party</hi> to a
<hi>Cheat?</hi> And where's the Right to his <hi>Peoples Souls,</hi> in forcing them
to the Profession of a Religion with their <hi>Lipps,</hi> which they abhor
in their <hi>Hearts?</hi> Or, in fine, how can a <hi>Popish</hi> Prince so much as
pretend, either to the one, or the other, against so clear a Light,
both of Scripture and Nature? In short, either he is indispensably
bound to do the thing, or at liberty whether he will do it or no:
If the former, his Oath must be either a <hi>Nullity</hi> or a <hi>Fraud;</hi> and
if the other, his antecedent Obligation has determin'd that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>[But Religious Phrenzy</hi> (says he, <hi>Fol. 7.) leaves that eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication
behind it, that where it commits all the Cruelties in the World,
'tis never sober after to be sorry for't.]</hi> How truly, and how severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is this said? Witness the impenitent Ends and Courses of all the
<hi>Kings Murtherers,</hi> both Dead and Living. And now again <hi>[Thus</hi>
(says he) <hi>Whilst a</hi> Popish King <hi>sets his whole Kingdom in a Combust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;
how little does he think he plays a Second</hi> Nero? <hi>Good Conscienti-Man,

and Thanksgivings, for the Ruine of their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> the <hi>Holy
Church,</hi> and <hi>Three Kingdoms?</hi> Nay, and the florid humour goes
on with him still. <hi>[Thus</hi> (says he) <hi>with an Arbitrary, unbounded

impossible for</hi> a Popish Successor <hi>to introduce</hi> Popery into <hi>England.</hi>
That the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> had such a design; &amp; that the <hi>whole Party</hi> believ'd
it <hi>practicable,</hi> he evinces from the Plot; and the prospect
of a presumptive Popish Heir, render'd them more confident of
succeeding in it, <hi>fol.</hi> 7. and 8. And yet four or five Lines further,
he represents the difficulties of restoring Popery into <hi>England</hi> to
be almost insuperable: and so with just reflections upon the <hi>Paris,</hi>
and <hi>Irish Massacres;</hi> Villanies of <hi>Gun-powder Treasons, Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiens,</hi>
and <hi>Plots</hi> against <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> He finishes that
Paragraph.</p>
               <p>I shall easily agree here to all the Ill that he says of the Seditious
and pragmatical Papists, without disputing one syllable of it.
And yet I think it very well worth our care, to distinguish betwixt
zeal and clamour; and not over-hastily to give credit to That
Sort of People, whose method it is; first, to make Papists odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and then to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> Popish. And this
is not said neither to divert any man from a reasonable apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the other danger. There never was a greater noise
of Popery, than in the Prologue to the misfortunes of the late
King. And what was the <hi>Ground,</hi> or what the <hi>Issue</hi> of it? There
was a Conspiracy to undermine the Government, and no way but
that to put the People out of their Wits, and out of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
together; and the Project succeeded, to the actual subversion


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65670:18"/>
of the Government. And when the Zelots had possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the Quarry, they shar'd both publick and private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
among themselves, and fell afterward to the cutting of
one another's Throats, for the Booty; without one word more of
Popery. In Brief, to joyn in an Out-cry against <hi>Papists,</hi> with
those that Reckon <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be <hi>Popery,</hi> is to assist our Enemies
toward the putting on of our own Shackles. And it is gone so
far too, that the Libellers, and their Dictators range them hand
in hand already; and you shall seldom see a Blow made at the
Pope, without a Lick at the Bishops. But the Project begins now
to open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> Let us now rightly consider how far the first Foundations of
<hi>Popery (vix. Arbitrary Power</hi>) may be laid in <hi>England.</hi> First,
then, if a <hi>Papist</hi> Reign; the Judges, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace,
and all the Judiciary Officers are of the King's Creation: and as such,
how far may the influence of Preferment; on baser Constitutions, cull'd
out for his purpose, prevail even to deprave the very Throne of Justice
her self; and make our Judges use even our Protestant Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to open the first Gate to Slavery.</p>
               <p>We are just now upon a <hi>Preliminary</hi> to the <hi>Nineteen Old Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
over again. For fear of an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> the King was
not to be trusted with the Choice of his own Officers. But no
though taken for the securing of the Government from Popular
Tumults and Insurrections; in case of lodging that trust in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand. Beside the putting of the King into an incapacity of
providing for the justice, and security of the Government. But
he is so far however in the right; that <hi>the perverting of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
may endanger the State.</hi> And for that consideration, it is a Trust
not to be parted with, lest it should once more be re-apply'd to
the destruction of the King and People, as it was before. It is a
certain Truth, that a Prince, by the abuse of his Power may prove
a Tyrant. But it is as certain again, that there is not any form,
or temperament of Sovereignty imaginable, that is not lyable to
the same possibility. For Tyranny it self, is only the straining of
the Essential and necessary powers of Government beyond their
pitch. We have experimented the worst effects of Usurpation,
and Corruption; and of turning the Equity of the Law against
the Letter of it; nay of setting up the Laws themselves against


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65670:19"/>
the very authority that made them. And all this would never
have done the work neither, if the faction had not supply'd the
want of Laws for their purpose in some cases, and superseded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were against them, by an Arbitrary Device of <hi>Votes,</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances.</hi> So that the hazard is nothing so great as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it, in the hand of a Prince, for want of that power of <hi>Enacting</hi>
and <hi>Repealing,</hi> which the Faction possessed themselves of by an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation.
<hi>But alas!</hi> (says he, Pag. 8.) <hi>The Laws in corrupted
Iudges hands have been too often used as barbarously as the Guests of</hi>
Procrustes, <hi>who had a Bed for all Travellers; but then he either cut
them shorter, or stretch'd them longer, to fit them to it,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this very charitably done now; to imagine the worst
things that either ever were or can be done; Of a Prince, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
my Author's supposition) whose Empire, Safety; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
and the wel-fare of whose People, are all dependent
upon his good behaviour, and justice? So that he ventures his All
on the one side, to get nothing on the other, Here is the fansie
of <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>uncertain difficulties,</hi> oppo'sd to our <hi>present security</hi> and
<hi>well-being!</hi> and after a Capital Sentence, pronounced with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of Law, upon an Imperial Prince, as a <hi>Traytor to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
of the People;</hi> We are now opening the way to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Prince to the Scaffold. For that's the Scope of several Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
Libels, both printed and written, that have at present,
their free course without controll? These are the Incendiaries
I speak of, and no other. [Well (says he again) <hi>but if the publick
Ministers of Justice betray the Liberty of the Subject; The Subject
may Petition for a Parliament to punish 'em for't. But what if he
will neither hear one, nor call the other? who shall compel him?]</hi> This
is a very artificial way of getting a shoot at the King through
the Duke; and to intimate the Exercise of an Arbitrary Power,
by this manner of supposing it. It was by these very steps of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
evil Councellours; crying out for justice against them; and
for a Parliament to punish them; that the Faction mounted the
Government, and strip'd his Majesty; first of his <hi>Friends;</hi> then of
his <hi>Revenue;</hi> next of his <hi>Liberty;</hi> and lastly of his <hi>Life,</hi> and all this
was actually done, for fear of no body knew what. <hi>Ther's no doubt</hi>
(says the Character) <hi>but hee'l find sufficient assistance from the</hi> Pope,
English Papists, <hi>and</hi> Foreign Princes; <hi>beside the Revenues of the
Crown. And then having but a prudent eye, and a tenacious hand to


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65670:19"/>
manage his Exchequer; we shall find hee'l never call that People he shall
never have need of,</hi> fol. 8.] He supposes here an assistance for a
Prince in possession of his Crown. But an <hi>assistance</hi> for <hi>what,</hi> unless
in case of a Rebellion? Or is it an assistance to enable him to
live without Parliaments? As if Foreign Princes would be at
that charge, to be never the better sor't. Or if he means a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Assistance toward the settling of him in the Possession of an
Absolute Power; his Interest undoubtedly will be much greater
in the supporting of him as an <hi>Heir,</hi> than in advancing him as a
<hi>Tyrant;</hi> beside, that for one <hi>English Man</hi> to serve him in such an
unwarrantable design, he will have an <hi>hundred,</hi> in case of any unjust
delusion, to stand by him in the defence or recovery of an nndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Right. This is only the quitting of one Pamphlet with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and to make use of that liberty my self which is allow'd
to others. <hi>[But all this while</hi> (says he) <hi>the Pope is not Absolute.
There wants a</hi> Standing Army <hi>to Crown the Work: And he shall
have it, for who shall hinder him? Nay, all his Commanders shall
be present qualifi'd, even by our Protestant Test, for the employment.]</hi>
We have not forgot the Time when <hi>one standing Army</hi> was Raised
for fear of <hi>another;</hi> and between Thirty and Forty Thousand Men
kept in Pay for a matter of thirteen or fourteen years together,
when the War was over, and not one Enemy left in the Field;
one King imprison'd, and another in Banishment; Taxes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd;
The People peel'd to the very Bones; and the Persons
and Estates of <hi>Free-born English Men</hi> subjected to the most Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Tyranny that ever was inflicted upon reasonable Creatures.
And what was the Ground and Foundation of this Calamity? The
Multitude were Buzz'd in the Head, that the King was Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclin'd, and govern'd by Jesuitical Councels; nothing but
Papists about him, and two or three Antichristian Bishops (a
Pack of Tories, and Tantvies) and a mighty noise there was
of <hi>German</hi> Horse, and the bringing of an Army up to Town to
awe the City, and the Parliament: and the very fear alone of
these shadows Transported them into the uttermost extremities of
rage and confusion. 'Tis true, there was no Plot afoot then, as
there is now; but they made sufficient shift, without it, to do
their own, and the Kingdoms business. You shall now see the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his Popish Successor's <hi>Standing-Army. He shall have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
Men <hi>of the Blade out of one half of the Gaming Houses in Town, to


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65670:20"/>
Officer twice as many Forces as he shall want: 'Tis true, they shall be
men of no Estates, nor Princples,</hi> &amp;c.] He should e'en have gone
on, when his hands were in, and quarter'd his new Leveys in <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
House,</hi> or <hi>Pauls,</hi> as in the days of his Forefathers. But is
not this better yet, than Spiriting away of Apprentices from their
Masters; decoying the poor Wenches out of their Bodkins and
Thimbles, and squeezing a Rebellion out of the Gospel? We
have seen an Army of pretended Saints, to the value of Twenty
or Thirty Thousand in a Body; and as many Religions, as Men:
every Article of the Creed call'd in question; and the Lord's
Prayer exploded as a stinting of the Spirit. This and a great
deal more, and worse, is true, to the very Letter. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>[And that this Army may be more quietly rais'd; how many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
pretences may be found,</hi> fol. 9.] Very right. As the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the King home to his Parliament; the delivering of him
out of the hands of Papists. The defence of his person, and
just rights, in the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion;
and all this, in the Stile of his Majesties most <hi>humble, and obedient
Subjects.</hi> [Perhaps (says he) <hi>the greatest and most importunate
preservation of the Kingdom shall call for't and then upon second thoughts,
instead of defeating some Foreign Enemy, they are opportunuely ready
to cut our Throats at home; if we do not submit, and give all that this
King shall ask, bid.]</hi> This ingenuous Author has directly Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
the true History of the Rise and Advance of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
into a Prophetical Computation of the Methods and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
which the World is to expect from a Popish King. Did
not they seize those very Arms that the King had provided for
the Relief of <hi>Ireland?</hi> and employ them against his Majesties
very Person at <hi>Edg-hil?</hi> And were not those very Troops that
were Raised, as they swore, for the defence of the City of

<hi>[Whenever</hi> (says he<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>) <hi>the People of</hi> England <hi>reflect on this Heir as

bury'd in his Apostacy from the Religion; and conseqnently, the</hi> Interest
<hi>of these Protestant Kingdoms, that all his Services are Cancell'd, and his
whole Masse of Glory corrupted, ibid.]</hi> I find some People of Opinion,
that this King in reversion is of the same Perswasion at this day; that
he was, when he acquir'd all those Glories: But let that pass, and
see now what's the sum of all this Flourish, but a labour'd Piece
of spiteful Art, to render the Brother of his Sacred Majesty as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
as the soulest Character, and Calumny can make him You
shall fee presently that This Venom against the Duke will terminate
in the King; and that instead of a Christian, and pious Zeal for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
the end of it is to inflame a desperate Distemper in the
<hi>State.</hi> It is, in short, a Character of the worst of men, adapted to
a suitable Religion: And expos'd to the World, in an uncharitable
account of things, which he cannot possibly foreknow. His next sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
is a Rhetorical Speculation; and not without Reflexions bold
enough, upon the unchangeable affection of his Majesty to his Royal
Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What (saith he) can the consequence of this unhappy Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
be; but that the very Souls and Loyalties of almost a whole
Kingdom are stagger'd at this fatal Conjunction; till I am afraid
there are too many, who in detestation of that one Gangreen'd
Branch of Royalty can scarce forbear (how undutifully soever)
to murmur and revile even at that Imperial Root that cherishes
it? <hi>Ibid.]</hi>
                  </q> What a strange Usurpation is this, not only upon
Majesty, but Human Nature; not to allow a Prince the freedom
of those affections which he can no more put off than his Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Being? But this is the Loyalty of the Old Stamp, that still
gives the Sign with a <hi>Hail Master,</hi> and a <hi>Kiss.</hi> But how comes
this Pamphlet to undertake for the sense of the whole Kingdom?
It is not that he finds them so much dis-affected, but he endeavours


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65670:21"/>
to make them so; by teaching and animating the Sedition that he
would be thought to fear. Nay, so far is he from being afraid of
the undutiful murmurs he seems to apprehend; that it is scarce
possible to do more toward the creating of them. And look now
how he grows upon His Majesty. [<q>Those very Knees (says he)
that but now, would have bow'd into their very Graves to serve
him, grow daily and hourly so far from bending (as they ought)
to a Crown'd Head, till they are almost as stubborn as their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
and Prayers have been ineffectual.</q>] What is this to say,
but in his way of intimation to insinuateâ€”what the Reader will
easily understand, though more than I am willing to express.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Char.</hi> Thus (says he) whilst a Popish Heirs extravagant Zeal
for <hi>Rome,</hi> makes him shake the very Throne that upholds him,
by working and encroaching on the affections of His Majesty, for
that Protection and Indulgence that gives birth and life to the
Heart-burnings of a Nation; what does he otherwise than in a
manner stabb his King, his Patron, and his Friend, in his tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
part, his Loyal Subjects hearts? which certainly is little less
than to play the more lingring sort of <hi>Parricide;</hi> a part so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unnatural, that even <hi>Salvages</hi> would blush at, yet this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ncorrigible remorseless Religion never shrinks at.</q> 
                  <hi>Folio</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>It is worth observing, that throughout this whole Character of
a <hi>Popish Successor,</hi> the Author of it lays more load upon the <hi>Heir</hi>
than upon the <hi>Religion;</hi> for he treats the Latter still in the terms
of a fair and generous enemy; but when he comes to the Other,
he shoots Poyson'd Arrows, <hi>Parricide, Gangreen'd,</hi> and the like,
without any respect either to Modesty or Honour. And what is
the whole Tract indeed, but an artificial Declamation, without so
much as one ill thing in't, bating the Perswasion, that is either li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a proof, or possible for him to know: And yet he does as
boldly pronounce upon things to come, as if he had the Book of
Fate in his Pocket. He charges the Successor here, with encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Kings Affections.</p>
               <p>It was a little while agoe, only the <hi>invincible tenderness</hi> of His
Majesty; but it is now turn'd into the <hi>working</hi> and <hi>insinuation</hi> of
his <hi>Brother:</hi> who <hi>stabbs the King</hi> (says the Character-Writer) <hi>in
the Hearts of his Loyal Subjects.</hi> But what if it should happen that
the King should be here stabbed thorough the Duke? It was at
this rate, that <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Strafford</hi> stabb'd the late King too. And


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65670:22"/>
what was the end on't; but that when the Kings Friends were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
under the Character of his Enemies; his Sacred Majesty
left naked and defenceless, those Hypocrites that had nothing in
their Mouths, but <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> those were the very Men
that stabb'd him themselves. This is the plain Historical Fact, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either amplifications or colours.</p>
               <p>But if you'll see a figure upon the Stretch; observe his next fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
where he makes the Duke a <hi>Parricide</hi> for killing the King in
the hearts of his People, by his applications and respects to His
Maiesty. And a <hi>Parricide</hi> (as he phrases it) so <hi>strangely unnatural</hi>
too, that even <hi>Pagans would blush at it.</hi> Is this Jest or Earnest now?
is it a pang of Duty and Conscience? Or is it not rather the Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy
of a high-flown thought? How comes it to be so flagitious
a crime, for one brother to love another, that Humane Nature
must be startled at it? Or that a Prince may not presume to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon the Duties of Christianity, Natural Affection, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Honour and Humanity, for fear of being call'd to account
for't in a Pamphlet? Well! but he tells us of the <hi>Heart-burnings</hi> of
the Nation at this conjunction; and for that reason, he expects, it
seems, that His Majesty shall relinquish his Brother. But what
if a Man should ask him, <hi>First,</hi> How he knows this to be the
sence of the Nation? <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Commission he has to tell the
World so? And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How he comes so positively to assert that
it is so; when it is clear, on the contrary that it is not so? For the
Peoples quarrel is to the <hi>Religion</hi> only, whereas the Authors is
principally to the <hi>Duke.</hi> But let us give him these <hi>Heart-burnings</hi>
for granted; and see how far a concession upon that point will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us at last. <hi>First,</hi> The Duke Marches off; and then the Kings
Ministers back after him; and then goes the <hi>Militia:</hi> and so in
course, the Bishops, the Revenue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Forty Eight:</hi> and all this, to gratify one longing after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till, in the conclusion, another Government turns up Trump.
<hi>Plato Redivivus</hi> has the whole Scheme of the Project ready cut and
dry'd. This was the very Method of our Ruine; and the name
of Religion led the way to't. A <hi>Covenanted,</hi> and, in his own
Words, an <hi>incorrigible, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now the Duke is out of the Kingdom? unless they would
him out of the World too? And that would not serve neither;
for so long as there is a Service-Book, a Surplice, or a Canonical
Habit in the Kingdom, and this Humour kept a foot, there shall

                  <q>The Nation in studying to prevent <hi>Tyranny</hi> grew jealous

they will give none at all, but rather triumph in His Majesty's great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
wants, even when his glory, nay possibly when his nearest safety
calls for their assistance.</q> 
                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 11. This way of saying that they
<hi>will</hi> not give Money, (which is more yet than he knows) carries the
force of an Advice that they <hi>should</hi> not; which is the thing that
this passage manifestly intends and designs. So that is the rest of
the Nation were of his mind, the <hi>French</hi> King might have this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for the asking; for both King and People upon these terms are
manifestly abandon'd as a sacrifice to this jealousie.</p>
               <p>Toward the bottom of the same page he brings in a Deliberation
to this effect: This <hi>Popish Prince</hi> cannot either help his Persuaasion
or relinquish it; nor is it a thing to be exacted from him that he
should. The Grievances of the Kingdom may be his unhappiness
and not his fault; for he is onely passive, and lives to himself, without
meddling to encourage or favour Popery in the least. <hi>But how does
it follow</hi> (says he <hi>Fol. 12.) that if we do not plainly see him act, that
he does not act.</hi> But how does it follow on the other side, say I, that
he does act if no body can prove it? It is the rule of Christian
Charity in doubtful cases ever to <hi>judge the best,</hi> but the Author of
this <hi>Character</hi> does not think fit to walk by this rule; for first he
casts with himself <hi>what is the worst that can happen,</hi> and then he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
the far-fetch'd possibility of that worst of Events into a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
that certainly that thing shall come to pass. And then he
considers how mean and wicked it is possible for Flesh and Bloud to
be, and those Vices and Imperfections jumbled together are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients

For first, though there was <hi>Theft, Murther,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

of their blasphemous <hi>Bands</hi> and <hi>Associations;</hi> so horrid
the Forms of their Calling the <hi>Searcher of all hearts; with hands
lifted up to the most high God, &amp;c.</hi> to witness the joyning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a <hi>holy Covenant unto the Lord;</hi> (which <hi>holy Covenant</hi> was
yet in the very first conception and intent of it, a premeditate
Complottery to destroy That in <hi>Effect,</hi> which in <hi>Terms</hi> they swore
to defend) All other sins (I say) were as nothing, in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
against this <hi>Catilinary,</hi> and bloudy Sacrament. And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
was the Reprobated Impenitence that follow'd upon it,
as if the Devil himself had come in, to the Signing and Sealing

of weakness, and surprise; (though I my self was none of the

of them a true sence of their mistake; but for those that design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,

am at a loss, even according to the largest allowances of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

in the very Frame, and wording of it; the counterfeiting
of Gods Authority for Sacrilege, and Rebellion in pursuance of

And now to finish the Parallel betwixt our <hi>Dissenting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
and his <hi>Jesuitcal:</hi> We have our <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> too, that vent
their Dreams and Vapours for Oracles. But to shorten the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>Bayli'es Disswasive</hi> will abundantly satisfie the Reader upon
this Subject.</p>
               <p>He passes from hence to a reply upon a supposition, [that such
Laws may be made before-hand, as will make it impossible for a
Popish King to set up Popery in <hi>England]</hi> But that (<hi>says he</hi>)
would be like <hi>hedging in the Cuckow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for who shall call this King
to question for breaking these Laws, if he has the power and will to do
it?</hi> This Question (<hi>fol.</hi> 13.) might serve for a piece of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a Contradiction he puts upon himself, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. which we
shall handle in course.</p>
               <p>If the Law has put it out of his power; there is no longer any
place for the supposal of a power; unless by Foreign Force, which
would presently improve a private Jealousy of Religion into the
publick Rupture of a National Quarrel, to the almost inevitable,
and irreparable Loss of his Reputation, his Friends, and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
together<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Now the other way, in case of his being injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excluded, it would be forty times more easy for Him to recover
his Pretensions from abroad, by a Foreign Assistance, in concurrence
with such an <hi>English</hi> Interest, as a generons Compassion to his Wrong,
a Respect for his Person, and the Justice of his Title would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
create him, than to erect an absolute Power against the Wills
and Hearts of his People: and contrary to all the measures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Prudence. And to do all this too, while he might live and
reign easily and comfortably to himself and his Subjects, within the
limits of a Legal Administration.</p>
               <p>And if he can never expect to gain this point, by calling in Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illaries
from beyond the Seas: much less will he be able to do it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bottom of his own Interest, and within himself: For there
must go a great many more hands than his own to such a work. And
to say that he may do it, by his Officers or Ministers, by the force
of Gratifications, Pensions, or the Promises and Hopes of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Advantage: That Objection may be easily obviated: For
it is a thing of clear and easy prospect: the Forming of such a Scheme
of Laws for securing the Bounds of the Government, as no man that


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65670:25"/>
has either a Neck, or a Fortune to lose, will dare to violate.</p>
               <p>But the bare <hi>Power,</hi> if he had it, would signify nothing neither:
unless the <hi>VVill</hi> as he says goes along with it. Now if he may <hi>WILL</hi>
he may <hi>NILL</hi> too: So that he is left at Liberty to make his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either of the One, or of the Other, which has, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
discharg'd him of the pretended Impulse of Religion, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
the Exception from the Papist to the Person: Founding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
upon a pretended Foresight of Tyranny and double Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in That Princes Character? which being a thing that is only to
be seen with His Spectacles, and a Prognostick Peculiar to His way
of Calculation, wee'l go to the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I will not deny (<hi>says he ibid.</hi>) but a Popish King may be totally
restrein'd from all Power of Introducing Popery, by the Force of
such Laws as may be made to tye up his hands: but then they must be
such as must ruine his Prerogative, and put the Executive Power of
the Laws into the hands of the People.]</q> This shift does not at all
either weaken, or avoid my Assertion, for the Kings hands are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ty'd, in holding the hands of his Ministers: And This may
be done (so far as is necessary for This purpose) without any Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
to his Royal Dignity. If the transferring of the Executive
Power to the People, that is to say Deposing of him, would do the
Job, the Character will shew us by and by, how That may be done,
without need of New Laws, and in spite of Old Ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what Monarch (<hi>says he</hi>) will be so unnatural to his bloud: So
ill a Defender, and so weak a Champion for the Royal Dignity he
wears, as to sign and ratify such Laws as shall entail That Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
and that Servility on a Crown as shall render the Imperial
Majesty of <hi>England</hi> but a <hi>Pageant,</hi> a meer Puppet upon a wire?]</q>
He does well to presume that a Prince will not Unking himself: but
he would do better yet to keep himself clear from such Propositions
and Principles as lead to that D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at the Crown, in a Papist, falls, upon the Rebound, on the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in a Protestant. (<q>But (says he, <hi>ib.</hi>) If no King will assent
to make Laws to do it this way, and no Laws can do it t'other, all
Laws against Popery, in case of a Popish Successor, are as I told
you before, but building the Hedge, <hi>&amp;c</hi>]</q> This Author seems to

                  </gap> Cramping the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:
For he himself will shew us by and by how to do that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Law, which he despairs of ever seeing done by one. If he had


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65670:25"/>
thought of what the King has lately parted with out of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
for the begeting of a Plenary Trust and Confidence in his
People, he would not have despair'd of any Condescension from
his Majesty, for the securing of his Subjects in their Properties and
Religion, after so much more done for them already than that, which
is here propounded, amounts to. He tells us (<hi>fol.</hi> 14.) of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

and he speaks too in the Stile of Authority. <hi>Let them stand upon

well have said, <hi>Let them stand to their Arms:</hi> and his expression (of
<hi>all expedients</hi>) expounds it so, even allowing him to be his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;
for the business is to keep out Popery and Tyranny.
And he makes it one expedient, (<hi>fol.</hi> 2.) and an essential one
too, to act the <hi>Offensive</hi> part as well as the <hi>Defensive;</hi> 
                  <q>Provided

<hi>TOLD,</hi> is a most Emphatical Mockery: and then, provided that
the Succession be secur'd, all other expedients are pronounced
lawful. Methinks he might have thought of a <hi>Proviso</hi> too for the
securing of the Kings Honour, Dignity, Person, Government, and
the Peace of his Dominions: which are, at the rate of his latitude
of allowance, all of them equally concerned in the danger with the

Rocks, and <hi>hunt</hi> and <hi>growl'd</hi> and <hi>tear one another to pieces like Beasts.</hi>
But we'll discourse the matter a little.</p>
               <p>Well! The <hi>English</hi> are certainly the Freest and the Happiest
People upon the Face of the Earth. <hi>Ay; but we shall be all</hi> Slaves
<hi>e're't be long.</hi> When's that? <hi>When the</hi> Popish Heir <hi>comes to the
Crown.</hi> Ay; but when's that again? <hi>When the King is dead.</hi> Well,
but when is the King to Dy? <hi>Nay, I cannot tell that.</hi> How long has
the <hi>Popish Heir</hi> to live? <hi>I cannot tell that neither.</hi> Will the Queen
have any Children? <hi>Nor that neither.</hi> How long will the Queen
live? <hi>How should I know that?</hi> Will the King survive her or not?
<hi>I cannot tell.</hi> Will he Marry again if he does? <hi>I cannot tell that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Will he have any Children if he Marrys again? <hi>Who knows?</hi>
But what if the Heir should not live to come to the Crown? <hi>but it
may be he may though.</hi> And it may be he may not. <hi>Ay, but I PHANSY
that he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well! But suppose he should come to the Crown. What then?
<hi>Why then he will set up</hi> Popery <hi>and</hi> Tyranny. Not whether he can
or no. <hi>Why, how did Queen</hi> Mary? She had the odds on her side;
for the <hi>Papists</hi> were then, in a manner, as the <hi>Protestants</hi> are now.
And yet, coming in betwixt two <hi>Protestants, Popery,</hi> ye see, went
off as it came on. <hi>But still there was a Persecution.</hi> 'Tis true, there
was; but all Princes are not alike. Q. <hi>Mary</hi> Persecuted the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;
Henry</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> did <hi>not</hi> so. And it is as good an
inference from the instance of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. that the <hi>Popish Heir</hi> will
<hi>not</hi> be a Persecutor, as from that of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> that he <hi>will. But
where the Popes Authority intervenes, both King and People are bound
to obey.</hi> And yet you see that for all the Power of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65670:27"/>
                  <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Holy League</hi> to boot, the People of <hi>France,</hi> though
<hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> would not submit to the Dis-possessing of a
<hi>Protestant Successor;</hi> neither did that generous Prince, upon the
Reconciling of himself afterward to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> exercise
any one act of Tyranny over his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects; which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
said upon this point. <hi>Well, but I PHANSY it will be</hi> Popery
<hi>and</hi> Tyranny <hi>yet, for all this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well! but to go a little further with you, now suppose it should
come to a <hi>down right Persecution? Aye, but we must stand upon our
Guards to prevent it.</hi> That would be more than ever the Primitive
<hi>Christians</hi> did under the <hi>Ten Persecutions:</hi> And we have not only
their <hi>Example,</hi> but their Express <hi>Doctrine</hi> against it. And we are

here's only <hi>Phansy</hi> set up in opposition to <hi>Religion, Reason</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi>
And That's enough in all Conscience too: For there
needs no more then the Flames of a distemper'd Spleen to cause an

What are <hi>Jealousies</hi> but <hi>Phansies?</hi> What <hi>Original</hi> had they? <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi>

               <p>Now what is there in the <hi>future,</hi> to weight against the <hi>Life</hi> of

change the Government; but <hi>probably not;</hi> in respect of the very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
of Inclining to such a Violation of his <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Word:</hi>

When I say a <hi>Certainty,</hi> I mean only a Natural Train of Events
in the Application of <hi>Actives</hi> to <hi>Passives;</hi> which, in a high degree

So that we are in Forty times a greater danger of a <hi>Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
at <hi>hand,</hi> than of a <hi>Popish Successor</hi> at a <hi>Distance.</hi> As to the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of a <hi>greater</hi> danger, and a <hi>Less,</hi> we'l e'en take the matter as
they suppose it. A King upon the Throne, that's <hi>Principled</hi> for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary

<hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Protestant Laws,</hi> that if he had never so great a mind
to't, there is not a Subject in his Dominions that would dare to
serve him in his Design. But, on the other hand, there's <hi>no King
at all,</hi> no <hi>Church,</hi> no <hi>Law,</hi> no <hi>Government,</hi> no <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> no

that the <hi>Phansy</hi> comes to no more in Effect, than <hi>if the sky fall

               </p>
               <p>But once again yet. Here's a <hi>Protestant</hi> Prince expos'd for fear
of a <hi>Popish</hi> one. <hi>Is</hi> the <hi>Chimera</hi> of a <hi>future danger</hi> of more value
to us then the <hi>Conscience</hi> of an incumbant and indispensable Duty?
shall we take pet at God Almighties providence; and not go to
Heaven at all, unless we may go our own way. Shall we Level a
shot at the Duke, at a distance; if there be no coming at him but
through the Heart of our Sovereign? shall we actually break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Protestant profession, which stands or falls with the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> because the Author of the Character phansies the hazard
of a Popish Religion in the Moon; and by the unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of a Misgovernment under this apprehension, draws the
very plague upon us that we pretend to fear: While we thus go on,
exposing both our Temporal and Eternal peace for shadows,.</p>
               <p>The Writer of the Character had most Rhetorically amplifi'd, in
his Calculations upon his Popish Successor; but so Oversiz'd the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
that when ever the people come to their wits again, they will
look upon the story of <hi>Garagantua,</hi> as not much the less Credible of
the Two: For his dangers are all out of Ken; his Thunder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him in the Fable, They are tumbling into a Precipice as deep as Hell,
and take no notice of it. Here is a danger suggested; and such a
means intimated for the prevention of it, as makes the Remedy
worse than the Disease; for the very Expedient undermines the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
But first, a word of the dangers on the other side.</p>
               <p>There are several ways started for the disappointing of this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
One by <hi>Attainder,</hi> upon 23. &amp; 13. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Another, by a
<hi>Bill</hi> in Parliament for <hi>diverting</hi> the <hi>Succession.</hi> And some of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers
fall down right upon a Third Proposal of the peoples preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Succession, though without or against Law. And Fourthly,
either to expel the Successour, or to keep him out, in case of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivorship.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>first,</hi> of these ways <hi>I</hi> shall speak, when the point comes
on. As to the <hi>second,</hi> which is matter of <hi>Parliamentary Cognizance,</hi>
I reckon it my duty to acquiesce in the Legal Issue of their Debates;
as an Authority to which I have ever paid a Duty, and a Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This only I shall take the freedom to say, that there is a vast
difference betwixt <hi>their Deliberations</hi> that purely regard the prospect
and interest of both Church and State, in what concerns the Popish
and Protestant Religion; and the passionate excursions of private
men on the wrong side of the Parliament Door<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, that thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Controversie rather out of envy to the Person and
fame of the Successour, than to promote the more important cause
of Religion; (like men that crow'd into a Church for company to
pick a pocket) and this to, without any respect to the King himself,
in the person of his Brother; or to the measures of duty to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Now as to the two last ways of proposal, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
for <hi>prevention</hi> or <hi>exclusion;</hi> I have this to say;</p>
               <p>If there be danger from a popish Successour, during his expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>within</hi> the Kingdom; the danger is infinitely greater, if he
be driven out of it. For, first, (as supposing it to be the peoples
Act) There must be an illegal and popular violence to accomplish
it; and there's the peace of the Government broken already. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
that the Authours of that Violence can never be secure, but by
following it with more and greater. And this comes presently to
be a natural transition from a murmur against the Successour, to
a Tumult in the State: In which Case, the King has only this Choice


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65670:29"/>
before him, either to part with every thing for the asking, or to
stand the shock or a Rebellion. Now take it either way; here's
much a greater mischief incurr'd, than that we feared; beside, a
<hi>Sanding-Army, Taxes,</hi> and <hi>Oaths</hi> that follow in course; and a new
Set of <hi>Liberty-keepers,</hi> and <hi>Major-Generals</hi> to preserve the peace. I
speak this in the contemplation of a violence without a lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to back it; which is the thing that some people have in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
               <p>This is the Scene of things at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> we shall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
see the Successours Interest and Reputation, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>creasing daily,
in regard of his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> his <hi>Title,</hi> and his <hi>Religion:</hi> having <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to friend, over and above: and probably, (as it is at present)
the place of his Residence. But these are, as yet, all dormant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and not to be employ'd, till either his duty to his Majesty, or
Justice to his own pretensions shall require their Aid.</p>
               <p>Take it the other way now: In the case of a <hi>Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sh King,</hi> who
is either <hi>kept out</hi> (as I said before) or <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>iven out</hi> from the exercise
of his right, by the tumultuary licence of the Rabble; an Oath of
<hi>Abjuration</hi> in case of any fair opportunity for him to assert his Claim
with his Sword in his hand, will be so far from engaging any man
against him, that yielded contrary to his conscience to swallow it
for the saving of his stake, that he will find no firmer Friends to his
Cause and Interest, than those men that are stimulated both by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Revenge to the execution of their Duties. For there is no
hatred so fell and deadly, as that which has for the object of it the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
or Contrivers of our damnation; and the hazard is so much
the greater, in regard of the difficulty to discover either the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or the strength of their Enemies. And whether that King
makes any attempt or no, the Nation must be at the charge, at least
of a <hi>defensive war,</hi> and of Impositions to maintain it. And this will
be the inconvenience even in the bare prospect of the state of the
Nation without a blow striking. But from <hi>Scotland</hi> at least, if not
from <hi>Ireland</hi> too, they must expect to be ply'd with continual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms,
till the insupportable expence of guarding the Borders and
the Coasts; shall make them as sick of their new Patriots as ever
they were of their old ones; and force them at last (or perhaps
sooner than they are aware) to render themselves and their Spoil to
their irresistible conjunction of so many Powers, as will be then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
to their destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65670:29"/>
And then comes in the <hi>Popery in earnest,</hi> that was dreaded but <hi>in
fancy</hi> before. When this new King shall by the proper act and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of a seduc'd and unforeseeing people, be deliver'd from the
Fetters of both Honour and Laws; who brings in Popery then, but
they that discharg'd him from those sacred Bonds by the solly and
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>umacy of their own inconsiderate Undertakings? Compare
now the dangers of a Popish King bounded by Protestant Laws, and
ruling over a Protestant People, where he may be as happy as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown, and the Affections of his Subjects, can make him.
Compare (I say) a Popish King under these gracious and obliging
Circumstances, in the quiet administration of his Government, with
a Prince that is forc'd to make his way with his Sword for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his own, and is not onely prick'd on by the impulses of
justice and vengeance, but animated by the Pope himself, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
by indignation to take the utmost advantage of that foolish
forfeiture, (the people themselves having cancell'd the Bonds of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Obedience.) Let any man compare these two cases, and
then speak his opinion.</p>
               <p>There is one p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>int yet behind, that goes further (I think) than
any of the rest. If it be reasonable to believe (as we are often
told, and no Mortal can deny it) that our Religion is an Eye sore to
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that this Island would make a considerable
addition to our victorious Neighbours late Conquests; what way in
the world could be propounded more to the advantage, both of the
Crown of <hi>France</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the bringing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the issue here in question, when in the powerful and liberal
Assistances to this supposed King for the regaining of his own, the
one and the other are but doing of their own business? This Prince
in the mean while being led to the one by inclination, and overborn
upon the other by Necessity.</p>
               <p>Here's enough said to lay open the miserable effects of popular
motions in matters of this high importance; and so I shall pass for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
submitting what I have said upon this occasion to the judgment
and determination of my Superiours. The remainder of the last
Paragraph above cited is fully answered already, bate onely the Clause
that I am now about to proceed upon.</p>
               <p>Char. <q>
                     <hi>Whilest we are thus enslaved (says he) by a medly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
betwixt Tyranny and Usurpation, by establishing a</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65670:30"/>
on a Throne, we are so far from preserving the Crown, that is, the
Imperial Dignity in a right Line of Succession, that we do not preserve
it at all; but on the contrary, extirpate and destroy it, whilst by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
a <hi>Papist,</hi> we totally Subvert and Depose the very Monarchy it
self. And can it be the Duty of either <hi>Englishmen</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> to
have that Zeal for a <hi>Corrupted, Leprous Branch of Royalty,</hi> that
we must ruine both Religion, Government and Majesty it self to support
him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is a strange way this of shewing a Mans Honour for his Prince,
by blasting the very Bloud of his Brother; or of expressing his love
to Monarchy, by treating Majesty, tho but in reversion, at so course
a rate. But it is upon a Principle that may be supported by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periousness
and Heat; in regard that it will not bear the Test of
a modest Debate; and a <hi>corrupted, Leprous Branch of Royalty</hi> is the
dint of the Argument. But what does he mean to confound <hi>Civil
Power</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> thus, and impose upon the World a <hi>Paradox,</hi>
that for want of rightly dividing, endangers both?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Government</hi> is matter of Publique and External Order; and a
Divine Provision for the Peace, Comfort and Security of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
wherein all the several parts are bound up in one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to attend the Interest and Conservation of the whole. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Religion</hi> is the business of every individual apart, and only so far
cognizable in a State, as it affects the Civil Power. What can
be more gross than to talk of <hi>fighting for Religion?</hi> or to pretend to
the maintaining of that by Arms, that is not liable to Violence?
Did ever any Man hear of a <hi>Religion</hi> that was either <hi>shot</hi> or <hi>cut?</hi>
Nor can there be any Confederacy or Association purely upon the
score of <hi>Religion,</hi> for how shall People agree to defend they know
not what? which is the very case when one Man undertakes for
the <hi>Religion</hi> of another. If our Religion be assaulted by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we may assert it by Redargution: But when the Opposition
advances into any over act, the case is no longer Religion, but
Political Safety. Beside that Government is Gods Ordinance for
the common benefit of Human Society, and of <hi>Pagans,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Christians,</hi> without any regard to this or that Religion: for <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Politique</hi> have no <hi>Consciences;</hi> but every <hi>particular</hi> indeed, stands
or falls to his own Master.</p>
               <p>

I cannot but observe through what degrees the <hi>Character</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
the <hi>Popish</hi> Successor. <hi>First,</hi> From the possibility of a good
Man, and then from bad to worse; till he has made him (<hi>fol.</hi> 14.)
a <hi>Corrupted, Leprous Branch of Royalty;</hi> and, at next word, a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Traitor, upon the Statutes of 23 and 13 of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and
another of <hi>Hen. 8. (Fol.</hi> 15.)</p>
               <p>This matter being, (as I am informed) at present <hi>coram Judice,</hi>
I shall say no more to it than this, that there are two <hi>Provisoes</hi> in the
5th of the Queen, that make the Case somewhat different from
what he has stated it: As for Instance:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provided alway, that forasmuch as the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
is otherwise sufficiently assured of the Faith and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of the Temporal Lords of Her High Court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
Therefore this Act, nor any thing therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
shall not extend to compel any Temporal Person, of
or above the degree of a Baron of this Realm, to take or
pronounce the Oath abovesaid,</hi> (viz. of Supremacy) <hi>nor to
incur any Penalty, limited by this Act for not taking or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
the same,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Provided also, that if any Peer of this Realm shall
hereafter offend contrary to this Act, or any Branch or
Article thereof, that, in that and all such Case and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they shall be try'd by their PÃ©ers, in such manner and
form as in other Cases of Treasons they have used to be
Tryed, and by no other means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be well if every Man that presses, with this un-prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
rigour, upon the Person here in question, would lay his
hand upon his heart, and say, <hi>if the King has pardoned me Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
Thousand times more than this comes to, with what Reason or Conscience
can I importune His Majesty thus bitterly against His Brother?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all these Clamours about a <hi>Popish</hi> Successor, I would fain
know how it is possible for any Man to be other than a <hi>Papist,</hi> in our
present condition of Affairs. A <hi>Church-of England-Man</hi> is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi>
to the Dissenters; a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and an <hi>Independent</hi> so one to
another; a <hi>Quaker</hi> to both; and among the <hi>Eight Score</hi> several
Sects of <hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Schismatiques</hi> that <hi>Paget</hi> and others, have


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65670:31"/>
reckoned up since <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> came in Fashion; there
are just so many sorts of <hi>Papists</hi> among them, in the Opinion of one
<hi>Sect</hi> or another.</p>
               <p>He has a Paragraph (<hi>fol.</hi> 15.) where, under the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he expounds himself to mean their <hi>Representatives;</hi> which is
a point I am not to touch upon: Only, I must confess, he has drawn
the Arrow to the Head, in one expression in it. <q>Why should not
<hi>they</hi> (saith he) <hi>the House of Commons</hi>) be as active and vigorous
for their own <hi>Royal Inheritance,</hi> and Sacred <hi>Succession of Power,</hi> as
a <hi>King</hi> for <hi>His.</hi>
                  </q> What he means by this <hi>Royal inheritance,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Succession of Power,</hi> I shall remit to the Consideration of the
Learned. (<hi>Bradshaw</hi> indeed pass'd a Sentence upon the <hi>Late King,</hi>
as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the <hi>ROYALTY</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi>) But the strongest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for himself that I find in the whole Book, is five or six Lines
lower. <q>If ever a <hi>Papist</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>unts this Throne (says he) then all
their Murmurs, their Petitions, Protesting and Associating-Votes
will be remembered to the purpose.</q> Now what can be a greater
indignity to the Justice and Resolution of that Illustrious Body,
than to imagine that so narrow a thought could any way influence
the Candour and Solemnity of their Debates?</p>
               <p>He spends his <hi>sixteenth Page</hi> upon Instances out of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. <hi>to
prove the Succession of the</hi> English <hi>Crown to be wholly subjected to the
Disposal, Determinations and Limitations of Parliament.</hi> How far
his Assertion is right or wrong, I shall not concern my self. But
however, as he has ordered the matter, it makes nothing at all for
his purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Parliament (he says) 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.) settled the Crown upon
the Heirs of that Kings body by Queen <hi>Ann;</hi> and in the <hi>28th.</hi>
Repealed that Act, and Entailed the Succession upon the Heirs of
his body by Queen <hi>Jane; Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being declared <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate.</hi>
And in Case he Died without Issue, then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
empowered him by the same Act, to dispose of the Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by his own Letters Patents, or his Last Will. In the <hi>35th</hi>
Year of his Reign the Parliament granted the Succession to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi>
and for want of Heirs of his Body, to the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi>
and the Heirs of her body; and for want of such Heirs, to the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> under certain Limitations and Conditions contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in that Act.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65670:31"/>
From hence he infers, that a Parliament may order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Succession. But whether they may, or not; here's
little or nothing prov'd from these Citations. First, under
the ambiguity of the Word <hi>Parliament,</hi> he would have this
thought to be the single Act of the Lords and Commons, when
the Enacting Authority of it was solely in the King. And yet he says
expresly that <hi>Henry 8. was so far from submitting to Parliaments,
that he would never have complemented them with a power that was not
their due.</hi> If that power did belong to the Parliament, what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they the King's authority for the making of it good; or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
themselves of that power, by transferring it to the King, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Reversion, or Remainder of the Crown, by his Will,
or Letters, Patents, to such person as he pleas'd?</p>
               <p>Secondly, These Statutes do not so properly transfer a Right
as declare and notifie the persons; for the prevention of disputes,
and competitions; as appears by the Preamble to that of the 28th.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Wherefore, We your most humble and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in this present Parliament Assembled, calling to
Our Remembrance the great Divisions which in Times
past have been in this Realm; by reason of several Titles
pretended to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, which
some times, and for the most part ensued, by occasion of
ambiguity and doubts, then not so perfectly declared, but
that men might upon froward intents expound them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans sinister appetite and affection, and posterity of
the Lawful kings and Emperours of this Realm; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath ensued great effusion and destruction of Mans
Bloud, as well of a great number of the Nobles, as of
other the Subjects, and especially Inheritours in the same.
And the greatest occasion thereof hath been, because no
perfect and substantial provision by Law hath been made
within this Realm of it self; when doubts and questions
have been moved and proponed of the certainty and lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llty
of the Succession, and Posterity of the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Now, so far is the intent of this Act from diverting the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
that the express end of it was the setting of it right, by
the avoidance of a former Settlement upon the nullity of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65670:32"/>
And afterward, 26th of the same King, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. the Act
here before mentioned is called, <hi>The Act for the Establishment
of the Succession of the Heirs of the King's Highness in
the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> Now there's a great deal
of difference betwixt translating the Succession from the wrong to the
right, and the diverting of it from the right to the wrong.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this change and disposition of Settlement, tho it pass'd
all the formalities of Bill and Debate, yet the first spring of it was
from the certain knowledge of the Kings pleasure to have it so, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they durst never have ventur'd upon such a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Matter of Fact in this case is no proof of Right, and
especially a Fact accompanied with so many circumstances of Cross-Capers
and Contradictions, as the pronouncing of the same persons
to be both <hi>illegitimate</hi> and <hi>legitimate, &amp;c.</hi> And a man cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
without a scandal to that grave and wise Assembly, that the
levity of those Counsels, and that humour of Swearing and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terswearing,
could be any other than the <hi>caprice</hi> of their new Head
and Governour.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, with reverence to the Utility and Constitution of good
and wholesom Laws, it is not presently to cite a Statute and say,
<hi>There's a Precedent;</hi> for those Laws that are repugnant to the light
of Nature and common Right, are N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>llities in themselves.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he brings instances here to prove, that a Parliament may
divert the Succession; but he shews withall, that there can be no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
even in that exclusion, in shewing that what one Parliament
does, another may undo. So that we are now upon equal terms of
security or hazard, either in the <hi>exclusion</hi> of the Successor, or in
the <hi>restraining</hi> of him. For if he be tied up by one Parliament, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
may set him at liberty; and if he be excluded by one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
another may take him in again. But he that shapes his own
Premises, may cut out what Conclusions he pleases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Char.</hi> 
                  <q>If then (says he, which no man in his right wits can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
our Religion, Lives. and Liberties, are onely held by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Tenure;</hi> and the Majesty of <hi>Englfnd</hi> not onely by the force
of his Coronation Oath, but by all the Tyes whatever, ought to
be the Pillars and Bulwark of the <hi>Protestant Faith;</hi> and at the
same time granting, that we have a Popish Prince to inherit the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65670:32"/>
Crown of <hi>England;</hi> he ought certainly in all justice as little
to ascend this Throne, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ought to have kept his,
when the immediate Blast of Heaven had made him so uncapable
of Ruling as a King, that he was only a Companion fit for Brutes
and Savages. <hi>fol.</hi> 17.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that we hold the <hi>exercise</hi> of our Religion by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Tenure,</hi> with a respect to a <hi>political union:</hi> but every man
holds the <hi>Religion</hi> it self that he ventures his Soul upon; not on
the Tenure of Laws and Constitutions Humane, but on the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of the divine will and pleasure: Providence having
dealt so graciously with Mankind, that, albeit in our <hi>Bodies</hi> and
<hi>Estates,</hi> which are only corruptible, and temporary, we lye exposed
to Torments, Persecutions, Violence, and the Iniquities of
Times and Seasons; Our <hi>Nobler Part</hi> is yet exempt from the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
either of Men or Beasts; and our <hi>faith, hope</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi>
treasur'd up, where <hi>neither Rust nor Moth doth corrupt,</hi> and where
<hi>Thieves do not break through and steal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> we hold them by the Common
Tenure of Government; the Common Right of men bound up
in a Civil Society; and under the Protection of such and such
Laws and Provisions, for the Common Benefit and Security of the
Whole, and Every part: And all this, clearly abstracted from
this or that Religion. In the cases of Treasons, Felonies, Riots,
false Oaths, Forgeries, Scandals, and other Misdemeanours, that
endanger the Publick peace; I do not find that the Law puts any
Difference betwixt Criminals, because they are of several Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
The <hi>Protestant Tenure</hi> of the King's <hi>Judges</hi> signify'd no more
in the eye of the Law, than if they had been <hi>Powder-Plot Jesuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come now to his <hi>Protestant Tenure;</hi> and to close with him
upon it too. (But as a Supposal not to be supposed.) If he means
by this <hi>Protestant Tenure,</hi> the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> as Established by <hi>Law;</hi> and that it is by this Tenure,
that we hold our Religion, Lives and Libertiers; it will concern
us to support this Tenure; but in such manner yet, as the Law
directs: For to set up a Tenure <hi>without</hi> a Law, or to assert a <hi>Tenure
against</hi> a Law, will not be for the credit of our Authors Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
If he means the <hi>Dissenting Protestant Tenure;</hi> He removes
the Very Basis of all our Laws and sets up the Title of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiude
against that of the <hi>Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65670:33"/>
And further; this <hi>Protestant Tenure</hi> of his, cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
barely of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> (as in
Our Nine and Thirty Articles) for first, there are several points
of them that are opposed and rejected by the Men that value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon this Character; And Secondly, Our Laws fall not
shorter in any thing perhaps, of so great Importance, than in the
point of Competent Provisions for the Suppressing and Punishing
of Heretical, and Blasphemous Doctrines. So that this <hi>Protestant
Tenure</hi> must of Necessity have a Regard to the <hi>Vniformity</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
according to the Forms, Rights, and Ceremonies by the
Law in that case provided: And in this sence I must confess that
our Lives, Liberties, and the Religion of the Government (tho'
not directly, yet in a most Rational Consecution of dangerous
Probabilities) lye all at stake. Wherefore again and again I say<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
let us joyn with our Author in the maintaining of this <hi>Protestant
Tenure.</hi> For tho' the intent of it be only to intimate a Jelousy of
Popery to the multitude; we shall yet find it, upon Examination,
to have a Loyal Aspect toward the Government.</p>
               <p>Here is an <hi>Vniformity</hi> prescrib'd; which is neither a <hi>New</hi> thing
to us, nor an <hi>Vnnecessary.</hi> Not a <hi>New</hi> one; for it has descended
to us from the time of <hi>Edward the Sixth;</hi> and it was the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could find out, for the safety of her
Person, and Dominions: <hi>That Excellent Queen Elizabeth,</hi> (as our
Author says, fol. 17) <hi>Vnder whose long and gracious Reign,</hi> England
<hi>was so highly blessed.</hi> Nay, and so sacred is the Providence of <hi>Order,</hi>
that Notwithstanding all the fulminations of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the
Numbers, as well as the dangerous Practices, of the Papists, on
the one hand; and the Impetuous Clamours and Importunities of
dissenting Protestants on the other, Charging both her self and
her Ministers with Popish practices and designs. This steady Queen
did yet (I say) preserve her Princely dignity, and the Reputation
of her People, both at home and abroad<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and at the same time,
maintain her ground against two potent Factions; by standing
firm to the Rules, and Methods of her Ecclesiastical Discipline,
And it is Remarkable, that the state has still been more or less at
ease in measure, as That Discipline has been either upheld, or
Relaxed.</p>

               <p>But how comes it that we that wear <hi>Christ</hi> in our Foreheads should
carry <hi>Antichrist</hi> in our Hearts? and under the name of <hi>Christians</hi>
walk so contrary both to the Doctrine, and to the Example of our

pretended abomination of Popery to set it up; that is to say, upon
impulse of Religion to do in any sort whatsoever a manifest wrong.
Let the end be never so good, it must yet upon the score of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be warranted by lawful means, and with such a regard to
Prudence too, that the means we make use of toward a good end,
may not be imployed to a bad one. One man wishes a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

in the Government, another skrews himself in under the
same Pretence, but to destroy it.</p>
               <p>It would be endless and nauseous to farce up a Pamphlet with
Citations, in a case where the whole Story of the World is so full
of Precedents. How came it that <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 when he was suspected
to be more than half a <hi>Protestant,</hi> proceeded so quietly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Opposition,</hi> in Declaring and Limiting the <hi>Succession?</hi> and then
that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (his Daughter) being a profess'd <hi>Protestant</hi>
and the Major Party of the People <hi>Papists,</hi> came to the Crown,
without any considerable Objection to her Religion? We do not
find, notwithstanding the Branded Apostacy of <hi>Jeroboam, that
made</hi> Israel <hi>to Sin,</hi> that his People yet laid hold of any <hi>pretence</hi> to
Rebel against him. We do not read in the Story of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King
of <hi>Kent,</hi> upon his being Converted to <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>Angustin</hi> the
<hi>Monk,</hi> that his Subjects, though <hi>Pagans,</hi> ever took up Arms against
him for't. Nor that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Subjects of any of the <hi>Other Saxon
Kings</hi> in their <hi>Heptarchy, opposed</hi> their Sovereigns, for Change of
Religion; neither was there any Persecution on the King's Side,
for matter of Religion. <hi>Bonos principes</hi> (says <hi>Tacit. Hist. Lib. 4.)
Voto expetere debemus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We are to pray to God for Good Kings, but
to submit to them</hi> whatever <hi>they are.</hi> Tertullian (<hi>Apolog. 30.) Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus
nullius est hostis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Christian</hi> (says he) <hi>is no Mans Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
much less the</hi> Emperors: <hi>for knowing that he Governs by Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
he cannot but Love, Reverence, Honour and Wish him well,
with all that belong to him, and therefore we pay that Veneration to
him that belongs to him, as being</hi> next <hi>immediately</hi> under <hi>God; what
he has is from</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> God <hi>is only his Superiour,</hi> &amp;c. And so far
were the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> from <hi>opposing their Superiours,</hi> that they
would not allow so much as a dis-respectful word to be given
them. There was no turning of Princes in those days, a grazing
with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> among the <hi>Beasts;</hi> no calling of them <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green'd,</hi>
and <hi>Corrupted, Leprous Branches of Royalty.</hi> But the very
Apostles Canons provided against those rude indecencies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
not only upon his <hi>Popish</hi> Successor, but upon all the Crowned
Heads of <hi>Christendom</hi> of that Perswasion. <hi>Quisquis Imperatorem,</hi> &amp;c.
(says the Canon) <hi>Whosoever shall speak ill of the</hi> Emperor, <hi>or of the</hi>
Magistrate, <hi>let him be punsh'd. If a</hi> Clergy-Man, <hi>Depos'd; if a</hi> Lay-Man,
<hi>Excommunicated.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:65670:36"/>
But what needs this recourse to the Examples and Judgments
of Antiquity for the clearing of Christianity in a case where the
common Principles of Human Nature are sufficient to set us right?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is the violation of a <hi>Gospel-Precept,</hi> in <hi>doing evil that
good may come of it,</hi> As certainly the divesting of a Prince of his
right, in an unwarrantable way of doing it, is a very ill thing. I
speak all this while to <hi>the Character of a Popish Successor;</hi> which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
on the People, hand over head, to the <hi>end,</hi> without that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the <hi>Means,</hi> which the Cause, I think, does require: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, when a lawful Authority intervenes, the state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is quite another thing; for it is no longer <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>Policy</hi>
that will be the Subject then in consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The admittance of this Position does in a Complement
to Christianity, overthrow all Religion, and puts all Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a state of Hostility: for there are some <hi>particulars,</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of <hi>all Perswasions</hi> that do firmly believe themselves to be in the
Right. And then consequently, every divided Party is that to the
other which a <hi>Popish Successor</hi> is to the Author of the <hi>Character.</hi> And
at this rate Christians are in the worst condition of all Mortals, by
making it a point of Conscience to Enter worry one another. To
say nothing of the Scandal they bring upon the Gospel, by erecting
this Rigorous and Sanguinary Doctrine upon the Foundations of
Meekness, Charity and Peace.</p>
               <p>And this Position does not only confound the Harmony that
ought to be among the Disciples of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> but superinduces
an utter Subversion of the Fundamentals of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
For to say that a Prince of another Faith may be Deposed, or
Secluded for his Religion, does not only Authorize, but provoke a
Prince of another Perswasion to render the same measure to his
People; and it absolves both the One and the Other from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of that mutual Correspondence which is necessary betwixt
them for the conservation of the Community.</p>
               <p>Nor is it all, that the <hi>Maxim</hi> it self is pernicious, (which many
times is the ill hap of a fair intention;) but there is so gross a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi>
in the Conduct of this Character, that a Man must have a
great deal more Charity than appears in the Author of it, to allow
it so much as the possibility of a <hi>good meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65670:36"/>
Here's a Clamour advanc'd in the Name of the <hi>English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
against a <hi>Popish Successor.</hi> But upon what ground?
<hi>Because it is a Persecuting Religion.</hi> Well! and what Religion
is it in a Successor that would please them? <hi>The Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
But the Religion of the Church <hi>Protestants</hi> will not please
the <hi>DISSENTING PROTESTANTS;</hi> and then, 'tis impossible
for the <hi>Dissenting Protestants</hi> to please one another; and as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Successor of any one Religion to please them all. But now
which of these <hi>Protestant</hi> Religions must he be of? for there are a
matter of Two Hundred Divided <hi>Sects</hi> that list themselves under
that denomination. <hi>Well! but if they be</hi> True Protestants <hi>they'll
Vnite against Popery.</hi> Yes, As the Fellow united his Ratts, he put
them all into a Tub together, and then they eat up one another.
View them well, and you shall not find above three of four of them
that have any consistence one with another. <hi>And which are they?</hi> nay,
that's a Secret. But if <hi>Popery</hi> be so dreadful, because it is a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Religion; why is not the Writer of this <hi>Character</hi> as sensible of
150 Persecuting Religions on the one side, as of One Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Religion on the other? God preserve the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
I say, from both. Or if that bitter Cup be our Lot, the Lord in
his Mercy grant that we may not add <hi>Sedition</hi> to <hi>Persecution.</hi> It were
no Ill Embleme of the Original of our Late Troubles, to phancy
a Man in a Fright, and leaping from a painted Lion upon a Wall
into a Bed of Vipers. And no better are the pragmatical part of
the Revolters from our Communion, while in the mean time, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands

laid down to take a Nap, while some other less skilful hand supplys
his place; or else he writes on in his Sleep. And it would have been

his Authority, but the Subjects nevertheless Criminal, on the other
side for withdrawing their Duty.</p>
               <p>He has found a Loop-hole to evade This Oath, by turning <hi>SVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IECTS</hi>
into <hi>SLAVES.</hi> But That will not do his business, without
turning a <hi>Lawful Successor</hi> to a <hi>Protestant Establisht</hi> and <hi>bounded Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
into an arbitrary, absolute, Popish Tyrant. In which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
he holds forth This Doctrine to the People; that in This
Case, there is a Forfeiture of the Government; and that this is
the very Case which we have now before us; wherein, contrary to
Law, Reason and the Fundamental Essentials of all Government,
he does, as much as in him lyes, authorize and incite the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to a Sedition.</p>
               <p>I answer, that the Law is clearly against him; for tho the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
is bounded, the Duty of the Subject is yet left unconditional,
there being no Law, nor so much as the colour of any, incase of the
Kings passing his legal Limits, to absolve the People of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
And it is not the Plea of Provocation, or the exercise of a


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65670:38"/>
Tyrannical Power, that will save the Subject from the Sentence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Law, in case of any disloyal act of Assault or Resistance.</p>
               <p>It is against Reason likewise, that the Inferiour shall overrule the
Superiour, and invert the last Resort of Decision and Judgment
from the Prince to the Subject.</p>
               <p>It is, lastly, destructive of Government it self, to suppose such a
Reserve in a Political Constitution, as carries the last Appreal to the
People, which is the case in this Proposition. The King as a Trustee
that abuses his power incurrs a Forfeiture, (as our Author will have
it) of that Trust; and so all subordinate Trustees may incurr the
like Forfeiture, till all Communities are melted down again into the
ridiculous conceit of the Original Soveraignty of the Multitude,
which is onely a Chaos of Anarchy and Confusion.</p>

in the cars of the people, there is not one syllable in it that appears
in his favour. And yet once again upon the presumptions ascresaid
he grounds this Assertion, That in such a case neither is he the same
King that we swore to, nor we the same Subjects that took the

Oath. If this be not <hi>Rome against Rome,</hi> and <hi>Popery against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>

the Oath of Allegiance as they did upon the Covenant. Give me leave

Language upon his R. H. he cannot charge any thing in the worldupon
him, that looks that way, in his inclination. But yet here's enough (says
he) to conclude the Reason and the Necessity of his Seclusion. The
Compiler of this Character would take it ill now, on the other side, if
a man should say that his very argument against the Duke, holds as
true against the Author of the Character. For that <hi>Dominion is
founded in Grace,</hi> is the Principle both <hi>for</hi> which, and <hi>by</hi> which he
pretends to Supplant the Successor. Now why may we not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Sedition from the one, as well as Tyranny from the other? Nay
and with more Justice too; considering that there is but a bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation

and Exercising that Power, the Case, on the Kings side, is
greatly differing, for the question is not whether the King does Well
or Ill in forcing his Authority beyond the due hounds, but whether
the Tyranny, on the one side, will justify an undutiful behaviour, on
the other? And the Law it self will easily determine. This Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.

(as aforesaid) and without any Exception, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to discharge him of that Duty, in any Cace whatsoever, the

                  <q>Monarchy (<hi>says he fol.</hi> 21.) can be acquir'd but by two ways. <hi>First,</hi>
By the Choice of the People, who frequently, in the beginning
of the World, out of a natural desire of Safety, for the securing
of a Peaceful Community and Conversation, chose a Single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be their Head, as a <hi>Proper,</hi> Supream Moderator in all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that might arise to disquiet that Community: Thus
were <hi>Kings</hi> made for the <hi>People,</hi> and not the <hi>People</hi> for <hi>Kings</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Principle of <hi>Popular Liberty,</hi> and placing the <hi>Original</hi> of
Government in the <hi>People,</hi> is highly derogatory to the Providence
of God; contrary to the <hi>express</hi> Letter of the Text, and destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
of the very Being of Human Society, <hi>First,</hi> By implying Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to be cast into the World unprovided for. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes
<hi>Magistracy,</hi> which the Apostle tells us; (<hi>Rom. 13. 2.) is the Ordinance
of God,</hi> to be of <hi>Human Institution,</hi> or at best, <hi>Nature's second
Thought;</hi> but in truth, an effect either of <hi>Tumult</hi> or <hi>Chance,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as Men were led to't either by <hi>Choice</hi> or <hi>Necessity. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
in supposing <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>radically</hi> in the <hi>People,</hi> and the grant
of it to be only an act of conveyance by common Consent, and with
a power of <hi>Revocation,</hi> upon certain equitable Conditions, either
<hi>express'd</hi> or <hi>imply'd;</hi> there goes no more than the <hi>Peoples</hi> recalling
of their <hi>Power,</hi> to the dissolving of all Commu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Society,</hi> at this rate, lyes at the Mercy of the <hi>Multitude.</hi> But how
this Revocation shall be notify'd, unless by way of <hi>Advertisement</hi>
in one of the <hi>True Protestant-Anabaptist-Mercurys,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>But then consider again, That this <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Revocation</hi> must
Pass with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente;</hi> nay, and a <hi>Nemine Absente</hi> too:
for <hi>one single Diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

makes, void both the <hi>Original Grant,</hi> and all that was done subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
upon it: for by reason of that defect, it is no longer the act of
the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may put a Man in admiration, to see what Credit this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastique
and Impracticable Conceit has got in the World, if he
does not observe the Address in the <hi>Application</hi> of it, and the use
that is made of it. All violent Motions of State (we see) are
wrought and brought about by the Favour and Assistance of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
And there can be no readier way in the World to make <hi>them</hi>
sure, then either to calumniate, or otherwise to lay open the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65670:40"/>
of the Government, and to tell them that <hi>Princes</hi> are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Trustees</hi> for the <hi>Peoples good;</hi> the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in <hi>themselves;</hi> and
that if <hi>Governours</hi> break their <hi>Trust,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> may resume their
<hi>Power.</hi> When the <hi>Multitude</hi> has once imbib'd this Doctrine, the
next work will be to set up for the recovery of their <hi>inheritance:</hi> and
when it comes to that once, we need but look behind us to see the
end on't.</p>
               <p>Our Author has already admitted, (upon this mistake of the
Fountain of <hi>Power</hi>) that the <hi>People</hi> may yet pass away their <hi>Original
Right,</hi> without <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Revocation. Here indeed,</hi> (says he, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Concession of <hi>Absolute Power) a passive Obedience was due;
but what's this to a King of</hi> England? Now though the Doctrine of
this Passage (<hi>fol.</hi> 20.) seems to clash with an Equity of <hi>Resumption,</hi>
reserved to the <hi>People</hi> in the last Paragraph above-recited, (<hi>fol.</hi> 21.)
I shall yet lay no hold of that implication, but turn the force of his
own allowance against himself. If the <hi>Peoples alienation</hi> of their
Power to a Prince, <hi>without conditions,</hi> shall stand good against them;
so shall the alienation of their Power also to a Prince, <hi>under conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
stand every jote as good, within the limits of those condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And where shall we find those <hi>conditions,</hi> but in the <hi>Establish'd
Law,</hi> which marks out the bounds, both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People?</hi> Now
if the <hi>Law</hi> Pronounces the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>Supream</hi> in all <hi>Causes,</hi> and
over all <hi>Persons, &amp;c.</hi> and yet with some Limitations and Restraints
upon his Prerogative: Suppose he <hi>passes</hi> those Terms, who shall
judge him, but God if he be <hi>Supream,</hi> and has no other Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him? Or if the <hi>People</hi> have reserved, in such a case, any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling
Power to themselves, how comes it that the Law takes
no notice of it; but on the contrary, makes the Subjects accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any act of Disobedience or Violence to, or upon the Person,
or Authority of the King, upon what pretence soever? So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of <hi>opposing</hi> or <hi>preventing</hi> an <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> the Law
is subverted (here) at a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ow; and a Foundation laid of the most <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious</hi>
and shameful sort of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>He says that <hi>Kings were made for the People, and not People for the
Kings,</hi> which is well enough, if he means that <hi>Kings</hi> were made for
the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> which is the great Blessing of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi>
and not <hi>People</hi> for the <hi>Government</hi> of the King; which turns
Society into Confusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65670:41"/>
But after all these words, to shew that Government Originally
was not <hi>Popular;</hi> I shall add a few more, to prove the Institution
of it to be purely <hi>Divine:</hi> which opinion, in truth, needs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Support, than the Authority of the Holy Scriptures.
<hi>By me Kings Reign,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have made the Earth, the Man, and the Beasts
that are upon the Ground by my great Power, and my Outstretched arm,
and have given it to whom it seemed meet unto me,</hi> Jer. 27. 5.</p>
               <p>That which we now call <hi>Kingly</hi> Government was at <hi>first</hi> called
<hi>Paternel,</hi> and after that <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> &amp;c. And we find, by the
Powers they exercised (as <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, War</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> &amp;c.) that
their <hi>Paternal</hi> Power did Then extend to all the Acts of our <hi>Regal</hi>
Power; The Objection is, could there be a <hi>King</hi> without a <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi>
Which is all one with the Supposal of a <hi>Father</hi> without a <hi>Son.</hi>
But This does not at all conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> had not both a <hi>Regal</hi>
and a <hi>Paternal</hi> Power, before he had either <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Children,</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to govern, and exercise it upon: It being a thing so consonant
also, to the Methods of the Divine Wisdom, to supply him previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with all needful Abilities and Authorities for the Discharge
of his Fatherly and Governing Office: The whole Race of his
Posterity, lying open, even before they had any Existency in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to the Omniscience of God, with whom there is no <hi>PAST</hi>
or <hi>FUTVRE,</hi> but all things, always <hi>PRESENT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if <hi>Adam</hi> did not bring his Authority into the World
with him, when did he receive his Commission? Or, if he had
none at all, how could he justifie the Arbitrary Rule he <hi>exercis'd</hi>
over those People that were only his Fellow Subjects, under the
same God, and without any Subordinate Ruler over them? Or if
<hi>Adam</hi> was vested with a Right of <hi>exerting</hi> the Power he <hi>exercis'd;</hi>
how came our Authors Imaginary Multitude to chuse a Governor
of their own, in opposition to the appointment of Providence?
Or who absolved them from the Bonds of their filial and primary
Duty and Obedience?</p>
               <p>What he says afterward of <hi>Conquest,</hi> (which he calls his Other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of <hi>Monarchy</hi>) serves only for an occasion to tell us, that
our Last <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest was little more than a Composition: which
