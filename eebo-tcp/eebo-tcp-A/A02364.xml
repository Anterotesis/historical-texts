         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Throughe theſe foreſayed remonſtrations being convicted, &amp; perſvaded, vnder the pretexte of greate furtherance, vvhich yonger Chyrurgians might heerby reape, and not beinge poſſible for me anye longer to reſiſte, the importunitye of certayne ſproutes, &amp; beginners of Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, vvho vveare of opinione, that this preſent peece of vvorcke, vvith all the deformityes therof, might be profitable for them, and beinge certifiede, that if by anye means they coulde attayne them into theire handes, they vvoulde commit the ſame to the printe even ſuch as it vveare. So that I am conſtrayned to imploy my ſelfe certayne hovvres of the day, in correcting of the ſame and a little more imbelliſhe, and adorne, the ſame, vvith 4 portrayctures of mans bodye becauſe the ſame entringe into the vvorlde, might be effected vvith more favoure, &amp; credite, vvherof the tvvo firſt, doe demonſtrate all externall partes, as vvell anteriorlye, as poſteriorlye, &amp; in the other tvvo, all the ſuperficiall Vaynes, are evidently layed ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs, vvhich as little rivers doe runne throughe the face &amp; throughe all other externall partes of the bodye extende themſelves as vvell behinde as before, becauſe the ſame beinge of the yong Chyrurgians noted, they vvith leſſe dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Farther I have enriched this vvorcke, vvith divers defigurations of Inſtruments, not of all Inſtrumentes, but of thoſe onlye, vvhich I eſteemed to be moſt neceſſarye: For even as the ſage, prudent, and vvyſe Nature, hath inſtituted ſuch an ordre, to mans body, that ſhee vvith fevv par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, can accompliſhe, manye great and excellent actions, In like ſorte muſt the Chyrurgiane, an imitatoure, and adminiſtre of Nature, endevoure, and conſtraygne himſelfe, vvith fevv Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to execute, and effecte, manye, &amp; greate Operations. And to ſpeake the playne truth all this greate companye and treaſure houſe of Engines, Molitiones, and of other Chyrurgicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, are more for curiouſity, &amp; oftentatione, then for anye neceſſitye, and vſe. I am alſo verye certayne of that vvhich our <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſayeth, to vvit, that vve ought not to conſtraygne, or reſtraygne, the libertye of our corps, and the Operations, vnto the penurye, and deficience of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes: but much more amplifie, and enrich the ſame, vnto the commoditye of the bodye, and eaſe of the Operations: but I vvoulde rather exoptate, and deſire, that this vanitye, &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſe bravadinge of Inſtrumentes, vveare ruled vvith more religiouſe mediocritye.</p>
            <p>Alſo I have made, a greate &amp; ample Table, or Index, in the end of the Boock, vvherin through Alphabeticall ordre I have illuſtrated, the moſt notableſt, &amp; difficulteſt thinges, vvhich in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qviſitione might be an impediment, vnto the vnexperte in the arte of Chyrurgerye, in ſeekinge of their farther commoditye. And if ſo be any man obiecte vnto me, that this my diſcourſe, is onlye compilede together of certayne rapſodyes of the antiqve Chyrurgians: I vvillingely heere confes, &amp; acknovvledge, that in this Treatiſe, ther is verye little, or nothing at all of myne ovvne Inventione: For I am not the man vvhich liveth by an other mans mutuated ſupellectilles and I rather publiqvely confes, that I have collected all this out of auncient Chyrurgians, being greate ſhame for me to be repraehended, and ſurpriſed, of a ſecrete thefte. For vvhat noveltyes are vnder the Sunne? as the vvyſe man ſayeth: And as the <hi>Comicus</hi> ſayeth, vvhat ſhoulde vve novv adayes ſay, vvhich hath not before bin ſpoken? But I may at all times vvith veritye ſay, that I am not entred into this matter to ſovve, and feminate the ſame in an infertille grovvnde: For I have added ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vnto greate amendmente, and have eradicated, &amp; vveeded out all ſpinoſities, &amp; thiſtles, vvherof they vveare repleniſhed vvith greate difficultyes, ſeqveſtringe on the one ſyde malevole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t herbes, vvhich choacked the good fruictes of the truth, compoſinge all thinges in good ordre, to adde thervnto cleernes, and facilitye: throughe the vvhich excellent, moderne, &amp; aunciente Aucthors may be vnderſtoode of thoſe, vvhich can attayn to the klovvledge of noe ſtrange langvages.

And it vvilbe a greate ioy, and peaſure vnto me that therin they ſurpaſſe me: &amp; I ſhall very vvell knovve to applye the ſame to my profite, and commoditye, vvhich they throughe theire great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and induſtrye, have brought forth, nether vvill I conceale that vvhich of them I ſhall have learned.</p>
            <p>And although it be the opinion of the Sages that vve ought not to lightly, thereveale ſecretes, of Phyſicke, vnto the common, &amp; vulgare poeple treating of ſuch matters, in theire maternall, &amp; motherlye langvage, becauſe it might be eſteemed of little vvorth, &amp; be of all men little accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: And although I coulde eaſily, have vttered, and expreſſed my intente, in latine, yet I rather publiſhed the ſame in our French language: And that firſt of all, becauſe all annciente Learned men, vvhether they be Greeckes, Arabers, or Latiniſtes, have vvritten al theire doctrine, and experience in the maternall language. The primates, and princes of Phyſicke, <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> and his faythfull, and fidele interpreter, &amp; commitatoure <hi>Galen, Paulus Aegineta</hi> &amp; <hi>Oribaſius</hi> doe vvitnes of the ſame. <hi>Avicenna,</hi> and <hi>Averroes,</hi> have alſo done the ſame, vvritinge in the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biane Langvage. <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Plinius,</hi> the firſte and they vvhich have only vvritten in Latine, have alſoe done theire endevoure, and have alſo diſired to imbelliſhe, and eternize, theire Latine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gvage, &amp; contrye, through the termes, and theoremes of Phyſicke. Farthermore alſo, by hovv much the more a thinge is more commone ſoe much the more is it better, and by ſo much the more may this ſcience of all men be knovvne, lauded, and extolde.
