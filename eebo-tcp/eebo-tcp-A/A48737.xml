         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the REVEREND,
My ever Honour'd Father,
Mr. THOMAS LITTLETON,
RECTOR of Suckley in the Diocese
of Worcester.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honour'd Father,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat old complaint of <hi>St. Jerom,</hi>
that <hi>Divinity is become every
ones Trade,</hi> was never more
seasonable then of late times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; when all Professions invaded the
Pulpit, and God's word was rudely handled
by those that were Bunglers at their own
trades. To vindicate me from that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of unseemly meddling with sacred
things, if my Education, which hath been
all along in Letters, and the Imployment I
am in, which requires of me sometimes to
perform the place of <hi>Catechist,</hi> will not serv:
yet the Relation, which I and this Treatise
both have to your self, will abundantly plead
<pb facs="tcp:102938:9"/>
a defence. For if the Church hath accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
services of this nature from several of her
sons in the Laity; then I hope, I that am
not only a Son of the <hi>Church,</hi> but the Son of
a <hi>Church-man</hi> too, shall escape censure; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially,
when I own my self in this small
work no other then your <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> and do
but copy out those notions of Truth and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wherewith you by your early institutions
season'd my Youth: So that in effect, the
Book I present you, is as much your child,
as the Writer of it, and this Explanation,
what it is, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Filia vocis,</hi> (the veneration
I owe to a Father will justifie the Allusion;
I mean) the <hi>Echo,</hi> the rebound and report
at distance of your Instructions, and those
discourses you made a score of years ago, at
<hi>Hales-Owen.</hi> Sir, It was then your custom
constantly on Sunday-afternoons, with all
familiar plainness, to set forth the <hi>Grounds
of Religion,</hi> and <hi>Principles of Christianity;</hi>
an exercise (though perform'd in the Desk)
of as great necessity, and tending as much to
edification, as that other (I was going to
say) Idoliz'd way of Preaching. Yet the
sad truth is, that in this age of disorders,
<hi>Preaching</hi> hath not been so much abus'd, as
<hi>Catechizing</hi> (with other holy ordinances)
hath been disused. And indeed, to this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb facs="tcp:102938:9"/>
we may mainly impute most other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.
When the Ground-work sinks,
'tis no wonder if the Building totter, and run
to decay; and if these Foundations should be
shaken, it may iustly be fear'd that the
whole Fabrick of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> will goe
to ruine, and fall into confusion. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
Christian will be easily perswaded
to give himself up to any wild opinion or loose
practise, to turn Heretick or Rebell, and
prove a fit Instrument for the managery of
Satan's designs.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that much hath been writt
already upon these Subjects; so that the
very Titles of those Books, which have been
intended Comments, and Expositions of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical
Heads,</hi> and Enarrations of the
Grounds of Religion, would take up more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then this whole Discourse wasts: And
I know there are many Excellent Treatises of
this kind, even in our own Language; yet
I have not met with any one hitherto, that
hath comprehended all the <hi>Rudiments of
Christian Doctrine</hi> (for so I think I may
safely call these Heads of Catechisme) in
one <hi>Manual,</hi> or delivered the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them in so familiar a Phrase &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
For whilest others ingage in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
and spin out all <hi>School-Divinity</hi> out
<pb facs="tcp:102938:10"/>
of these plain Truths, and fill their margin
with quotations out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
Humane Learning to Sacred
purposes; as if they meant to print only <hi>Ad
Clerum,</hi> laying out their vast abilities out
of the Peoples reach: I judg'd it more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to publick Vse, and to the scant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of my Skill, to give only a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
account by an easie <hi>Paraphrase</hi> and <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical</hi>
interpretation of every clause, word
by word, and then of the whole sentence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Nor have I been wanting, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
have invited, up and down to bring
in Practical considerations, nor fear'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to enter the Lists against the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
and (their Proselytes) our <hi>Sectaries;</hi>
yet not so as to fetch in strength from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
without, but make use of those wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
only, the present place afforded me.
I have been the larger in my <hi>Discant</hi> upon
<hi>the Lords Prayer;</hi> becasue indeed it is the
<hi>Ground</hi> of all <hi>Liturgy.</hi> In the <hi>Creed</hi> I did
not think it safe or fit to mention those old
Heresies so long since exploded, for fear least
a weak Confutation should teach them; (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there have been too many in our late Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
too industrious to revive them,
and bring them into Credit;) but contented
my self with a short, and (I hope) Orthodox
<pb facs="tcp:102938:10"/>
explication of the Mysteries of our Faith.
When I was upon the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> I could not
but make National reflections upon each
Commandement, yet so as to convince the
whole People, not to upbraid any one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For though <hi>the Act of Oblivion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
us to forget Injuries done to Men,
yet Religion will oblige us to remember our
Sins against God. The <hi>Sacraments</hi> I
have handled with that brevity, that I
have not there much insisted on the <hi>Rites,</hi>

            <head>An Explanation of the
GROUNDS
OF
RELIGION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ELIGION is the Fear of
God, <hi>i.e.</hi> the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; worshipping of God.
God is known by his
Works and by his Word. There
was never any Nation which did not
profess the worship of God. An
Atheist was alwayes counted a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
Now most Countries following
Nature as their guid, have mistaken
either in the matter or manner of
their worship. The Heathens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
such as <hi>Indians, Scythians,
<pb facs="tcp:102938:15"/>
Turks,</hi> &amp;c. worship either a false God,
or with false worship. But God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being guided by the light of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
do embrace the true Religion;
the <hi>Iewish Church</hi> in the time of the
Law, the <hi>Christian Church</hi> under the
Gospel. For after the coming of
Christ, the Religion of the <hi>Iews</hi> hath
now no longer use, since it was but
a shadow and type of Christ to come.
For Christ the Sun of Righteousnesse
being risen, the Ceremonies like sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
are scatter'd and fled away.
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> then is that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which Christ himself taught
when he was on earth, confirm'd by
miracles and holinesse of Life, and
sealed with his precious Blood dying
on the Cross. Christian Religion is
at large conteined in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<hi>i.e.</hi> in the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles, who were the
Pen men of the holy Ghost; But it
is chiefly compriz'd in the four <hi>Heads
of Catechism,</hi> which we call the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:102938:15"/>
of Religion.</hi> Now <hi>Catechism</hi> is a
brief and plain Institution, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
the Mysteries of Faith, and the
Duties of a holy Life, in that manner,
that they may be easily understood
by any, even the most vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension:
Wherefore 'tis call'd <hi>the
Sincere milk of the Word,</hi> as being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the capacity of little children,
which as yet cannot bear more
weighty discourses, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to <hi>solid meat.</hi> This Doctrine
then is plain that it may be receiv'd by
the Understanding, and short that it
may be held in Memory; yet full too
that it may instruct us in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation. For it is made up
of four parts, whereof the <hi>First</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us what we are to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God and the Church; the
<hi>Second,</hi> what duty we owe to God
and man; the <hi>Third</hi> describes a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of praying; the <hi>Fourth</hi> delivers
those Sacred seals, by which this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is confirm'd. The Confession
<pb facs="tcp:102938:16"/>
of Faith is set down in the <hi>Apostles
Creed.</hi> The Law of God contein'd
in the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> is the Rule
of life. The <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> is a most
absolute form and pattern of Prayer.
And lastly the two <hi>Sacraments</hi> of
<hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Supper,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Seals. These are the Pillars,
upon which not onely the Church,
but every faithfull soul is in the Spirit
built up to perfect knowledge and
blessednesse, to grace and glory.</p>

PRAYER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>RAYER is a calling upon
God in time of want or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;
and a returning of
praise for blessings receiv'd, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
obtein'd: Or indeed more
generally, and suitably to the nature
of this holy exercise, abstracting it
from our occasions; 'tis a Meditation
upon God, his essence and his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
his Word and his Works; and
an acknowledgement of his power
and wisdome and goodness, whereby
he orders all things to his own glory
and our good. It is indeed the special
act of God's worship; for <hi>Adoration</hi>
is nothing else, but a praying to him,
whom we adore: Whereupon<note n="a" place="bottom">Qui singit sacros auro vel marmore vultus<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Non facit ille Deos; qui rogat, ille facit. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                     </note> the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102938:18"/>
heathen well observ'd, that 'twas not
he that graves the idol, but he that
prayes to it, which consecrates the
Deity. This is sure, that his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may well be question'd, who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to pray; though 'tis true too,
that prayer may be abus'd to wrong
ends, even to devour widow's houses,
nay to eat up God's own House.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>grounds</hi> of Prayer are laid
in the nature of God, and the relation
which he hath to us; who, as he is our
Creator and preserver, challenges this
homage; whence the Psalmist fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
invites all our fellow creatures
to this duty, &amp; brings us altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one quire to praise the Lord. And
the very instinct of nature, hath taught
ravenous beasts,<note n="b" place="bottom">Non tam praedari quam precari.</note> not so much to prey
as to pray; the young Lions, and the
young Ravens in their hunger cry to
him, and he feeds them, and fills eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing living with his blessing. Nor
doth our <hi>relation</hi> so much <hi>as</hi> our <hi>want</hi>
make prayer necessary; for we depend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102938:18"/>
upon him, both as to the life of nature
and of grace; nor are we able to subsist
or act without his constant help.
Therefore that praecept is no more,
then nature dictates to us,<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Thess. 5. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>

                     <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing,</hi> or <hi>continually,</hi> that is, <hi>In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
time, In every place, In every busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
The main thing in Prayer being
to lift up the soul, to carry God in our
thoughts, and have our conversation
in Heaven; as the man after Gods own
heart saith of himself, <hi>I have set the
Lord alwayes before me.</hi> And in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of so glorious a Majesty there
cannot chuse but be an humble, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent,
fervent, chearfull frame of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
a mind well tuned, and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
so order'd, the thoughts so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
as if one were alwayes in an
actual devotion.</p>
                  <p>Now God's <hi>Nature</hi> makes it as
convenient for us to go to him in
prayer, as our <hi>Interest</hi> makes it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
for, as he was pleased to call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102938:19"/>
(that had frequent intercourses
with him in this kind) his <hi>friend;</hi> He
hath all the qualities, which should be
taken notice of in the choice of a
friend. He wants neither will nor
skill to do us all imaginable good;
He hath kindness to intend us good,
wisdome to contrive it, and power to
accomplish it. Nor are the other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
idle in our behalf; For 'tis his
Mercy to promise us help, and his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to perform his promise: and the
like may be said of the rest. Then what
a priviledge is it, that a poor creature,
dust and ashes may freely speak to his
maker? That we who dwell in houses
of clay may keep up a commerce
with heaven? that sinfull creatures as
we are have access to the throne of
Grace with boldness, and may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a hearing in God's Court of
Chancery?<note n="d" place="bottom">Gen. 18. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all
the earth</hi> (saith he) <hi>do right?</hi> And any
sinner may sue for his pardon with the
same plea. Shall not justice acquit me,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102938:19"/>
since mercy hath accepted my surety?
Is it not enough, that my debt hath
been once pay'd? Christ hath dyed for
my sins, and my soul shall live. Nay,
let our case be what it will, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath afforded us such Arguments,
as he will not stand out. Shall he that
hath given me a <hi>life,</hi> deny me <hi>food?</hi>
shall he that hath given me a <hi>body,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me <hi>raiment?</hi> He that hath given me
his Son, will not he much more give
me all things else? Thus Prayer is not
only like <hi>Iacob</hi>'s wrestling with God
upon earth, but his scaling ladder too,
to reach heaven; whilst Prayers
ascend to fetch down blessings, and
blessings descend to fetch up praises.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let's but look to the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi>
that come by praying, and me
thinks no body should be so ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to himself as to neglect it. What
is't, but ask and have? and will any
one be so lazy, as to refuse the pains
of asking? He deserves not bread to
put in his mouth, that will not open a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102938:20"/>
proud mouth to ask it. We have
Gods word for't in several places, that
his kindness he rates so cheap, that it
shall be had for asking.<note n="e" place="bottom">Matt. 7. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Ask, and it
shall be given you.</hi> And our Saviour
passeth his word,<note n="f" place="bottom">Ioh. 14. 13, 14.</note> that <hi>whatsoever we
shall ask in his name, he will do it.</hi>
Can any thing be purchas'd at a lower
rate, then asking? This is the buying
without mony and without price.
Doth a man want wisdome, counsel,
help? Doth a sinner want grace, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
strength? Doth a Saint want
light, comfort, rest? Let him but come
and ask, he shall find God readier to
give, then himself was to ask; who
sometimes answers prayers before
they are made, and counts it one of
his greatest titles, that he is <hi>a hearer of
Prayer;</hi> But some <hi>ask and have not; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="bottom">Iam. 4. 3.</note> as the Apostle saith, <hi>they ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss.</hi>
Wherefore he that would pray
aright, so that he may obtein, must
come prepared &amp; furnisht with those
Graces, which may make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102938:20"/>
                     <note n="h" place="bottom">Psal. 19. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Let the words of my mouth and
the meditation of my heart be acceptable
in thy sight.</hi> We must not rush in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so great a presence; (for<note n="i" place="bottom">Psal. 5. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the foolish

the Majesty of God, and our
own vileness, being deeply affected
with the sense of his goodness, and
mans misery; and premeditate before
hand what we have to say, and how;
and indeed pray before we go to pray,
that God will prepare our hearts for
prayer. For so the Psalmist resolves
the success of Prayer;<note n="k" place="bottom">Psal. 10. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>
(or <hi>direct) their heart, and shalt
cause thy ear to hear.</hi> And though all
the graces, like a bed of spices, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion to breath forth their
sweet odours; yet some have a more
particular imployment, such as are,
<hi>Reverence</hi> in our high thoughts of
God, <hi>Humility</hi> in our low thoughts
of our selves, <hi>Trust</hi> to rely upon his
goodness, and <hi>Patience</hi> to wait his
time, <hi>Knowledge</hi> that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102938:21"/>
in some measure the nature of
God, and <hi>Obedience</hi> that we may sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
perform his will, <hi>Zeal</hi> which
may inflame and raise our affections
towards him, and <hi>Constancy</hi> which
may keep us in a daily practice of this
Deity. And to those, which call upon
him so, God will be near, and will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do that which they ask, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which may be better for
them.</p>
                  <p>Who comes irreverently puts an
affront upon God, which an earthly
Prince would not brook. He that is
possess'd with an aw of greatness, will
take heed how he demeans himself
before it. <hi>Reverence</hi> then draws with
it <hi>attention,</hi> which will drive away
vain thoughts, as<note n="l" place="bottom">Gen. 15. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> scar'd the
birds from the sacrifice. We cannot
in reason exspect, that God should
take notice of us, if we mind not
him; or hear those prayers, which
the Speaker himself regards not.</p>
                  <p>Who leaves <hi>Humility</hi> behind him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102938:21"/>
doth but personate a devotion, and
plays, rather then prays. He may
please himself, or others it may be,
with acting a pompous part; but <hi>God
resists the proud,</hi> nor doth the boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pharisee go home justified. Now
<hi>Humility</hi> is chiefly seated in the mind,
but it expresses it self too in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and prescribes the posture
of <hi>kneeling, bowing, falling</hi> flat upon
the face: nor was the Publican less
humbled, when he <hi>stood</hi> afar off and
pray'd.</p>
                  <p>Who would seek to God, if he durst
not trust him, but look'd upon him,
either as a down-right enemy, or an
unsteady friend? we must bring the
<hi>confidence</hi> of children, if we look to
have the kindness of a Father. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
hath said it, that<note n="m" place="bottom">Iam. 1. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>he that prayes
doubting and with wavering,</hi> shall go
without; so that who asks with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
bespeaks a denyall.</p>
                  <p>Nor yet must this confidence be so
bold, as to limit God to means <hi>how,</hi> or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102938:22"/>
appoint him his time <hi>when.</hi> God's
own times are best;<note n="n" place="bottom">Psal. 31. 16.</note>

Prayer: As to the place; <hi>publick</hi> in the

judgements and mercies; particular
sins and graces, &amp;c. And accordingly
some have to very good purpose and

<hi>Manuals</hi> of devotion, fitted for all the
business and most occurrences of life.
As to the manner; <hi>mental</hi> only, as<note n="y" place="bottom">1 Sam. 1. 13.</note>

it into four kinds: <hi>Petition</hi> for good,
<hi>Deprecation</hi> of evil, <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for

All which sorts of prayer are either
exemplified or included in this most
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102938:25"/>
absolute form, which our Saviour
himself prescrib'd, which from him is
called <hi>The Lord's Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are not many things, which
wear the stamp of this title, and those
have a peculiar veneration due to
them, as immediately appointed by
Iesus himself; <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> the
<hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> the <hi>Lord's Prayer:</hi> (The
same word, out of which the name
which we give God's House is made,

                     <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Church.)</hi> Christ did not only
make it, but appoint it too; for when
his disciples came to him with a desire
that he would teach them to pray, as
<hi>Iohn</hi> had done his disciples; He bade
them use this form. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>When you pray, say thus:</hi> which
yet doth signify not only in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but in these very words. St. <hi>Luke</hi>
more peremptorily delivers the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note n="c" place="bottom">Luk. 11. 2,</note> 
                     <hi>when you pray say:</hi> so that granting
the adversary the advantage that he
would catch at from St. <hi>Matthew;</hi>
yet he must acknowledge even from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102938:26"/>
thence, that this prayer is an exact co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and plat-form, by which we are to
frame and model all our prayers; and
St. <hi>Luke</hi> will make out farther, that it
is a form of prayer, to be constantly
used by them, who would be taken
for Christ's disciples. And no question
but as it is the most ancient, and best
prayer, which ever was in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, so 'twas meant for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
use and rehearsal in the sacred
offices of the Church. This assertion
proves <hi>Liturgy</hi> as lawfull, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of blasphemy, schism, and
non-sense make it convenient if not
necessary: which the opposers of set
forms perceiving and fearing least the
spirit (as they term it) should be
bound, if Christ's own form should
pass free, make bold not only to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
but to abuse it too, and cry it
down; as if his words could offend
God, whose very name doth so much
prevail with him in prayer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

according to <hi>Matthew</hi>'s expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:

'twill be hard for them to find an
instance of their arguing. Nor will the
variation of a word in the middle of
it, or the omission of a clause at the

we shall see anon. This excellent form
and pattern then of prayer is both for
matter, and form, and order so full and
compleat and comprehensive; so well
order'd, and fitly suited, and hansom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exprest; that, were the command
for the use of it laid aside, it seems to
commend it self to a Christian's daily
practice, as a short yet full Liturgy.</p>

prayer is addressed to; to wit, God,
who is described, partly by a title,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102938:27"/>
which shews his relation to us, and
our interest in him, <hi>Our Father.</hi> partly
by the place, wherein he dwels and

contains in it a compleat sum and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of all holy desires, and a perfect bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
of things pray'd for, both spiritual
and temporal, and hath six or (as some
would have it by parting the last into

former whereof concern God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the three later belong to us and our
necessities, both unto this life and that
which is to come. So that the glory of
God, and the Salvation of man, which
are the two pillars, upon which the
frame of providence, and work of
grace do stand; are mainly here consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and run in each vein of this
Prayer. The sense of all may be briefly

a mutual respect, and seem to look to
one another after this manner: That

thee in the Land of the living, preserve

That thy <hi>Kingdom</hi> may come into us,
and grace may rule in our hearts, blot

as he is merciful, perfect as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
that we may be known by our
conversation to be the children of
God, children of the highest, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light, to whon belongs the
Kingdom of Heaven. For 'tis God's
presence and favour makes heaven:
Heaven would not be heaven unless
he were there. Where ever grace is,
there's heaven; for God dwels there,
entertaining himself in an humble
heart as much in the highest heavens.
To make short, how should we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him, worship him, fear him and
love him, and joy in him with a holy
ecstasy of affections, and heavenly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102938:38"/>
reptures of devotion, that have leave
to use these words, <hi>Our Father which
art in Heaven?</hi> This appellation with
the other title of Father assures, and
makes up our confidence compleat.
For being <hi>our Father</hi> he will do us all
the good he can, and being <hi>in Heaven</hi>
he can do what he will; so that the
goodness of a Father, and the power
of heaven stand ingaged for us, as the
two pillars of our hope; and two sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that all our petitions following
will be granted and made good unto
us.</p>
                     <p>Amongst which, as 'twas fit, those
which belong to his own glory have
the first place; and God having made
all things for himself cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull
of providing for that. But he
loves to be ask'd to do even what he
means of himself to do, that man's
will may be brought into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with God's, and the execution
of decrees become the return of
prayers. Thus he delights to oblige
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102938:38"/>
where he can force, and that which
he hath with an unchangeable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
from all eternity resolv'd with
himself, makes it the product of his
creatures will; as if he had more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the desires of men then for
his own resolv's, and would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his own eternal decrees, unless
man first consent, and make it his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
And indeed it is man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
that is driven throughout
the prayer; for 'tis not for God's sake
that we pray, but for our own: What
advantage gets God by our prayers,
unless giving be getting? His name is
holy, his Kingdom is everlasting, and
his will irresistible, whether we pray
or no. But we pray that all this may
be order'd for our good, and we are
as much concern'd in this as in our
daily bread; God so ordering all the
administrations of his providence and
grace, that his glory and man's salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
go hand in hand, and that all
things may work together as for his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102938:39"/>
glory, so for our good, the good of
those that love and fear his name.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>name</hi> is the first thing we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after about any thing we desire
to know; as <hi>Moses,</hi> when he talked
with God at his first appearance to
him, told him the Israelites would ask
him, who sent him, and<note n="p" place="bottom">Exod 3. 13,</note> what was
his name. There hath alwayes been
taken great care for the imposition of
names, that they might be suitable and
proper to the nature of things. For
things are distinguished and known
from one another by their names.
Wherefore God himself named the
greater pieces of his work, which
being of vast unruly bulk, were to be
under his own immediate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as Heaven and Earth and the
Sea; and 'tis said<note n="q" place="bottom">Psal. 147. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>he calls the stars all
by their names,</hi> &amp;c. But those creatures
which he meant to put under mans
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102938:39"/>
feet, he brought to him to name.</p>
                     <p>The like care hath been constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken by parents and others in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
fit names for their children,
that families and persons may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
distinguished; for which
purpose the day, on which the child
was circumcised, amongst the Iews,
which was the eighth day from his
birth, and about the same time among
the heathens, but amongst us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
at the baptisme, this solemnity
of naming the child is perform'd; a
thing of such concernment, that it
hath been delivered sometimes by
the message of Angels, other while
by miracle. And that was a signal
token in the<note n="r" place="bottom">Isa. 45. 1, 3.</note> prophecie, wherein he
calls his anointed <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name four
hundred years before he was in being.
'Tis a nice consideration, but there
may be something in it, and of more
then ordinary consequence, that God
should take such care about names,
that he should think fit to give and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102938:40"/>
change them either in favour or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
as in the instance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Conjah, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and that he is
said to write the <hi>names</hi> of his elect in
the book of life, and to give them <hi>a
new name;</hi> and to blot out the <hi>names</hi>
of the wicked, and to threaten that
their <hi>names,</hi> i.e. their memory shall
perish. Let them take heed that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to Christen their children, and
give them names, least they design
their childrens ruin; God finding no
names they have in the church-roll, to
copy into his book.<note n="f" place="bottom">Gen. 27. 36.</note>

of the divine attributes, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

to his commands. Nor is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and usual signification to be laid
aside, God having many such names
given him in Scripture; both proper,
as <hi>Iehovah, Iah, Elohim, Adonai,
Shaddai;</hi> and appellative, even a full
Alphabet of names as the Syric
Grammarians reckon them. And so
too,<note n="f" place="bottom">Psal. 111. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Holy and reverend is his name.</hi>
Our petitions here begin in God's
name, a form so well liked, that it came
to be taken up even up even in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
affairs of life, wills, contracts, &amp;c.
and made use of at last as a stale to
countenance the worst designs of
cheat, prostituted to base self-ends, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the infamy of a Proverb. And
surely if we facing our prayers with it,
make it only a vizar to our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
desires, we doe it a fowl reproach,
and profane it, when we pray it may
be sanctified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To Sanctify</hi> hath also a doubtful
meaning according to the thing it is
applyed to. The Philosopher has in a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102938:42"/>
moral respect rank'd things into three
forms; For there are some things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and in their own nature <hi>good;</hi>
others as naturally <hi>bad;</hi> and a third
sort of <hi>indifferent</hi> things, which in
their own nature are neither good nor
bad, but according as they are used.
His distinction may find room here
and accordingly admit of a threefold
Sanctification; That which is in it self
holy is sanctified, when 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and reverenc'd as holy; And
thus<note n="g" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 13. and 29. 23.</note> we are bid <hi>to Sanctify the Lord
of Hosts himself, the holy One.</hi> That
which is by nature evill and corrupt
is sanctified by being made holy, and
having that nature renewed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to righteousness; And thus<note n="h" place="bottom">Lev. 20. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>God
sanctifies us</hi> by his spirit, creating us to
good works in Christ Iesus; and he
bids us also<note n="i" place="bottom">Vers. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Sanctify our selves</hi> by a
diligent attendance on the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and holiness of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
That which is of a middle
and indifferent nature, is sanctifyed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102938:43"/>
when we set it apart from common
service and apply it to holy uses. So
our meat is<note n="k" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>sanctified by the word and
Prayer,</hi> so the Priest with his vests, the
Temple with it's utensils, the Sabbath,
&amp;c. become sacred and inviolable;
And who offers a violence to any
thing that thus belongs to God's
<hi>peculium</hi> is profane and sacrilegious.</p>
                     <p>Our request then in this petition is,
That all things may be done to the
glory of God, that he would order his
own counsels, and all the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his providence and his grace
to the utmost advantages of his own
praise; that he would sanctify us that
we might sanctify him in our hearts;
that we may fear before him, that is
dreadfull in holiness; that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
reverent thoughts of him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
him in his infinite perfections, be
astonished at his unsearchable glory,
study his praises, meditate on his
goodness, delight our selves in him,
and speak well of his name, and set
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102938:43"/>
forth his noble acts; that we may take
notice of him in his out-goings, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his providences, mark his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
supplyes and restraints, regard
his mercies with thankfulness, and
mend under his judgements; that we
may wait on him in his sanctuary in
the use of his ordinances, go to his
house in his fear, praise his name<note n="l" place="bottom">Psal. 42. 4.</note> in
the assembly <hi>among those that keep holy
dayes,</hi> attend to his word, keep his
Sabbaths, honour his Ministers, and
give due respect to every thing that
belongs to him; and that we use not
any of his names or titles, but upon
weighty occasions, and with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
And lastly that our whole
life be so holy and blameless, that we
may not give occasion for God's
name or his wayes to be evill spoken
of, but rather that<note n="m" place="bottom">Matt. 5. 16.</note>

presence, which the Iews Liturgy is ful

Messias. Now there is a twofold <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>
or coming of Christ mentioned
in Scripture; The one was when he
came in the flesh, in the form of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to die for us, that he might <hi>reign
upon the tree</hi> as some readings have it
in the Psalms: The other will be,
when he shall come in the clouds
with power and glory, attended with
Angels to judge the world, at that
great and dreadful day, when the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102938:49"/>
trumpet shall summon all to appear
before the tribunal. And when that's
done he shall deliver up the Kingdom
to his Father; and the time of this his
coming and the end of the world,
he hath left here to be the subject of
our prayers, and not of our inquiries,
to exercise devotion not curiosity: the
uncertainty of the time being an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to quicken our diligence in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for it, that we may watch and
pray; he having told us afore-hand,
that he will steal upon us,<note n="p" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> as a thief
in the night. But what need we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves about the age of the
world, when our own time is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
that we cannot call the next
hour our own, and know not how
soon the arrest of death may hurry us
away to judgement? He that dies now
in the Lord<note n="q" place="bottom">Rev. 14. 13.</note> rests from his labour, &amp;
his good works follow him; and if
we cannot properly say that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come to him, we may
safely say he is gone to it. At the end
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102938:50"/>
of the world then is Christ's great
coming, and the general judgement:
but at every single death there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
doom past, when the soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after it's delivery out of the
body is dispatched either into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of life, or lodged in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of death, so that in this sense
Christ may be said to come too. And
there is a gracious visit, when he
comes, and<note n="r" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 20.</note> knocks at the heart, and
calls to his beloved by his word;
When he comes into us, to a feast and
banquet of love furnished with the
consolations of the spirit.</p>
                     <p>The sum of this request is, that God
would declare his power even to the
heathen that know not his name, and
make discoveries of his Majesty by his
outward administrations, not leaving
himself without witness, but convince
profane spirits that there is a God that
rules in the world; that he would
manage the affairs of the world for his
peoples good, and for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102938:50"/>
of the Kingdom of his Son; that
he would bless the civill societies of
men; that he would fill Soveraigns
with wisdom to go in and out before
the people, and people with loyalty to
their rulers, and with love to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
That he would establish the
state, wherein we live, in peace and
order, preserving us on one hand
from the tyranny and oppression of
superiours, and on the other hand
from rebellion and conspiracy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors;
That he would save the King,
whom he hath set (under himself) our
supream Head and Governor, from
all treasons and treacherous designs;
that he would subdue the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, cloath his enemies with
shame, and upon himself let his crown
flourish; that he would give the King
his judgements, and make our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
men of courage, fearing God
and hating covetousness; That he
would preserve us from all dreadfull
calamities, the plague, pestilence and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102938:51"/>
famine; from wars, fires, inundations,
from murder and sudden death; That
he would take a special care of his
Church and his chosen ones; that he
would send labourers into his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard;
that he would endue his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
with righteousness; that he would

he would inlarge the tents of Japhet,
remember his ancient people the
Iewes, gather in the remnant of the
gentiles, send forth his Gospell into
the dark corners of the earth, and
publish the glad tidings of salvation
unto all mankind; that he would fill
up the number of his elect, and hasten
the glorious appearance of Christ;
That he would confound the devices
of all that have evill will to Zion, and
turn the hearts of hereticks, schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,

                     <p>The nature of God is not made up

parts, as eyes, hands, feet, &amp;c. or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of mind, as understanding, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,

taken from men, God being
pleased in holy writ to condescend to
our capacity, and speak of himself after
the manner of men: God is all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
all will; nor is there any
thing in God which is not infinite, i.e.
himself. His will then is not a thing
really distinct from his understanding
or indeed from his essence, neither is
it a blind power as it is in us, that needs
the guidance of reason and the light of
another faculty to be convey'd into
it, to represent the object, and advise
it to choose the good, and eschew
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102938:52"/>
the evil; but is of it self most free, most

God; that of his decrees, and that of
his commands. Nor do these two
cross and oppose the one the other, as
if God decreed one thing should be,
and commanded the contrary: but
they keep a sweet harmony and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

they do keep the same road of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness,

                        <hi>he would have all men be saved, and

then that shall teach that God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
predestin'd any sinner to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and by irreversible decrees
concluded him under an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

if not a lyar, yet (which is the worse
of the two) a dissembler, to say he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires

unavoidable death, and with all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of love to invite them to come

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102938:53"/>
By his decrees he hath from the
beginning set down with himself
what shall be in time, foresees and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
all events to his own end; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that one tittle of his word shall
not pass away, till he have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
his full will, and brought about
his own purposes. Poor weak men
want strength and policy to perfect
designs, and many times we are cut
of in the mid-way by an untimely
death; But God's counsels are laid
deep, and he is of an infinite power,
and lives to do what he doth to the
uttermost. Nor yet does he act so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
as to take from second causes
their freedom of acting or impose a
necessity upon man's will to force it
this way or that. Far be it from any
sober heart to think, that God can in
any sense be the authour of sin:
Should this doctrine obtein in any
man's mind, that all his actions are
from all eternity predetermin'd by
God, so that he must needs do what
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102938:54"/>
he doth, and cannot possibly do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
I should desire that it may
onely be consider'd, what direfull
consequences will naturally insue
from such a persuasion, when 'tis in
good earnest own'd and liv'd after,
and whether all the villany and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schief
in the world will not find hence
a ready justification. Not to say how
vain and useless all reason, counsels,
debates, exhortations and reproofs,
all that by which we are men or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the use of ministry and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and all the arguments for a
virtuous and a godly life, would prove
with one that were obstinately possest
with this opinion, and were resolv'd
to live according to it. But 'tis safer for
us to consult God's precepts, then
tamper overboldly with his decrees;
and to study his will in his commands,
with humility adoring the wisedom
and righteousness of his unsearchable
counsels. These he hath reserv'd to
himself; and locked up from us, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102938:54"/>
the <hi>Arcana imperii:</hi> The other he
hath plainly made known unto us,
and proclaim'd them in his word, and
we hear the sound of them in our
eares; O that they might also sink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hearts to doe them! By these
we shall at last be tryed, when every
one shall receive according to his
works: nor will the decrees of God
prejudice that soul which hath duly
observ'd his commands, or secure
those who wilfully break them. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is the plain rule which we are
to walk by; the book of decrees is that
sealed book, which none but the

to be taken up alwayes with

life should we lead here on earth, if
we could but thus throw all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
at God's feet, contenting our
selves with his disposals, not trouble
our selves with the cares of this life;
but count it our meat and drink to do
his will, to obey him, and trust in him
though he should kill us, to doe and
suffer any thing for his sake, and think
it our honour that we are thought
worthy; to breath after heaven, mind
heavenly things, and whilst we are in
this valley of the shadow of death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves for eternity, by doing
that here in this life, which will be
the whole imployment of the next.</p>
                     <p>To gather up the sum of the whole
petition, 'tis this; That God would
give us patient and chearful spirits so
far, that we may resign up our selves
and our interests wholly into his
hand, and submit to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102938:57"/>
possess our souls with patience,
and count that condition best, which
God out of his infinite wisdom and
tender care thinks fittest for us; as
being well assured, that he doth all for
the best, that he loves us better then
we our selves do; That we should
thankfull acknowledge his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his preservations of us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
for us; And if at any time he
chastise us with wants and distresses,
and exercise us with afflictions, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them as messages of his love,
and tokens of his kindness, not to
murmur or repine under the cross, &amp;
think we are hardly dealt with; but to
account it great joy, and take up the
yoke, and bear the burden quietly,
and cast it upon the Lord who will
bring it to pass; That we may not bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pry into his decrees, nor presume
upon a rash confidence, or despair in
distrust of his love; but adhere to the
plain rule of his word, and busy our
selves in doing his will; That we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102938:58"/>
would tread carefully in the path of
duty and mind the business of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and particular calling, and trust
God with the success in the use of all
lawfull means; That we may not be
discontented, peevish and froward,
when our humours and interests are
cross'd, and when his providence an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
not our desires; but bless God,
when he takes away as well as when
he gives, and give him the glory what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
befalls us: That we may resign all
to his blessed will, and rest fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with his determinations, that in
all cases we may say with our Saviour,

                        <hi>Not my will but thine be done;</hi> That
he would write his laws in our hearts,
and teach us his statutes, and acquaint
us with his will, that we may doe it;
That he would assist us with his grace,
and strength from above for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his commandements;
That he would mortifie our lusts and
the corrupt desires of the flesh: that
we may not set up them in opposition
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102938:58"/>
to his Holy will, but bring every proud
imagination in obedience to him;
That we may be so acted by his spirit,
that we may be quickend in every
good way and work, and be carried
on from strength to strength till we
come to perfection; That we may
have a holy emulation for the blessed
spirits above, and endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them in yielding an obedience
without delay, without murmuring,
and without weariness; That we may
endeavour to the utmost to find out
<note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 12. 2.</note> what that good, that acceptable and
perfect will of God is, and to perform
it, and never think we can doe too
much for him, or suffer too much for
his sake; That we would lay aside all
worldly cares, and<note n="d" place="bottom">Luk. 1. 74, 75.</note> serve God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear in holiness and righteousness
before him all the dayes of our life,
and fit our selves for the business
of eternity, by having our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in heaven, whilest we are here
on earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102938:59"/>
Thus the three Petitions do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concern God, and may also
have particular reference to the three
Persons of the Trinity; That the <hi>name</hi>
of the Father who is God blessed for
ever may be exalted and glorified;
That the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of his Son and his
glorious presence may be hastned;
That the spirit would frame our hearts
to the obedience of his <hi>will.</hi> And to
the three offices of Christ; By whose
<hi>name</hi> as he is our Priest we are saved,
whose name is above every name ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and excellent; who as <hi>King</hi> rules in
our hearts, and will come in trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
manner at the last day to own
his faithfull subjects and be avenged
of his enemies; And who lastly as
Prophet hath declared unto us the
<hi>will</hi> of the Father, and came to do his
will on earth as it is in Heaven, with an
exact unsinning obedience.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the word <hi>Thy</hi> idle, but hath
a great significance, commending to
us that great Gospel-duty of self-denial,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102938:59"/>
which is indeed the essential
character of a right Christian, who
can be content to part with all, so
God may have his due. For so the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is to be understood; <hi>Thy name</hi>
not our honour; <hi>Thy Kingdom</hi> not
our interest; <hi>Thy will</hi> not our humour.
And thus the three petitions seem to
be levell'd at the world's Trinity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Riches and Pleasure. We ought
not to study our own honour, but to
doe all for the glory of God; we must
not strive for deceivable riches, but
set the Crown upon Christ's head;
We should not follow our own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and pursue our own satisfactions
and contents, but submit to God's
will. It is no wonder that this holy
form of Prayer was so displeasing to
the ambitious and factious spirits of
these latter times, a generation of self-seeekers,
who meant to advance their
own names, and get the power of the
Kingdom into their own hand, and
pretended a divine authority for their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102938:60"/>
own will, as if they would have prayed
rather, Our will be done in heaven as
it is on earth: nor did they stick to say
as much, when they father'd all their
mischiefs on providence, and from
their successes concluded God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of their wickedness.</p>
                     <p>These last words, <hi>On earth as it is in
Heaven,</hi> may seem to look back upon
the three precedent Petitions, after
this manner;
<list>
                           <head>on earth, as in Heaven.</head>
                           <item>Hallowed be thy Name,</item>
                           <item>Thy Kingdom come,</item>
                           <item>Thy will be done,</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>May we men on earth praise and
glorify thy name, adore thy power
and Majesty, perform thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and submit to thy holy will,
even as the Angels those ministring
spirits and the blessed Saints doe in
Heaven, saying,<note n="e" place="bottom">Isa. 6. 3. Rev. 4. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
God of Sabaoth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102938:60"/>
Now follow the Petitions which
concern us and our necessities, which
are either temporal supplyes of food,
and a comfortable subsistence, and a
dayly provision, and sustenance; or
spiritual wants, such as are the <hi>Pardo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
of our sins, and <hi>justification</hi> by the
blood of the Son of God, which was
shed for the remission of sins; and the
<hi>strength</hi> of assisting grace, whereby
we may resist and overcome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; <hi>sanctification</hi> wrought by the
spirit of God, dwelling in us, and
cleansing our hearts by faith. So that
these three also may have respect to
the three persons, seeing that they
seem particularly directed to the
<hi>Father</hi> for maintenance; to the
<hi>Son,</hi> for pardon; to the <hi>Spirit</hi> for
grace.</p>

them) which may be the objects of a
right order'd natural desire; and all
those additional advantages, which
the custome of countryes hath made
convenient and agreeable to people,
according to their severall ranks and
qualities; which are all here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> to
teach us frugality and contentedness,
that if we have but bread, we should
be there withall content, and not
grudge at those who have greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
afforded them: For we are not
worthy to feed upon the crumbs that
fall from the table of his bounty, and
if he please to allow us a portion in
the childrens bread, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it with thanks from a fathers
hand; and that providence is never
wanting to supply us with bread, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
experience hath taught us,<note n="h" place="bottom">Psal 37. 25.</note> who
never saw the righteous forsaken, nor
his seed though begging their bread.
Again we may learn hence a thrifty
bestowing of God's gifts, not to lavish
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102938:62"/>
them out in riot, or spend them on
our pride, as the<note n="i" place="bottom">Luk 16. 19.</note> rich glutton, that
wore gorgeous apparell and far'd
sumptuously every day; but rather to
communicate God's goodness, and to
distribute it amongst the poor, and let
others share in our superfluities; which
are the true Christian sacrifices
wherewith God is well pleased,
seeing that all that we ask or can
challenge for our selves is but bread,
and if God give more he does it to
that intent, that there may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of doing good, and exercising
of charity, that he that abounds may
impart to him that wants. Who
would grudge God, if he rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
it, the tenth sheaf, who hath so
freely given him the other nine? Who
would not chearfully feed the poor
with a scant almes, and make a dole of
pence, when God has inrich'd him
with pounds and bless'd him with a
fair estate? But such is the perversness
of worldly men, that they consider
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102938:62"/>
none but themselves, and the more
bountifully God deals with them, the
more niggardly they deal with others;
not fearing to cheat God himself of
his due, and defraud the Priest and the
poor, whom God hath appointed his
receivers of those small returns he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from them for his large kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to them. The covetous miser
that pinches his own belly is a thief to
himself, and turns his bread into
stone. He that hoards his corn
in a time of dearth, is a thief to
society and inherits the curses of the
people. He that spends all on himself,
and considers not the poor, and robs
the Church of her due, is sacrilegious
and profane, and either saith not this
prayer at all, or else sayes it not as he
should; for it teaches us to say <hi>our
Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="exposition">
                     <p>OUR. The covetous and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
person is all for himself; He sayes
in his heart, <hi>give me my Bread,</hi> and
cares not what becomes of others.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102938:63"/>
But this Prayer requires another kind
of spirit, that we take notice of the
wants of our brethren. God is not for
monopolies, that any one hand should
ingross the whole stock of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings;
He will not have one go away
with all, and the rest have nothing
left them; If he give any one more
then is enough to serve his private
turn, what's over and above is a trust
to be laid out for the good of the
community; for estates, honours and
parts, and all the other advantages of
life are talents, and will be call'd for
back again with usury: we are then to
have a mutual compassion as fellow
members of the same body, which
though they differ very much in place
and condition and use, yet are they
all helpfull to one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
together to the good of the
whole body. Nor is this all which
is gathered from this word; but it
teacheth us industry too in some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
way of life, for the getting of our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102938:63"/>
bread: It must not be the bread of
idleness, for that would prove a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to lust; and if we should pray
here for that, e're we come to the end
of the prayer we should unpray it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
It must be ours before it will be
given us; that which was Adam's curse

we cannot yet call it ours, or promise

God give it us.</p>
                     <p>GIVE. If it be given, how is it

What reason is there that a piece of
dry bread should do any more to my
nourishment then a chip of wood, or
a clod of earth? or how comes it to
pass that the meat which was e're
while upon my trencher, is now
turn'd into my substance, and become
part of my flesh and blood, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
spreads it self over my whole
body to the relief of every part, but
that God conveys a blessing along
with it, and hath put a strength into
these creatures to nourish us, and give
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102938:64"/>
us suitable refreshments, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
our nature with faculties and
forces, by a strange kind of Chymick,
to draw out that strength from them,
to digest and ferment their substance,
to distill and fetch from them their
virtue, to throw of the refuse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what's usefull, and bestow it into
so many little vessels, to be carried up
and down through the whole fabrick,
and make up every defect.<note n="p" place="bottom">Matt. 4. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Man</hi>
(sayes our Saviour) <hi>doth not live by
bread alone, but by every word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
out of the mouth of God.</hi> 'Tis
God's <hi>fiat</hi> that does thus virtuate and
commission his creatures to serve us,
and doe us good; 'Tis a <hi>giving,</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
assignment of every ones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
out of God's exchequer; 'tis
not a scramble, catch that catch can.
We must not snatch his gifts but stay
till he give them. The oppressor, the
extortioner, the griping usurer, the
couzning trades man and every one
that takes an ill course of life hath not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102938:65"/>
what he hath given him: he will not
let providence be his pourveyour, but
makes his own craft caterer for his
bread; he will not stay for God's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
but breaks open the exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
and plunders divine bounty. But
such will find the bread turn gravell
in their mouths, and those stoln wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
bitter in the end. What God does
not give, comes without a blessing,
and 'twill be found at last that those
are worst serv'd, who serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Nor must beggers be choosers,
or pass censure upon God's gifts; Be
it more or less, whatever it is, it comes
from the hand of a Father, and is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a rebellious child deserves.
We must neither envy those that have
more given them, nor scorn those
that have less, since it pleased God so
to make the distribution.<note n="q" place="bottom">Matt. 20. 15.</note> Let not
thy eye be evill because thy master is
good; nor censure any one from his
outward fortune. We are all children
of the same Father, and if he gives one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102938:65"/>
child better cloaths and better fare
then another, he sees very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to diversifie his dispensations, and
'tis reason enough to quiet our
thoughts that he hath so order'd it. But
if our curiosity do tempt us to look
out upon the condition of others
about us, let us make this use of it, and
compare our selves with those above
us, to learn humility, that we should
not be proud for God's giving us so
much, since he has given to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more; and with those of lower
degree, to practise thankfulness, that
we may not grumble at God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
who hath done better by us,
then by many our betters. Let the rich
be humble, because he hath nothing
but what he hath receiv'd, and let the
poor be thankfull for the little which
he hath receiv'd; and God if he see it
fit for him will give him more. One
particular duty at our meals we may
pick out here, that we presume not to
feed upon those meats which God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102938:66"/>
hath prepared for us, (for so the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
acknowledges.<note n="r" place="bottom">Psal. 23. 5.</note>

'Tis observ'd of the swine, that

doing it. For a debtor or trespasser
that is not solvent, or hath not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

farthing; which being utterly unable
to doe, he must never hope to come
out, but rot in prison. The same is the
case betwixt God and us, we are
bound to him by our creation to an
observance of his laws, or to undergoe
the penalty of the breach which is
everlasting death; But we are fallen
short and are unable to discharge that
debt, nor are we able to answer him
one word of a thousand; so that there
are due to us all the plagues written
in his book; We have gone astray and
done abominably, we have broken
all his laws and commandments, we
have been rebellious children from
our youth up, and the imaginations
of our hearts have been evill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
we have neglected our duty in
every thing, and have not harkned to
him to obey his voice; so that to us

                     <p>From the different words the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
use some draw an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>formality</hi> of the whole
prayer, &amp; that therefore it is enough,
if we deliver our selves according to
the meaning of the prayer and not in
the very self-same words, the words
themselves being diversely reported.
To this may be replyed, first that this
is but a contention about words; For
though the two words differ a little in
sound, yet they are all one in sense,
and let them use which expression
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102938:73"/>
they like best, so they use one and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the precept which injoyns the
form. Secondly that the various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a word ought not to null and
void the whole form so as to say that
that prayer recited by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is
not the same which St. <hi>Luke</hi> rehearses:
If so; then<note n="q" place="bottom">Psal. 18. <hi>compar'd with</hi> 2. Sam. 22.</note> that Psalm of <hi>David</hi> is not
the same with that which is set down
in <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor would the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
as they are repeated in
<hi>Deuteronomy</hi> be the same as God spake
in the xx<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> because
of the alteration of some words. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
upon this account the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Scripture might be call'd in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
there being hundreds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
readings in the very originals:
now there can be but one right, and
we have no means left us to know
which is that right. But in most of
these there being no point of faith or
manners concern'd, 'twill be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
which of the two we take, so we
take one; or we may make use of both,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102938:74"/>
and that's the third answer, That our
Saviour dictating this form at two
severall times, at second going over
might possibly vary a word or two,
which may be the reason also of most
(if not all) the severall readings in the
Hebrew and Greek Text; the writers
themselves in the several copies tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
from them, altering here and
there a word. And from this ground
may have sprung that liberty which
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> take in their Greek
Translation, they following another
copy much different from the present
Hebrew: And then the command
obliges us indifferently to either, or if
we will to both, sometimes one,
sometimes the other. Not to say in
the fourth place that our Saviour
spoke <hi>Syriac,</hi> &amp; the Evangelists might
allow themselves the freedom of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
to translate the same word
differently, it being a<note n="r" place="bottom">

the Syric Interpreter affords here
no help, rendring it, as the Evangelists

                        <hi>As we forgive them that trespass

upon which we beg forgiveness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to find that favour at God's

that God would deal with us in that
very manner as we deal with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And thus 'tis a very high obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to charity, mutual forgiveness,

it self, would not be hard to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but would lay aside his wrath and
forgive and forget whatsoever has
been amiss. And in this sense the
words afford a powerfull argument
to plead with God for pardon and an
undeniable consequence, <hi>from the less

should we coop him within our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

'Tis meant then not of an even, yet a
just and fit proportion; that as we who
are mortal and finite have a charity in
us, which though bounded with the
measures of time and place and
strength, that we can doe but little
good and that but to few, and that but
a little while, yet 'tis so sincere that we
would to our utmost doe all the good
we can, and which is the greatest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a good nature, are ready to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102938:76"/>
forgive any one that offends us; So he
who is the fountain of all good, the
Almighty, infinite, and everliving
God, would with his infinite charity,
his everlasting love, entertain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
us sinners, and freely pardon all
those offences which we have ever
committed against him. Thus the
reason may be the same of the most
unequal numbers, and finite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
may walk together in the same
proportion; <hi>as</hi> a finite charity is to a
finite offence, <hi>so</hi> an infinite charity to
an infinite offence; <hi>as</hi> man is to man,
<hi>so</hi> and much more is God to man. If
one man be a God to another, as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
makes him; then what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
of God himself? If we that are
wicked forgive one another, surely
God cannot choose but forgive us.</p>

no; on the contrary 'tis a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that he has shed his love abroad

of his having forgiven us first,

obtein the remission of sins. For he
justifies us by the blood of his son, and
sanctifies us by his Spirit. Now<note n="x" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 22.</note> the
fruits of the spirit are love, peace, joy,
long-suffering, gentleness, meekness.
God other while commands us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

&amp;c. And on this very subject to be
mercifull as he is mercifull, and to be
followers of Christ, who<note n="y" place="bottom">1. Pet. 2. 23.</note> when he
was reviled, answer'd not again, but
was led as a lamb dumb before the
shearers: But here he is pleased to set
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102938:77"/>
himself a copy from our actions, and
to take pattern of us, whereby as he
does make a low condescension to
draw his goodness parallel to ours, so
he doth deeply oblige us to forgive
one another, by putting words into
our mouths by which we shall be
judged if we do not; For the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
person that sayes this prayer,
prayes backward, and does indeed but
curse himself, and he who bears a
grudging mind against his brother,
puts in a caveat against himself, and
prayes that he may not be heard. And
to a peevish, humorous, passionate,
revengefull spirited man God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the argument. Art thou a worm
and canst not indure to be trod upon?
canst not thou who dwellest in the
dust brook an affront, nor bear with

should tamely put up the injuries
which are offer'd to his honour? Dost
think it reason for him to pardon thy

to use violence for the recovery of a

though infidelity &amp; impenitency may
have a main hand in shutting heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates

yet if our Saviour give us a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the proceedings which shall
be at those great Assises, (as 'tis Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
to think he did not) the great
damning sin for which reprobates
will stand arraign'd will be the want
of charity. His offences then will be
inexcusable who was a rigid exactor

are so critical in the study of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
that we examin looks,
censure behaviour, and let nothing

for innocence to enter our company,
and our conversation is an inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102938:79"/>
We make our very tables snares,

And if any one hath indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
ill at our hands, to be sure, we
let fly at him bitter words, murder
him in our thoughts, and seek all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
for a desir'd revenge. And
can such a one exspect that God
should swallow his camels, who has
so queasy a stomack and narrow a

O let no one be so desperately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull,
so ill natured to himself, as
to persue an enemy beyond the hopes
of heaven, and purchase a revenge
with the loss of his soul. He forfeits his
own pardon that can't forgive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Consider at what a cheap rate
God sets his pardons to sale. For thou
maist wipe off thy own score with thy
brother's faults; his moats will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

assigns. What they can't pay thee,
God strikes off of thy account; what

How much reason hast thou
to forgive and thank too any one, that

reclaim thee from thy sins, and put
thee in a capacity of God's pardon?
And shall he that is at this pains about
thee to fetch thee home to thy Father,
and bring thee to Heaven, be thought
to doe thee ill offices, and not deserve
a pardon for his courteous malice?
What good shrewd turns are these?
What friends more beneficial then

To what end courts of judicature,
where injur'd persons may have right
done them? Besides that war upon

nor reward us according to our sins:
But that he would deal bountifully
with our souls, and of his free grace
pardon us; that he would accept of
what Christ his Son, our surety, hath
done and suffer'd for us, to take away
the sins of the world; that he would

There are many wayes and
many leaders; we are often at a stand,
and through ignorance know not

have need of being led. <hi>Moses</hi> led the
children of Israel through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

being naturally as weak as we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
our understanding dark, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102938:89"/>
our will lame and crooked: Nay, and
when we are acquainted with the

apt to be misled, to goe back, or start

every step we tread is snare, and
unless God order our goings, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us in his way, and bear us up with

fall into sin, and run into errour. The
world, the flesh and the Divel, lay
baits and traps for us. The instigations
of Satan, the vanities of the world, the
counsel and example of wicked men,
and the corrupt desires of our own
flesh misguid us, and put us upon
dangerous occasions of ill, rocks of
offence, and pits of destruction.
Wherefore seeing that sin doth so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily

put stumbling blocks in our way, nor
countenance those evil guides and
ringleaders of mischief, which seek
our soul to destroy it, by leading us
himself into temptation. But do not
we lay an imputation upon God's
goodness in praying, that he would
not lead us into evil and sin?<note n="w" place="bottom">Iam. 1. 13.</note>

Oh outragious confidence! O a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
void of all ingenuity, past all shame

All these things,</hi> all which things?
Base bold feind, hast thou any thing
to give? All too? all at a clap, false

of thy own but evil, hell and
death, the wages of sin. All that's
good is God's already, or if thou hast
any thing to give, dost know, saucy
creature who it is thou speakest to?
wilt thou offer thy maker any thing?
dost think that hee'l take any thing at
thine hand? If he stood in need, would
he pass by all his creatures, canst ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

a present to him thou hatest? What
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102938:93"/>
wouldst thou have him doe for't?
wouldst thou purchase his favour?
Hast a mind to buy thy peace and
compound for pardon? spare thy gifts,
bring thy self, repent and beg that
thou mayst have leave to fall down at
his footstool, and worship before the
mercy seat; canst thou confess and
forsake thy sins? Thou hast<note n="i" place="bottom">Prov. 28. 13.</note> Scripture
for't, and thy former discourse shews
thee well read in Scripture, thou shalt

on purpose to reconcile sinners, and
save what was lost) will be easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to intercede for thee, and get
admittance for a faln Angel, nor is all
his charity tyed to faln men; thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Angels, whom thou left'st in
heaven, trust in him and worship him.
And why maist not thou hope the day
of thy return is coming, now that
heaven gates are set open to all that
will enter, &amp; the Kingdom of Heaven
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102938:94"/>
suffers violence? And thou hast greater
reasons to prevail with thee for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
then miserable men have, as
knowing the great happiness thou
hast parted with, and having so long
felt the torments of an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
thy own hell, and of that hell
which thou art heating for others. If
any man were in thy case, who yet is of
a shallower understanding and sense
then thou art, would he not willingly
leap out of those flames in which thou
fryest? would he not gladly be freed
from the wrath of God, which thou
hast for so many ages lain under, and
which for ever thou must lye under
unless thou canst repent? And to what
end shouldst thou stand out any longer
in an enmity to him that overpowers
thee, to whom thy hatred can doe no
hurt, who constantly baffles thy
counsels &amp; defeats thy strengths, and
has bound thee with everlasting
chains? one would think this very
conflict might sufficiently convince
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102938:94"/>
thee, how poor thy malice shows, and
how successless all thy attempts? No;
Repentance is a doctrine to be
preached only to men; as the good
Angels cannot sin, so neither can the
bad repent. The Divel is but enraged
with the tidings of salvation, and his
dispair imboldens him, and he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to be damn'd for ever. He has
an inveterate hatred, and implacable
malice against God, which has call'd
him forth now unto this defiance. He
hates the very thoughts of being bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because he cannot be so out of
God's company; he hates God, as
God hates sin, with a perfect hatred,
and would treat with God upon no
other terms then this, that God would
not be. Out of hatred to God he hates
himself, and is contented to foregoe
his happiness rather then to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it, and buyes his spight with
endless torments. If God should rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
him (as he is) in heaven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
him from his bonds, he would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102938:95"/>
look on the favour as a more painful
imprisonment, and account heaven
his worse hell; Though he knows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
that nothing he doth against
God shall prosper, he thinks it success
enough of his plots, that he has
shown a contempt; and in this very
temptation of Christ nothing pleases
him so much, as the effrontery of it,
that he could (as his servant<note n="k" place="bottom">Luk. 23. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Herod</hi>
after did,) mock him and set him at
nought, when he was not suffer'd to
doe him any more hurt. For what is it
he tempts him to? that which he could
not have impudence to hope would
be hearkned to, that which he knew
was impossible for Christ in his very
nature as well as in his will to doe; to
sin; the holy one to commit a sin.
Oh audacious tempter! couldst thou
offer to corrupt him who knows no
sin with a bribe? couldst thou fancy
the judge of all the earth could be
made doe wickedly for reward, when
every upright judge scorns to have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102938:95"/>
bought? many an honest lawyer
will not be hired to be an advocate for
wrong? But oh Divelish impudence!
what, sin? He had tempted him before
to distrust and then to tempt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and seeing Scripture, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
it, would not prevail, is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
by a double repulse; but that
he might go of with a boast, seeing he
could not with conquest, shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
right Divel, and belcheth out a
blasphemy big enough to fill the wide
mouth of hell. He would have his
Maker and his God turn Idolater, he
bids him that dwelleth on high fall
down, such a fall too, as would be
lower then the divel's own fall; for it
must be below him, it must be to him;
<hi>Fall down and worship me.</hi> Oh impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
blasphemous absurdity! what
divel could put such thoughts into
Satan's heart, such words into's
mouth? that God, whom all the Gods
worship, should himself worship. For
he knew very well whom he had to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102938:96"/>
doe with in this encounter, that he
was the Son of God, having been
often cast out by him, &amp; confessing it
here with an <hi>If.</hi> And whom, what
wouldst thou have him worship? an
image? an idol? stocks and stones? why,
thou canst not perswade any men that
have their reason about them to doe
so; What is't? some Saint or Angel?
Thou knowst his Angels have charge
of him and are bid worship him: what
then? speak, Lucifer? <hi>me.</hi> Oh diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
pride! oh unsufferable rudeness!
which a poor creature can hardly
have patience to hear; that God, at
whose name the divels tremble,
should be tempted by the divel to
worship that divel that tempts him.
Me thinks, one cannot read this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
without a great horrour, and an
agony of fear, that God should suffer
his onely Son, God equal to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
to be tempted by the divel to the
foulest of sins, Idolatry, to the worst of
creatures, the divel. What care and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102938:96"/>
vigilance ought we to have? what fear
and jealousy? How should we watch
and fast; and prepare our selves for
spiritual conflicts, and beg strength
from above, that our hearts may be
garrison'd and kept by grace; And
since Christ himself was thus brought
into the clutches of Satan, what great
reason have we to pray that we may
not be led into temptation?</p>
                     <p>Now there is a twofold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
one for tryal, whereby God doth
keep the graces of his Saints in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise;
so<note n="l" place="bottom">Psal. 7. 10.</note> God searches the hearts, and
tryes the raines of the children of
men, as silver is tryed in a fornace.
Thus <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith, <hi>Iob's</hi> patience,
&amp;c. were tryed, nay sometimes God
leav's his best servants to themselves,
and lets them catch falls to keep them
humble, and to let them know that
their strength is from him. God
tempts for tryall, the divel onely
tempts for sin, and sometimes too God
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102938:97"/>
imployes the divel in his tryals to heat
the fornace, which he does with an
intention to destroy, but God orders
for experiment and probation. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
is for hurt, when we are tempted
to sin, to presumption or dispair. Thus
God tempts no man, but judicially
hardens impenitent sinners that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
themselv's in their evil way, and
gives them up to their lusts, and into
the power of the divel. Thus we read
he harden'd <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a lying spirit into the mouth of
the Prophets, let Satan tempt <hi>David</hi>
to carnal confidence, and the pride of
numbring his people; and our Saviour
after the divel had filled <hi>Iudas</hi> heart,
bid him doe what he meant to doe
quickly; meaning that horrid treason
of betraying his Master. And of this
kind of sinfull temptation is this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be understood, though it
mean also the other kind of tryals.</p>

'tis Gods usual course to heighten the
rewards of his tryed servants, which
<note n="q" place="bottom">1. Tim. 4. 7.</note> have fought a good fight, and layes
up a crown of glory for them. Indeed
in every temptation the tempter
comes by the worst, and 'tis to the
divel's disadvantage; for if it take, 'tis
true 'tis his hellish delight to see souls
perish, yet however it increases his
guilt as being accessary to anothers
sin, and consequently must needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his punishment &amp; improve his
torments: If it meet with repulse, it
cannot choose but be great torment
to this spightful spirit to see that he has
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102938:99"/>
been instrumental in raising the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and furthering the salvation,
and heightning the gloryes of the
Saints; every baffled temptation is a
step higher into glory, and (if I may
say it) we get up to heaven on Satan's
back, by trampling him under our feet.
A Saint goes triumphant with a train
of conquer'd lusts and (as <hi>Samson</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

the gates (the powers) of hell to force

We are lyable &amp; exposed continually
to temptations. But God takes out the
sting and the venom of them, and
whilest the wicked fall under the evil,
the righteous goe free: that what is

that enemy. And thus 'tis said,<note n="x" place="bottom">1. Ioh. 5. 19. <gap reason="foreign">

that God would not himself tempt us,

manner of evil, both bodily &amp; ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both temporal and eternal, both of

would deliver us from a hard heart,

presumptuous sins and contempt of

return again to folly; that his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
grace may be accompanied with
sanctifying grace, which may keep us
blameless, that we may become tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Holy Ghost, and he may
dwell in our hearts by faith, which
may quench the fiery darts of the evil
one; That he would not leave us to
our selves at any time, but instruct us
with his eye, and guide us in the way
which he shall choose for us; That he
would not for our many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102938:102"/>
in judgement, harden our hearts
&amp; deliver us up to a reprobate mind

conclude us under a state of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and give us into the power of
Satan, to be led captive at his will,
who is the God of this world who
rules in the hearts of unbelievers;
That he would hedge our way about,
so that the opportunity of sin may be
denyed us, and that, though it easily
beset us, yet we may not fall into it;
That he would keep us from presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on his mercy, or despairing of it,
that so being carried with the full
sails of faith, as neither to split at that
rock and make shipwrack of a good
conscience, or sink in this gulf and be
swallowed up in sadness, we may work
out our salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
That he would not bring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

support us in it, and give an issue out

to direct and secure our paths, that,
though we are surrounded with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
yet he ordering our steps, our
soul may escape as a bird from the

save us from the destroyer, that walks
to and fro on the earth, seeking whom
he may devour; shorten the tempter's
chain, and put a hook in his nostrils,
that neither the divel, nor any wicked
man, or evil thing, may have power
to hurt us; That he would keep us in
his wayes, least our foot should at any
time dash against a stone of offence;
That he would refrain our foot from
every false way and work, suffer no
vanity to have dominion over us, that
we may not grow worse under his
judgements, or his mercies, but that
all the dispensations of his providence
about us may be so improv'd, that his
fear and love may constrain us, and
keep us in the walk of our duty; That

shame and punishment which attends
it; that he would not let the fierceness
of his wrath break out upon us, nor

desires, <hi>Thy Kingdom</hi> will be advanc'd,
<hi>thy power</hi> made manifest, and <hi>thy Glory</hi>
promoted. 'Tis not for our selves we
ask, nor can we think our poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
an argument sufficient to
ground a confidence on, but for thy
names sake. Alas! should we aim at
<hi>Kingdom, power</hi> or <hi>glory,</hi> what poor

                        </gap>, short-liv'd thing would it
be, bound up within the measure of a
transitory life of a span length? but
thine lasts to ages of ages, thy <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
has the same date as eternity, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
commenced, never shall exspire;
thy <hi>power</hi> reaches from everlasting to
everlasting, and thy <hi>glory</hi> indures from
generation to generation. 'Tis our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102938:105"/>
earnest request that thou wouldst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the honour of thine own
name, that thou wouldst not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy self in the vindication of
these thy glorious attributes, nor let
them suffer by turning thy face away
from our prayers.</p>
                     <p>And thus these three words may
cast back a respect to the several peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as has been before observ'd; to
those which concern God, in this
manner. <hi>Thine is the Kingdom,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let <hi>thy Kingdom come,</hi> since it doth
of due belong unto thee. Again <hi>thine
is the power,</hi> therefore let <hi>thy will be
done;</hi> for whose will should carry but
his, whose will no one can resist? And
lastly, which was propos'd first in the
petitions, (that the Prayer might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

might be the <gap reason="foreign">

we proceed to ask in our own behalf,
wherein yet those attributes seem to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102938:105"/>
be no less concern'd, with some such
reflection as this. <hi>Thine is the Kingdom,</hi>

                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s care to provide bread for
his subjects: how much more will our
King and our God supply all our
wants, and allow us necessaries? <hi>Thine
is the power,</hi> therefore <hi>forgive us our
sins,</hi> for<note n="c" place="bottom">Mar. 11 7.</note> who has power to forgive
sins but God? Oh! that it would please
thee to shew this thy power in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
our iniquities, and not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
them! and lastly again, <hi>Thine
is the glory,</hi> wherefore <hi>lead us not into
temptation,</hi> whereby we may bring
dishonour to thy name; <hi>but deliver us
from evil,</hi> that we may glorify thee,
the author of all our good.</p>
                     <p>And all these requests to be granted
not for the present only, for a day, or
an age; but this provision for his own
glory and our wants to be <hi>for ever;</hi>
because his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and his <hi>power,</hi>
which are the store, whence this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
is to be made, and his <hi>glory,</hi>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:102938:106"/>
which is to be provided for, are <hi>for
ever;</hi> as also our wants need a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
supply. Now these his attributes
having been in ages past, and being to
last for all ages to come, by former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of those that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and our own, beget a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the future, that as<note n="d" place="bottom">Psal. 22. 5.</note> our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
trusted in him &amp; were not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
so succeeding generations shall
find, 'tis not in vain to seek him, and
that he, whose goodness is unexhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will not be weary of doing good.
So that the eternity of Gods perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ingages our posterity to hope
in him, and concludes this prayer fit
to be used as long as the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Doxologie</hi> or Conclusion of
the prayer is set down only by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions it not, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the <hi>Church</hi> in her offices
leaves it out; nor does this difference
plead any thing against the formality
of the prayer it self, or the omission of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102938:106"/>
this part prove, that the whole may be
omitted and laid aside. For as't has
been said before, Christ propos'd this
Prayer upon two several occasions, at
two several times; one was,<note n="e" place="bottom">Matt. 6<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 9.</note> when he
was preaching his Sermon on the
mount before a great multitude of au<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ditors,
wherein he delivers in a large
discourse the sum of Christian institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the dutyes of a holy life, of
which Prayer being none of the least,
himself propounds a pattern for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and use.<note n="f" place="bottom">Luk. 11. 1.</note> The other was more
private in the company only of his
disciples, when after he had been at
prayers by himself, they desir'd him to
teach them to pray, as <hi>Iohn</hi> had done
his disciples, whereupon he gives
them this form for their constant use,
at least upon solemn occasions, <hi>when
ye pray, say,</hi> &amp;c. Now this latter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of it leaving out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
shews, that it is not an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of the Prayer, necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, but an addition that may
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102938:107"/>
be spared, indifferent to be used or not;
wherefore whether thou say the Lord's
Prayer this way or that, so thou say it
one way or other, either with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
according to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> so as
to be one of the Christian multitude;
or without it according to St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
so as to be one of the disciples, we shall
not quarrel; only do not thou quarrel
at his wisdom, who thought fit to vary
some expressions in the self same form,
on purpose to please thee, that thou
mightst have a liberty of choice, there
being an express command to use it,
and thou left to thy freedom to take
which thou wilt.</p>
                     <p>One thing may yet perhaps be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
why the Church should follow
St. <hi>Luke</hi> in this omission, and take the
rest from St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> whose words
in expressing the fourth and fift peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
differ from St. <hi>Lukes?</hi> To this
some perhaps will answer that the
<hi>Doxologie</hi> is of a questionable authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as suppos'd to have crept in out of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102938:107"/>
the <hi>scholion</hi> or margent into the text,
wherefore it being without all doubt
omitted in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel, &amp; being
doubted in St. <hi>Matthew's,</hi> (the <hi>Vulgar</hi>
&amp; <hi>Arabic</hi> Translations having it not<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>)
that the use of it might breed no
scruple it was thought fit to be quite
left out: But allowing it a full authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Church may surely be allowed
the same freedom, which any private
Christian hath, of using which form it
shall think fittest for publick service.
Wherefore seeing both the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
doe agree so far as the petitions,
which make up the prayer, the Church
might judge it convenient to lay aside
the rest, and therein follow St <hi>Luke.</hi>
And again because St. <hi>Luke's</hi> language
is more elegant, and difficult: St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's</hi>
on the other side, according to
the simplicity of the Hebrew style,
being more plain and facil, might
consequently be deemed fitter for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
use, especially when St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
himself sayes that our Saviour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102938:108"/>
did dictate it to the multitude; which
variety of style together with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Interpreters, (who are used to
render the same things differently,)
being consider'd, may also evince that
this prayer, though deliver'd by our
Saviour upon two several occasions,
might be the very same in the <hi>Syriac</hi>
language, which our Saviour used,
though it be diversly express'd in the
Greek: St. <hi>Matthew</hi> perhaps more
closely adhering to the words then
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who according to his <hi>genius,</hi>
to keep an accurate propriety of the
Greek tongue, might take the liberty
a little to vary. And of this we might
produce many instances, in several
discourses of our blessed Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by them both, which though
variously reported by both, nay by all
four, yet were plainly meant for the
same, so that both the forms, though
not exactly agreeing in all the words,
are but the same Prayer, and he that
uses either of the forms sayes the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102938:108"/>
Prayer, no less then he that should say
it in <hi>Latine</hi> according to <hi>Pagnin's,</hi> or
<hi>Steven's</hi> or <hi>Beza's</hi> Translation, who
yet may differ in the plainest sentences,
(as not using the same pen, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
sometimes out of the meer study
of variety) shall be thought to say his
<hi>Pater Noster</hi> in Latin; only he that
would use it in Latin, would no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
choose that Latin translation
which he thought came nearest the
Original, which is here the Churches
case.</p>

                  <head>THE
TEN COMMANDEMENTS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD, when he had erected
the stately frame of the
World, and furnished the
scene of nature with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinds of creatures, prescribed an
order &amp; course, in which every thing
should move; for his command doth
as well determine the actings of his
creatures, as it did produce their
beings: Thus the great wheel of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
keeps an orderly and constant
course; and, as in a watch or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
curious piece of workmanship,
every small parcel of his work ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the rule of it's motion, and is by
that principle, the workman's hand
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102938:131"/>
put into it, guided to those ends for
which it was made. And this is the
<hi>Law of Creation,</hi> by which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
pay an obedience to their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;
for as they depend upon his
power to Be, so 'twas fit they should
be directed by his wisdom to Act.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi>
which God, as supreme Soveraign
and absolute Lord, and proprietour
of all things, has the sole right of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing.
By this the heavenly bodyes
dispense their influences, and steer
their motions, which when excentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
are not irregular. The Sun knows
his place of rising and setting, and it
must be miracle that either stops him
in his wonted rode, or puts him back.
The Moon is constant to her changes,
and all the stars fixt to their stations,
nor doe the wandring stars rove out
of those bounds which God hath set
them. The very inconstancy of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and vicissitude of seasons is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by this Law, and when any thing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102938:131"/>
in the Elements happens extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as that fire should refuse to burn,
water deny to drown, &amp;c. 'tis because a
more particular warrant hath super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded
the general commission, which
was sign'd at first; for the law giver has
power to alter his own laws, &amp; make
what exceptions he please: which was
the ground of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, who
though by the general precept forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to kill any one, yet upon special
command thought himself obliged
to sacrifice his own and onely Son.
To this Law are subject the Sea also,
ebbing and flowing, from &amp; towards
the shore; God having appointed it
its bounds, beyond which it may not
go; and the Earth with all plants and
fruits which grow on the surface of it,
and stones and minerals in the bowels
of it, according to the rules of each
kind.</p>
                  <p>Of this Law a paricular branch is
that, which we call <hi>natural instinct;</hi>
whereby living creatures, which are
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102938:132"/>
indued with sense and motion and a
faculty of propagating their like, to
wit, Birds, Beasts, Fishes and creeping
things are regulated in the managery
of their care and converse. Hence
springs that tender affection, which all
damms have for their young ones, the
conjugal fidelity of pairs, the rules of
order and government amongst so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
such as Sheep, Bees, &amp;c. After
this manner it pleas'd the faithfull
Creatour to provide a Law for the
well-being of his creatures; without
which the universe would have been
still a meer <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> void and
without form. This is that ligament,
which binds the jarring Elements in a
league of amity, and sets every thing a
work, quietly to its own ends, so as to
preserve the whole; and were it not for
this, all things would run into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>But man being a creature of a more
excellent make, and having the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese
of divinity stamp'd upon him,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102938:132"/>
(being made in the likeness of God,)
was not to be coop'd up within the
same measures as his fellow-creatures,
and be guided to his duty by blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts
and a reason without him; but
had a greater latitude as of knowledge
so of liberty allow'd him; for it was
thought fit, that he, who was to have
dominion over the rest, and to act So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
among other creatures,
should be intrusted with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of himself. Wherefore he had
an understanding &amp; a will given him,
whereby he might see and choose his
rule, and might determine himself to a
generous obedience. And these facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his were (as all things else were
that God made) at first very good; his
understanding right and wise, his will
holy and just, of perfect sufficience to
lead him to the right, and of as perfect
an indifference to leave him to the
wrong; besides, his affections pure
and free from all disorder. Now that
man might not pride himself in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102938:133"/>
upon his own excellencies,
and that God might from this his
Vicegerent and Prince of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have some small acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of subjection, it pleased him to
make a command of tryall in a slight
matter indeed (the eating of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
but loaded with a grievous threat,
<hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
shalt dy the death:</hi> The breach of so
easy an injunction upon so solemn a
denunciation aggravating the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and the contempt of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.
And see, how hard it was to
persist in good, even for him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never knew evill? How slippery
a State Innocence, when there is but
the least temptation to debauch it?
How frail a thing the best of men, if he
be left to himself? A toy tempts <hi>Adam</hi>
from his obedience and his happiness
together, and from <hi>Eve</hi>'s hand, which
administred the sin, he took his death
too. Then were forfeited all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
priviledges of his Creation; then
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102938:133"/>
were defaced all the resemblances of
divine perfections; then was his soul
as well as body left naked of all graces
and virtues, &amp; his original righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
turn'd into <hi>original sin;</hi> then were
his dayes cut short by bringing a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
upon himself and his posterity,
so that he, not <hi>Cain,</hi> was the first mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer;
then was lost even that awe &amp;
authority, which he had over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures; who after man turn'd
rebell withdrew their allegiance too;
And 'tis not unlikely that by the sin of
man the affections of the very brutes
have been debauch'd from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
temper; Hence possibly those
enmityes and antipathies, which some
kinds of creatures have to others, that
before in the golden age of innocence
liv'd at peace; hence those quarrels &amp;
animosityes, which those of the same
kind exercise; &amp; hence perhaps those
(I may say) vitious miscarriages and
enormous misdemeanours of several
indiviudal creatures, those especially

which are man's domesticks, &amp; have
a more familiar acquaintance with
his manners; as dogs, swine, &amp;c. which
sure, had man continued innocent,
would have kept to rules of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
modesty, and such other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as was fit for the goodness of the
supream Law-giver to prescribe for
the preservation of peace and good
order amongst his creatures. Thus
hath the <hi>Fall of Man</hi> put whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into disorder, spoil'd the natural
principles of honesty and justice, and
by abusing the Liberty of doing good
or evill, brought us all into a sad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of doing nothing else but evill;
that, whereas he had only a possibility
of sinning, 'tis impossible for us not to
sin.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore when God saw that
those notions and inclinations, which
he had implanted, were by the fall so
batter'd and marr'd, that they could
be no longer usefull for those great
purposes of his own service &amp; man's
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102938:135"/>
felicity; &amp; that man had now darkned
his understanding, deprav'd his will,
and corrupted his affections, &amp; made
himself in all his faculties and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
a vassal of sin; he was graciously
pleas'd out of the rubbish of those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
&amp; that law which he had
written in man's heart, to collect, and
set down in writing, a Law, by which
man might be instructed to his duty;
that humanity might not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into beast, and withall to
show that God hath not lost his right
to command, though man have lost
his ability to obey. 'Tis true, that all
the time before the flood, and some
good while after, man-kind was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by an unwritten Law, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
notions of right and wrong, and
traditions handed to them by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks
from the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
such as was the worship of God
by offering sacrifice and first fruits, by
calling upon his name, and keeping
the Sabbath, &amp; those precepts which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102938:136"/>
were given to <hi>Noah</hi> and his three
sons: and thus some remnants of the
primitive integrity were alwayes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the customes and usages of the
most savage people, that had no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
law to walk by; whence arose
that which we call the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
all nations agreeing in some
common principles at least of publick
justice, and God instructing them by
his Sun and his rain, though he did
not teach them by his word and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.</p>
                  <p>Yet when the number of men was
multiplyed into so many nations,
(which began to difference themselv's
by manners &amp; religions as much as by
languages and countries,) and their
lives shortened so, that tradition could
not be conveyed so purely to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as formerly; it pleased God to
choose to himself a peculiar people
among all the nations of the Earth,
even the family of his friend <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
to whom he might make more
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102938:136"/>
particular discoveries of his will; and
having four hundred years affliction
in Egypt, and a miraculous delivery
thence, prepar'd the children of Israel
for the receiving of his Law, he did
in open audience from the top of
mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with his own Mouth
pronounce aloud, and afterwards
with his own Hand fairly ingrave on
two Tables of stone the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;</hi>
which though they be
in a special sense termed the Law of
God, yet the whole Scripture may be
and is so stiled often, in as much as the
History of the Bible doth but serve to
represent examples of obedience or
disobedience to this Law, and the
Prophetical writings are but explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and comments upon it, and the
Psalms and other sacred pieces are but
Meditations and pious descants. This
is that we call the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> the
rule of manners and the guid of life,
which teaches every man how he is
to behave himself both towards God
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102938:137"/>
and towards man, whether as he is
considered barely in his person or in
his relation.</p>
                  <p>There is mention made also of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laws of Gods making which
were peculiar only to the Iews: the
<hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law which sets down
rules for sacred persons, places, times,
assemblyes, vests, utensils, sacrifices,
and other rites; and for the ordering
of all Ecclesiastical affairs: and the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial</hi>
Law, which provides for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of propriety and peace, for
the creation of Magistrates and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of Iustice, and all politick
concerns. Now though these were
indeed so proper to the lewish State
and Church, that no other Nation is
strictly obliged to their observance; &amp;
although the Levitical Priesthood is
ceast, and the Ceremonies, being but
types and shadows of Christ which
was to come, were at the rising of
that Sun of righteousnesse made void
and useless to the Iewes &amp; dangerous
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102938:137"/>
to Christians, since the use of them
would tacitely imply a denial of our
Lord's coming in the flesh, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
prove down right Antichristian,
he being<note n="a" place="bottom">11. Ioh. 7.</note> the Antichrist, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that: yet I know not why States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should not think themselves
obliged to respect the lawgiver's wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and the equity of the thing,
though the law it self doth not oblige;
as in the case of thieves, a fourfold
restitution would look like a more
proportionable punishment then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death, no goods amounting to
the value of life, and a Bridewell or
Plantation be a sorer course to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
the malefactor for his mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
actions, &amp; surer to recover him
from his wicked habits, then the goal
and gallows. Again God's Law hath
given adultery it's due, punishing it
with death, the honour of the sufferer
being irreparable; whereas man's
law commonly is so remisly either
made or executed, that all the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102938:138"/>
the injured person must expect
is from his own patience, fearing least
by a challenge of justice, he make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but the object of a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
Nor do I see, why the use of
any innocent Ceremony in gesture or
vesture, &amp;c. should now be deemed
unlawful upon this ground, because
the Levites perhaps used one not
much unlike; or why the Governours
of the Christian Church may not in
things indifferent order the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,
as were used in the Iewish,
and yet not lye under the scandal of
Iudaisme: as to instance, shall a white
vest now be less becoming, because
the Levites wore linnen? surely if this
argument hold, blacks will be much
more mis becoming the holy order, as
being the colour by which the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Priests<note n="b" place="bottom">Call'd thence <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Kemarim,</hi> i e, <hi>Atrati.</hi> Zeph 1. 4.</note> were distinguisht. But
'tis not perhaps the thing so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
as the imposition. They
would be left at liberty, and have their
obedience as indifferent, as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102938:138"/>
'Tis too manifest, what this
means; they can brook no superiours;
they would have no authority over
their heads; for 'tis confest on all
hands, that God cannot be served
without form and Ceremony, of time,
of place, of persons, and that a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
govenment, whereby we may
know him that officiates from the rest
of the company, is expedient. Now
set pride and faction aside, and 'tis easy
for any indifferent man to judge,
whether it be fitter to obey the grave
and deliberate constitutions of the
Fathers &amp; Governours of the Church,
or be led by the sudden and mutable
fancy and humour of every parochial
Teacher, especially such as these late
times have afforded us many, whose
forms it has bin unsafe to say <hi>Amen</hi>
to, and whose postures and garbs have
rather moved the laughter of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and the pity of serious auditors,
then their devotion. Whose discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will it be best to trust to? And if
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102938:139"/>
there be such a thing as Church-Government,
where will it lye, if not
in determining things of this nature?
Besides such stragling Pastours do not
consider, what a sorry example they
set to their flocks; for how can they
expect that obedience, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
refuse to pay? or how can they
hope to exercise a Pastoral authority
over their hearers (amongst whom
some peradventure are men of as
large abilities and as great learning &amp;
piety as themselves) when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
affront the Episcopal authority
which is over them? But they resolve
to be directed wholly by Scripture,
and will do nothing without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Text. I wish they would but
take notice, what advantage they
reach out to all schismaticks, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
and how easy 'tis to use their
arguments for the overthrow of all
decency and order, contrary to the
Apostle's rule,<note n="c" place="bottom">1. Cor. 14. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>let every thing be done
decently and in order.</hi> Where's Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102938:139"/>
say they, for surplice, for cross,
for kneeling? Has not the schismatick
improv'd this objection to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerably?
Shew me Scripture for
gown, for black cloak, for capps, for
pulpit, for bells, for churches, for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister's
set maintenance, for any thing,
for every thing. Thus we see, if this
hold, nothing wil stand. In short, some
habit, some place, some posture, &amp;c. is
necessary to the worship of God; but
what particular habit or form or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
is fittest to be used, that which
the wisdom of the Church prescribes,
or that which the discretion of each
private Pastour shall make choice
of, I shall leave to the sober Reader
to judge. Again 'tis not the Ceremony
so much troubles some, as the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
of it; as though any thing could
be appointed, which an ordinary wit
will not make significant. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself (if learned men mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
not) was not so scrupulous, who
hath transcrib'd into Christian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102938:140"/>
several usages of the Iewish
Church, even to the very expression,
as in the Lord's Prayer, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lord's Supper, several
passages whereof are quoted out of
the Iewish Liturgies and Rituals. To
conclude, it concerns us to be very
wary of changing old well-laid cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
though they be but superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
for fear of shaking the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and let some men please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(as they list) in their spiritual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
(as they call it) or itch (as<note n="d" place="bottom">11. Tim. 4. 4.</note> the
Apostle calls it) wofull experience has
taught us, that the Church is in great
danger, where she is left to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of particular ministers. Not to
say, that discontents and quarrels
about the circumstances of religion,
as they give vent to schismes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
in Church; so they often
lead the dance to seditions and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
in State; for Schisme and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
likely go hand in hand, and men
would be as willing to have their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102938:140"/>
liberty as their spiritual; and it may
be observ'd, that those pens, which
have travell'd most against Prelatical
tyranny (as they term it) have bin ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
incouraged to go on, and strike at
civil power, as liking no Monarchy
whether in Chair or Throne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us study peace, and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shew our selves good Christians
by our self-denial, by submitting our
discretion and our abilities to the
rules of the Church and the wisdom
of our superiours; yet let us out of
love to our Country act the part of
good Subjects, and not with unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
discontents and unseasonable
quarrels indanger the imbroiling of
three Nations in the miseries of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
war; having found by tryall, that
Discontent improves to faction, and

shape could not affright us, we might
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102938:141"/>
be startled with the dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of those plagues and evils,
which it brings along with it. Now
the Nature of God's Law is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the laws and institutions
of men. God's Law is perfect, and
has provided for every condition
of men and for all their actions;
here's no rule wanting which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
nothing redundant or over
much; but the ordinances of men are
but poor scantlings &amp; consequences
drawn out of a shallow reason, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
by further experience, new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
still requiring new supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
God's Law is pure &amp; holy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a Holy God, &amp; making
those holy, that place their studies and
indeavours in the exercising of it: but
those laws, which are derived from
the puddle of humane reason, carry
along with them the mixture of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
passion and interest &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and many times down-right
wickedness and injustice being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102938:142"/>
in the very frame and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of them. And above all, where
as the politick devices of men can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restrain the outward man, and lay
traps for words and deeds, but cannot
insnare the freedom of thinking; God
being Lord of the Conscience, his
statutes reach conscience, captivate
the mind, and apprehend each guilty
thought: and whereas here on earth
plots and conspiracies against autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
are made out only by what has
bin done or said, God's supremacy
will arraign those that rise up against
him by the evidence and verdict of
their own conscience.</p>
                  <p>This Law being so perfect, so pure,
and so holy, 'tis impossible for us, who
are altogether evill, by our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

are not able of our selves so much as
to think a good thought; so that, if we

Nor doth this Law of Faith
void and null the Moral Law, but
the terrours of the Law drive us
to imbrace Gospel-terms; for
which reason the<note n="h" place="bottom">Gal. 3. 24.</note> Law is called <hi>the
Scholemaster to Christ.</hi> For when
a sinner is convinced, how unable he
is of himself to fulfill the demands of
the Law, and how his multiplyed
transgressions render him lyable to
the curse of the Law and the fierce
wrath of God, he in the apprehension
of his own guilt and insufficience flies
to the Mediatour (as to a city of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge)
who hath fulfill'd the Law for
us, and hath undergon the wrath of
an offended God and the curse of a
righteous Law, that he might be able
to save those to the uttermost, that
should put their trust in him. Neither
doth the Law of works cease to be
of use to those, that are in Christ, and
are now under the Covenant of
Grace; for Obedience as well as Faith
is required, as a condition of the new
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102938:143"/>
Covenant; for it must be a Faith
<hi>acted</hi> or <hi>acting by love,</hi> and, though
the person is justified by faith, yet that
faith must be evidenced by good
works:<note n="k" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 6. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

                     <hi>Shew me,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<hi>thy faith by thy works.</hi> The Moral
Law then remains still in force, as a
rule of this obedience: as it shews our
misery and drives us to Christ, so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
our gratitude, when we are in
Christ. The Law is a glass to present
us with a sight of our sin, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our past actions with the rule;
and a lanthorn too to direct us in the
path of our duty, by comparing our
future actions with the same rule. In
the one respect we see at what distance
we have lived from the rule, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
in the other respect we see how
to keep close to it, and amend our
lives. The Law indeed has lost it's
damning power as to the righteous,
but 'tis still in force to direct; &amp; though
they are acquitted from the curse by
the merit of our Saviours death, they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102938:144"/>
are not discharged from the duty,
as being risen again with him to a
newness of life, and created in him
to good works. Nay, their obligations
are heightned, and they are to have
greater respect to the Law, that they
may proportion the measures of their
gratitude to the merits of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:
for they, who have had
much forgiven, must love much, and
love is the fulfilling of the Law.
Christ having bought us with a price,
we are no longer our own to fulfill
the lusts of the flesh, but we are his;
and we shall be known to be his by
loving one another, and keeping his
commands. And 'tis plain, that he
meant not to release us from the Law,
but rather to improve and inhance
the observation of it; and in those
things, wherein the ties of the Law
were slacken'd, either by God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
or false glosses and corrupt
customes of men, to fill it up, and
clear it from mistakes, and lay greater
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102938:144"/>
weight on it's precepts; as appears by
his Sermon on the mount, wherein
he goes over most of the particulars.
And what the Apostle sayes before
conversion,<note n="l" place="bottom">Rom. 7. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>If it had not bi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for the
Law, I had not known sin;</hi> so we may
say after conversion. Were it not for
the Law, we should not know our
duty.</p>
                  <p>The Law is divided into <hi>ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi>
whence 'tis called the
<hi>Decalogue</hi> or ten Words, which were
written upon <hi>two Tables,</hi> four on one
Table, and six on the other. 'Tis
not amiss to take notice of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision:
the Law is a rule of practice,
and the hand the great instrument of
action, a Table for each hand, and for
every finger a Commandement. A
brief survey of the method &amp; scheme,
by which the commands are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
we may take thus. The first
Table sets down the duties we ow to
God, the second Table contains our
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102938:145"/>
duties to Man, our neighbours and
our selves. All is but Love, but with
difference of degrees; for our love to
our neighbour must be subordinate
and inferiour to our love to God; so
our Saviour hath resolved the summ
of all;<note n="m" place="bottom">Matt. 22. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, with all thy
mind, with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength.</hi> to as high a degree, as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
we can; for it may be supposed
that these several words signify but
the same thing, that is, the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of love. It would be too Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
perhaps to make a different sense
of each word, that <hi>the heart</hi> should
signify the will, <hi>the mind</hi> note the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<hi>the soul</hi> stand for the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and <hi>strength</hi> imply our bodily
service. It means sure the whole
man. <hi>And thou shalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self.</hi> And that one would
think should be very well, but this
Law teacheth us how to love our
selves too. There's scarce any one doth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102938:145"/>
that so well as he should doe. Our
neighbour cannot quarrel us, if we
love him as our selves; but God will
not be content with that; he will be
loved above every thing, above self
it self. We must love every thing else
for God's sake, and God for his own.
The duties to God take up the first
place, and those being discharged will
<hi>√† priori</hi> effect the second table duties.
He that go's thorough the first table,
will never boggle at the second. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Knavery are inconsistent.
Can he be holy that's unjust? fear God
that honours not his King? doth he
conscientiously fear an Oath, who
makes no conscience of a Lye? a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
professor and a cheat? a strict Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
keeper and an Usurper, a Rebell?
scrupulous of idolatry, and yet delight
in adultery, and indulge himself in
schisme, envy, and other works of the
flesh? If these things may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
then Saint and Divel, Christ and
Belial, heaven and hell may be joyned
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102938:146"/>
together. Such men's religion is vain.
The duties to man follow in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, and will <hi>√† posteriori</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the first table duties, and he
that's thorough paced here gives a
fair evidence, that either he has made
or means to make his progress fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
An honest man and yet an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist?
a charitable person and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous?
a loyal subject, a good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and yet a swearer, a Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker?
the Morality of such men is
as counterfeit, as the other's Religion
was: for how can he be faithful to his
Prince, who is false to his God? or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
charity aright towards men,
who fear's not God's displeasure? We
must not part the two tables, but take
them together, spiritualize our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and civilize our religion.</p>
                  <p>Our love to God is seen in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
we give him; now the worship of
God is either internal, of the inward
man; and that is prescribed in the <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>st</hi>
command: or external, and that is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102938:146"/>
shewn forth in our gestures, directed
by the <hi>second,</hi> in our words and
speeches, which are the subject of the
<hi>third;</hi> and in our work all the week
and our rest on the Sabbath, which is
the business of the <hi>fourth</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Our love to our neighbour is
consider'd either relatively to our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
&amp;c. in the <hi>fifth;</hi> or absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to all men what so ever, in the rest;
and that either externally in his body,
as to hurt, in the <hi>sixth;</hi> as to defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the <hi>seaventh</hi> command; in
his goods, in the <hi>eighth;</hi> and in his
good name in the <hi>ninth;</hi> or internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which strikes at the root of all, evil
concupiscence, in the <hi>tenth</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
So that the first and last
do more particularly restrain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, the rest do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
order the outward man; yet so
as that the thoughts and desires
also are reduced to the same heads.</p>
                  <p>Having taken this brief survey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we proceed to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102938:147"/>
in particular, 'tis necessary to
take along with us three or four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rules, according to which they are
all to be understood. <hi>One</hi> is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Affirmative precept includes a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and on the other side where
any sin is forbidden, there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vertue is injoyn'd: thus the
Commandements are like the flocks
of <hi>Engedi,</hi> every one bears twins. The
Commandements are most of them
negative, there being but two, the
fourth and fifth, that are set down af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively;
yet he that has but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
religion, will hardly be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Law. 'Tis not enough not
to kill thy neighbour, not to steal
from him; but thy charity must be
imploy'd in helping him, when he is
in danger and in want: nor will it serve
turn, that we do not worship images,
nor take God's name in vain; but we
are bound to worship God, and to
make a reverent use of his name. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi>
is, that where any duty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102938:147"/>
or any sin forbidden, there
the several kinds, degrees, causes, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
signs, circumstances, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else belongs to that duty or
that sin, are together with it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or forbidden; as murder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it hatred, quarrel, and all
manner of hurt. The expression in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is scant, but very comprehensive
and of large sense. The <hi>third</hi> is, (which
was partly toucht at before) that in
every command not only gross acts,
but together with our deeds, our
words, and above all our thoughts
are consider'd; it being God's prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
to be a searcher of hearts, and
God of all parts requiring the heart,
and having erected there his judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even our own conscience: and
this was that great advantage of God's
Law beyond all humane laws, that it
orders the thoughts, and divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the joints and the marrow. 'Tis
not sufficient then to have a demure
outside like the Pharisees cups and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102938:148"/>
platters, but we must keep a clean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side:
for God requires truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts. And this is indeed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that Evangelical obedience
aims at, sincerity, &amp; the right ordering
of our thoughts &amp; desires is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch of Christianity, as giving God
the great glory of his omniscience. A
<hi>fourth</hi> may be this, that all Virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in a mean hath two extreams,
on each side one, a vicious excess and
a vicious defect, which both fall under
the prohibition, though but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be named. The Atheist which
owns no God at all, is as much a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour
of the first precept, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheist,
who has a multitude to pay
his devotions to. Fondness may be as
great an errour in love, as too much
severity. Prodigality transgresses the
bounds of a liberal disposition, as
covetousness comes short; when we
are bid not covet that which belongs
to another, it is not meant we should
fling away what's our own. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102938:148"/>
we must keep a middle road, take
heed of being righteous too much or
too little, we must neither turn to
the right hand nor to the left. The
<hi>fifth</hi> and last rule is this; That the same
Grace or Sin, the same good or bad
act may in several respects, be reduc'd
to several commandements; as the
eating of the forbidden fruit, and the
disobedience of <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife, &amp;c. Indeed
the whole circle &amp; round of virtues,
is like a gold-chain, where if you
break off one link, you spoil the whole
chain; whence may have proceeded
that note of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> That<note n="n" place="bottom">Iam. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>he who
breaks one Commandement, is guilty of
all;</hi> not so much because the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Law-giver is the same in the
several commands, as by reason of
that mutual coherence and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which the Commandements
have with one another. Most sins,
are made up of a complication,
and are like a bed of snakes enfolded
together. To this head may be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102938:149"/>
brought those sins which are of a
transcendent nature, and are scarcely
to be lodged properly and directly in
any one precept, but seem rather to
include the violation of them all: such
as are Pride, Hypocrisie, Ignorance,
malice, profaneness, sloath, with their
opposite virtues, meekness, sincerity,
discretion, charity, zeal and diligence,
&amp;c. And some other Beldam sins,
which are the womb and outlet of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sins; as presumption, despair,
drunkenness and covetousness, which
the Apostle hath branded as<note n="o" place="bottom">1. Tim. 6 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the root
of all evill:</hi> and their contraries, Faith,
Hope, Temperance, contentedness,
&amp;c. which all seem to be accumulated
habits, and so resolve themselves into
many, if not most parts of the Law.
Taking these rules along with us, we
shall with the more ease take the just
measures of each command in its full
latitude; for God's<note n="p" place="bottom">P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

as the Psalmist has observ'd, are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
broad:</hi> Much matter deliver'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102938:149"/>
in few words; for so it became the
Majesty of the Law-giver to use plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and brevity, to help the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and ease the memory of the
hearers, and he that would to purpose
understand the Law of the Lord,
must meditate in it day and night, that
so he may time his duties aright, and
be like the tree planted by the river
side, which bringeth forth its fruit in
due season, and thus whatsoever he
does shall prosper.</p>

time with that hast, as if the whole
Law had been but one word; but at
the second going over, leisurely and
distinctly. Whereupon they say, that
in this portion of Scripture the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
are upon every word doubled,
to denote that double delivery, the
one a note of speed, the other of stop
and pause. This (I suppose) they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the two words here used, as
if he <hi>spoke</hi> them in hast, and <hi>said</hi> them
at leisure; or whether they thought it
fit the Law should be delivered twice
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102938:151"/>
by word of mouth, as well as twice
written upon tables. Whether this
were so or no, matters not much; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it should be our prayer and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that they might be spoken over
twice to us, to the ear first, and then to
the heart, to the inward man as well
as to the outward; &amp; though we have
not the advantages of those terrours
and dreadful circumstances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Law was at first delivered, to
prepare us with a prostrate humility
and a devout reverence, yet let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that we hear the trumpet sound
to judgement, and awaken our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and let us think we see the flames
of Hell, &amp; those everlasting burnings,
whither the transgressors of this Law
must be dispatch'd, and possess our
souls with fear, and hearken what the
Lord will say to his servants.</p>

redeem'd us from a spiritual Egypt,

of creation; thou shalt observe my
providences, stand in aw of my Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and have regard to my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
nor shalt thou ascribe whatever
befals thee to chance or fortune, to
thy own wit or strength, but look on
all events as the contrivances of my
wisdom, and the effects of my power;
Thou shalt bear a love to my name,
and take thy delight in my Law; Thou
shalt give up thy heart to me, and
serv me with truth in the inward
parts; Thy understanding shall be
busily imployed in feeling after me,
and finding me out, according as I
have made manifestations of my self,
in my word and in my works, and
shall guide thee by the dictates of my
holy Spirit. Thy will shall be enclin'd

according to the rules of Holiness

shall be wholly carried out to me as to

believe in me, and put thy trust in me,
and love me, and love those that doe
love me, and hate those that hate me,
and what I hate with a perfect hatred
<hi>Sin;</hi> thou shalt rejoyce in my favour,
and delight thy self in me; nor shalt
thou take any occasion of sadness but
from my displeasure, and let fall thy
countenance when I hide mine; thou
shalt meekly submit to my disposals,
and burn with zeal for my glory; thy
soul shall cleave fast unto me, and
thou shalt serve me faithfully all the
dayes of thy life; Thou shalt behave
thy self alwayes as in my presence, and
shalt have respect to me, and be afraid
of doing any thing that may offend
me, in the deepest retirements of thy
most private thoughts, for all things
lye open and naked before me.</p>

aggravation of the sin, that
the setting up another God, though

                     <head>The second Commandement.</head>
                     <p>The first prescribes the object of
our worship, and forbids a false God;
This regulates the manner and way
of worship, and prohibits a false ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the true God. And herein the
confidence of the Roman-Church is
to be admir'd, which to defend its
Idolatry, fears not to commit sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and casheirs this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from being one of the ten, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they make good amends, by as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
parting the Tenth, as they have
audaciously remov'd this. And what
they say for themselves, that they doe
not worship the Image it self, but God
at, or by, or through the Image, and
that the service is transient to the Idoll
and terminated upon God, is no more
then an ingenuous Idolater of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Rome would have said; seeing
no man of understanding could be so
blockish, as to pay the civility of his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102938:160"/>
devotions to a log of wood, or to an
Artist's phantasm, and caress a dead
thing; but they surely meant their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration
to the Deity represented and
understood by that gross resemblance.
Possibly the vulgar sort lookt no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Idoll it self, which may
(I suppose without breach of Charity)
be thought of a great part of the Laity
amongst these Christian Idolaters,
whose Ignorance is the mother of
their Devotion, who if they knew
God better according to the first
Commandement, would not worship
Images contrary to the second.</p>
                     <p>This Commandement hath two
parts, an Explication, and a Reason;
The explication first of the object
what is meant by Idoll, set down in
two terms, <hi>Graven Image, or any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
amplified by Induction or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
enumeration of things in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above, in the earth beneath,</hi> or <hi>in
the water under the earth,</hi> which are
the three great parts of the Univers,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102938:160"/>
wherein all things are contained: by
this means leaving no evasion for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
no thing, no place unnam'd, that
might be abus'd to such a purpose.
Secondly of the Act, what the making
to ones self means, and that in two
terms too, <hi>Bowing down to them,</hi> or
<hi>Adoration,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> or <hi>service,</hi>
For so the word in the original ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it, forbidding the <hi>Dulia</hi> the
lower worship, as well as the <hi>Latria,</hi>
the higher, and voiding that idle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of two sorts of religious
worship. The Reason is fetch'd from
the nature of God, represented here
by four attributes, His power for he

For indeed friendship consists in

of wills: And 'tis the nature
of love to seek by all means to please
the party loved, and not to cross his

is the true mark of our love to God, if
we are carefull to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

which God takes the greatest care of,
and is most jealous of the breach; and
it may justly occasion our wonder, to
consider that notwithstanding God's
strictness in propounding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and his severity upon the
breaches; yet his own people have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102938:170"/>
been ever forward to run into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to take example from those
very nations, whom they themselves
for this very sin, have by God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
rooted out of their land and
country: So that it should seem there
was but too great reason, why this
reason should be set particularly to
back this command.</p>
                        <p>The meaning of the precept is this.
Thou shalt not make use of any
Image, whether graven of whatsoever
metall, gold or silver; or cut out of
stone, or carv'd in wood, or fashion'd
in wax, or what other material soever,
or any picture drawn or pourtray'd
in cloth, paper, &amp;c. or any likeness
and resemblance of any creature in
the whole world, for a religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in the way of worship, upon any
pretence. Thou shalt not worship the
work of mens hands, or the work of
their brains, neither Image nor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
none of my creatures, much
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102938:171"/>
less any of thine own. Thou shalt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worship them, nor me by them;
but shalt consult my word, and fetch
thence the rules and wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
Thou shalt not be led by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Heathen-people, whose ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of me may be some excuse to
their Idolatry, to follow their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and turn my glory into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any corruptible thing. The Sun
and Moon and Stars above thee shall
not dazzle thy mind by their lustre, so
as to forget me, and pay that homage
to those glorious lights, which is due
to me, who live in unapproachable
light; The trees and springs, bread and
wine, and other blessings of life, shall
not for their usefulness and for that
helpful virtue, which I their Creator
have put into them, win so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy affections, as to asscribe that
honour to them, which belongs to
their Maker; nor shall the wonders of
the deep, and the prodigious secrets,
which I have laid in the womb of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102938:171"/>
the seas, swallow up thy admiration,
so as to drown that respect which
thou oughtst to have for me; the sight
of whatsoever excellency, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
or dreadfulness in any of the
creatures, shall but serve to give thee
an occasion of magnifying my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
perfections, and goodness and
power; not to fix thy devotion upon
them; for I commanded and they
were made for my own glory, and
for thy use, not for thy worship; The
Angels thou shalt respect as my mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
and receive my errands with
reverence, but shalt not by worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them make them my fellows<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
The Saints who now rest from their

shall not fright thee into religious
observance, being able to doe no
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102938:172"/>
more hurt then I let them; Thou
shalt not with base flattery Idolize the
persons of men, whether they be Good
or Great, but carry a respect subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to me; In fine, Thou shalt not set
thy affections, and respects upon any
thing, so as to make it an Image of
jealousy. Thou shalt not fall flat on
thy face before any creature, or its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
nor bow thy knee nor kiss
thy hand, nor make any other sign of
adoration, nor pray to them, or before
them, or use any other gesture of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
however thou mayst pretend to
direct thy intention; nor shalt thou
pay them any religious service or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
by building groves, temples
and altars, by making priests, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
sacrifices or any other rites.
But thou shalt worship me the Lord
thy God, and me alone shalt thou
serve, in body as well as soul; for I am
the Creatour of both; and though I
am a spirit, and am to be worshipped
in spirit and in truth, yet your bodyes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102938:172"/>
also shall be temples of my holy spirit,
&amp; I will be sanctified in them in the use
of such holy rites and Ceremonies, as I
have appointed, &amp; shall hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
in my word and by my Church;
that all things in my service may be
done decently, &amp; in order. Thou shalt
therefore worship me according to my
appointments, come to my house in
my fear, &amp; behave thy self with care
and reverence in the holy place, whilst
thou art in my presence, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all religious acts, and shalt
bow down to me, &amp; kneel before the
Lord thy Maker. Thou shalt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with witches, or use other unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means, nor shalt thou regard sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries,
or any superstitious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.
Lastly, thou shalt give thy self
up wholly, both in body, soul and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to my worship, and shalt dedicate
thy self so to my service, that thy body
also may become a Temple of the
holy Ghost. And all this thou must be
the more carefull of, that thou mayst
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102938:173"/>
not deprive me of that homage,
which I expect from thee, and give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my glory to another, when thou
considerst my jealousy to observe such
indignityes, and my power to avenge
them; the severity of my Iustice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
Idolaters and their posterity
after them, and the multitude of my
Mercyes to them and theirs after
them, who have a respect for me, and
a care to keep my commands.</p>
                        <p>Now if we would take notice, how
full the world is of Idolatry, when
neer three parts of four in the whole
habitable world are Mahumetans and
Pagans; and the greatest part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is ingag'd in Image-worship;
what cause have we to fear the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
judgements of a jealous God?
How guilty has this Land of late been
of the basest Idolatry, in the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
addresses to usurping powers,
and imputing the villanous artifices
of wicked men, to the holy Spirit of
God? How have schisms, like armyes

up to a lying spirit. How is Self and
Sin made the great Idol of all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,

God to witness a lye. Two
Observes that word <hi>Iehovah</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi>
helps us to; as having a double Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;
<hi>One</hi> is, that however a false or a
vain swearer may pass, as to the notice
and penalty of humane Lawes, God
will find out the offender and punish
him. <hi>Another</hi> is, that it is said here
only, <hi>the Lord,</hi> whereas before, 'twas
said <hi>the Lord thy God,</hi> to shew that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
and rash oaths are sins of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that God will not only punish
his own people for, but even the
Heathens and Infidels, whose <hi>Lord</hi>
indeed he is, but he is not their <hi>God.</hi>
And Heathen story is full of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
wherein the breach of oath
has been constantly followed with
remarkable vengeance. And that is
intimated in that negative threat,
which signifies more then it speaks
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102938:175"/>
out, <hi>He will not hold him guiltless;</hi>
meaning, that he will most certainly
punish.</p>
                        <p>The sense of the Command then is
this; Thou shalt not use my Name
upon a design of cheat, and to cover
a lye; thou shalt not forswear thy self
by calling me to witness a known
falshood, and thus call some heavy
vengeance upon thine own head: But
thou shalt, when thou art call'd by the
Magistrate thereunto, bear faithfull
witness to the truth which thou
knowst, and shalt make good thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
Thou shalt not blaspheme my
Name, by rash and needless oaths, nor
upon every mean &amp; paultry occasion
make mention of it; but shew a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

so requires, and Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
for the decision of strife, and

shalt swear by me, and by me alone,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102938:176"/>
who onely know the secrets of hearts,
and am able to avenge the falshood.
Thou shalt have an awfull respect for

shalt walk in my fear, in thy distress
call upon my Name, be frequent in
Prayer, and in praise, lift up thy heart
and thy voice to me who hear in
Heaven, and so order thy conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

that thou mayst not cause my

glorifie me, and by thy example may

                        <p>Let us but take a view of our selves,
and see whether we are such as the
Lord will hold guiltless. Have not we
taken the Lord's Name in vain, when
generally it has been used as a stale to
base interest, and a cloak for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
and tyranny? when our Pulpits
have prefix'd the Name of the Lord
to the blackest designs, and those who
would be thought strictest in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
the Name of the Lord, have
set on foot rebellion, under the title
of <hi>the Cause of God?</hi> when there has
been such breaking of Oaths, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Covenants, against the Laws
of God and man? In so much that for
our swearing backward and forward,
as the villany of these late times has
taught men to doe, we may justly be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102938:177"/>
term'd the perjur'd Nation? when our
orthodox teachers have been thrown
into corners with indigence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
that the basest of the people
might fill their hands, and become
Priests to a Tyrant's interest? when
prosperous villany has been bless'd in
the Name of the Lord, and suffering
Innocence has been impleaded as
guilty? when swearing is in so much
credit &amp; is look'd on as the Character
of Greatness, and rash oaths have the
reputation of Gallantry? when we that
have the Name of God call'd upon us,
live unworthy of that calling, &amp; make
his Name be evill spoken of? O! let
us pray as the Church has taught us,
<hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline
our hearts to keep this Law.</hi>

'tis not the seaventh day onely, but all
seaven, that we are to serve God in.
He that would serve God well on the
Sabbath in a holy rest, must first serve
him in his week's labour, and doing
the work of the six dayes well. The
<hi>second</hi> and <hi>third</hi> concern the Manner
of his worship, <hi>This</hi> more especially
the Time. It hath also, as the other
two had, two parts; the Precept and
the Reason of the precept. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
is attended with a large explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what is meant by <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
what meant by <hi>Keeping</hi> it <hi>Holy.</hi> First
we may take notice of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, wherein it is deliver'd;
'tis usher'd in with a <hi>Memento;</hi> Then
what is to be remember'd; <hi>the Sabbath</hi>
and <hi>the Sanctification</hi> of it: Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the explication, What is the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:102938:178"/>
by Opposition <hi>first</hi> to our dayes
of work, the other dayes of the week;
<hi>six dayes shalt thou labour and doe all
thy work,</hi> which indeed is precept too,
as well as concession, no less a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to oblige us to diligence in our
calling, then a Grant to give us leave
to follow it. And the injunction is
twofold, that we <hi>labour,</hi> take pains in
our imployment, set our selves a
work; and that we finish and make an
end of our business, <hi>and doe all that we
have to doe.</hi> Then <hi>secondly</hi> by Position,
which punctually sets down the day,
<hi>But the seaventh day is the Sabbath.</hi>
What is it next <hi>to Sanctify</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
or <hi>keep</hi> it <hi>holy? To doe no work</hi> on
that day, nothing of our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imployment, wherein the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Command appears,
that all of the family as well as the

The reason is taken from God's own
example, whereof we have first the
Narration, how he <hi>made all things in
six dayes and rested the seaventh;</hi> and
then the Design of his so doing, that
he might appoint the Sabbath, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

FOR IN SIX DAYES, THE
LORD. This is the reason of the
Command, and shews farther the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of it, that we would not think
much to doe as God himself did, and
indeed the morality of it too: for this
reason concerns all mankind, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,

THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IN
THEM IS. He finish'd the work of
creation, and did all which he had to
do, in that first week of the world.
And it would be worth our imitation,
to consider, how God takes a review
of every day's work, and it would be
well for us, that we could every night,
before we take our natural rest, take
account of our actions, and see that
they are good; and at the weeks end
before we enter upon this spiritual
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102938:185"/>
rest, survey the work of the whole
week, and say of it, not that it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good, but that at least it were
not exceeding evil. Two things in
the method of God's working may be
worth our particular notice, that<note n="v" place="bottom">Gen. ch. 1.</note>

o're night, what he should doe next
day; and that God made man last on
the very Sabbath-eve, as if he had
made him for no other purpose, then
to keep the Sabbath, in the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his works, and the celebration
of his praise.</p>

                        <p>AND RESTED THE SEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTH
DAY. God might have been
working on still, and set forth his
power, in new productions; for Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
cannot be tired, nor Infinity
be exhausted; but he was pleas'd to
put a period to his own extraordinary
actings, and by his own will determin
the products of his boundless power.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102938:186"/>
Again, if he had pleas'd, he could have
dispatch'd all his works in a day, in a
moment, and not have made such
leisurely progress, and have done all
at once; But he chose a number of
dayes to accomplish his great design
in; <hi>six dayes,</hi> that there might be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
proportion, and distance of time
betwixt the productions of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
creatures; and but six, that the glory
of his workmanship might not receive
any disparagement from a seeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
Now whether these six dayes, in
which the world was making, were
meant to signifie the continuance of
the world for so many thousand years,
a thousand years being in Gods reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but as a day, and the seaventh day
of rest to typifie another thousand
years of Christ's reign, or an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sabbath in Heaven; or whether
any other mystery lye hid in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

might appropriate the seaven Planets,
each to his day; and fonder Art divide
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102938:186"/>
the week according to planetary
hours, may be guess'd, but cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be known. Wherefore it may
suffice us, that it pleas'd God so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his work, and so to appoint a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rest: and he sure had very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for observing that order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                        <p>How far have we come short, of

                        <p>But it seems in the ordinary oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of Providence to fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
many times, when the dutyfull
child is caught away with a hasty
death, and a Loyall Subject looseth
both Life and Lands for his fidelity to
his Prince, &amp;c. To this I answer, That
this promise is conditional, as God
sees fit, who, whatsoever he does,
does it alwayes for the best, and then
if he doe not perform his word, as to
the Letter at present, he will be better
then his word hereafter. Those, whom
the arrest of death disseizes of an
earthly possession, he instates into a
heavenly inheritance, which is indeed
<hi>the Land of the living,</hi> and <hi>the Land
of promise,</hi> of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was but
a type. The young Innocent is
snatch'd out of the mother's lap, to be
lodg'd in Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom.

case in the no less sad then
wicked times of Anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
when damnable Heresies broke

and down, when there was an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Toleration of all Religions
but the right; when we comply'd
with illegal powers, and were aw'd
by Courts of High Injustice; when
partyes bore rule, as false to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as they were injurious to the
publick; when our sins grew up and
multiplyed with our calamityes, and
God's judgements, and our provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
improv'd one another; when
our Oaths of Allegiance were eluded
with the Solemn cousenage of a
League, and sinful combination;
when we were bewilder'd with the
witch-crafts of Rebellion, and
knew not the things which belong'd
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102938:200"/>
to our peace, but pretended to reform
abuses by destroying the offices; when
with tumults and Libels we drove
our Dread Soveraign from his home,
rais'd a war against him, chas'd
him as a Partridge over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and offer'd violence to the
Lord's anointed; when with unduty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hands we seized his Sacred Person,
confin'd him to prisons, and vex'd his
righteous soul; when we (for 'twas our
sins did it, and we are all Accessary)
by a villanous mockery of Iustice
brought him to his tryal, &amp; sentenced
him, and (which is more than our
posterity will have the heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
done, though we could find
hands to doe it) barbarously murder'd
our Gracious King at his own Palace-gate,
adding all the direful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of aggravation to that hellish
impiety; when ever since our <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s
death, our great sin has been our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
we have suffer'd in acting,
and been constantly exercis'd with
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102938:200"/>
unconstancy of wicked changes;
when Loyalty hath been persecuted
as the greatest Crime, and many have
shorten'd their dayes for their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to their Prince; and after that our
Crown, &amp; Head too, was fallen; when
the Father of our Countrey liv'd in
exile, and our Mother the Church
mourn'd in private, and was sed with
the bread of tears; when Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were despised, and labourers
thrust themselves into the harvest,
to cut down dignityes and profits,
root and branch; when the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
were dispensed by the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and Civil Offices administred by
the Base; when there was no regard
had to the Ancient and the Wise, to
the Noble and the Learned, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
was powred out upon Princes.
In short, when we have thus rebell'd
against King and Priest, and cast off
Authority to purchase a freedom for
schism and mischief; what need have
we hereafter to pray fervently with
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102938:201"/>

when my glory or the benefit of thy
neighbour requires it; Thou shalt not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:102938:217"/>
give in a false evidence, nor plead a
wrong cause, nor favour injustice, nor
tell a lye to advantage; Thou shalt not
knowingly say that, which thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to be false, with a purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others, nor shalt thou be over
confident in affirming what thou art
not sure of; Thou shalt not basely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
and pretend one thing and
mean another, for God is the God of
truth; Thou shalt not speak or think
ill of any one in thy heart, by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
evil surmises, and taking up a
reproach, or ill report against him;
Thou shalt not be curious to spye out
his faults, nor critical and censorious,
nor shalt thou slander him with thy
tongue, or speak ill of him behind his
back, and flatter him to his face; but
thou shalt make the best of his actions,
&amp; put the fairest interpretation upon
his carriage; Thou shalt speak all the

his failings, believe and hope the best,
and not give ear to all thou hearest, &amp;

thou seest good in him, and be as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his reputation as of thy own;
Thou shalt not be double-minded,
nor hasty in thy promises, nor false in
thy purposes, but sincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
that thy sayings and doings may
agree; Thou shalt bridle thy tongue,
and avoid foolish speaking, and let no
rotten communication come out of
thy mouth, but with steady gravity
weigh thy words aforehand, &amp; speak
to edification; Thou shalt not discover
secrets committed to thy trust, nor
vainly babble of every thing thou
know'st, nor yet conceal necessary
truths, but be faithful and trusty in thy
silence, and discreet in thy speech;
Thou shalt not be churlish, of difficult
address, and hard to be spoke with,
nor yet full of insignificant comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and artificial craft; but shalt shew
thy self courteous and affable, ready
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:102938:218"/>
to hear and to answer; Thou shalt not
be clownish and rude in thy converse,
nor yet act the buffoon by abusing
Scripture, or jeering thy betters, or
other foolish drollery, but use civil &amp;
chearful language, and according to
thy company and occasion fit thy
discourse; Thou shalt not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
and magisterial in finding
faults, nor yet cowardly and fearful of
displeasing, but tell thy neighbour
freely of his sin, when thy duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it of thee, and opportunity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites;
Thou shalt not impudently
proclaim thy sin, and brag of thy evil
doings, nor be too confident in boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy gifts, but leave it rather to a
stranger to commend thee; nor yet (to
shift duty, or out of vain glory) speak
meanly of thy self, and lessen thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
but shalt put a just value
upon thy self and thy parts, that they
may be useful; and be wanting in no
fair and modest way to keep up thy
credit, and maintain thy reputation.

Above all, thou shalt by a blameless
conversation indeavour to keep a
good conscience before God, and a

things which may make thee well
spoken of; And yet thou shalt not be
over fond neither of thy reputation,
so as to affect applause, but design ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to live to conscience then to
same, and whilst thou dischargest thy
duty, not to look on good report as
thy reward, nor to be discouraged

thy brother, nor yet love him with
that sondness, as to honour him above
me; Thou shalt not love the world,
nor the things of the world, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
all thy love to thy self; Thou
shalt take heed of all unchast love, and
wanton dalliance, but thou shalt love
thy neighbour with unfaigned Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and make after whatsoever things
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:102938:223"/>
are good, and of good report; Thou
shalt not give thy self to immoderate
joy, or to over much melancholly;
Thou shalt not rejoyce at any ones
misfortunes, nor be griev'd at his
well-doing, or look upon him with
an evil eye. But thou shalt keep an
even and composed spirit, equally
temper'd to joy and sadness, that thou
mayst rejoyce with them that rejoyce
and weep with them that weep, that
<note n="v" place="bottom">Iam. 5. 13.</note> thou mayst in thy grievances pray,
and in thy mirth sing Psalms; Thou
shalt not be too confident nor yet too
distrustfull of thy self, neither shalt
thou place thy trust in man, nor too
much stand in fear of him, seeing his
breath is in his nostrils: But thou shalt
hold so even a balance betwixt thy
hopes and fears, that thou mayst in
Charity endure all things, and hope
all things, and that thou mayst walk
with care and circumspection, and set
thy heart upon thy way; Thou shalt
not break out into passions, upon
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:102938:224"/>
slight occasion, or study revenge, but
shalt keep in thy anger, and when my
glory calls for't, imploy it in zeal and
sin not; Thou shalt cleanse thy heart,
the fountain of actions, denying all
ungodly lusts, mortifying the desires
of the flesh, wrestling with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and fighting the good fight
against thy three grand enemyes, the
world, the flesh, and the Divel; Thou
shalt not nuzzle thy self in carnal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and give thy self to idleness, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting
thy prayers and thy dutyes,
and opening the door to temptation,
and fatning thy heart for destruction;
Thou shalt strive against the first sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of thy lust, and shalt crush the
cokatrice in the egg, before vanity
have got the dominion over thee;
Thou shalt withstand the evil one,
that he may fly from thee, that having
done all thou mayst stand; Thou shalt
not entertain ill thoughts with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
nor roll the sweet morsel under
thy tongue; Thou shalt not give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:102938:224"/>
to the wicked enticements of thy
own flesh, but arm thy self with holy
resolutions; Thou shalt do thy utmost
endeavour to root out all evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,
&amp; to keep that noisom pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of original corruption, that body
of death which thou carryest about
with thee, from streaming &amp; breaking
forth, into inordinate desires, irregular
words or actions, whereby God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
or thy neighbour injur'd; and
lastly, thou shalt so bound thy appetite,
&amp; keep it within the limits of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein providence hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thee, that thou mayst without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
thy neighbour or desiring any
thing that is his, quietly rest satisfied
with thy own estate, and carefully
mind the dutyes of thy calling, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that contentedness with what a
man hath, is both the great duty of
Christian Religion, and the greatest
felicity of this life.</p>
                        <p>That we may inquire into our selves,
it hath been plain by our actions, how
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:102938:225"/>
full of concupiscence our hearts have
been, when the Lusts of this Age have
been as wild, and the practises as loose,
as the Opinions; &amp; mens minds have
been as free to covet as they have
been to think; when appetite has been
boundless, and being goaded by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
has rambled over all Sacred &amp;
Civil Rights, &amp; left nothing untouch'd
that belong'd to God or man, which
the covetousness of wicked hearts
could reach at; when we have coveted
God's House as well as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's,
&amp; made conscience of nothing
that might improve our estates; when
instead of Self-denyal, which is the
principle of Christianity, Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has been set up, and Interest made
our Idol; when we have been so far
discontented at our present condition,
that we have over-run all orders, &amp; to
mend our private fortunes have ruin'd
the publick; when we walk disorderly,
and are immoderate in the use of our
pleasures, and are taken up with the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:102938:225"/>
love of the world, and impure affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and cannot rellish the things of
God; when we cannot indure one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and require that of others we
would not allow them, and set our
selves at irreconcileable distances;
when we indulge our selves in carnal
joyes, and have no compassion for our
suffering Brethren; when our hopes
depended on an arm of flesh, and the
fear of man deterred us from our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so that we would not trust God for
our delivery in the performance of
our duty; when every small thing puts
us into passion, and in our zeal we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
a revenge on the person, more
then a reformation of his vice; when
we follow the guidance of a deluded
conscience, and mistake both cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and ambition for zeal; when
we prefer publick mischief, before our
own disappointments, and had rather
Church &amp; State should be indanger'd
then our design should miscarry; when
we hug temptations, and make much
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:102938:226"/>
of our lusts, and lull them on the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of ease and security; when we
wish for things unlawful, and take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
courses to get them; when all
our desires are let out for carnal satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
and we make it the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of our lives to provide for our
content, and yet can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented;
When by our covetousness
and evil concupiscences we have thus
broken, not only this, but all Gods
Laws and Commandements, we may
very well desire God's pardon for
what is past, and his assistance for the
time to come, in the Churches

say, Holy Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
or mysteries used
in the Church, appointed
by Christ himself. Now <hi>Sacrament</hi>
is a military term, and signifyes that
oath, whereby souldiers were wont
to engage to be true and faithfull to
their General in the War against the
enemyes of their countrey: And thus
it is with us Christians, who have
vow'd obedience to Christ, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
of our Salvation, and sworn to
fight under his Banner, that we may
by his strength overcome the world,
the flesh, and the Divel.</p>

                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:102938:228"/>
The Sacraments are but two, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the Holy <hi>Supper:</hi>
which come in the place of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
and the Iewish Passeover.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Baptism</hi> we are admitted into the
bosom of the Church, and as it were
entred into God's family, being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
aliens from the Commonwealth
of Israel; and of the children of wrath
become heirs of the promise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Supper</hi> affords us a spiritual
repast, and by it we grow up, and are
intimately united to Christ, and are
preserved and fed to life everlasting.</p>
                  <p>There are two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in a Sacrament; an outward
Sign, and an inward Grace signified.
Sign, in <hi>Baptisme</hi> is Water, which
washeth the filth of our body; the
Thing signified is the Blood of Christ,
whereby our souls are cleansed from
the filth of sin. The outward Elements
in the <hi>Supper</hi> are Bread and Wine, by
which the strength of nature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and maintain'd: The Things
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:102938:228"/>
signified are the Body of Iesus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and his Blood shed, which being
partaken by Faith doe heighten our
graces, and nourish the souls of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
<hi>Baptisme</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Tit. 3. 5.</note> then is the laver of
regeneration; and the <hi>Supper</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">1. Cor. 10. 16.</note> is the
Communion of the Body and Blood
of Christ. In a word the Sacraments
are annexed to the Word of God, as
the seals of the promise, conveyances
of grace, and evidences of the Spirit,
by which he doth effectually apply to
believers the love of the Father, and
the merits of the Son, assuring their
hearts, confirming their Faith, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Hope, and enlarging their
Charity.</p>

                     <p>THe Institution of Baptisme was
after this manner. When Christ
had with his Blood sealed the truth
of his Doctrine, and purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Church, <hi>i.e.</hi> a peculiar people,
the chosen ones of God, whom he
fore knew from all eternitie; (for he
was the<note n="f" place="bottom">Rev. 13. 8.</note> Lamb slain before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world was laid;) and had
made good this his purchase by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
in that the bands of death
sell off, and he was released out of the
prison of the grave, having paid the
debt, for which he as our surety suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it was then convenient that this
Church thus purchased, should be
gathered, and the chosen ones be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and converted to the saith by the
preaching of the Word, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the rest of the world by
a profession of the Gospel, and the use
of holy ordinances. Wherefore being
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:102938:229"/>
himself to depart hence &amp; to ascend to
Heaven, he leaves his Disciples with
instructions, how to propagate the
faith, and to order the affairs of his
spiritual Kingdom to the end of the
world, and to proclaim throughout
all quarters of the world, the good
tidings of peace and pardon to all such
as should by faith and repentance
come in and give up their names to
Christ; It being God's will<note n="g" place="bottom">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note> that all
should be say'd, and come to the
knowledge of the truth. Whereupon
he sends the Apostles to preach, and
by Baptisme <hi>i.e.</hi> by a solemn rite of
washing with water, receive into the
bosom of the Church as many as
should profess faith in him; giving
them this commission before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partue,
as it is set down by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
<hi>Goe ye and teach all Nations
baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Baptism having
bin formerly us'd by <hi>Iohn</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
of our Saviour, and honour'd
by the example of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:102938:230"/>
who<note n="h" place="bottom">Ioh. 3. 16, 17.</note> at his Baptism was signally
own'd from Heaven for the Son of
God, the Spirit also in the shape of a
Dove lighting upon him.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour in these words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he appoints the form and use of
Baptism, partly commands, partly
promises. The command hath in it a
mission, <hi>Goe:</hi> &amp; a commission, <hi>teach,
and Baptize.</hi> The promise is that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
believeth and is Baptis'd shall be
saved.</hi>

                     <div type="gloss">
                        <p>GOE YE INTO ALL THE

to the lost sheep of the House of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
confin'd his own walk within the
bounds of Iewry; but at his death the
vail of the Temple being rent in

down, all other Nations of the world
were receiv'd into the covenant of
grace, and made partakers of that sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
which the Iews<note n="i" place="bottom">Act. 13. 46.</note> put from
themselves. In order to this, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:102938:230"/>
were furnisht with the gift of
tongues, to the end that they might
discourse with all people in their own
language, of which they gave a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
essay at the Feast of Pentecost; and
not long after they had meeting, and
agreed amongst themselves, what
quarter of the world every one should
take upon him as his Province, and
accordingly travell'd, some one or
other of them, over all the parts (of
the known world at least) there being

then the Sun in the Firmament makes
his passage through the twelve signs

Churches were planted up &amp; down,
Cities and countryes converted to

                        <p>The later speaketh thus; <hi>Teach by

your preaching shall find success. And
this no question was the practise of
the Apostles at first, as hath been of
the Church ever since, to admit all
even little ones, (as Christ did suffer
little children to come to him) and the
Infants of believers to Baptism: for so
Circumcision, in place of which Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism

should the sign of the Covenant be

who hath promis'd to be our God, &amp;
the God of ours? What an unkindness
is it, that a parent should shut the gate
of life against his child, and deprive it
of the priviledge of a new birth: seeing
that believers children are born heirs
of the promise, and have as good title
to the spiritual blessing of their Fathers
as they have to their temporal estate;
if the word of God be good evidence.
What hard-hearted person can look
upon it's child no otherwise then a
heathen brat, then the young one of
some brute damm; I will not say lamb,
or kid, or calf, which God appointed
to be offered to him, and accepted in
the Iewish service. And will any one
then be backward in bringing his child
to the Temple, and presenting him to
the Lord, or fear God's displeasure for
so doing? O rigid course to pass a
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:102938:233"/>
sentence of excommunication upon
children, till they come to years of
discretion. And why so? because they
have no faith. Suppose they have not.

the will of God concerning

that came down from Heaven, to the
end that having put on our nature, he
might in our stead satisfy the Law, and
undergoe the punishments due to us
for our sins, that we through Faith in
him might live; It pleased him (that
he might leave with us the Symbols
of his presence for ever, and preserve
the memory of his sufferings afresh
in the mind of the faithful) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
his Death by a Sacrament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<hi>Bread,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wine,</hi> the usual sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes

his sacred <hi>Body,</hi> which was broken on

the spear: and his <hi>Blood</hi> which trickled
from his sacred Head by the pricking
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:102938:237"/>
of the thorns, gush'd out of his hands
&amp; feet when he was nail'd to the tree,
and brake forth of his side when he
was wounded with the launce, and
plentifully stream'd forth out of every
vein of his sacred Body, when he was
cruelly scourged with whips.</p>
                     <p>Now his <hi>Body</hi> thus broken, and his

not that any one doth eat the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
flesh of Christ, and drink his very
blood in a gross manner, for that will
be as absured to think as 'tis savage to
doe; or that Christ can be receiv'd
any other way then by Faith, for 'tis a
point of Faith that the Body of Christ
did goe up to Heaven, and there is to
remain till the last day; and 'tis contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to very reason, to say, that the same
Body can at the same time be in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places; and to bring to pass contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:102938:237"/>
is a thing out of the power
of omnipotence it self; not to say that
it is plain even to our outward senses,
that the elements of bread and wine
doe still remain after consecration the
same in substance as well as in colour,
and accidents as they were before. In
fine it would indeed be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if the signs should change their
nature, and the thing signified be it
self really there; for a Sacrament is
nothing else but a figure, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of some thing that is absent,
exhibiting to the understanding that
which cannot be seen with the eye;
and by outward actions resembling
the inward virtue and efficacy of that
thing of which it is a sign.</p>
                     <p>This sacred Rite is called <hi>the Holy
Supper,</hi> either by the way of Metaphor
to denote the communion, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
which the Saints have with
one another (for which reason we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

family meeting together at that time,

the houshold of Faith, who though

of life, yet as members of one and
the same body, whereof Christ is the
Head, are united to one another by
the same spirit, &amp; fed with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

of the Church is made up of many
Saints, just as the bread it self of many
corns, and the wine of drops; whence

Or, out of a more particular
respect to the <hi>Passeover,</hi> into the place
and stead whereof this Sacrament
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:102938:238"/>
came; as the other succeeded circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision:
for the Iews were wont by
God's appointment yearly to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
a Feast, whereon at evening in
each houshold they slew a Lamb,
dressed it, and eat it together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the deliverance from
the Egyptian slavery, and from the
Angel, who striking all the first born
of Egypt pass'd over the houses of the
Israelites, who for that purpose had
according to that<note n="p" place="bottom">Exod. 12. 22.</note> command dash'd
the Blood of the Lamb upon the
lintel of the door. Now Christ being
the substance was to put an end to all
ceremonies, &amp; came to make one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
sacrifice once for all, who in that
he dyed, dyed but once, being the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sins of the world; and his death we are
to remember in these pledges of his
love, whereby he hath delivered us
from a spiritual slavery, and wrought
salvation for us. And indeed in that
very nick of time when our Saviour
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:102938:239"/>
had finisht the Paschal Supper with his
Disciples, he appointed this as to abide
for ever in the room of the other. The
<hi>Lord's Supper</hi> it is styled, because ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Lord Jesus, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him to be fed on by Faith. The
words of the Scripture, wherein the
Institution is set down, expresse both
time when, and manner how it was
performed: the manner again deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
partly what he did, partly what
he said, in consecrating the bread first,
and then the cup.</p>
                     <p>The Institution of this Sacrament
is described by the authour, time, and
manner. The Authour, <hi>the Lord Iesus.</hi>
The Time, <hi>the night wherein he was
betrayed.</hi> the Manner consists of two
parts, shewing partly what he did,
partly what he said; and that severally
of these two several signs, by which
he would represent his Body and
Blood. For this Holy Supper was to
consist of spiritual meat and drink;
as men use both to eat and drink in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:102938:239"/>
their other ordinary meals. The <hi>Bread</hi>
is the sign of his Body; the <hi>Cup</hi> of his
Blood. First, as to the <hi>Bread</hi> what did
he? <hi>He took it, he bless'd it, he broke it,
he gave it.</hi> What said he? <hi>Take, eat;
this is my Body.</hi> Again for the <hi>Cup,</hi>
what did he? <hi>he took it, he bless'd it, he
gave it.</hi> What said he? <hi>Drink ye all of
it; for this is my Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

again, and explain it more fully.</p>

spiritual drink as well as meat, the

But first the <hi>Bread</hi> and then the <hi>Cup.</hi>
Why? because there must be a body

then <hi>wine</hi> to refresh the heart. Again
the <hi>Cup</hi> last as of great importance;

blood, but wash us by the sprinkling

works<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and preserve his Church spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

to the Hebrews<note n="f" place="bottom">Heb. 9. 22.</note> observes, that in the
old Law there was no attonement for
sin without blood: for in the blood
lay the life, &amp; the life of the sinner was
to answer for his sin: wherefore 'twas
not so much the flesh of the sacrifice,
(which was partly burnt into ashes,
partly eaten by the Priest or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation)
that appeas'd God's wrath, as
the blood, which was sprinkled round
the Altar. Nor did the eating of the
Passeover (which was the type of this
Supper) secure the Israelites from the
destroying Angel, but the blood
which was struck upon the lintell of
the door. Nor can the Papists plead
the no necessity of administring the
Cup, because the children of Israel in
the celebration of their Passeover, and
the Priests and people in their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
onely eat of the flesh of the lamb
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:102938:249"/>
or bullock, and not drank the blood,
but either spilt it, or sprinkled it up &amp;
down. For first we have here Christ's
express command, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi>
whereas they were bid to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And then, which is the main thing.
Christ's merit (as was said before) lay
most in his blood, so that to give our
selves an interest in his sufferings, we
must partake of his blood as well as of
his body.</p>
                        <p>But why is the Symbol of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood call'd a <hi>Cup,</hi> whereas that

answer one another, but bread and
wine. This by the Papists own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
must be allowed to be a figure
(call'd Metonymie) of the vessel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
for the liquor contained, the
<hi>Cup</hi> for the <hi>wine</hi> in the cup. Now
therefore if the <hi>Cup</hi> be not really
turn'd into the blood of Christ, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the <hi>bread</hi> changed into flesh.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:102938:250"/>
For just as it's said of the bread, <hi>This is
my Body,</hi> so he sayes of the Cup, <hi>This is
my Blood.</hi> And if there be a figure in
one place, why not in both? or can we
suppose, that our Saviour in a thing
of so great concernment, would not
have spoke properly here too, as he
did before. But the truth on't is, we
should on all hands run our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a world of absurdities, should we
take words strictly as they sound, and
not allow them a fair meaning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to popular use, and custom of
speaking. For by this means we should
have cities with wals up to heaven,
Christ would be turn'd into one rock,
<hi>Peter</hi> into another, <hi>Herod</hi> would be
Metamorphosed into a fox, and <hi>Ovid</hi>'s
fables would hardly seem more
strange then Scripture. But Rhetorick
teacheth us the convenience, and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
custom the necessity of using fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
&amp; no question but our Saviour
made use of the liberty in this sacred
Institution.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="453" facs="tcp:102938:250"/>
Now the ground of this figure
whereby the <hi>Cup</hi> is put for the wine
(whereas the other part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is properly express'd by the
name of <hi>bread)</hi> may be this; because
bread being of a solid substance is of it
self easily laid hold on, and taken up
with the hands: but wine is of a fluid &amp;
liquid nature, so that it cannot be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with to any use, unless it be first
put into some vessel, as a cup, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Likewise also.</hi> These two particles
imply, partly that Christ did as well
appoint the use of wine as of bread to
make this holy Supper an entire Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
in so much that, if either
should be taken away, the mystery
would be maimed and imperfect; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he did in like manner, and after
the self same fashion, consecrate the
Symbol of his precious Blood, as he
did that of his holy Body, using the
same actions, and almost words; for as
<hi>he took the bread,</hi> and <hi>gave thanks,</hi> and
<hi>gave it to his Disciples,</hi> bidding them
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:102938:251"/>
                           <hi>eat,</hi> and telling them, that is was his
<hi>Body, which was broken for them,</hi> and
charging them to doe it <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him:</hi> Iust so <hi>he took the Cup</hi>
too, and <hi>gave thanks,</hi> and <hi>gave it</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them and bid them <hi>drink,</hi> and
told them withal, that it was his
<hi>Blood, which was shed for them,</hi> and
charged them to do it <hi>in remembrance
of him.</hi> Some little difference we may
meet with, both in the actions and in
the words, either by adding or leaving
out. First here is added a more special
note of the time, when the cup was
appointed, to wit, <hi>after Supper,</hi> which
is but generally expressed in the other
part to be <hi>the night in which he was
betrayed:</hi> And a more punctual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
when he sayes, <hi>Drink ye all of
it;</hi> contenting himself of the bread to
have said onely, <hi>Eat it.</hi> with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
declaration of the nature of this
Sacrament, where he tells them, 'twas
<hi>the Blood of the New Testament,</hi> which
he sayes not of his Body; and of the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:102938:251"/>
use and end for which it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>for the remission of sins.</hi> i.e. for
sealing that pardon, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by his blood. Besides a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
at least an advice of frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
implyed in those words, <hi>As
oft as ye drink it.</hi> Then here is left out
the action of powring out of the
wine, which answers the breaking of
bread; for <hi>he broke the breaa,</hi> but it is
not said that <hi>he powred out the wine.</hi> So
that it may be supposed the cup was
full of wine, when he took it. Yet the
words of consecration doe make out
this action also; for as he said, <hi>This is
my Body which is broken for you;</hi> so he
saith, <hi>This is my Blood which is shed for
you.</hi> And lastly, he sayes of the bread,
<hi>Take, eat;</hi> but of the wine onely, <hi>Drink;</hi>
which yet they could not do without
taking it. Now herein perhaps lay
the difference, that of the bread being
broken into small pieces, every one
could at once take his part, and all
partake together at the same time:
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:102938:252"/>
but the cup being not capable of such
a partition, they handed it to one
another, the second staying till the
first had drunk, and so on to the
last.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Cup,</hi> to wit, being full of wine;
for so himself sayes afterward, that he
would drink no more of the fruit of
the vine, till he drank it new with
them in the kingdom of his Father.
Now wine was the fittest to express
the nature and use of the Blood of
Christ, it being the noblest liquour,
that which most refreshes the heart of
man. <hi>Give wine</hi> (as the Proverb<note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. 31. 6.</note> saith)
<hi>to the sad in heart, that they may forget
their misery.</hi> Wine was used also in
the curing of wounds, as 'tis said<note n="h" place="bottom">Luk. 10. 34.</note> of
the good Samaritan, that taking the
man <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>hat had lighted amongst thieves
into his care, he powred wine and
oyl into his wounds; the wine to
search and cleanse, as well as the oyl
to heal and skin them: Christ's Blood
hath the same virtue and efficacy to
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:102938:252"/>
quench the spiritual thirst of a sinner,
who being scorch'd with his guilt,
longs for Christ's righteousness, as the
hart panteth after the water-brooks;
to cheer the spirits which lye droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the sense of sin; to supply
new strength to a Christian believer,
that he shall rejoyce to run his course
as a Giant refresh'd with wine; and
lastly to wash the defiled conscience,
and cleans the foul running sores of
the soul, that it may be fitted for the
oyl of the spirit the comforter. Besides
Christ himself is often compared to a
Vine, whereof all the faithfull are
branches, <hi>I am the Vine</hi> (sayes he <hi rend="sup">i</hi>) <hi>and
my Father the Husbandman;</hi> and he is
said to have trod the winepress of
God's wrath alone for us. Yet in case
of necessity, where wine cannot be
had, other drinks either natural or
made (according to the custom of the
country) may be us'd, as water, beer,
&amp;c. Now as that bread which came
down from heaven was the type of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:102938:253"/>
his body, so was the water which came
out of the rock, and follow'd the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
through the wilderness, an
emblem of his Blood; for<note n="k" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>that rock
was Christ.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>He took it.</hi> He lifted it from the
table, and held it in his hand, either
having first powred wine into it out
of some bigger vessell or flagon, or
else with an intent to power wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; as the word <hi>shed forth,</hi> or <hi>powred
out</hi> doth intimate; for the sign was to
represent the thing signified.</p>

For no man was ever either by gifts

advanc'd to that pitch of perfection,
that he could perform an exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all God's commands; <hi>We
have sinned all</hi> (saith<note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. 3. 23. 1 Ioh. 1. 10.</note> the Apostle) <hi>and
if we say that we have no sin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our selves, and there is no truth
in us.</hi> Nay, supposing one's life never
so spotless; yet cannot we make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for that natural uncleanness
of original sin, which we are born
with, and which as soon as we live
forfeits us to death, according to the
threatning,<note n="c" place="bottom">Gen. 2, 17.</note> 
                           <hi>In the day that thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt dye the death.</hi>
Wherefore what was wanting in us,
Christ made up with the merits of his
obedience, who having fulfill'd the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:102938:259"/>
Law, and being in himself altogether
free from guilt, became<note n="d" place="bottom">Cor. 5. 21.</note> sin for us,
and was reckon'd amongst transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
that we might be justified by
his blood, and sanctified by his spirit.
Our sins then are by his death done
away, so that if we lay hold on him
by Faith, that we may receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his death, we that are guilty
must be acquitted, because our surety
that was guiltless was condemned;
we shall live, because he dyed; we
shall escape the wrath which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent;
and our sins must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiven,
because his innocency was
censur'd; so that now God stands
oblig'd by his faithfulness and justice
too, to forgive us our sins, and cleanse
us from all iniquity. He is but faithful
when he keeps his word, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
his part of that Covenant,
which he made with us in his Son;
and he is but just, when our surety
has paid the debt, to discharge us.
Now this Sacrament being a seal of
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:102938:260"/>
the Covenant doth assure us of that
forgiveness; and seals to our heart
by the sprinkling of blood, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the spirit a pardon of our
sins, and does withall oblige us to
Faith and repentance, which are the
conditions, without which we must
not expect forgiveness, and to a new
obedience, which is the surest sign
and evidence, that we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>

Truth is, scarce any language has greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,

hath; which is some reason of the difficulty of
it to strangers. I shall instance in some

other the <hi>Scholastic Orthography:</hi> Again,
a different meaning sometimes diversifies the

down, and to tell a <hi>lye; foul</hi> dirty, and a <hi>fowl</hi>

to discourse more largely in his <hi>Tables of
the English Tongue,</hi> wherein he hopes to
give satisfaction to the <hi>Critic,</hi> and the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
At present he thinks it his main concern
to be Vnderstood, and therefore takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
