            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39062:3"/>
rest. This Paper of yours (as you pretended in the time of the late King) was written and published by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Commission. So that you draw a scandal upon the Government, by suppressing Books against <hi>Popery,</hi> because people are apt to think you have an <hi>Authority</hi> for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This, to be plain with ye, has the most of <hi>weight</hi> in't of any <hi>thing I have met with.</hi>

               <p>This is <hi>their</hi> Master-piece, and I'll give ye a clear and a distinct answer to't. In the first place, I did say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>I had a Commission to inquire into the</hi> bus'ness of <hi>Otes</hi>; and that I did nothing in that matter, but pursuant to my duty, in the <hi>discharge</hi> of <hi>that</hi> Commission: But I do positively deny the having had any particular Commission for the publishing of this paper. So that the foundation of the <hi>calumny</hi> is gone already. Secondly, I never suppress'd, or pretended to suppress any Book, or Discourse against <hi>Popery</hi> whatsoever, upon that consideration: But I am not, upon any terms in the World, for a <hi>Book</hi> with <hi>No Popery in the Title,</hi> and <hi>No Monarchy in the Matter:</hi> Or for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Religion the <hi>Bawd</hi> to a <hi>Sedition</hi>; at the rate of your <hi>True</hi> Protestant <hi>Petitions,</hi> and <hi>Addresses</hi>; that, instead of [<hi>Humbly Shewing</hi>] the <hi>Subjects Grievances</hi> to their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> most audaciously expose the <hi>Honour</hi> of the Prince to the People, and only <hi>tack</hi> the Preface of a Supplication to the <hi>Body</hi> of a Libel. Now if I neither had such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, nor ever said, I had such a Commission, as these Dreamers of Dreams imagine: If I never supprest; no, nor so much as complain'd of any Discourse against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, for the Popery=sake; Or with a respect to any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; the whole Frame of this <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> falls to the Ground; and I defy the whole <hi>Herd</hi> of my <hi>bellowing</hi> Adversaries to produce but any thing like a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39062:3"/>
reason for the noise they make. I do not find that any of the Primitive Christians either propagated or maintain'd their Faith by the Dint of <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>Rascals.</hi> That's the <hi>Salamanca Idiome,</hi> and according to the <hi>modern</hi> way of planting the Gospel; upon the <hi>foundation of the Damnable Hellish</hi> Popish Plot. Prethee is <hi>our Religion</hi>; that is to say, <hi>our Religion</hi> established by law) ever the better, or that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever the <hi>worse,</hi> for treating the <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy</hi> in <hi>ribaldry</hi> and <hi>foul language</hi>? Is it not possible <hi>for a man to go to Heaven</hi> without being unmannerly?</p>

               <p>How <hi>comes it to be so unmannerly,</hi> I prethee, to say a <hi>Spade</hi>'s a <hi>Spade?</hi> or to call any sort of <hi>Villain</hi> by his right <hi>Name</hi>? besides that, 'tis a point of <hi>general prudence,</hi> in all cases whatsoever, for people to make a common enemy as black as they can: For if you bring 'em to have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for their persons once, 't<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
