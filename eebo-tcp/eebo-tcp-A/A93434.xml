         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you may bee pleaſed to take notice that on the
18. <hi>January,</hi> 1643. wee ſet ſayle in <hi>Plymouth</hi>
Sound, and aftermuch foule weather and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
windes beating about the Lands end; it
pleaſed God, to bring part of the Fleet ſafe to
Anchor in <hi>Milford</hi> Haven on the 23 of the ſame,
<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Leopard Regis,</hi> the <hi>Swallow;</hi> the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi>
Merchant, <hi>Providence</hi> Merchant, and <hi>Creſſent</hi> Frygot, and
within three dayes after, the <hi>Proſperous,</hi> and the two <hi>Lerpoole</hi> veſſels,
came into <hi>Milford;</hi> But through the neglect of Captaine <hi>Plunket,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Williams,</hi> the ſaid Veſſels were neceſſitated to remain
at <hi>Milford</hi> ſeven weekes, it being their charge to have conveyed
them to their deſired Port; And at our arrivall wee found at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in the Haven, the Globe of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and a ſmall ſhip which
arrived at <hi>Milford,</hi> eight dayes before wee came in; And had
brought from <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> Ammunition to fortifie the Harbor; as great
Guns, Powder, Bullet and other proviſions, and had Landed them
at <hi>Prickspill,</hi> which lyeth on the Northſide of the Harbor, where
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111463:3"/>
the enemy had made a Fort, and fortified it; Into which <hi>Pyll;</hi> the <hi>Globe</hi>
and the other ſhip having made us from the mouth of the Harbor,
let ſlip and runne; And my Admirall in purſuit came before the
<hi>Pyll;</hi> where were exchanged diverſe ſhots, but no hurt done on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide; The Admirall perceiving no conſiderable ſervice or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
could bee performed on the Fort or Ships; they being
drawn about a Neck of Land behind the Fort; hee came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
before it within ſhot; and the <hi>Swallow</hi> a head of him; and
the reſt of the Fleet a head of the <hi>Swallow,</hi> inclining to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide:
ſome three dayes after in the night, the enemy drew a Gunne
out of the Fort to the Weſtward of the <hi>Pyll,</hi> and at break of the
day, began a morning ſalute to the <hi>Swallow,</hi> who to gratifie their
courteſie, anſwered them; and after many ſhot their Gunne ſplit,
and ſo they drew it away at that time: it proved very ſtormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inſomuch that our Ships hauld home their Anchors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon the firſt opportunity the <hi>Leopard</hi> and <hi>Swallow</hi> were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to weigh and come to Anchor, on the South ſide, before <hi>Angle
A birth,</hi> where uſually the Kings Ships ride when they come into
that Harbour, but ſhortly after the Admirall ſent the <hi>Proſperous</hi> and
<hi>Leopard</hi> Merchant, to ride before the <hi>Pyll,</hi> to hinder, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the ſtrengthning of their Work; which daily the enemy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed
to doe; from the Ships were diverſe ſhots made daily at their
works; as alſo from the Fort at the Ships; but as yet no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
dammage received, onely the <hi>Leopard</hi> Merchant, received a
ſhot in her quarter, which dropt into the Maſters bed: and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
the Fort the more, the Admirall, with the joynt conſent of the
Commanders, built a Fort on the South ſide over againſt the <hi>Pyll,</hi>
and placed therein a Demy-Cannon; wherewith wee played into
their workes, which was a great incouragement unto many in the
County, to adhere unto the well-affected party, who at that time
were very weak. Thus having preſented you with our proceedings
at Sea, in and about the Harbour; you may bee pleaſed to take a
view of the correſpondence wee held a ſhore, both with the ill and
well affected after our happy arrivall; I call it happy in reſpect of
the great deliverance it pleaſed the moſt mighty Preſerver of all
things to afford to the diſtreſſed Inhabitants of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and the
well-affected Gentlemen of that County.</p>
               <p>The next morning after we came to anchor in the Haven, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Langhorn</hi> and the Major of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> came aboord the <hi>Leopard,</hi>
and informed my Admirall with the feeble condition the well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111463:3"/>
party was in; As alſo of the ſtrength, power, and inſolency
of the adverſe party: For after the enemy had fortified the North
ſide of the Harbour, and intending to have fortified the South ſide
within a day or two, had not our arrivall fruſtrated that deſigne,
the enemy preſuming on their ſtrength, caſt off their ſheeps-cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iug,
in which they had ſo long deluded the people, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves to be like unto the reſt of there Confederates (<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening-Wolves.</hi>)
The Earle of <hi>Carbury</hi> having voted, that after the
Harbour was Fortified, he would plunder the Town of <hi>Pembrook,</hi>
and the houſes of the Gentlemen who had adhered to that party,
and that their perſons ſhould be put to death by cruell tortures;
The Major of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> they ſayd ſhould be put in a Barrell of
nayles and brought to <hi>Prickspill,</hi> and from the top of a hill ſhould
be rouled down into the ſea: This report ſo terrified the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that they fled from their houſes, and hid themſelves in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
places in diſguiſe, and ſent their wives and children to <hi>Tynby,</hi>
where his Lordſhip then lay; humbly to ſupplicate his Lordſhip
to be pleaſed to grant them protection, that their houſes might
not be plundered, nor their perſons abuſed by the rude ſouldiers;
among whom there was a reverend aged Gentlewoman, the wife
of one Maſter <hi>Griffeth White,</hi> who had in her houſe eight ſonnes
and eight daughters who were Virgins, and foure ſmall Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
in all number twenty, with divers ſervants both Male
and Female. This Gentlewoman preſſing his Lordſhip to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate
her ſad eſtate, in caſe her houſe ſhould be plundered,
deſired his protection; aſſuring his Lordſhip that whenſoever hee
would be pleaſed to give her husband leave to wait on him, ſhee
did not not doubt but that her husband would give his Lordſhip
ample ſatisfaction in all his lawfull demands. His Lordſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
he would finde a time to ſpeak with her husband, but as
for a protection he would grant her none. The Gentlewoman with
tears in her eyes deſired his Lordſhip to looke on her children, who
in point of honor he ſtood engaged to protect: as alſo the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhity
of Mations and Virgins, the which without his Lordſhips
protection ſhe ſayd, muſt undoubtedly be violated, and her family
periſh. To which his Lordſhip anſwered with divers reproaches,
and ſome jea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s among, that it were better her children and family
ſhould periſh, than that the King ſhould want means to perfect his
deſigne; to which ſhe ſaid, the King could not want, if his Majeſty
would be graciouſly pleaſed to be content with what God, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111463:4"/>
Lawes of the Land hath provided; At which his Lordſhip flung
out of the roome, leaving the Gentlewoman with tears in her eyes,
and ſo ſhe departed to her houſe full of grief and penſive thoughts.
A paſſage from his Lordſhip of ſo barbarous a deportment, that I
beleeve hiſtory can ſcarſe parallel to have proceeded from any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
And if theſe be the loyall ſubjects who fight for the Goſpel,
the Kings honor, and the Subjects Liberty, I leave to every mans
judgement to determine. The lamentable condition of the well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
being by the Admirall and Commanders diſputed, It was
demanded of Colonell <hi>Langhorn</hi> and the Major, what force the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
party was able to rayſe to oppoſe his Lordſhip; It was by
them replyed, that they could not raiſe above 40 horſe, and about
60 foot: then it was demanded, in caſe there ſhould be 200 ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
landed well armed, whether they would joyn with them, in
endeavouring to drive his Lordſhip out of the County, for unleſſe
they would be active, they muſt reſolve to prepare to go away with
the Fleet, in regard a conſumption of victuals would force us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
that Harbour. The Colonel and Major, with the wel-affected
Gentry, like gallant men who had rather die than outlive the honor
of their Country, or ſee the ruine thereof by a Jeſuiticall and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
faction, reſolved to put themſelves under the providence of the
Almighty, and with the help of our Sea-men to affront the enemy;
the which was without delay put in execution. And on the 13 of
<hi>Feb.</hi> we fell on a Garriſon of the enemies in a ſtrong hould called
(<hi>Stackepoole</hi>) the Mannor houſe of one Mr. <hi>Roger Lort,</hi> on which with
our great guns having made a breach, after 8 hours aſſault we tooke
it with the loſſe of two men, and many wounded on both ſides;
ſhortly after they fell on another garriſon of the enemy called <hi>Treff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Ordnance, whereat his Lordſhip wheeled about with all his forces
and ran into the Town. Our forces proſecuting their aſſault upon
the Garriſon, took it, and therein 45 horſe, and 150 Arms, with the
loſſe of two men on our ſide, and ſix on the enemies: God giving
our ſmall forces this good ſucceſſe, they retired to <hi>Pembrooke</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſh
their men, and to enable themſelves for a more potent deſign on
the enemy, intending to oppoſe their whole body, which conſiſted
of 1200 men foot and horſe, which lay in and about <hi>Haverfordweſt,</hi>
then his Lordſhips Rendevouz; but his Lordſhip hearing of this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111463:4"/>
deſign, having fortified <hi>Haverford</hi> Weſt, and placed moſt of his
ſtrength there, his Lordſhip like a valiant Commander, with 20.
horſe, ſome foot, and four field-pieces ran away, telling the reſt
of the Commanders, that he rode unto the adjacent County to
raiſe more forces, and that he would ſuddenly returne.</p>
               <p>Now when our men were refreſhed, and ſix fild-pieces moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on Carriages with Wagons to convey their Ammunition
and Victuals, they reſolved to fall on the Fort at the <hi>Pyll:</hi> and
on the 22. of <hi>Feb.</hi> Collonel <hi>Langhorne</hi> &amp; the Mayor of <hi>Pembrook,</hi>
ſent aboard the Admirall, to deſire that our boates might bee
ſent to the paſſage to convey over on the enemies ſide, their
Artillery, Wagons and Proviſions; the which was done on
<hi>Friday</hi> the 23. And about three of the clock in the morning
they were all landed, conſting of about 300. horſe and foot,
with ſix field pieces of Ordnance; who proceeding on their
March, their horſe in the Front, they advanced before the
<hi>Pyll,</hi> about twelve of the clocke at noone; Our Ships alſo were
at Anchor before the Fort; the <hi>Leopard Regis,</hi> and the <hi>Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
road to the Weſtward, and the <hi>Proſperous</hi> and <hi>Leopard</hi>
Merchant road to the Eaſtward, plying our Ordnance into
the Fort; And when our Land Forces had drawne up their
Artillery, they played into the Fort from a hill which lay to
the Eaſtward of it, and were anſwered againe; the horſe and
foot did skirmiſh from their Ambuſcadoes; but on this day
no man was either ſlaine or hurt on either ſide; Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on, cauſed a ceſſation; our Land forces quartering about
their Artillery lay in the field before the Fort; it being a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cold night, the next morning being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 24. by
breake of the day, from our Ships and Land-forces, we began
to ply our Ordnance; from the <hi>Swallow</hi> was a ſhot made into
the Fort, which tooke off the head of one man, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriours
of another, of which he dyed the next day; Our horſe
and foot behaved themſelves valiantly that day, and beat the
Enemy from their Ambuſcadoes; and with the Enemy entred
their Fort, and then the enemy cryed quarter; the which
our Commanders in imitation of their Heavenly Father,
who is the God of mercy, granted farre above their deſerts,
and ſpared their lives; who had formerly voted, that if they
ſhould prove Conquerers, they would kill the dogges, &amp; raviſh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111463:5"/>
the Bitches, and drowne the Whelps; moſt in humane lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
did it not proceed from thoſe that adhere to the Beaſt,
and therefore proper for them to ſpeake Diabolicall and
Beaſticall language; In the Fort were taken Armes 200. Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ordnance 18. Souldiers 240 &amp; Commanders 26. their
names and qualities are expreſſed in the Schedule annexed; In
the <hi>Pyll</hi> were taken two ſhips, the <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> in her twelve
pieces of Ordnance; and by a ſhot from the <hi>Globe</hi> was one of
the <hi>Swallowes</hi> men ſlaine on the ſhoare by his owne folly, the
other Ship called the <hi>Providence</hi> had belonging to her ten great
Guns, but the enemy had carried them to <hi>Haverford</hi> Weſt, in
the taking of this Fort, the protecting power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
I hope, by us ſhal never be forgorte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it was his own
arme that got the victory, to whom be aſcribed all honour and
glory for ever and ever; for in taking thereof, there was not
one man ſlain, either by ſword or ſmall ſhot; when the enemy
was routed, ſome of their ſouldiers fled to <hi>Haverford</hi> Weſt, and
informed the Commanders there, of the loſſe of the Fort, and
that all their Commanders and Souldiers therein were taken
priſoners; At which newes it is reported, Sir <hi>Henry Vaughan</hi>
with the of his Commanders, began to rage &amp; ſweare like mad
men and as Beare robbed of her whelps, ran up and down the
ſtreets, crying, beat up our Drums; gather our horſe and foot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for we will out this night, &amp; be revenged of the Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
Paliament dogs; And having with this bravado drawn
their forces into a Body, being about 450. Sir <hi>John Stepney</hi> the
Governour of that town, like a prudent overſeer, went into the
Church-yard, to ſee if he could diſcern our forces to approach
towards <hi>Haverford</hi> Weſt, about halfe a mile from the towne, hee
diſcovered a heard of black-bullocks coming toward him; hoſe
horned beaſts ſo amazed the Knight, that being afraid of his
own ſhadow, his worſhip ran to the head of their forces, &amp; ſwor
Gods-wounds the Round-headed dogs were comming; at
which report they marched out of the town, &amp; calling to mind
the valiant example of their L. Generall <hi>Carbury,</hi> they wheeled
about, and ran away, the boyes of the towne perceiving them
to run, fell on the reare, and took from them threeſcore Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets;
this diſorder in the reare made thoſe in the front beleeve
that the Round-heads were at their heels indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:111463:5"/>
The feare thereof metamorphoſed aule our Cozen <hi>Taffies</hi> into
<hi>Mercuries,</hi> and winged ſpeed, every man fled for his life, ſome
threw away their Armes, and thoſe that had the charge of the
Powder flung it into the River. And in this manner was the
Towne of <hi>Haverfordweſt</hi> ſurrendred; verifying that ſaying of
the kingly Prophet <hi>David, The wicked flyeth when no man purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them.</hi> When the enemy fled, they left behinde them in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfordweſt</hi>
a hundred red Coats which were never worne, a
quantity of victuals, and ten peeces of Ordnance, all which
argued they wanted nothing but a good Cauſe to maintaine.
Now our forces being againe refreſhed, having our Demi-Cannon
and a Demi-Culvering mounted on field Carriages,
and being ſupplyed from our Ships with Powder and all other
Ammunition, they marched towards <hi>Tynbie</hi> on the 6. of March.
On the ſame day the Swallow and Creſcent Frigot, with the
Proſperous Merchant, ſet ſaile from <hi>Milford,</hi> and came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
before <hi>Tynbie,</hi> where I ſummoned the Governour and
Maior to ſurrender the Towne for the ſervice of the King and
Parliament: but receiving a negative anſwer, I deſired the
Governour and Maior to ſend out of the Towne all the women
and children; for unleſſe they would comply I muſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of my duty uſe my uttermoſt endeavours to force them
thereunto. The ſame night our Land Forces came within two
miles of the Towne, from whence Colonell <hi>Langhorne</hi> ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the Swallow, and deſired me to ſummon the Town, the
which I had done before his Letter came, and returned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
their Anſwer. And receiving no ſatisfaction from the
Governour or Maior, the next morning about eight of the
Clocke we began to play into the Towne with our Ordnance
from our Ships; and about one a clocke in the afternoone our
Land Forces came before the Towne. And having placed
their Demi-cannon within a quarter of a mile of the Towne,
they fell to battery, and ſo wee continued three dayes. The
ſmall ſhot on both ſides performed well. The Towne was
maintained with brave reſolution, and more bravely aſſaulted
by our Seamen and Landmen, preſenting their naked bodies
even in the face of danger. Commiſſary <hi>Guine</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111463:6"/>
of the Towne ſhewed himſelfe to be a man of undaunted
ſpirit, iſſuing out of the Towne, bringing up his ſmall ſhot to
make good their Ambuſcadoes, and his valour, expoſed that
Towne to unavoydable miſery, in voting hee would neither
give nor take Quarter. But I may ſay of his valour as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in another caſe to certaine Chriſtians in his time:
Shall I praiſe him for this? No; I praiſe him not; for all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that tend not to the glory of God, lead us to our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
To which indeed this reſolution of his had almoſt
brought him; for leading on his men to face our ſmall ſhot,
who plyed their Muſquets ſo faſt that his men forſooke him,
and himſelfe received a ſhot under his right Pap, which infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to retreat all alone in an orderly pace. He was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
entred the Towne, but the Maſter Gunner thereof was
alſo ſlaine. In which we muſt not omit to manifeſt Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards us, for our ſmall ſhot having forced the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
out of their Ambuſcadoes, purſued them cloſe to the town
Gate, their Gunner having laden a peece of Ordnance with
Caſe ſhot, and watching for ſuch an opportunity, having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyſed
the Gunne, ſaid to thoſe that ſtood by, Now you ſhall
ſee me make a ſlaughter of theſe Roundheads; at which word
a ſmall ſhot from our forces hit him in the head, after which he
never ſpake more; whoſe fall ſo daunted the enemy both
Commanders and Souldiers, that forthwith they cryed out for
Quarter. The firſt that forced their entry into the towne was
Captaine <hi>Peter Whitty</hi> with his Company of Seamen and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Officers; Lieutenant <hi>Greene</hi> and Enſigne <hi>Dodſon,</hi> with
Lieutenant <hi>Calte,</hi> who led on the Swallow men, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after them Colonell <hi>Langhorne</hi> with his Troope of horſe.
This Towne of <hi>Tinbye</hi> was held by the judgement of the moſt
judicious almoſt impregnable, it being not to be entred but by
ſingle File: wherein were taken three or foure hundred priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as many Armes, ſeven peeces of Ordnance, all which
were taken on Saturday the 9. of March, and on Sunday the

hazard his life, or fortunes, or what is moſt deare unto him, for

Counter-ſecuritie, you have three Kingdomes in the body of
