            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thing not a little fearful for the time unto thoſe that found themſelves within the danger and mercy of the ſame, eſpecially the Empreſſe and her Ladies and Gentlewomen, as alſo the moſt hardy and aſſured Knights among them, and not without cauſe, for during this ſtorm, it ſéemed the furious Waves mounted to the Skies, and the Clouds again flying about, made ſemblance to menace the overthrow and ſubvertion of the earth, the Sun being ſo dark, and the Sky ſo obſcure and thick, that the leaſt relief and comfort this ſorrowful and diſtreſſed Fléet might hope and expect, was their prompt and ſpéedy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre within the bowels of ſome gréedy Monſter of the Sea, which in ſuch ſort aſtoniſhed the beautiful Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, that they ſéeming (although in good health) to dye for very fear and diſtreſſe. I cannot imagine that any Villain how hard hearted and cruel ſoever he were, hearing their pittiful cryes and lamentations, but would have inclined himſelf to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, aid, and aſſiſt them. Preſume then, in what vexation and grief the Emperor <hi>Eſplandran</hi> found himſelf to be, when he (being in his time a man that no man could ſurpaſſe for valiant and haughty courage) knew not by what means to help himſelf, but in a manner wholly deſpairing of all aid and relief, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſed his eyes that he might not ſée the Lightnings, Thunders, Rain, Hail, Wind and Waves that the Tempeſt wrought, for no ſooner fell a flaſh of Lightning, but thrée or four horrible and fearful claps of Thunder followed, as if the whole World ſhould end and have conſumed with fire: In that ſort floating and traverſing the raging Seas, their Ships full of water, ſterns, poops, rudders, maſts, ſails and cables, broken, the Sea ſéeming an innumerable flock of ſhéep féeding upon the mountains of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> whereon the Ships ſailing with ſuch pittiful diſtreſſe, ſcattered ſome backwards and ſome forwards, they knew not where to finde each other, neither yet could once perceive any fixed Star whereby they might return into their courſe: and to their greater torment, when night came on, the Seas, began much more to rage and ſwell, wherewith the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Pylots, and Marriners, were ſo much abaſhed (although not unacquainted with the ſame) that committing themſelves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55249:4"/>
to the only mercy of God, got them under hatches, where lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads on their knées, as if one had béen ready with a Sword, to give them their laſt and mortal ſtroke, attending on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a moſt dolorous and deſperate end.</p>
               <p>But when all hope of aid, relief, or comfort ſéemed wholly to be voyd; God of his goodneſſe (on whom they ceaſed not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to call) heard their woful cryes, ſo that about the break of day the ſigns of calm weather (<hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>) began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a cloud to appear, and by little and little the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing, the Wind ceaſing, and the VVaves leſſening, their ſurety and delivery from danger at that time ſéemed moſt certain, whereat they all were of good courage, being neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not little abaſhed to find themſelves ſo ſcattered from each other, and in a Sea unknown, not onely out of their right courſe, but alſo out of all company of their Ships, for that the Ship wherein the Emperour ſailed, had no other company then of one wherein King <hi>Norandel</hi> was, which two being together about the break of day diſcovered two great Foyſts or Turkiſh Galleys, that having béen toſſed and tormented by the tempeſt, were in no leſſe diſtreſſe then the Emperors fléet, nevertheleſſe, neither the one nor the other perceiving any means to avoid the fight, prepared themſelves to battel, in ſuch ſort, that having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted each other with Canon ſhot, they approached ſo near, that coming to the puſh of Pike, wild-fire, ſtroke of ſword, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapons, there began betwéen them a fight ſo terrible and fierce, that divers of them were ſent into the Sea, they fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo valiantly together, that hardly could it be judged to whom the victory would incline, till King <hi>Norandel</hi> found means to enter into the Ship, where with he grappled upon the Hatches whereof he found a <hi>Turk</hi> higher and bigger then the reſt, who holding a Sword in both his hands, made ſuch maſſacre and ſlaughter of the Chriſtians, that none durſt once approach or ſhew themſelves before him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Norandal</hi> (whoſe heart was never daunted) quickly ſtayed his fury, for that after many ſtrokes on both ſides given, the Turk having received a great wound in his thigh, felt ſo grievous a pain and extream dolour, that at laſt hée fell upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55249:5"/>
the hatches, which the King perceiving, lightly ſtepped over him, and being about to unlace his Helmet, minding to ſtrike off his head, the Turks ſouldiers cryed unto him, that for Gods ſake hée ſhould ſpare his life, which doing, you ſhall (my Lord ſaid they) have one of the greateſt Princes of the Eaſt unto your Priſoner, which will content your ſelf as well as any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ever did happen unto you heretofore, and therewith they all looſing hard together with their Captain and chief leader, yielded themſelves unto the King, whereof he preſently adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the Emperour, who for his part had ſo well exploited his affairs, that already hée had entred and ſeized upon the ſhip by him aſſailed.</p>
               <p>This combat ended, and the priſoners bound and laid under hold, the General of the Turks was diſarmed, and in ſuch ſort handled, that in the end he recovered again, who perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the danger of his enemies, and his company overthrowen, addreſſing himſelf unto King <hi>Norandel,</hi> ſpake unto him, and ſaid,</p>

               <p>To whom the King replied, that unleſſe hée would promiſe him to do his will and pleaſure, as alſo to ſhew him the truth of all he ſhould demand, his life ſhould be in as great hazard as ever it had béen.

               <p>But in the mean time, wée may not forget this new return of the Emperour into his Country: you muſt underſtand, that after the Emperor and the Empreſſe, had received the honour due unto them, of the Princes, Lords, Ladies, Gentlewomen and others, and that <hi>Don Flores</hi> had ſhewed the humble duty of a Childe unto his Parents, they alltogether went unto the Palace, where among the Troop of Ladies (the Lady <hi>Camelle</hi>) whoſe love hath béen ſo much recommended in the Books of <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhewed ſigns of great joy and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Being entred into the Court, the tables were covered, where the Emperour holding open Court, moſt honorable to behold, having alwaies by him his Son, the Prince <hi>Don Flores,</hi> King <hi>Norandel</hi> came before him, and leading by the hands, two young men moſt beautiful to behold, preſented them unto him, ſaying, (my Lord) behold here two young Gentlemen, who for the love and deſire they have to ſée, and ſerve you, have béen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to abandon their native Countries, &amp; paſſe ſo many dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seas as they have done; for the which you ought to love and cheriſh them, and ſo much the rather, for that this is your near

Kinſman (named <hi>Lipſan</hi>) ſon unto the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other the ſon of <hi>Don Gulidragant,</hi> Couzin unto the Marqueſſe of <hi>Saludar.</hi> In good faith (ſaid he) imbracing them both, I thank them moſt heartily, and ſéeing they have done ſo much for me as you ſay, following your advice, I will honour them as much as poſſible I may, knowing very well, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors will is ſuch I ſhould do ſo. Hereof am I very well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, ſaid the King, and thinking to have procéeded in further talk, there entred into the Hall the Marqueſſe of <hi>Saluder,</hi> and other Gentlemen with them, which at the Emperors arrival were gone to chaſe a Hart, that the night before had béen ſhut up within the toyles: but underſtanding of the Emperors arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, left off their chaſe, and came to ſhew their humble duties and reverence unto their ſoveraign Lord, of whom they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovingly received.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Flores</hi> entertained the two young Gentlemen newly given unto him, and from that time forward began to bear perfit love and affection unto <hi>Lipſan,</hi> which in divers places of our Hiſtory you ſhall well perceive.</p>
               <p>In this ſort the Court increaſed dayly of Noble men and Gentlemen, that for the ſpace of eight daies there was no other thing ſpoken, but of the great and royal chear that the Emperor kept, although in the mean time divers great and weighty matters happened, and were to be debated.</p>
               <p>Thoſe eight daies paſt, King <hi>Norandel</hi> remembring his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner which hée had taken on the ſea, and brought home ſore wounded into the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> lodging him in his own houſe, determined to go and viſit him: to whom when hée came, finding him in a manner healed, and out of danger, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know who he was, and what occaſion moved him to ſail on the ſeas when he met with him, as we have already declared: to that end he ſpake unto him, ſaying, ſir Knight, I pray you have me excuſed, and take it not in evil part, if that ſince your arrival into this great City, I have not ſhewed you the courteſie and honour that appertains unto ſuch a Knight as you are: for I ſwear unto you before God, that it hath not béen for want of good will, but only by reaſon of the Emperours affairs, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55249:6"/>
little leiſure he hath had to receive the Princes, Knights, and others that are come to viſit him, whereas I have béen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to remaine ſo in ſuch ſort, that forgeting my ſelf, I did not once remember you till this morning, that my affairs being ſomewhat leſſened, I called you to minde, and there with came hither, not only to viſit you, but alſo to amend the fault I had committed in your behalf.</p>
               <p>And it liketh your Grace, anſwered the Knight, I do now very well, and better than before, perceive that it ſhould bée a thing unnatural, if the trée ſhould not bring forth fruit like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the root from which it firſt ſprang: I ſay this (my good Lord) in reſpect of you touching mine own part, that have not deſerved the honour you did unto me, you will therein follow the bounty of that famous King <hi>Luſart</hi> your Father, a man eſtéemed of throughout the whole world, not only for his magnanimity, but alſo for his wiſdome and courteſie, as much as any Prince that lived before his time or ſince. Wherein truely you ſo well imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his ſteps, and that in ſuch manner, that having vanquiſhed me in battel, I confeſſe my ſelf more vanquiſhed then before, by reaſon of the great courteſie I finde in you, ſo that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to account this your victory of greater honor, then if I my ſelf had overcome ten of the beſt Knights in great <hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truely (ſaid the King) this courteſie you talk of, as far as I can perceive doubleth in your ſelf. But let us leave this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and tell me (if it pleaſe you) in what caſe you find your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and whether you find your ſelf any better then you did upon the ſeas. By how much the more (ſaid the Knight) that the health of my body increaſeth and approacheth, ſo much the more dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth and withdraweth the joy I was accuſtomed to have, in place whereof I am ſolicited by moſt grievous ſadneſſe, and not without great cauſe: one, by reaſon that perceiving my ſelf healed, I finde my ſelf in Priſon and arreſted, whereby my heart is ſo grieved, that I would willingly by death bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of pain, (not as I ſaid before) becauſe I am ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily falne into your hands: but by reaſon I may not accompliſh the voyage I have taken in hand, nor yet ſatisfie and fulfill that which I have ſworn and promiſed to do, having already paſſed ſo

many perils and misfortunes, for the attaining of my deſire, whereunto I have ſo long time aſpired. And now becauſe I know that my purpoſe is failed, and the grief my Prince will receive, (by my fault) as alſo the loſſe that ſo many great Lords ſhall receive by my long ſtaying, it ſo much vexeth me, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I am almoſt out of my wits, and ready to deſtroy my ſelf.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe pleaſed well the King, for thereby he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his priſoner entring into the very matter it ſelf, whereof he was ſo deſirous to be ſatisfied, which, the more eaſily to procure, hée ſaid unto him, what the cauſe of your grief is I know not, but of this one thing can I well aſſure you, that during your abode here you ſhall be well aſſured to receive all the honour and good entertainment that may bee de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time, ſéeing we are in this diſcourſe (I pray you ſir) by the promiſe I look for of you, on the faith of a Knight, ye will declare unto me that which I ſhall ask you.</p>
               <p>Therein I will do your pleaſure ſaid the Knight, for though I ſay it my ſelf, I know not any Gentleman living more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and careful to maintain his credit and promiſe than my ſelf, and ever will, wherein I will not yield to any man.</p>
               <p>Such is to bée looked for, ſaid the King, at the hands of men of your calling: now therefore I pray you declare unto mée who you are, what your name is, and what that King and thoſe great Lords are, which attend your return, as alſo the occaſion of your voyage.

               <p>In the mean time (beléeve mée ſir) I never was at my hearts eaſe, nor yet ſhall be, until ſuch time I ſhall have reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my kinſmans blood, ſhed in ſuch ſort as I have declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. And for that wée are diverſe of this one opinion and

intent, we therefore have made a league and promiſe to yeild, and all with one conſent have required aid, and ſuccour of all the Pagan Kings our friends, who to that end have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to aſſemble men from all parts, and that in ſo great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they being altogether and once entered into great <hi>Brittain,</hi> it ſhall be impoſſible that the King raigning therein ſhould reſiſt us, neither whole Chriſtendome, although they were altogether aſſembled, and would undertake the ſame.</p>
               <p>But what Kings and Lords (ſaid <hi>Norandel</hi>) dare ſo much preſume: ſéeing that thoſe which in times paſt aſſayed the like have ſped ſo ill, that the greateſt part of them have left their lives remaining ſo well chaſtiſed for their preſumptions, that this country whereof you ſpeak hath béen their Sepulchre, and that therein as yet are living the ſame Knights, which in thoſe times both overcame and vanquiſhed them.</p>
               <p>Ha (anſwered <hi>Coſdroel</hi>) aſſure your ſelf, (as I ſaid before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you) that their number is now ſo great, and they mean to deſcend in ſo many places of the Land, that the ſmall number of thoſe valiant Knights you praiſe ſo much will be eſtéemed as nothing in that behalf, and which is more, we are well adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that within this little time, Knighthood is ruſted among them, that in a manner there is not any more talke miniſtred of wandring Knights; but all like carpet Knights, (in ſtead of following Arms, as in times paſt men were accuſtomed to do) ſtudy onely to fit by the fire and court fair Ladies, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them ſo much the worſe eſtéemed of.</p>
               <p>I pray you then ſhew mée (ſaith the King) who are theſe Pagan Kings whereof ſo much you vaunt.

               <p>Theſe things are not ſo eaſie (ſaith the King) to be atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gone thorow withal as they are begun, by reaſon the firſt point is eaſie, but the ſecond much more hard, and to prove it to be ſo, aſſure your ſelf that in all the countries by you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ſhall find ſuch and ſo many good and valiant Knights and Souldiers, that never in their lives (it may be) they found themſelves ſo hardly matched, and their proud enterpriſes (as I hope) ſhall remain as much voyd and fruſtrate of all means as they to the contrary think it ſtrong, fortified, and Iuſt.</p>
               <p>Iuſter then it is can it not be (anſwered <hi>Coſdroel</hi>) for that ſome of them come to revenge the deaths of their Parents, and kindred, other their own injuries, and the moſt part for to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their lands and poſſeſſions loſt.</p>
               <p>VVho are they (ſaid the King?)

               <p>To which King <hi>Norandel</hi> for that time would make him no further anſwer, meaning thereby not to give him any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or perſeverance of the deſire he had to underſtand further
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55249:9"/>
of the matter, but onely demanded of him in what time hée thought they would be aſſembled and joyned together. In good faith (anſwered <hi>Coſdroel</hi>) the greater part of them are already prepared to embark themſelves, and attend onely the comming of the Turks Army, that they may ſet ſail all together, and you for your part, ſir Knight, (ſaid the King) what ſhall become of you: Are you in hope to be there in perſon?</p>
               <p>Yea truely (ſaid he) if your vertue be ſuch, that ſetting apart the revenge you might well take of ſo poor a Priſoner and a ſtranger as I am, you will diſcharge him of impriſonment, and give him liberty to accompliſh his meſſage he hath promiſed to make unto thoſe Lords to whom hée was travelling, at ſuch time as you ſtayed him, which done, look whether it will pleaſe you, I ſhall return, I promiſe you of my faith, ſo to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out failing in any point.</p>
               <p>Touching your liberty, can I not diſpoſe (ſaid the King) for that concerneth the Emperour himſelf: but I will declare the whole diſcourſe unto him, and therein will uſe my ſelf ſo well in your behalf, that I doubt not, but according unto his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed clemency, and Princely magnanimity, you ſhall obtain whatſoever you requeſt at his hands, therewith bidding him farewel, he took his leave and departed.</p>

Why (ſaid the Emperor) what ſaith he?</p>
               <p>Then King <hi>Norandel,</hi> began from point to point to declare

unto him the whole diſcourſe which you heard before, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great aſſembly of men made by the Pagan Princes, not onely to aſſail great <hi>Brittain,</hi> but alſo the whole Land of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and the City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf. And as he continued on his diſcourſe, not omitting any thing thereof, the Emperour both wiſe and well adviſed in the mean time, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his mind the dangers and accidents that might happen thereby, wherewith he found himſelf in a great perplexity: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, with the beſt and chearfulleſt countenance he could ſhew, he made King <hi>Norandel</hi> anſwer, ſaying,</p>
               <p>Couſen, the King my Father is not a learner to prove the force of theſe Pagans, neither yet am I. Divers and ſundry times have they aſſailed to land in great <hi>Brittain,</hi> as alſo in my countries, but (God be thanked) they never wan any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but death, or their confuſions, and as much ſhall now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto them: nevertheleſſe, we muſt advertiſe the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all other Chriſtian Princes, to the end, they may be prepared for them, eſpecially the Kings <hi>Agraies</hi> and <hi>Graſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Scots,</hi> of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> and <hi>Sobradiſe,</hi> my Vnkles, as alſo the Prince <hi>Florizando,</hi> all which together are ſtrong and puiſſant enough to withſtand and reſiſt theſe brave Giants, and others their aſſiſtants in the Eaſt Countries: and if they make way hither, believe mee they ſhall find (with the aid of my Son <hi>Luiſart</hi> and others our friends) but a hard mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for them to chaw. So may it bée I beſéech God, (ſaid the King) but yet am I in great fear as touching the Country of great <hi>Brittain:</hi> for (as <hi>Coſdroel</hi> hath very well noted unto mée) Arms are therein of late time ſo much left off and unfrequented, that at this preſent there is not a wandring Knight to bée found therein, as was accuſtomed to be, neither yet any other, doing that whereby in times paſt they were ſo much eſtéemed of, more then in any country of the World.</p>
               <p>Truely (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi> then) thereat am I much abaſhed, and truely I made my account that you (my Lord) turning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperor, would have given me leave to travel thither, there to receive the order of Knighthood, therein to prove my force and valour, in ſuch manner as you, <hi>Luiſart</hi> my Brother,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55249:10"/>
and other kings our predeceſſours have done in times paſt: but by your ſayings, I perceive I muſt be forced to take another courſe.</p>
               <p>The occaſions of trying your manhood are ſufficiently at this preſent offered in our own countrey (ſaid the Emperor) and here ſhall you finde from henceforth wherein to employ your ſtrength, and exerciſe Arms being knighted, without ſéeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, at the leaſt if all be true that <hi>Coſdroel</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>In good faith my Lord, ſaith the K. and ſo I think, he doth: but in the mean time what is your gracious pleaſure, that I ſhall do with him: he would gladly it might pleaſe your grace to give him liberty, that he might go and perform his voyage, upon condition to return, and yeild himſelf my priſoner again, as now he is, and ſo hath he deſired mée moſt earneſtly to crave the ſame at your hands: but I made him anſwer, that it lay not in mée to do, but reſted onely upon your Graces Will and Commandement, and that I would move it unto you. I am very well content, ſaid the Emperor, that he ſhall not onely have liberty to do as he requireth, but alſo that he ſhall go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it pleaſeth him, letting him well underſtand both to him and his, that we fear them but a little, and that we care not for their enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Truely, ſaid King <hi>Norandel,</hi> your Grace ſpeaketh like a great and couragious Prince, and you cannot better do, for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and as alſo by him, they may well perceive, that you are not ſo eaſie to be feared as they think, neither yet Chriſtendom ſo lightly to be won as they account. VVell then, ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, go and carry him theſe news, and let him depart hence as ſoon as it pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>Then King <hi>Norandel</hi> went preſently unto <hi>Coſdroel,</hi> and finding him up out of his bed, began to ſpeak unto him, ſaying: Sir knight, the Emperor hath by mée underſtood all that you declared unto mée this morning: and becauſe he eſtéemeth you for ſuch a perſon as I have told him, and what you are, he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you not onely liberty to accompliſh your Ambaſſage, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to go whither it pleaſeth you, and ſo you may do as ſoon as your health will permit.

               <p>THe matter by King <hi>Norandel</hi> declared the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did not ceaſe to trouble the Emperors minde, and more did it move him the night following, till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo that he being up, hee called his counſel together, to whom hée declared all the diſcourſe, before rehearſed,, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them (as much as ſuch a Prince as hée was, might do or require at the hands of his Lords, Friends, Servants, and Subjects) to give him as ſpéedy, good, and faithful counſel as they might, the matter being of ſo great importance as it was. Where many points were diſcourſed, ſome left off, and others agréed upon, in the end they determined, that the Emperor ſhould diſpatch <hi>Sergil</hi> of an Ambaſſage into great <hi>Brittain,</hi> to certifie King <hi>Amadis,</hi> of the great preparations made againſt him: unto whom inſtructions being given, there was a letter delivered which the Emperor wrote unto the King his Father, wherewith the Meſſenger had charge to ſignifie to him, that all the Pagan Kings (perſwaded thereunto by the Children of <hi>Arcalaus</hi> and others which hée named) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red divers Armies for to invade his Land, and therefore hée wiſhed him to prepare all his Haven Towns, to fortifie his Frontiers, and to aſſemble from all parts his friends, allies, vaſſals and ſubjects, becauſe the deſcending of thoſe Armies were uncertain, and that the Emperor could never have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof, but only by <hi>Coſdroel.</hi> Yet did hée eſtéem
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55249:11"/>
it for moſt certain and true, remitting the reſt unto <hi>Sergils</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whom he eſtéemed wiſe enough to deliver the ſame, as having heard it likewiſe from the mouth of King <hi>Norandel</hi> himſelf. Hée being then diſpatched away, having wind and ſhipping ready, imbarked himſelf, and being at Sea, leaving <hi>Thrace</hi> and ſailed towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence paſſing the ſtraights, entred into the Ocean Seas, making towards <hi>Brittain:</hi> but wee will leave him on his voyage for this time, that <hi>Don Flores</hi> complain not of us to have forgotten him.</p>
               <p>Hée being pricked forward with the ſpéeches of his Father, thought hee did him wrong to delay his taking the order of Knighthood, until the coming of the Turks, wherewith hée found himſelf not greatly pleaſed, but toſſing and revolving in his minde on the ſame, had no other thought but only to find the means how, without his Fathers leave or his knowledge, hée might attain unto his purpoſe, but by no means could hée deviſe the ſame: for firſt hee had heard King <hi>Norandel</hi> blame the over great ſluggiſhneſſe of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Knights, for being become too idle and ſlacker in arms, then the honor and duty of Knighthood did require: and yet had he not any acquaintance elſewhere. Nevertheleſſe, his age, greatneſſe, and force, together with his courage, willed him to forget that effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and courtly life, and from thenceforth to employ himſelf unto works of vertue, worthy of great dignity and praiſe, wherewith his minde, being both night and day perplexed and troubled, that he could not kéep the matter ſo ſecret, but that of force he muſt uſe ſome ſpéech thereof to <hi>Lipſan</hi> of <hi>Moniaſte,</hi> Son unto <hi>Brian</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he loved, affected, and was private withall, more than any other that attended on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſo that one day among the reſt, they walking together in an Arbor, and being out of all company, he began to diſcourſe unto him the ſecrets of his heart, without omitting any point thereof, deſiring his opinion therein.</p>
               <p>Sir, anſwered he, my adviſe is, that in all things you ought to follow the will and pleaſure of the Emperor: for you muſt think, that whether it bée in this or any other thing that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your honor, hée is more careful for you, than your ſelf.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55249:11"/>
You ſay ſo, ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> and yet you know well enough at what bay hée holdeth mée, and the prolongation he uſeth againſt my deſire: wherefore I am determined, whatſoever happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereof, to depart from hence, whether I hope not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, until ſuch time that by my valiant enterpriſes in Arms, I may bée eſtéemed worthy the linage whereof I am deſcended, for that accurſed is the Son, that reſembleth the Father no more but only in being his Childe, and not in his vertues and good conditions.</p>
               <p>You know my Lord, ſaid <hi>Lipſan,</hi> that I will never diſobey you, but will bear you company, not only in this enterpriſe, but in all others it ſhall pleaſe you to undertake, as hée that moſt deſireth to do you ſervice. Of my faith my good friend, ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf thereof, likewiſe do I love and eſtéem you more, than any kinſman or friend I have: and becauſe I perceive King <hi>Norandel</hi> coming towards us, let us leave off our diſcourſe for this time, and the next day when we ride on hunting, we will conclude, whereas we may with more privity and leiſure deviſe thereof.</p>
               <p>So it is beſt, anſwered <hi>Lipſan,</hi> whereupon King <hi>Norandel</hi> approached, to whom they went, telling him that they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the next day to hunt, ſo to paſſe the time. Of my faith, ſaid the King, ſuch pleaſure is fit for young Princes and great Lords: at the leaſt (ſaid <hi>Lipſan</hi>) if we cannot prove our force againſt wandring Knights, wée will exerciſe the ſame upon all kinde of Beaſts wée finde. Being in this diſcourſe they entred into the Palace, where they met <hi>Falangris, Abris de Sauſirege,</hi> and other Gentlemen, unto whom the enterpriſe of their hunting was made known, to the end that each of them might bée ready the next day. Next morning, the hunters went abroad very early into the Forreſt to make preparation before the Princes coming thither, but ſcarſe had they entred therein, but that all the young Gentlemen were at their héels.</p>
               <p>The wood was very full of Harts, Hindes, Does, Wolves, Bears, Lions, and other kinde of Beaſts, giving ſufficient cauſe of recreation, as alſo a place very fit to bring them up:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55249:12"/>
for beſides the largeneſſe and thickneſſe thereof, it was at the end cloſed with the Sea, and on the ſides with Rocks and Caves, where they were not long time ſéeking game, but <hi>Don Flores</hi> alwaies accompanied by <hi>Lipſan,</hi> began to ſay unto him, I pray you (my good friend) let us go aſide and there make an end of our deviſe yeſterday begun, which to do as then, was not very difficult, for that ſome were buſied in ſetting up of nets, others in looſing of Hounds and other Dogs, after their Game, and the moſt part in beating the buſhes, and ſéeking who ſhould firſt finde ſome kind of beaſt or other lying at reſt, whereby theſe two young Princes had means to follow their pretended delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without any thing perceived by <hi>Don Falangris,</hi> who the Emperor had expreſſely ſent thither to attend upon his ſon. They entred into the thickneſſe of the Wood, wherein they had not ridden long, but iſſuing out of a buſhy path way, entred into a pleaſant meadow, in the midſt whereof ſprang one of the moſt faireſt and cleareſt fountains of water that could be ſéen: at the brink whereof they alighted, for that already the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be ſomewhat high, and the air to be hot, and unbridling their Horſes, giving them liberty to féed, ſate them down under a great Palm-Trée, where <hi>Don Flores</hi> returning unto his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the day before begun, let his Friend underſtand, that his mind was fully reſolved not to return any more unto the Court, but to depart thence, ſéeking his adventures, until ſuch time as he might obtain the order of Knighthood: for believe mée (ſaith hée) my good friend, it is ſmall honor for mée, being the Son of ſuch a Father as I am, and Nephew unto the great King <hi>Amadis,</hi> to dwell ſo long time among Ladies, and to bée their minion, continuing an effeminate and idle life. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe not to have any other riches in this World, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good Harneſſe, a ſtrong Spear, and a gallant Horſe to ride on, wherewith I aſſure my ſelf, and my heart ſo giveth mée, that I ſhall win Renown, and may attain unto that degrée of honour, which ſo many good knights heretofore have obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lipſan</hi> hearing him ſpeak with ſo great an affection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that very hardly ſhould hée break off or diſſwade him from that which he ſo reſolutely had concluded in his mind, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55249:12"/>
him, ſaying: My Lord, I find your deviſe good: but yet it ſéemeth unto mée very hard for us to eſcape out of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in ſuch ſecret manner as you deſire, either by Land or Sea. Did you never hear (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) that to the thing a man pretendeth, and purpoſely goeth about, nothing is hard or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. God hath likewiſe created him above all the beaſts moſt ſingular and incomparable. Wherefore let us boldly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our journey, and you ſhall ſée that aid will not be wanting, and if the worſt fall, let us enter diſguiſed among others into the firſt Bark that ſetteth ſail: yet were it better (anſwered <hi>Lipſan</hi>) to take the Bark wherein I came hither, and with my men ſail whither Fortune ſhall lead us.</p>
               <p>It is well ſaid (anſwered <hi>Don Flores</hi>) and for the reſt let mée alone: We will depart by night, and I will take ſo much money with mée, that we will have ſufficient to furniſh our ſelves both of Horſes and Armors. And being in this diſcourſe, they heard the buſhes and hedges ſhake, and therewith a great noyſe as it were ruſhing through the thickets, of ſome thing that ſéemed to make towards them, and preſently they perceived a great and fierce Lyon, with moſt fiery eyes iſſuing forth of the Wood, which being oppreſſed with over great thirſt, ran with open throat right forward unto the Fountan, where they as then ſate talking together. Nevertheleſſe for all this furious encounter, neither of them was once abaſhed, but <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> riſing up, began to ſpeak unto the Lyon: by the Gods fair beaſt, you are but evil taught, to come ſo boldly to councel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are called, at the leaſt if thirſt conſtrained you thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, you ought to have come in better ſort, without fearing of our Horſes as you have done.</p>
               <p>This Lyon had béen chaſed and hardly purſued by the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and running that way to refreſh himſelf, perceiving <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> to reſiſt him, in great fury and rage made towards him, which <hi>Don Flores</hi> perceiving, not being as yet riſen, ſtarted preſently up, and taking a Hunting Glave that hung by his ſide, ſteppedback, and therewith gave the Lyon ſuch a blow on the hinder loyns, that he cut off one of his legs; and wounded the other, wherewith the Lyon felt ſo great pain, that with his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55249:13"/>
cry all the Forreſt rang, and yet with that little force he had left, he fiercely made towards <hi>Don Flores,</hi> who redoubling his blow, ſtrake him on the head, wherewith he cut off one of his ears: yet did not the Lyon ceaſe, but ramping up, bit him in ſuch manner through the Arm, that he made his téeth méet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and had it not béen for the pangs of death, wherewith he was oppreſſed, aſſure your ſelf he had done him greater hurt; but therewith he fell down dead upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Ha (ſaid <hi>Lipſan</hi>) to <hi>Don Flores,</hi> as far as I can perceive you are wounded, and yet hath he paid well for his boldneſſe, I have no harme (God be thanked) ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi> that is dangerous, and ſhewing him his naked arm, they ſaw that it would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily healed. By my ſoul (ſaid <hi>Lipſan</hi>) laughing, the fault was mine, and the pain yours: but becauſe he thought he could not obtain any great honour againſt mée, although I had angred him, he had rather leave mée and his injury unrevenged, to die with more honour by your hands. Then began they to behold the force and greatneſſe of the beaſt, and not without great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and aſtoniſhment, for that two of the beſt knights in all <hi>Greece,</hi> had found themſelves ſufficient work to overcome the ſame. And ſo leaving the Beaſt ſtretched along the graſſe, ſate them down again by the Water ſide, the heat of the day more and more encreaſing, and hunger likewiſe beginning to approach, for that they had not eaten all the day, being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their company, as they were; Whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſet forwards, ſéeking where they might finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, when as they perceived making towards them two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, each of them mounted upon a fair Palfrey, richly trapped and they themſelves moſt bravely apparelled, but as it ſéemed unto them ſtrangers. Wherefore <hi>Lipſan</hi> ſaid, if wée were wandring knights, this fountain would not leave us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome adventures, as far as I perceive, yet this that now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth and ſecondeth is not ſo dangerous as the firſt.</p>
               <p>Whereunto <hi>Don Flores</hi> beginning to anſwer, the two young Gentlewomen, came to ſalute them, which in moſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous manner they did, for firſt lighting on foot, and as if they had known <hi>Don Flores</hi> long time before, began to honour him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55249:13"/>
and do him great reverence. Wherefore he received them in the moſt courteous manner he could, ſaying, Gentlewomen, if it pleaſe you to requeſt any thing at our hands, aſſure your ſelves it ſhall not be refuſed. God reward you (ſaid they both) for at ſuch a mans hands as you are, there is no other to be looked for, and thus much we will aſſure you, that if you deſire to do us pleaſure, we have no leſſe will to do you ſervice, and for the ſame cauſe are we come out of far Countries unto you, thereby to eaſe our hearts, and likewiſe ſatisfie your deſires.</p>
               <p>In good faith Gentlewomen (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) I thank you as much as poſſible I may, and I hope one day to make this your gentle offer better known and requited, when opportunity ſhall be offered, and you deſirous to employ mée. But I pray you (fair Ladies) tell us if it pleaſeth you, the occaſion of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither. My Lord (ſaid one of them) we are nouriſhed and live with a Lady an Aunt of ours, that wiſheth you great good and much honor, for the love ſhe beareth unto King <hi>Amadis</hi> your Granfather, and to the Emperor your Father, which Lady knowing your deſire, as alſo your reſolution, together with the ſmall means that reſteth unto you for the ſatisfaction of the ſame, hath commanded us, that with all ſpéed wée ſhould come at this time right into this place, where ſhée told us wée ſhould finde you, as now we do.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) that your Aunt ſhould know that, which very hardly I my ſelf do know? Shée did truely (ſaid ſhe) for ſhée told us for certain, that we ſhould finde you by this Fountain, where you ſhould have ſlain this horrible beaſt, which here we ſée lye dead before us, and that by the ſame you ſhould be Wounded, but not much, as alſo that your meaning was to depart from the Court, and ſecretly to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelf into ſome other Countrey (unknown) there to be made Knight, that afterward you might ſéek ſome ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. And becauſe the Lady whereof I ſhew you cannot forget the great favours and courteſies by her received of your friends, ſhée is deſirous to do you this pleaſure wherewith you ſhall finde your heart at eaſe, and your mind content.</p>
               <p>Thereat was <hi>Don Flores</hi> more aſtoniſhed then before, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55249:14"/>
he never thought that ever any other then <hi>Lipſan</hi> had had ſo great a part within the ſecrets of his thoughts, and perceiving theſe two Gentlewomen to declare unto him ſo much thereof, namely of that which happened unto him at the Fountain. Hée found himſelf much troubled in his mind, in ſuch manner that he could not refrain to ſay unto them. Truely Gentlewomen, you tell mée ſo much of that which I meant to kéep moſt ſecret, that I can very hardly be perſwaded, that ever I thought it. This is but a ſmall matter (anſwered the firſt) in reſpect of that which our Aunt can do, and that which ſhe hath heretofore made known unto King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and to your Father, (at ſuch time as he received the order of Knighthood in the firm Iſle) and ſince that time unto the Emperor your Brother.</p>
               <p>At that inſtant <hi>Don Flores</hi> called to mind that he had heard ſpeaking of <hi>Vrganda la Deſcogneve,</hi> and of the marvails ſhée had wrought; whereupon he gave more credit unto the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels words then before he did, and ſo much, that thereupon hée ſaid (I pray God Gentlewoman) that hée will grant mée time one day to acknowledge the good will and favour your Aunt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto mée, for conſidering, the pleaſures and ſervices ſhée hath alwaies done unto my kindred, it were more than reaſon, that ſo long as breath is in my body, I ſhould love, honour, and eſtéem her. VVherefore determine with your ſelves what courſe it pleaſeth you that I ſhould take, and which ſhe willeth mée to follow, and aſſure your ſelves I will do it, whatſoever it bée.</p>
               <p>My good Lord (ſaid ſhe) my Aunt knowing all by mée before declared, and your meaning to abandon this Countrey, as alſo the great profit you ſhall hereafter purchaſe unto all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, deſireth you by us, that you will preſently embarke your ſelf in the ſmall Boat which we have left here at the ſhore ſide, and if you have deſire to be Knighted, there was never ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered unto any other then this that is now prepared for you. Thereat <hi>Don Flores</hi> ſtudied a little, and then anſwered: you being come ſo far as you ſay, it were againſt reaſon you ſhould loſe your labours, wherefore I am determined wholly to obey my Lady your Aunts pleaſure, and accompliſh all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe will command mée, and therefore let us depart when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55249:14"/>
it pleaſeth you. You do even as you ſhould, ſaid the other, and well ſhall it happen unto you; but before our departure we muſt heal you of your wound, and drawing out of her ſléeve a ſmall Ivory box, taking him by the arm, ſhe ſtriped up his ſléeve, and rubbing over his Wound, ſhée ſo eaſed him, that preſently hée felt no more pain, therefore he could not refrain to ſay, I thank God now I féel my ſelf whole, there is nothing more to be done but to find our Horſes and follow after you. Care you not for them (ſaid the Damoſel) you ſhall get up before mée, and your companion before my Siſter, till we come unto the ſea ſhore, which is not far from hence, where we ſhall find all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us. Well then ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> let us in Gods name depart.</p>

                  <p>How <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan</hi> entred into the Barke, ſailing in the Sea, untill they arrived in the Iſle <hi>non Trovee,</hi> where <hi>Vrganda la Deſcognenda</hi> dwelt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SO long rid the two Gentlewomen with <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> that they came unto the Sea ſhore, where finding a Ship ready they embarked themſelves, ſailing with ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Winde, that ſcarce did <hi>Don Flores</hi> think to have béen out of the ſight of the famous and great City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when as already they were ſo far off, that they had not onely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Country of <hi>Thrace,</hi> but alſo the ſight of any Land or Country whatſoever, ſéeing nothing elſe but onely Skies, Clouds, VVater, and Waves. And ſailing day and night, in the end they arrived in a certain place, where twelve Dwarfs ſtanding in order one by one, attending their comming, with Horſes ready for them, and preſently after came thither divers Gentlemen and others, that lead them ſtraight unto a banck, where going ſomewhat higher, they diſcovered a Valley moſt pleaſantly filled with Trées and running Fountains, the like thereof they had never ſéen before, which they paſſed through till they came to the ſide of a moſt pleaſant Iſland, being there, <hi>Don Flores</hi> asked them in what place they were, and what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55249:15"/>
name ſo fruitful and pleaſant a Countrey had. Sir ſaid one of the Gentlewomen this Iſle you ſée before you, is called <hi>non Trovee,</hi> where <hi>Urganda la Deſcogneve</hi> dwelleth, and where you ſhall be ſo welcome, that you will account the travel you have taken in this long journey well employed.</p>
               <p>Truely Gentlewoman, ſaid he, your company hath béen ſo acceptable unto mée, that this which you name travel, is in my behalf turned unto reſt, and pleaſure by reaſon of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I have to ſée my Lady your Aunt. For the which ſhe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily thanked him, and longer had they continued in this talke, but that comming unto another Arm of the Sea, they ſtayed there becauſe they muſt of force paſſe the ſame to go unto the Palace of <hi>Vrganda.</hi> Then the Gentlewoman that had moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained <hi>Don Flores</hi> during his journey, ſaid unto him; Fair Gentleman, this place you ſée (as I ſaid before) is called the Iſle <hi>non Trovee,</hi> and that by good right, for except it pleaſeth my Lady and Aunt, although all the Princes of the Eaſt were purpoſed to come unto it, yet could they never finde it, and yet I tell you more, that although it bée but ſmall both in breadth, length, and circuit, yet I dare aſſure you, that in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it is not ſecond unto any, neither is there the like to be found for pleaſantneſſe of air, throughout the whole VVorld. So I think (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) as far as I can perceive, of the reſt I cannot judge (as knowing nothing) becauſe that as yet I have not ſéen it.</p>
               <p>Believe mée ſaid the Gentlewoman, when you ſée it you will eſtéem the ſight to be much more then the report, and the Renown to be leſſe then it deſerveth. And ſaying ſo they land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they were already at the waters ſide, where a great Barke ſtayed for them, wherein they entred and paſſed over, and then mounting again on their Horſes, riding ſo long, till at laſt they diſcovered a far off a ſtrong fortreſſe, ſo ſhining, that it ſéemed to be made of Chryſtal, for in déed it was builded all of white Marble, poliſhed, and gilded both below and above; whereat <hi>Don Flores</hi> took great pleaſure, yet not ſo much as hée did approaching near unto it, and not without cauſe, for there was never any Houſe better ſeated, built, nor perfectly deviſed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55249:15"/>
then it was, ſpecially the entry and all the portal, being moſt high and ſtately raiſed, with many fair pillars, and that which made it ſéem moſt excellent, was a ſtory wherein was painted the combate that <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi> made for the delivery of <hi>Brandoze,</hi> one of <hi>Urgandas</hi> friends, holden in priſon by the Lord of the Caſtle <hi>de la Chauſee,</hi> where one of her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by deceit had ſhut him in, as by the ſame Hiſtory is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that ſo naturally, that there wanted only life to expreſs the ſame. Whereat <hi>Don Flores</hi> and his companion <hi>Lipſan</hi> took great pleaſure, becauſe they ſaw King <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> as they thought, even in the ſame age that they then were, with the Gyant which they long time beheld, and longer had done, but that one of the Gentlewoman perceiving the gate ſhut, called the Porter and bade him open it.</p>
               <p>Then there came an old Gentlewoman which preſently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it, and receiving <hi>Don Flores,</hi> ſaid unto him welcome, the faireſt young Gentleman now living, with all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then taking him by the hand, ſhée led him into a great Hall within the Palace, where <hi>Urganda la Deſcognevee</hi> ſtayed for him, whom the old woman ſhewed unto him, ſaying, Gentleman, behold there my Lady that hath taken the pains to méet and receive you. Then looking before him, hée perceived an old Woman moſt honorably and richly apparelled, with two big, fair, and well diſpoſed ancient Knights (about forty years of age) going before her, and ſhée following, being led by two Gentlewomen her couzens, the one named <hi>Juliande,</hi> the other <hi>Soliſe,</hi> for her old years did not permit her to ſhew her ſelf in braver ſort. Whom <hi>Don Flores</hi> moſt humbly ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And ſhée ſtretching forth her arms to receive him, ſaid, Gentleman, you are moſt heartily welcome hither, long time is it ſince I deſired moſt earneſtly to ſée you; but my ſickneſſe and aged years have hindred me ſo much, that without the ſame I had long time ere now viſited you and done you ſervice, as I have heretofore continued to do to your neareſt kinſmen and friends.</p>
               <p>Madam, anſwered hée, all thoſe of whom you ſpeak are ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55249:16"/>
much bound and beholding unto you, and I alſo, that as long as I live I will not ceaſe to acknowledge the ſame, in any thing wherein it ſhall pleaſe you to command me. My good Childe (ſaid ſhe) thereof am I well aſſured, and thank you therefore moſt heartily. But ſéeing we are in queſtion of <hi>Urganda,</hi> it ſhall not bée amiſſe to touch a word or two of that by the way. You muſt then underſtand, that after the inchantment of <hi>Amadis</hi> and others in the univerſal Tower, ſhée returned unto her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland <hi>non Trovee,</hi> where ſhée paſſed her life long time in great pleaſure and delight, as much as poſſible might bée: living therein with her friends, where it happened unto her (more by the permiſſion of God, then by reaſon of her age) that her ſight began by little and little to diminiſh, ſo that in the end ſhée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtark blinde, and ſo continued without her ſight. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe being ſo retired into her Iſle, and there attending the hour of death, when it ſhould pleaſe God to call her, ſhée kept her ſelf a long ſpace in ſilence, without cauſing any report or ſpéech to run of her, as before ſhe had done. True it is, that ſhe ſent two of her couzins unto <hi>Niquee,</hi> to unlooſe and deliver out of captivity, thoſe whom ſhée had inchanted: but they could not bring it to paſſe, and ſo her intent took no effect, till ſuch time the gate was opened unto them by another means, as in the Books of <hi>Amadis</hi> you may read.</p>
               <p>Wherefore wée will now return unto the matter that wée left, and ſhew you, how that <hi>Urganda</hi> underſtanding by her kinſwoman, the delivery of thoſe Priſoners, Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, and perceiving by her Art the great danger prepared againſt all Chriſtendome, and their ſtrong and hard battels that the pagans ſhould fight in great <hi>Brittain</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, whereof <hi>Don Flores</hi> ſhould bée the defender, and as it were the Buckler; determined with her ſelf to ſend for him, by ſuch means as you heard before, and in the ſhort time as then reſting, cauſed him to be made Knight with as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as he deſired: which to attain, ſhée ſent two gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that found him in the Wood with <hi>Lipſan,</hi> and in ſuch manner led them away with them unto her, of whom they were well received; in ſuch ſort, that imbracing <hi>Lipſan,</hi> ſhée
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55249:16"/>
ſaid unto him, my Son, I love and eſtéem you much, not only for the love of the King your Father, to whom during my life I have wiſhed great honour and all good; but alſo for the hope I have, that like as hée in his young years was a courteous, gentle, milde, hardy, and amorous Knight, you will follow his ſteps, and not be leſſe in fame then he.</p>
               <p>On my faith Lady (anſwered he) I have not for this preſent any greater deſire then to do you ſervice, wherein the greateſt Princes and Knights of the world, ought moſt willingly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves for your ſake.</p>
               <p>Truely friend (ſaid ſhée) at the leaſt your Father hath ſhewed the ſame in times paſt, which maketh me more affectioned to wiſh you well. In the mean time <hi>Don Flores</hi> entertained <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande</hi> and <hi>Soliſe,</hi> mothers of the Kings <hi>Talanque,</hi> and namely, both as then remaining in the Iſlands of <hi>Caliſorine:</hi> But <hi>Urgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> called him away, and taking him aſide with <hi>Lipſan,</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I pray you lead me into the Orchard, where I will give you to underſtand certain things that import you much, and will not be unprofitable unto you. Then taking her each of them by one arm, entred into a pleaſant Park, moſt fair, goodly beſet with trées, and repleniſhed with ponds, rivers, fountains, and ſprings, that the like was not to be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, except it were the Palace of <hi>Apolidon</hi> in <hi>Firm Iſle,</hi> whereof you have heard in other places. Where they ſitting down, <hi>Urganda</hi> began as followeth.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, ſaid ſhée unto <hi>Don Flores,</hi> it is already high time for you to enter into the way to attain that good which is prepared and predeſtinate unto you, taking arms, for that ſince the times of <hi>Perion, Luiſart,</hi> and <hi>Amadis,</hi> never any Knight attained unto thoſe points of honour that you ſhall obtain, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an end ſo haughty and difficult enterpriſes, that you will loſe the deſire that pricketh you forward, in remembring the proweſſes done by your famous anceſters.</p>
               <p>There ſhall not want any thing in me, ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> if it pleaſeth God, and though it ſhould coſt me a thouſand deaths, if it were poſſible to endure ſo many. I know that (ſaid <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi>) it may be, better then you think I do, whereof time
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55249:17"/>
ſhall witneſſe, which ſhall confirm my words, and that I have foreſhewed unto you, and to the end you ſtay no longer in ſo fair a begining, I will take that order whereof I will tell you; Firſt I will provide you of the beſt arms that ever (it may bée) were forged, with one of the moſt couragious and goodly horſes whereon Knight did ever ride, the like will I give to <hi>Lipſan,</hi> and to each of you your Eſquire, with a ſhip, therein moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to convey you both unto <hi>Rome</hi> unto the Emperor, of whom you ſhall receive the order of Knighthood, ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by you, aſſuring my ſelf hée will not refuſe it unto you.</p>
               <p>At the Emperours hands (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) I think it will not bée, for that not long ſince. I have heard, that not any wandring Knight, ſearching ſtrange adventures ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or accounted of by him, but as much as in him lieth hée hindreth them, and I fear he would conſtrain me thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Thereof take you no care (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) hée hath ſince that time changed his opinion, but I pray you moſt earneſtly, that meeting with <hi>Talanque</hi> and <hi>Manely,</hi> you will receive them into your company, as being loved of me, which love you no leſſe than I do them, notwithſtanding their near affinity to me.</p>
               <p>This prayer (ſaid he) ſhall be a commandment unto me, and when time ſerveth, I will accompliſh the ſame, ſeeing it is your pleaſure, or any other thing whatſoever you ſhall give me in change: for it is not unknown unto you with what deſire I am yours, and that moſt willingly I will ſo remain during life. That know I well (ſaid <hi>Urganda</hi>) and to begin, ſaid ſhe, you ſhall remain certain daies with me, and ſhall be my Gueſts, until ſuch time order be taken for all things neceſſary for your voyage. Madam (ſaid hee) we will never diſobey whatſoever you command. And for that it was already late, and the tables covered for ſupper, they altogether withdrew themſelves into the Palace, where we leave them, returning unto <hi>Don Falamgris</hi> and others that we left in the Wood near unto <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

                  <p>How <hi>Don Falamgris</hi> perceived the Prince <hi>Don Flores</hi> abſence, and of the diligence he uſed to finde him out, and what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu have heard before in what ſort <hi>Don Flores</hi> left the company of the Hunters buſie at their Game, and of the reſt that the ſame morning were there aſſembled, who having in the end taken and killed many beaſts, and being ſatisfied with the pleaſure, together with the pain they then had indured, <hi>Don Falamgris</hi> calling to mind the two young Princes, which more then any other were recommended unto his charge, <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan,</hi> and ſéeing them not, neither yet hearing any news of them, there was never poor Gentleman more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed then he, for he withdrew from all company drowned almoſt in tears, and his arms croſſe one over the other, went all alone in each by path and crooked way, making the greateſt lamentations and ſorrows in the VVorld.</p>
               <p>O moſt ſorrowful and hard fortunate man (ſaith he) what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wilt thou from henceforth yeild unto the Emperor of the thing he loved moſt dearly, and having no ſooner ended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints but taking his horn in his hand, he blew therewith as loud as poſſible he might, in a manner as if ſome beaſt had béen taken, hoping by that long kind of blaſt to call and aſſemble thoſe that he ſo much deſired to finde out; but all that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, news could he hear none: where at he found himſelf more abaſhed then before, and not he alone but all the reſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which in the ſame manner traverſed, both Hedges and Ditches, through thick and thin, to finde that they could not ſée. But all in vain, for what diligence ſoever they uſed, or what unknown or thick way ſoever they took, not one of them could learn any thing, until <hi>Falamgris</hi> in a manner more dead then living, by chance arrived at the Fountain, hard by the which the dead Lyon lay, and preſently after him came thither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two Hunters, of whom he asked if they had heard any news of their Lords. No (ſaid they) but onely this, that you ſée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

you. And lighting off their Horſes, began to behold the beaſt again, and ſéeing the blows the beaſt had, Ha ſaid <hi>Falam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris,</hi> he that gave thée thy death, was not a learner to ſtrike, and ſcarce had he ended his ſpéech, but caſting his eye aſide, hée perceived the bridles of two Horſes hanging on a Trée, that for fear of the Lyon were fled into the buſhes: which ſight ſo moved <hi>Falamgris,</hi> that he doubted either their Maſters were dead, or that ſome evil fortune had happened unto them, which made him ſtand ſtill in a manner all amazed.</p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>Abres de Sanſuegne</hi> with a great troup of others came thither, driving thrée ſomiers charged with Veniſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, wherewith they thought to make <hi>Falamgris</hi> merry, but the joy they had continued but a while, when they once knew of the loſſe and abſence of <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan,</hi> on which their abſence they made many diſcourſes; and divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, were pretended, yet in the end none found better, then that <hi>Falamgris</hi> ſhould return preſently unto <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to advertiſe the Emperor to the end that order might bée taken therein. That will I not do though I dye for it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Falamgris</hi>) but you my Lord of <hi>Sanſuegne</hi> ſhall go, and give him to underſtand, all what is happened unto us, in the mean time I will make ſuch ſearch throughout the whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that if it be poſſible to hear any news of them, I will know it, though it be long firſt: Which <hi>Abres</hi> was content to do. Now it was about Sun-ſetting, and in a manner night before any of them came into the Town where the Emperor was. Who being advertiſed thereof, asked very earneſtly how it happened. <hi>Don Abres</hi> ſhewed him from point to point, which he bare with great modeſty without once ſhewing any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of grief, only in beholding the Empreſſe in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her ſelf, and as it were out of the bounds and limits of reaſon: nevertheleſſe, hée knew ſo well how to comfort her, that in the end ſhée armed her ſelf with more patience then before.</p>

No my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, but onely by the dead Lyon, and the bridles, of two Horſes. True it is, that ſince that, I found <hi>Lipſans</hi> Horſe half devoured by beaſts, but of the other, I can hear no tydings at all, and at the uttering of thoſe words, hée ſhed forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears, that hée ſéemed as a man in a manner deſperate, and out of his wits, whereat the Emperor commanded him to ceaſe wéeping, for (ſaith he) ſuch behaviour rather becomes a childe, but bring mée where the beaſt lyeth, and where that is you have elſe found.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Falamgris</hi> ſpurred right unto the Fountain, where hard by there hung upon a trée the bits and bridles of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in a manner under them lay the Lyon dead. Marry (ſaid the Emperor then) behold (I pray you) what a furious beaſt was here: and preſently thereupon perceived a path, which hée commanded a Page to follow, untill he found the end: but not long after he returned again, bringing news, that not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then beaſts had paſſed that way, and that the ſame path went juſt upon the ſea ſhore, but ſaid he (my Lord) I have found a trace which giveth a light that the Horſes of <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan</hi> fled that way, and as he ſtepped forward to lead the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror on the way, King <hi>Norandel</hi> came unto him, who being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55249:19"/>
weary, had in a manner put his Horſe out of breath, in running after the Horſe of <hi>Don Flores</hi> that he had taken again, having of all the reſt of his Harneſſe, but onely the Saddle left, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he preſented himſelf before the Emperor, ſaying: My Lord, if we had as well found the Maſter as his Horſe, wée had done ſufficient for this daies Work: but I think him not to be within this VVood: for there is not one buſh that I have not ſought, but I believe rather that he hath embarked himſelf in ſome veſſel, paſſing along this ſhore, for I have found the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mens féet towards the Sea ſhore. I kon him thanks (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Emperor) in long time ſhall hée not ſo well try his fortune, as his Grand-father King <hi>Amadis,</hi> or my ſelf have done, I hope God will defend and kéep him from evil, being he is as he is, and from that day forward began to ſhew more chearful countenance then before, making known his high and couragious ſtomack, then when moſt it ſéemed oppreſſed with grief and adverſity.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid King <hi>Norandel</hi>) he hath loſt himſelf perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and it may be you ſhall ſée him again as good a Knight, as you would wiſh him to be. There is enough done (ſaid the Emperor) let us return again into the Town, where they were no ſooner entred but it was night: but when the Empreſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the little profit they had gotten by their travel, and that aſſuredly her Son was loſt. God knoweth how and in what manner ſhe ſhewed her ſelf a Woman (I would ſay a fool) but that ſuch a word is unſéemly for a Lady of ſo high a calling, if men would not excuſe, her in reſpect of the nature of her ſex.

               </argument>
               <p>THe court being in this uprore (as I ſhewed you before) the Emperor neither yet the Empreſſe thinking in long time to hear any news of their Son, the eight day following there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55249:19"/>
entred into the Court an Ancient Knight, who being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with four Eſquires, richly apparelled, méeting with the Duke <hi>Caſtilles,</hi> asked of him, if by any means hée might ſpeak with the Emperor himſelf, for (ſaid he) I bring him news wherewith he will be much pleaſed and content. In the name of God (ſaid the Duke) I will bring you into his preſence, for never was there Prince had more need thereof, and taking him by the hand, lead him into the Empreſſes Chamber, where the Emperor ſate deviſing among the Ladies, to whom the Duke ſaid: My Lord, this Knight asked for your Grace, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you (as he telleth mée) very good news, wherewith the Old Knight ſtepped forwards, and knéeling on his knées, (kiſſing a Letter that he held in his hand) delivered the ſame unto him, ſaying, My Lord, <hi>Vrganda la Deſcognovee,</hi> my Miſtreſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth her moſt humbly unto your Grace. But when the Emperor underſtood the name of the Gentlewoman, his heart leaped, and breaking the ſeal, he began to read it, whereof the tenor was as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt high and puiſſant Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da la Deſcognovee</hi> of long time not unknown unto you, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Graces proſperity, with all increaſe of joy and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

For ſuch ſhall be his valour and proweſſe in Arms, that not any living creature ſhall ever be able to attain unto the like, and ſuch ſhall be his reputation, that until the time of the good King <hi>Arthur</hi> which ſhall raign in great <hi>Brittain,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſhall be comparable unto him, for he ſhall recover the Countries loſt, and ſhall revenge the cruel murthers commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55249:20"/>
in his time, and becauſe all this ſhall happen and come to paſſe, and that before long time be paſt, I beſeech your Grace when they are fulfilled to have in remembrance that which by this Letter is now fore-ſhewed unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At ſuch time as the Falcon and black Kites of the Iſles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeas, ſhall make war againſt the fair birds and their young ones, the white and ſubtle Eagle ſhall come forth to defend them, aided by the obſcure Eaglets and other birds that ſhall follow her, to aſſure her of her abode, one of her young ones being with her: by which means ſhall happen ſo brave and cruel a battel againſt the Falcon and black Kites, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them ſhall remain dead, taken, and ſpoiled in the place, and many of them alſo ſpotted with their own blood: at the ſame time likewiſe another Falcon that ſhall bee preſent, ſhall take courage, and with his ſharpe tallons being favoured of the white Eagle and her obſcure Eaglets, ſhall do ſo much for the ſweet birds, that he ſhall help to deſtroy the Falcons and black Kites, whereof ſhall bee ſuch ſlaughter made, that killing ſome, and ſlaying others, few or none of them ſhall have means to return unto their neſts, for the which deed the ſaid black Eagles, Aiders and Aſſiſters of the white Eagle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to recompence the glorious falcon, ſhall make him Lord and Governour of their young ones, lodging him in the higheſt and beſt place of their neſts. Whereof I pray your Grace to think upon, for all this without doubt will come to paſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Emperor (having read the Letter over twice or thrice) I believe that <hi>Vrganda</hi> ſaith the truth, and that this Propheſie ſhall come to paſſe, but for my part I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or comprehend the ſame. God grant all may fall out for the beſt, that whatſoever ſhe foretelleth mée of my Sonne, may come to ſuch an end, as both ſhe and I deſire: of this one thing am I very glad, that he liveth, and that ſo good and wiſe a Lady hath care over him. Then turning himſelf unto the Meſſenger, he asked him if his Miſtreſſe were in good health.</p>
               <p>And it pleaſe your Grace (anſwered the Knight) ſhée is very weak and féeble of body, but moſt ready and diſpoſed in mind to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55249:20"/>
do you ſervice; for although her years and great weakneſſe have taken from her the uſe and exerciſe of her eyes, yet have they not taken from her the deſire ſhe hath of executing that which may pleaſure you. In good truth (ſaid the Emperor) that have I alwaies expected in ſo good and vertuous a Lady as ſhe is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I am more beholding, then to any other of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion living: by reaſon of the pleaſures, benefits, and agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervices, I have received at her hands.</p>
               <p>If my Lady (anſwered the old Knight) travelleth, taking pains to pleaſe you, ſhe cannot do it for a greater Prince, nor one that more deſerveth it, and ſo hath ſhe given mée in charge to ſhew you, which having done I am preſently to return back again unto her. Wherefore my Lord, having fulfilled her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, it may pleaſe you to give mée leave. I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſaid the Emperor. My friend ſaid the Empreſſe, you ſhall commend mée heartily unto her, and ſhall give her certain ſmall preſents which I will ſend her, and to her two kinſwomen. Then ſhe commanded a little coffer of Cedar to be brought full of exquiſite things, which the old Knight having received, and his leave taken both of the Emperor and all the reſt, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame way he came, leaving the Court very joyful and contented with the good news he had delivered them, kéeping on his way as beſt pleaſed him.</p>
               <p>And now let us ſée in the mean time what <hi>Sergil</hi> being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for <hi>England</hi> on meſſage to King <hi>Amadis</hi> doth, to whom Wind and Fortune was ſo proſperous, that having ſailed the Italian Seas, and Ports of <hi>Spain,</hi> paſſed the ſtraights, entring into the Ocean Seas, ſailed ſo well that within two daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he departed, he arrived at <hi>Winſore,</hi> where he met with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerote de Stravanx,</hi> whom he knew very well, of whom he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where King <hi>Amadis</hi> lay, for that ſéing the town ſo bare of Gentlemen and Knights, he thought that the King had not as then béen lodged there, <hi>Angerot</hi> bade him welcome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with lead him unto the Court to the Kings preſence: of whom being welcomed hée ſaid: In Gods name <hi>Sergil</hi> what is the cauſe you do return ſo ſoon again from <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> How doth my Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55249:21"/>My Lord (ſaid <hi>Sergil</hi>) and it like your Grace, your Son is well and in good health, commending him unto you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with kiſſing the Letter, he preſented it unto him. Which the King having read, ſaid: It certifieth us of ſome news at hand. Such news and it like your Grace (anſwered <hi>Sergil</hi>) were good to be certified unto all your councel. Then the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſend for King <hi>Arban</hi> of North-<hi>Wales, Liſtoran de la tour Blanch, Grindolan</hi> Brother unto <hi>Angerote, Saquilles</hi> his Nephew, <hi>Lazadin Leſcrimeur,</hi> the Earl <hi>Durdalin,</hi> and divers other, before the which aſſembly, <hi>Sergil</hi> turning himſelf toward the King, began to recite what had happened unto them after his departure from <hi>Brittain,</hi> what a great tempeſt he was in, in what danger they were, the battel betwéen the <hi>Sarazens</hi> Ships and theirs, the impriſonment of <hi>Coſdroel,</hi> and laſtly, the determination and pretence of the Pagan Kings, moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Children of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> and others as miſchievous as they, whereof the Emperor my Maſter hath thought good to advertiſe your Grace, to the end you may provide for them, that you be not taken upon the ſuddain. And to the ſame end pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to ſend for all your Captains and Souldiers, Friends and Allies, together with the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled, and your Ports well furniſhed in Warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he hopeth this great and huge Army of Enemies can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all hurt you, but that all will turn unto their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and overthrow.</p>
               <p>And for his part aſſure your ſelf (my Lord) he ſléepeth not, but determineth, if they enterprize againſt him, ſo to receive and entertain them, that he hopeth to give them cauſe never to be ſo bold again, as to viſit him in ſuch ſort.</p>
               <p>Truly (ſaid the King) theſe hell-hounds have ſtill a quarrel againſt mée, yet have they at other times ſufficiently found and aſſayed what I can do. But if God will they ſhall féel once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this voyage what ſlaughter I can make of them, for if they once ſet foot on land, be it in great <hi>Brittain,</hi> or in any other place where I command, whatſoever falleth out, I will give them battel.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid King <hi>Arban</hi>) things done deliberately, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55249:21"/>
by counſel, have commonly good ſucceſſe. If they come to viſit you (as they brag they will) time and ſeaſon will give you means to reſiſt them then, as you ſhall find convenient. In the mean time, according to the Emperor your Sons counſel, you ſhall, if it pleaſe you make the matter known unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the reſt of your friends, by whom you may be ayded: giving order likewiſe that your Ports be well furniſhed, and all your ſhips rigged and prepared to ſet ſail when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you.</p>
               <p>So will I do anſwered the King, and therefore (good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin) I pray you let mée have your counſel therein. Séeing it is your will (my Lord, ſaid <hi>Arban</hi>) that I do it, I will take what pains I can therein. But who will you ſend in Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage unto <hi>Rome:</hi> Marry you (my Lord <hi>Lazadin,</hi> ſaid the king taking him by the Arm) ſhall take that charge upon you. You have heard what <hi>Sergil</hi> hath declared unto us from my Sonne, the ſame ſhall you declare unto the Emperour, and that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to have his men in a readineſſe, promiſing him that if the cloud falleth in <hi>Italy,</hi> preſently to aid him there and that whenſoever it falleth here about, that he will aid mée in like caſe, as I doubt not but he will.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid <hi>Lazadin</hi>) your pleaſure ſhall bee fulfilled. And I pray God give mée grace there and in other places to do you any ſervice I may. Prepare your ſelf then (ſaid the King) and take what company you think good with you. That done, the Counſel brake up, every one repairing to his lodging. The King and <hi>Arban</hi> together deviſing what order were beſt to bée taken for the Country. In the mean time <hi>Lazadin</hi> having Veſſels and men prepared, with a proſperous Winde ſet ſail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Oſtie,</hi> where being arrived, he Landed, and from thence took his journey unto <hi>Rome,</hi> being there, hée preſented himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor, of whom he was firſt moſt courteouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and then demanded the cauſe of his repair thither.</p>
               <p>And if it pleaſe your Grace anſwered <hi>Lazadin,</hi> King <hi>Amadis</hi> my Maſter recommendeth himſelf moſt affectionately unto you, and hath written you a Letter, wherewith he preſented the ſame unto the Emperor, wherein was nothing ſpecified but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55249:22"/>
onely a credit for the Meſſenger, and that he could at large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the matter unto him. Wherewith the Emperor prayed <hi>Lazadin</hi> to delare the ſame, which he did from point to point, as ye heard before, deſiring him at the end, in his Maſters behalf, to prepare a puiſſant Army, ready to reſiſt the Pagans power whereſoever they ſhould Land, were it in <hi>Italy</hi> or great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> aſſuring your Grace (ſaid he to the Emperor) and ſo hath the King my Maſter given me in charge to declare unto you, that if the cloud fall in your countrey, he will aid you with ſo great a force, that you ſhall know what deſire he hath to do you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and if it falleth in his Countries, that it will pleaſe you to ſuccour him in like manner, for that he ſaith your two forces being united together with your Friends and Allies, all the Princes of the Eaſt cannot in any ſort hurt or indamage you.</p>
               <p>Truely my friend anſwered the Emperor, the King my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath reaſon to eſtéem of mée as hée doth, therefore to bée brief, according to your meſſage, let him be aſſured that I will not fail, to prepare for their comming, and hold my men in a readineſſe, as intelligence ſhall be given us of our enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. In the mean time you ſhall reſt you here with mee, and then return again unto him with this anſwer, and a Letter withal from mée, which I ſhall give you: but Sir, I pray you go and viſit the Empreſſe and the Ladies.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid he) that ſhall I willingly do, for ſo am I commanded by the Quéen. I pray you do ſo (ſaid the Emperor) then leading him unto the Gentlewomens chambers, among the which were the Infants <hi>Eliſene,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> Daughter unto <hi>Angerote de Stravanx,</hi> whom <hi>Lazadin</hi> ſaluted immediately after his humble duty done unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.</p>
               <p>They, as moſt courteous Ladies began to deviſe with him, and amongſt other talke miniſtred. asked him if King <hi>Amadis</hi> were in as good health as they deſired hée ſhould be: I aſſure you (ſaid he) I left both the King and the Quéen in very good health, and ſo they willed mée to ſhew you, and therewithal do recommend themſelves unto you, but eſpecially to you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: unto whom if it ſhall pleaſe you to write ſome of your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55249:22"/>
news, they ſhall think it a great pleaſure at your hands, which I beſéech you do, and I will deliver it as one that deſireth to do you a greater ſervice, if at any time it ſhall pleaſe you to command the ſame at my hands.</p>
               <p>Truly my Lord <hi>Lazadin</hi> anſwered the Princeſſe <hi>Eliſene,</hi> I have heard ſo much of you, as touching your courteous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle entertainment of Gentlewomen and Ladies, that I now perceive you cannot forget your old behaviour and bringing up, for my part I heartily thank you for the great courteſie you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer mée, and after I underſtood your arrival here, fearing that the Kings affairs would conſtrain you to depart from hence without taking your leave of the Ladies, I have already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Letter, which I thought to deliver you my ſelf, or to have ſent it, by one of the Empreſſe her Gentlewomen, but ſéeing you have done us ſo much pleaſure as to viſit us in our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I pray you take it and deliver it your ſelf unto the King my Father, with his Daughters moſt humble commendations. Madam anſwered he, that will I do without doubt.</p>
               <p>This done, <hi>Lazadin</hi> ſtayed till evening very late among them, courting the Empreſſe and the other Ladies, as time and opportunity ſerved, and in the end took his leave, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received ſuch commendations and charges, as thoſe which might command him had delivered, as alſo what other matters they had to ſay, as well touching King <hi>Amadis,</hi> as alſo Quéen <hi>Oriane,</hi> and others, bidding them farewel, he went again unto the Emperor, of whom having received a Letter, as hée had promiſed him, to carry unto great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and his leave taken as well of him as of the Princes <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> and <hi>Floriſanda,</hi> hée with-drew himſelf unto his lodging, untill morning that hée got on Horſeback, and in great haſt travelled unto <hi>Oſtie,</hi> where taking ſhipping in the Bark that there ſtayed for him, with a proſperous Wind ſailed ſo far, that paſſing the <hi>Miditerranean</hi> Seas, he fell upon the Brittiſh Coaſt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan</hi> are offended to lye ſo long in oblivion, let it ſuffice you to know that <hi>Lazadin</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Winſore,</hi> where the King ſtayed his return, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well underſtood the meſſage by him, brought from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55249:23"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> preſently diſpatched <hi>Sergil</hi> for <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and others, that for the like affairs hée ſent abroad into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the land. Let us then leave them on their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and return wée unto our two young Gentlemen, which in the mean time were governed by old <hi>Urganda</hi> in the Iſle <hi>non Trovee.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IF all waies were ſtraight, and that wée néeded not often times either to paſſe over mountains, or compaſſe about ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, marſhes, and ditches, to arrive where we deſire to bée, we ſhould reſt us ſometimes, and the pains wée took would be leſſe tedious, and not ſéem ſo long, as oftentimes it is found to be. This I ſay, to the end that before we enter into the very depth of our Hiſtory, and the true diſcourſe of this Book, wée have béen forced to chooſe out crooked waies and follow obſcure paths, thereby drawing ſomewhat out of the way to make the matter more eaſie and intelligible: but ſéeing we are re-entred into the high way, beleive me the reſt of the way you have to walk, is much more eaſie and pleaſant than that which already wée have travelled: which to prove true, let us now return unto our matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan,</hi> which in the mean time ſtaied with <hi>Urganda,</hi> hoping from day to day, according to her promiſe, to be conducted to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to bée Knighted: one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt at Evening time, as then not expected of them, ſhe called them unto her, taking them aſide, ſaid, Now my Children, I have cauſed you to be fetched hither into this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, to the end you might obtain the thing you moſt deſired, that is, to receive the order of Knighthood, therein to imitate your Fathers and Friends, ſo much eſtéemed and feared throughout the whole world. And to the end you ſhall know how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55249:23"/>
you are to behave your ſelves therein, I will give you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for your Eſquires, two of my Nephews, whom I pray you to love, and uſe them in your ſervice, as thoſe whom I love with all my heart.</p>
               <p>Then ſhe called them unto her, naming the firſt <hi>Urgandin,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Filidonio,</hi> this ſaith ſhe to <hi>Don Flores,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Vrgandin,</hi> ſhall be yours, and the other <hi>Lipſans.</hi> They are both Gentlemen born, and of a good houſe: I pray God they may do you ſuch ſervice, as I hope and deſire they ſhould do. Then ſhe commanded the two Gentlewomen that brought them, to fetch her thither two truſſes ſhe had ready prepared, which they did, and unbinding them, took out of the firſt an Armour and Furniture appointed for <hi>Don Flores:</hi> the moſt fair, ſtrongeſt, and beſt tempered, that (it may be) ever came out of good workmans hands, as well could he prove that bare them afterward on his back, wherewith he remained conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in many great perils, and valiant enterpriſes by means of the ſame: but if the Plate were good and excellent, the Helmet, being as red as blood, was not far behinde, much leſſe the Shield, bearing gules, two <hi>Swans</hi> argent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Don Flores</hi> was afterward throughout divers Countries, named the Knight of the <hi>Swans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſée, ſaid <hi>Vrganda,</hi> this is a preſent I give unto you, and a Horſe ſhall you have correſpondent to ſerve your turn in all places where you travel: then unbinding the other, ſhée took out another Armour, all white as ſnow, with a Shield <hi>Or,</hi> ſtreamed with flames of fire, gules. And theſe, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> ſhall be yours: for like as in this Shield are painted flames burning, ſo ſhall your heart flame in the love of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Which indéed happened afterward: for he bare ſuch and ſo extream an affection unto the fair <hi>Cliſtibalda,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Norandel,</hi> that he was ready to dye for her ſake, and for the love of her he accompliſhed, and brought to an end, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair and ſtrange adventures, as it ſhall bée recited in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of our Hiſtory, wherein he ſhall be called by his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, the Knight of the burning flames.</p>
               <p>Then giving order for his Horſe, and other neceſſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55249:24"/>
and fit for his and <hi>Don Flores</hi> departure, ſhe ſaid: I pray God, my Children, that all may fall out to his glory and ſervice, and that to your honours you may receive the order of Knighthood, to bear Arms during your lives, as your ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have done before you, whereunto that you may attain, in the morning betimes you ſhall enter into a Ship, ready rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and prepared for you in the Haven, and ſhall ſail right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rome,</hi> where theſe my Gentlewomen ſhall accompany you, for they ſhall ſerve you and do you much pleaſure in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, aſſuring you that in all my life I never knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man nor woman except Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> more expert in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery than they are.</p>
               <p>Therewith the two young Gentlemen gave her moſt hearty thanks: and for that time took their leave, the next morning minding to imbark themſelves, which they did, aſſoon as day appeared with ſo good a wind and proſperous journy, that they arrived ſafely at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the two Gentlewomen not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what they had to do, apparelled themſelves moſt richly, then commanding two white Geldings to be ſadled, got upon them, deſiring the two young Gentlemen to ſtay for them till they came again: for ſaid they, it is requiſite that we go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſpeak with the Emperor, which done, we will return and certifie you what anſwer he maketh: God be your ſpéed, anſwered <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they rid in haſte unto the City, where they arrived at ſuch time as the Emperor with the Ladies were ſet at meat, they entred into the great Hall, where they found them almoſt ready for their fruit, and with moſt reverent countenance preſented themſelves before him. And as being well brought up, made unto him thrée low courteſies. Gentlewomen ſaid the Emperor, have you any cauſe to uſe my help, or any others that are of my Court.</p>
               <p>And it liketh your Grace ſaid they, unto your ſelf only are we adreſſed: you then have found me, ſaid the Emperor, ready to make you acquainted with the good deſire I have to ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Ladies and Gentlewomen, any ſervice I can.</p>
               <p>We hope no leſſe of the vertue and magnanimity that is in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55249:24"/>
your Grace, anſwered they, although we never deſerved the ſame at your hands. Well then ſaid the Emperor, in what thing will you now imploy me? for if it be poſſible, aſſure your ſelves, I will accompliſh the ſame.</p>
               <p>My Lord ſaid they, wée are come out of a far and ſtrange Country, to bear company unto two Gentlemen of moſt high and noble Parentage, one whereof hath great deſire to bee made Knight. And becauſe there is not any part of the world wherein Knighthood flouriſheth more, than in this your Court, he hath reſolved and determined with himſelf not to receive the ſame, unleſſe it be at your hands my Lord, if it pleaſe your Grace to inveſt him therewith: and for that he knoweth that ſuch favours are commonly granted by Princes and great Lords, ſuch as you are, ſooner to Gentlewomen, than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whatſoever they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he therefore hath deſired us to take the pains, although to us but a pleaſure, to come unto your Majeſty, to preſent this his humble requeſt, which and it pleaſeth your Grace, under your correction, you ſhall grant him: aſſuring you, that both the one and the other for whom we intreat, are of blood Royal, and of ſo noble houſes, that it ſhall redound unto your Graces honor and glory.</p>
               <p>Truely Gentlewomen, ſaid the Emperor, you ſhall not be denied at my hands, a thing ſo reaſonable and vertuous: but I pray you moſt inſtantly (at the leaſt, if you may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence) to ſhew us more at large what manner of men they are. My Lord, anſwered they, your Majeſty ſhall pardon us, that can we not do, for it is expreſlie forbidden us, wée will preſentlie go fetch them, and ſure we are, you will be greatlie pleaſed with the ſight: Which ſaid, taking their leave, they returned the ſame way they came, leaving the Emperor much muſing at the adventure, ſaying to his Lords, that certainlie ſuch young ſtrangers ſuits, deſiring Knighthood out of ſo far Countries, as the Gentlewomen had reported, muſt néeds be of more account, then commonly other Knights are.</p>
               <p>Mean time the two Meſſengers were again returned unto <hi>Don Flores</hi> and <hi>Lipſan,</hi> that ſtayed for them, unto whom they declared what they had done, as you have heard before: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55249:25"/>
ſaid they, you muſt both mount on Horſeback Armed, in the ſame Arms my Lady our Aunt gave you, and wée will guide you to <hi>Rome,</hi> even unto the Emperors Preſence, which they preſently did. They were both moſt fair, and of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent form of body, eſpecially <hi>Don Flores,</hi> whoſe forme and ſhape was ſo perfect, that for greatneſſe and ſtrength correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ſéemed ſome young Gyant: and in truth during his time, he never found any that ever prevailed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Then ſetting foot on Land, and mounting on their Horſes Armed as they were, they travelled towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and being come thither, rid ſtreight unto the Court, entring into the great Hall, where the Ladies were deviſing together, by whom they were moſt courteouſly welcomed, eſpecially of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who with great honour received them, and after a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant countenance and courteous entertainment given them, turning unto the two ſtrange Gentlewomen, he asked of them if theſe two young Gentlemen were the ſame they had ſhewed him off.</p>
               <p>Yea and it liketh your Grace ſaid they. And I am ready ſaid the Emperor then, to fulfil on them the promiſe I made unto you, and to give them the order of Knighthood when it ſhall pleaſe them to receive it.</p>
               <p>It ſhall then be to morrow ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> if ſo it pleaſeth your Grace, this night, according to the cuſtome wee will watch, and in the morning your Majeſty ſhall accompliſh on us what ſhall ſéem good unto you. The Emperor had not in long time before béen requeſted to do any ſuch thing, nor that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him unto greater honour, wherefore he determined to kéep a feaſt, and to ſhew his great magnificence, for the love of the two young Gentlemen ſtrangers, whom hée ſhould make Knights.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the two Eſquires brought from the ſhip both their Armors, wherewith when the night came, they arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and entring into the Chappel, made their Vigil, according as the cuſtome in ſuch Ceremonies required: being alwaies on their knées, beſéeching God to give them as good an end in that their enterprize, as they eſtéemed the beginning ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55249:25"/>
and worthy of praiſe. In that manner remained they until morning that the Emperor entred into the Chappel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied of the Empreſſe, the Prince <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Eliſene,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Cantarie, Floriſando</hi> King of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigne,</hi> his Father, leading by the hand the Infant <hi>Theodore,</hi> and other Princes and Ladies, all they finding the two young Gentlemen on their knées, the Emperor therewith ſpeaking unto <hi>Don Flores</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>Gentleman, the Maſs being Celebrated you and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie ſhall have that you deſire. Therewith the Biſhop of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi> being ready, hee bleſſed (according to the cuſtome) their Swords, Shields, and Helmets, preſented unto him: which done, the Emperor riſing, asked of <hi>Don Flores,</hi> if he would bée made Knight, I (and it pleaſe your Grace ſaid he) for it is my onely meaning and deſire.</p>
               <p>Swear then ſaid the Emperor. <hi>That you ſhal wel and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve the order of Knighthood, never doing injury to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lady or Gentlewoman, but ſhal maintain their right againſt all ſuch as ſhal force or do them wrong, and ſhal not though you dye for it, commit any thing unconvenient, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable act, unto ſo holy and honourable an order, as this you are minded to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That do I promiſe and ſwear unto you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Don Flores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And upon this your Faith and promiſe</hi> ſaid the Emperor, giving him the Sword on his neck, <hi>I make you knight in the name of God, Creatour of all things, whom I beſeech moſt humbly to arm you with as much force and vertue, as there is in you of beauty and good grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then taking him by the right hand, and lifting him up, ſaid: you may now receive your Sword of whom ſoever you ſhall think beſt. Then <hi>Don Flores</hi> caſting his eyes upon <hi>Florizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> ſaid: if it pleaſe your Grace, I would receive it at the hands of <hi>Florizando,</hi> and my Helmet of <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> which was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. <hi>Floreſtan</hi> King of <hi>Sardaigne,</hi> hanging his Shield about his neck.</p>
               <p>Scarce had they finiſhed, but <hi>Lipſan</hi> ſtepping forward, and knéeling down, deſired moſt earneſtly of the Emperor, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55249:26"/>
with his favour it would pleaſe him to grant that his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might make him Knight: that am I well content withal, ſaid he: and ſo I deſire him to do it for your ſake.</p>
               <p>Wherewith the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> for ſo ſhall <hi>Don Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> be called in divers places of our Hiſtory, gave the like Oath to <hi>Lipſan,</hi> as had béen miniſtred unto himſelf by the Emperor, and deſired the Ladies they would vouchſafe to give him the reſt of his Arms. Which they accompliſhed moſt willingly: for the Empreſſe girded his Sword about him, the Princeſſe <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene</hi> ſet on his Helmet, and the Princeſſe <hi>Theodore</hi> gave him his Shield.</p>
               <p>Truely ſaid the Emperor I cannot remember that in all my life I did ever ſée two Knights armed together which liked mée better. And as for you Knight of the <hi>Flames</hi> (turning to <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> to whom the ſame name is often given in this Hiſtory) hée ſaid, you are more beholding unto the Ladies, then any other that I know: having received ſuch honour and ſervice at their hands.</p>
               <p>My Lord, ſaid he, this favour indéed did I deſire of them, to the end that during my life I may remain their ſervant, for I aſſure you, that from henceforth it ſhall pleaſe mée better to employ my force at the requeſt of the leaſt and ſimpleſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World, then at the deſire of the beſt and moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentleman living.</p>
               <p>In good truth, then ſaid the Emperor, they ought all by good right to love and eſtéem of you. And ſo it came to paſſe: for never was there Knight that ever did more for Ladies then he did after that.</p>
               <p>Now my Lord (ſaid <hi>Don Flores</hi>) if it pleaſeth your Grace, you ſhall give us leave to depart, that we may begin to ſhew our forces, and follow the feats of Knighthood. So am I well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do anſwered the Emperor, this day being paſt, wherein I mean to make you my Gueſts, being minded to make you the beſt entertainment I can, and ſo the Ladies would likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Both to you and them ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> are wée moſt humble ſervitors, and will not in any point break your commandment, if it pleaſeth God. Which done, they were conducted unto the

Palace, there being lead into a Chamber prepared for them, where putting off their Arms, and apparelling themſelves in other ſuits fit for the time, they went unto the Ladies, with whom they bare company both at dinner, ſupper, and dancing, until time came that they muſt of force go take their reſt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the day following, as the two new Knights took their leave of the Emperor to travel abroad, there entred into the Court a Gentlewoman cloathed in black, deſiring ſuccour of the Prince <hi>Florizando.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe next day the two new Knights deſirous to purſue their adventures, attended the riſing of the Emperor, but iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their Chamber, they found him already walking in the great Hall: and as they were about to take their leave, minding to give him thanks for the great and honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they had received at his hands, there entred into the Hall a Gentlewoman apparelled in black, with a countenance ſo ſorrowful, that thereby it might eaſily be judged her heart was oppreſſed with great grief: being entred, ſhe ſpake unto the Gentlemen preſent, of whom ſhe demanded if <hi>Florizando</hi> were not there among them: but he (of whom by fortune ſhe asked the queſtion) anſwered, I am he, Gentlewoman, and ready to comfort you, if it lyeth in my power: for that the apparel and countenance you bear do very well Witneſſe, that you are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the beſt contented, nor of the merrieſt in the World.</p>
               <p>Ha (ſaid ſhe) the tears ſtanding in her eyes, running down her face, gentle Knight I cry you mercy: you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I am of the Country of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> where from my youth upwards I began to ſerve the Princeſſe <hi>Sabine,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto King <hi>Garinter</hi> and was captive with my Miſtreſſe at ſuch time as King <hi>Malobato</hi> came and conquered his countrey, and ſo held her Priſoner for the love of his Son named <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but by the ſtrength and valiant proweſſe which is in you, ſhe was afterward delivered, and you overcame that <hi>Rowland</hi> with whom you fought: yet having overcome him, he obtained
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55249:27"/>
ſo much of you by requeſt, that you conſented, hée ſhould have her for his Wife, upon charge hee ſhould become a Chriſtian, and ſhould yeild unto the King <hi>Garinter</hi> her Father, all ſuch Lands as he detained and occupyed of his by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the marriage was ſolemnized (which if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God I would it had not béen ſo:) for that ſince, the wicked Wretch had my Lady in his power, and lead her with him into <hi>Iconia,</hi> whither I bare her company, hoping of good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome reward for my ſervice, hée began to do her all the miſchiefs he could deviſe, and ſuch, that where I made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to live in joy and pleaſure, you ſée mée now apparelled in this ſort, and bearing a countenance that witneſſeth my ſorrow and grief. But let mée ſhew you the cauſe: ſo it was, that ſcarce had King <hi>Rowland</hi> entred into his Countrey, but that he found divers of his men revolted, ſaying that it appertained not to Chriſtian Kings to Raign over a Pagan Countrey. Which known by a great number that followed him in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Denmark,</hi> they ſhewed openly that which until then they had kept ſecret and unknown, and renouncing the faith and baptiſm they had received with their Maſter, forſook him to turn againſt him with his enemies.</p>
               <p>His Enemies I ſay, for ſo he called them, yea he himſelf no better, ſéeing he had agréed with you, to forſake his own Laws, not for any good he hoped for by ours, but onely to enjoy the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for whom his heart burned ſo much in Love, which being cooled, and his deſire ſatisfied, hath again received his Pagan Laws, and ſéeketh by all means to force the Lady <hi>Sabine,</hi> unto the ſame, which ſhe would never conſent unto, although he hath tormented her, and yet to this preſent day holdeth her in a ſtrong and cruel priſon, threatning her, that preſently upon her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the childe wherewith ſhe goeth, to make her dye and evil death, which I poor ſoul conſidering, went unto her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to carry him thoſe pittiful news, and found him in his countrey, whither not long before he was returned, comming from the ſuccour of the Iſle <hi>Montgaza,</hi> and from great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> namely, from King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his great friend the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being newly diſ-enchanted, aſſuring
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55249:27"/>
you, that ſuch his abſence made King <hi>Rowland</hi> enterpriſe all the miſchief unto you rehearſed, and worſe than theſe, for hee is entred into the Country of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my deſtroyeth, pilleth, and putteth to fire and ſword all he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before him, thereby utterly to overthrow and impoveriſh his Father in law, who being weaker of men then hée, and older in years then willingly he would, hath commanded mée to ſéek you out, and in his behalf to deſire you, that ſéeing that once you have re-eſtabliſhed the Realm and Country of <hi>Denmark</hi> into his hands, yeilding the ſame peaceable unto him, it would pleaſe you once again to aid him againſt that cruel King, ſo wickedly falſifying his faith and promiſe which to you hee had made then, when in your preſence, and by your perſwaſion, he gave him his Daughter in marriage.</p>
               <p>If this will not move you unto pitty, and that for your eaſe, or other cauſes to your ſelf known, you will not undertake this voyage, for the delivery of this ſorrowful afflicted King. I beſéech you for the honour of God and Knighthood (ſaid ſhe) wéeping moſt bitterly, do it for the love of my poor Miſtris left by me in great extremity, which you ought not to ſuffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born (as you are) unto vertue, and to maintain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Ladies, that in adverſity have recourſe unto you for aid, ſuccour and relief. <hi>Floriſando</hi> having known King <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> more amorous of <hi>Sabine</hi> then ever he had ſéen any (as hée thought) travelled by love, with compaſſion moved at her tale, anſwered unto the Gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>And beleive mée Gentlewoman, it grieveth mée much to think upon the pains and travel you have taken, as alſo of the grief you now ſuſtain, but much more for the troubles of your Miſtreſſe, to whom (after you ſhall have ſomewhat refreſhed your ſelf here in the Court) you ſhall return, aſſuring King <hi>Garinter</hi> that I will follow preſentlie after you, to aid him as he hath deſired me. O my Lord! ſaid the Gentle woman, God forbid that I ſhould take reſt either of body or in minde, ſo long as I know her that hath nouriſhed and brought me up, to be in ſorrow and pain, and that Traitor King <hi>Rowland</hi> living and perſiſting in his wickedneſſe, without receiving due reward for his deſert.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55249:28"/>Then the two new Knights ſtepped forward, promiſing <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſando</hi> to conduct her into <hi>Denmark,</hi> where (ſaid they) wée will aid the King, ſtaying till you come, for the which hée heartily thanked them, and preſently taking their leaves of the Emperor and the Empreſſe, and the Damoſel, likewiſe of <hi>Floriſando,</hi> they departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> entring into the ſhip that <hi>Vrganda</hi> had given them, wherewith they ſailed ſo far, that for the ſpace of five daies they were without the ſight of any land, until the ſixth day that they entred into a ſtraight, where certainly they were in great danger to be loſt: yet by the grace of God, their veſſel took land in a place better then they thought it had béen, wherefore the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> commanded the Marriners to caſt Anchor and go a ſhore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they obeyed, ſo that the two Knights with the Damoſels and their Horſes being landed, they willed the Pilot and them of the Ship, to depart from thence unto the Iſland <hi>non Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vee,</hi> and being there arrived, willed them to thank <hi>Urganda</hi> in their behalf, for the great curteſies, favours, and pleaſures ſhe had ſhewed unto them: which done, they departed the ſame way they came, and on the other ſide, <hi>Don Flores, Lipſan,</hi> and their company mounting on their Horſes, travelled along by the ſhore ſide, till ſuch time they came unto the head of a cauſey, where the Eſquire <hi>Urgandin</hi> ſaid, I know not in what Country we are, but ſure if we follow on this way, it will lead us unto ſome Village, where we ſhall know what we deſire.</p>
               <p>And going forward they travelled ſo far, that at length they perceived the gliſtring of a Caſtle, which in their ſights ſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of white Marble, it ſhined ſo bright, the ſituation being on the top of a Hill, under the which ran a great and déep River, over the ſame having a great Bridge of ſtone, built with arches very fair, at the end thereof ſtood a Tower with a watch therein, that none might paſſe the ſame, without knowing who he were.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, neither the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> nor the Knight of the Burning Flames did once ſtay, until ſuch time as a villain came unto them, who at the entring of the bridge,

holding a ſtaff in his hands, ſaid with a churliſh voice: What now you ſtrangers? think you to have the paſſage ſo eaſie at your commandments, and that without giving us your names: no, no, look firſt what theſe letters contain (then hée ſhewed them a Iaſper ſtone) which he bade them read at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which having well underſtood, ſaid he, do as you think good. At theſe words the two Knights approached near the Bridge, where the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> perceived a great Ivory Horn fairly guilt, hanging at a great chain likewiſe guilt, with a writing, which contained as followeth.</p>

               <p>I know not ſaid <hi>Don Flores,</hi> who this brave and glorious Knight is, nor for what cauſe he beareth ſo great hatred unto the beſt King now living in the world, but were he a Devil inchained, or loofe, I will prove what he can do. Then ſetting the Horn unto his mouth, blew it ſo loud, that all the place ſounded therewith. It is néedleſſe, ſaid the villain that had ſtayed them, for the Lord of the Caſtle will not come forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to morrow in the morning, neither to fight, nor yet to parley in any ſort.

               <p>That will I not do anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> for rather will I ſtay here a whole Wéek together, then I will depart without battel: you heap the like evil fortune upon your ſelf (ſaid the villain) that divers others have done, that in like ſort found themſelves diſcontented herewith, wherefore I counſel you to paſſe on your way, and that quietly, without ſo much chafing and vexing of your ſelf.</p>

                  <p>How the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> fought with the Lord of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and overcame him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN ſuch ſort the Knights and Gentlewomen paſſed away the night until the next morning, that the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> awaked, about break of the day, when he called <hi>Urgandin</hi> his Eſquire to bring his Armour and ſaddle his Horſe. In the mean time <hi>Lipſan</hi> and the reſt of the company awaked, to whom he ſaid, that time drew on to prove their new adventure. When you will anſwered <hi>Lipſan:</hi> his Eſquire <hi>Filedrino</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought him his Horſe: wherefore Arming himſelf in all haſte, they took their way towards the Caſtle, leaving the Gentlewomen attending the event of their fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> was no ſooner come unto the ſtone, but (as he did the day before) he ſet the Horn to his mouth, and blew ſo loud, that well it might be heard two miles about, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Lord of the Caſtle and the Watch ſtart up at the ſound thereof, as it were in a maze, and he that had the entry of the Bridge eſpecially in charge, looking out at a Window, ſpake as followeth. Truſt me Gentleman you are over haſty to ſéek your own misfortunes, whereof peradventure you may repent at leiſure.</p>
               <p>Thou ſaieſt well, anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> but thinkeſt thou wée have nothing elſe to do? tell thy Maſter (honeſt fellovv) that hée is to blame to play ſo much the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard within his Caſtle, let him come forth into the fields where we have ſtayed for him: are you at that point (ſaid the other) you think then you have to do with ſome fooliſh Coward: but

truely I hope to ſée you both before noon, brought into ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that I think you will be better contented with a little reſt, than deſirous to travel any further on adventures, and that you may prove it to be true, blow the Horn the ſecond time, that your evil fortune and miſchief may fall upon you all at once.</p>
               <p>Then the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> blew the Horn again louder than before, in ſuch ſort, that preſently after hée perceived the Gates of the Fortreſſe opened, and a great Knight iſſuing forth, mounted upon a Horſe ſo high, that hée ſéemed a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhaken with the Wind, the Knight armed in all points, bore a Shield half parted <hi>Or,</hi> and as hée approached near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> hee ſaid. Perdy Sir Knight, you have béen overbold with my Horn: for the which you ſhall ſpéed never the better, ſéeing without cauſe or reaſon you have waked mée out of the ſound ſléep I was in.</p>
               <p>I know not (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi>) to whom the evil fortune ſhall happen, but this know, peradventure you had been better in your Bed than here fighting with us, kéeping and defending the paſſage (without cauſe) againſt all men, and as I have heard, by one of your men, as alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ſtone, threatning wrongly and without cauſe, the Knights of great <hi>Brittain.</hi>

               <p>That is not ſo (ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi>) for I beleive that if any of them that you threaten paſſed this way, he would heal you of the pride and raſhneſſe that maketh your head ſo out of temper, and to make you know that I ſpeak not without

               <p>The Knights of King <hi>Amadis's</hi> Court (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi>) are not accuſtomed to fight againſt others with advantage. And ſéeing thou haſt had this conference with mée alone, with mée onely thou muſt (wilt thou or not) have now to do: my companion being ſuch and ſo valiant a man, that be it againſt thée or any other, as great a Lubber as thou art, hée néedeth not any help. Make thée ready then ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> therewith giving back about a carrier length upon the bridge, being large and plain, vailing both their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, they ran ſo right one againſt the other, that the great Knight ſtrake the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> right upon his Shield, wherewith his Spear brake all in pieces, not doing him any hurt: but his enemy moved at the injurious words uttered by him againſt King <hi>Amadis,</hi> could ſingle him out better, and with ſuch force, that ſtriking him out of his Saddle with the blow put his right ſhoulder out of joynt, ſo great was his fall: Nevertheleſſe, he ſtayed not on ground, but riſing up lightly, leaſt if he defended not himſelf better on foot, then hee had done on Horſeback, he ſhould fare but ill, and taking in his hand a Falchon he bore by his ſide, ſaid unto the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> Knight, the hazard and hard fortune is fallen upon mée, on Horſeback, but we ſhall ſée how it will fall out on foot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore light off your Horſe or I will kill him.</p>
               <p>O ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> laughing, even now you would have had to do with two at once, how comes it to paſſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55249:30"/>
you can behave your ſelf no better againſt one: Well then in Gods name, let the reſt of our Combate be on foot: therewith he deſcended, and delivered his Horſe unto <hi>Vrgandin,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf with his Shield, ſet upon the glorious Knight, whom he within ſhort time handled in ſuch manner, that with one blowcleaving his Shield in two parts, hée put him in fear of his life, yet did he ſtrike ſuch a blow on the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> Helmet, that he failed not much to ſtrike him down, his eyes and ears therewith ſtarting and tingling, which he bore not long without revenge, for he ſéeing him without a Shield, ſtepped forward, and with all his force ſtroke him right upon the place where before hée himſelf had béen ſtrucken, and paſſing through the Helmet and coif of ſtéel, Wounded him ſo déep in the head, that loſing his ſences, hée fell flat down on his face upon the bridge, and as he thought to ſtride over him and ſtrike off his head, hée heard a great noyſe out of the Caſtle, which was of two Knights, that perceiving the Weakneſſe of their Lord, came forth all Armed for to ſuccour him, which <hi>Lipſan</hi> perceiving, ſtepped forward to receive them: in the mean time the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> leaped lightly on his Horſe that <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandin</hi> held, ready for him.</p>
               <p>Then it was who could do beſt, for the two Knights newly iſſued forth, ſought if it were poſſible to revenge his cauſe whom they eſtéemed dead, and the two ſtrangers to uſe them worſe if it were poſſible, and in ſuch ſort ſtriking and Combating together, both on the right hand and on the left, the Knight of the <hi>Flames</hi> with a croſſe blow ſtroke the one, (with whom hee fought) ſo fiercely on the vizard, that with the blow he clove his Iaws, and therewith cut off a péece of his neck, wherewith he was ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that turning his back he began to run in all haſte to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, crying with a loud voyce: Come forth men, come forth, and be revenged on theſe Traitors, and preſently thereupon fel down dead in the place, by reaſon of the blood that ran into his throat and choaked him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> that dealt with the other, brought him into ſuch extremitie, that being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble long to endure againſt him, hée was forced to ſuffer as much
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55249:31"/>
as his companion had done, which cauſed them of the Caſtle to ſtay their courſe, being already comming to ſet upon the two ſtrange Knights: but upon the ſudden ſtayed themſelves, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would become of their man that lay ſtill upon the Bridge. Vnto whom the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> returned, and lighting on foot, went and unlaced his Helmet, thinking to ſtrike off his head, but hée féeling the air, began to breathe, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes, perceived his enemy lifting up his Sword to ſtrike off his head, therefore with a loud voyce hee ſaid, I pray you ſir Knight, for Gods cauſe do mée not that injury, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpare my life, upon condition that you ſhall paſſe the bridge at your own pleaſure.</p>
               <p>O Traitor (ſaid he) the Bridge will I paſſe, and thou ſhalt loſe thy head, to aſſure them that hereafter ſhall chance to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mée this Way.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid the other) if I have done evil I will make amends for it at your pleaſure, which I promiſe you to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my honour and credit. Give mée your Faith (ſaid the knight of the <hi>Swans</hi>) that neither by you nor any of yours, wée ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any hurt or damage, then ſhall you ſée what I will do.</p>
               <p>That do I ſwear and promiſe unto you (ſaid hée) then the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> took him up, but when hée ſaw the one Kt. dead, and that the other likewiſe could not get unto the gate, never was there man more grieved at the heart: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, he made ſigns to his men that they ſhould lay their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons down, and let fall the Draw-Bridge out of hand, but they could not as then hear what he ſaid: therefore there iſſue forth more then thirty men Armed with brigandines and halberts, for to aſſail the two Knights, which their Lord perceiving, ſtepped before them, commanding them to honour him by whom he had béen overcome: whereunto they obeyed, then <hi>Don Flores, Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> the Gentlewomen and their Eſquires, entred into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where they were well lodged, and the Wounded Knight laid in his bed, where oftentimes the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> went to viſit him, who the next day minding to depart, ſaid unto him. Sir Knight, you muſt diſcharge your promiſe made to mée, for now I muſt be gone, having other enterprizes to accompliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55249:31"/>My Lord (ſaid hée) rather will I dye a thouſand deaths then once fail therein. Begin then (ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi>) to declare the cauſe wherefore you ſo much hate King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and who hath moved you to maintain the evil cuſtome of this Caſtle, then you ſhall know what reſteth for you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh.</p>
               <p>Sir ſaid hée, King <hi>Amadis</hi> being a Kt. adventurous, ſlew my Father named <hi>Ardan,</hi> a Knight moſt redoubted in the court of King <hi>Luiſart,</hi> at which time I was but one year of age, but ſince that time, growing unto mans eſtate, and continuing with my Mother, one of the richeſt Ladies in this Countrey, ſiſter to <hi>Dardan le Superbe,</hi> ſlain likewiſe at <hi>Winſore</hi> by the ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> I was by her in ſuch manner perſwaded to bear a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred againſt him and his Lineage, that having attained that ripeneſſe of years capable to receive the order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, &amp; being a knight, yea, and one of the beſt in theſe countries, I determined with my ſelf, that ſo long as life and limb laſted, to aſſail by all means to hurt and endamage our common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, doing ſo much, that both he and his, might féel ſome part of the evil Will I bear unto them: and the better to effect my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I remembred my ſelf, that the Court of King <hi>Amadis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly frequented by Knights ſéeking ſtrange Adventures, it ſhould hardly fall out, but that ſome of them would paſſe by this Way: for which cauſe I took upon mée to kéep and defend the bridge, hoping that if any of them might fall into my hands, to make them (in deſpight of him) dye an evil death, or elſe give them a life worſe then death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Truely, ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> I would willingly know what puniſhment thoſe of his houſe or his lineage, have deſerved for a thing wherein they never once offended, it had béen much more ſéemly for you to have challenged your Enemy to the Combat, and aſſayed to revenge your ſelf on him alone, or have gone into great <hi>Brittain</hi> to find him there, without watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſage in ſuch manner after thoſe which not ſo much as once doubt of you and whereof it may be there will not one paſſe this way in ten years ſpace.</p>
               <p>The going into great <hi>Brittain</hi> (ſaid the other) is not much
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55249:32"/>
from the purpoſe, and peradventure it will be done ſooner then you think, for that already the Children of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling men out of all parts, to aſſay by force of Arms, if they can recover the places and Fortreſſes ſtollen from them by King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi> and with them are divers great Lords united, as well of theſe countries as others, whereby there will begin the cruelleſt VVars that ever was heard of, for it ſhall not be ended, until both he and his lineage Friends and Countrey, be utterly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>You promiſe much unto your ſelves ſaid the knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> thoſe for whom you would purchaſe this revenge are dead in that Countrey (for they were not worth a ſtraw) and you ſhall dye likewiſe in the ſame Countrey as they have done, being much worſe: But I adviſe you better and more for your profit, that is, ſo ſoon as you are able to travail, leaving this enterprize of the Wars of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> you ſhall go unto <hi>Rome,</hi> where from mée you ſhall preſent your ſelf unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the Prince <hi>Floriſando,</hi> telling them that the new knight bearing for his Deviſe the <hi>Swans</hi> in his ſhield, and that took his leave of them to follow the Gentlewoman apparelled in black, ſaluteth them both, then you ſhall recite unto them, what hath paſſed here without this Caſtle betwéen us, and from thence you ſhall go into great <hi>Brittain</hi> to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and there you ſhal yeild your ſelf priſoner unto him, and ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him the death of your Father and kinſman, and ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſent unto him from mée the Horn and the Chain that hangeth there without, and that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>VVhereunto he obeyed, in ſuch manner, that being healed of his VVounds, he travelled into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſpake with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and <hi>Floriſando</hi> according to his charge given, and from thence came to great <hi>Brittain,</hi> where he preſented the Horn and the Chain, which K. <hi>Amadis</hi> commanded to bée hung under an Arch at the entry of his Palace, and ſo did hée accompliſh all that he had to do: but this wicked <hi>Mandancedon</hi> afterward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting

                  <p>How the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> fought in the Forreſt with <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes,</hi> and overcame him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe promiſe by oath received of the knight of the Caſtle, by the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> and having therein recreated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his company for the ſpace of two or thrée daies, at the laſt departed from the ſaid Caſtle called <hi>la Brave Roche,</hi> travelling ſo long, that the next day about twelve of the clock, they encred into a goodly Forreſt, the Sun being at the higheſt, ſhining very hot, and paſſing through the ſame, came to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of a long Cauſey, where they perceived comming towards them a Knight all armed, riding upon a brown bay Horſe, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Shield of Sable, charged with a Lyon Rampant, <hi>Or,</hi> Armed langling Argent, and a chief gules, which ſufficiently ſhewed him to be of the Lineage of <hi>Arcalaus,</hi> for they all do bear the like Arms. And as they approached nearer together, they ſaluted each other in moſt courteous manner: but preſently the Knight of the cauſey perceiving the two young Knights ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with their Helmets off, becauſe of the extream heat, began to behold them, thinking by reaſon of their young years, and great beauty, that their ſtrength could not be much, whereby looking upon the ſorrowful countenance of the Gentlewoman apparelled in black, he could not refrain, but ſaid to her.</p>
               <p>Truly Gentlewoman, you are (as far as I ſée) worſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied then your caſe ſéemeth to require, which makes mée think, your grief procéedeth thereby.</p>
               <p>Truely Gentleman ſaid ſhe, the company that guideth mée are ſuch, that if it were other, my grief ſhould be much more, yet can you not ſo much diſſemble ſaid the Knight, that I ſhould not perceive you are far meaner guarded then you deſerve. In
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55249:33"/>
ſo much, that if by arms your joy may be recovered, you are now but hardly ſped, having no other with you then Armed gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, and if they be men, then have they each man his, ſo ſhall you be mine, whom I will ſo well entertain, that if your grief be to be ended and aſſwaged by Arms, believe mée, I am an expert maſter in that art.</p>
               <p>Knight, Knight, ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you to bragg leſſe of your own proweſſe, and with more courteſie, then you do, let the Gentlewoman (good ſir) travel on her way, and follow you your own, (if you think good.) If I thought not to ſtain mine honour (ſaid the Knight of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey) in fighting with ſuch Boyes as you are, I would make you dearly buy the folly you uſe, yet it is reaſon I ſhould excuſe you, ſéeing that youth by reaſon of their young years, and want of diſcretion, do oftentimes thruſt themſelves into ſuch matters: and turning to his Eſquires, ſaid, Sirs, take this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans horſe by the bridle, and make her ride on before whether ſhe will or not.</p>
               <p>Yea truely ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Swans,</hi> if we would ſuffer her to do it, but before you bring that to paſſe, it will be néedful for you to ſpeak in other ſort: on, on, ſaid the other to his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, take her and make her turn by force, at which words the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> overcome with choller, although by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the extream heat, he had his head unarmed, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain, but approached the other, and with the back of his hand ſtroke him ſuch a blow on the face, that hée brake two of his téeth.</p>
               <p>Ha Raſcol (ſaid he, ſtriking) doth it become ſuch royſters as thou art to uſe violence againſt Gentlewomen: the blow hée gave him was ſuch, that his noſe ran down with blood, being therewith ſo aſtoniſhed, that if hee had not claſped his arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his horſe neck, he had fallen to the ground, yet taking courage, he laid his hand on his Weapon to revenge himſelf, and with ſuch dexterity, that the Knight of the <hi>Swans</hi> had not the leiſure to take his helmet, yet did he not refuſe the fight, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered with his ſhield, ſet upon the other, the Knight of the Cauſey crying unto him:</p>
